out and joining this session my name is
good piercing and I'm a cloud solution
architect by profession and I will walk
you through today's webinar on the AWS s
shops so a few of the basics here you
might have a control panel and you might
be familiar with it so if you need to
ask any question you can raise your hand
and you can also type your question in
the in the control panel in the
questionnaire section you can also chat
with me in the chat section of the
control panel and that's how we can
communicate right in this seminar we
will be discussing about that white
cloud and why Isis ops right what kind
of significance it has right so you
might be having a lot of questions on
your mind that you know why everyone is
talking about the cloud nowadays and how
you know cloud is going to be
overlapping with your existing role
right and how you can enhance your
skills upgrade your skills to be cloud
ready right so how exactly cloud is
helping everyone over there so first
thing is a white cloud
so we'll be we'll be talking about that
and the second is what exactly this
cloud computing is and is that something
you just come up and what exactly the
cloud is offering to all of us then we
will discuss the different cloud
services which are available and what
cloud services are suitable for me or
what are the cloud services which I can
leverage to enhance my productivity my
environment right and we'll also discuss
about that when we talk about the cloud
we are hearing a lot about the you know
Amazon or Amazon Web Services so I will
help you understand what exactly AWS or
Amazon Web Services are right and when
it comes to you know starting the
training and the certification so
primarily there are different associate
level certifications which are
introduced by Amazon so the two popular
one are v ops and the solution architect
so we will find out the difference
between you know what's s office and
what solution architect is and which
career path is right for you so which is
which is more suitable for you all right
so if you if you are choosing this of a
career path so
what to expect in the sub-sites what
your roles and responsibilities will be
so what you will be doing once you
become your cloud co-op so the AWS s ops
right so a lot of good topics coming up
here let's get started here right so I
think the cloud has been around us from
quite a long time but I think from past
two to three years there is a lot of
buzz around cloud right that what
exactly the cloud is offering as you
know we are becoming more tech savvy we
are having a more and more services
which are a variable on the net and as
we are having more number of users
Internet users who are consuming those
services right so this particular domain
is expanding exponentially right and
these days we are having most of all the
devices which are Internet enabled you
can connect them in the internet so that
you know you can track them you can
interact with them over the Internet
right we do have a lot of video
streaming platforms where you can watch
videos your favorite programs online you
can stream your music as well right you
can actually work with all your files
online you need not to store them on
your local space so you can keep all
your files all your data or internet on
some shared space right then again you
do have a ebooks libraries like you have
a Kindle which which helps you read the
books online over there you can keep
your library in NOAA library so you
really need not to carry carry your
books everywhere just log in or connect
to the internet from anyplace and you
are very good to go and in terms of
videos so reduce on demand
you might have heard about the Netflix
right and on the internet TV you have a
you have other options as well like
YouTube and other stuff is coming up
right all that all that data use data is
you know we have which we need to manage
right then again we have a different
applications which are you know
collecting the data from the various
sources and providing your kind of a
snapshot summary ovie which you need
right so in short in a very short so we
have a lot of data and we have a
multiple challenges around it right we
have a lot of data and we have
multiple challenges around it what kind
of salad is that you know how do I
manage this kind of a huge data right
and this data is actually growing
exponentially with every passing day
right so in our old traditional
infrastructure management ways we use to
store that on the hard disk external
hard disk and external storage right so
those are the those are the kind of an
option which were available but it was
having a lot of kind of lot of kind of a
challenges when it comes to you know
managing it so as you know be the
exports are forecasting so this data is
actually gonna grow a lot let me share
some some more statistics with you here
that you know what kind of a data growth
we are actually looking at so what we
expect up in an ER I know time to come
okay all right so let me yep let me let
me search that on the Google and ship
that share that slide with you so this
is something which I which I searched on
the Google and it says that yep between
2013 and 2015 so this is what exactly
the data growth which has happened right
so a lot of different type of data which
has you know grown very you know
exponentially in in the in a format that
unstructured data as well as a
structured data and we had a challenge
to to keep that data to process their
data to you know archive and and store
the data for for longer term as well
right so this was this was the data
slide shared by Oracle that is what that
is what they have shared and you'll find
a lot of other slides available on the
internet which actually tells you you
know these statics fix for for the data
growth which is which is there okay this
is one more article which shows us you
know the how exactly the data is growing
which we need to manage right and it is
it is actually forecasting that what all
the data we have today in 2017 so will
be having a three times by the by 2020
so in just in just next year's so it's
going to triple right it's it's quite a
triple that it is going to triple
so this is this is a huge challenge for
all the organizations who are dealing
with the different type of a data right
and and the other challenge we have is
you know you know when when there's a
huge data so earlier we were we were you
know concerned about the cost that you
know in old days the the cost of the
storage was kind of a very high right so
we were kind of a concern whether to you
know keep that it out whether to collect
that kind of a data which I might need
later so now these days the the storage
is becoming very cheap right it's
becoming very very affordable and again
the prices of stories are you know
all-time low here I'll show you the D
comparison here though about the above
the storage biases are for the last few
years and if you see that you know that
this chart shows that you know the cost
per GB nice what was it what was the
cost per GB when we started back in
1980s right so I think we were we were
spending a millions of dollars for 4 GB
of data to store right and that has that
has come down very very very very very
cheap rate right nowadays I think I
think if I look at this chart it says in
between somewhere around 2003 for the
the data cost data storage cost has come
down to just under $1 per GB and if I
talk about 2015-16 so looks like just a
$0.10 per per gig so that's a better
cost so that is very very cheap to store
the data right the storage become so
cheap but other challenge which comes to
this is you know when I have a petabyte
of data when I have a you know huge data
which I need to store I can buy a big
storage arrays from the different
companies right
I can I can buy the big storage arrays
from the from the different companies
there so what happens when we when we
purchase those big areas you know for
for example I have bought a capacity of
let's say 2 petabyte to 2 beta byte of a
storage I have bought from from a
storage vendor it may be or I be M it
may be EMC it may be not have like any
any of the storage vendor
so have that happens if I'm buying this
to this today let's paste on on a 16th
of August 16th of August so you know I'm
paying all that cost upfront to the
vendor right so I have already paid that
money to the vendor for you know for the
two petabyte of space right so I'm not
going to consume that space on the day
one but I have I have already invested
invested a huge money in that right so
on 16th 16th August so this is the kind
of this is a kind of money which I have
already invested right with with this
storage and I am not not going to
consume that from the day one right so
maybe over a 1 year maybe over one year
I may only be consuming it just 10% of
it right I may only because you may get
10% of it so that means there is a
wastage of 90% of my money which I have
invested right which I am NOT consuming
it right so that's where that's where
the cloud is going to help you and you
know assist you with this this kind of a
challenges right so these these are the
challenges everywhere not only not only
with the storage right but with the with
the compute capacity as well right so
let me cover the storage part first
right so if I'm moving my data on to the
cloud so what happens is if I'm
consuming let's say 250 GB on the on the
first week or on the first month so my
first one bill will be only 250 GB
because I will be only paying for the
for the storage which I'm actually
utilizing it I am NOT going to charge
for the to beta byte but I am only
paying for 250 GB which actually I am
using it right so it makes a lot of
sense so it is much more slower cost
much more cheaper as if I compared to
the cost of a 250 gig as compared to 2
beta byte of a storage here right so so
this is this is a one example right and
other challenge was you know in terms of
the in terms of the compute space let's
suppose I want to deploy an application
or I want to deploy a database so what
happens is if I if I am going to deploy
a database
or if I'm going to deploy a computer
services I need to do some math right I
need to do some math that ok I'm
thinking that my database will be used
by hundred users right and I will be
having a some 500 gig of data which will
be stored on to the database right I
need to I need to make some kind of an
assumptions right I need to I do put
some kind of a formula in place I will
do some kind of assumptions that you
know what kind of what kind of
requirement I do have for my hardware
right so when I'm when I'm doing a math
then I will arrive on some kind of a
figure that ok
for the initial assumptions I can say
okay I need a eight CPU and I do need a
64 gig of ram to start with so this kind
of a hardware is good enough for me
right so what happens in this case is
you know when you are actually guessing
the capacity when you are trying to you
know do some math and and try to
calculate the capacity what exactly you
do need so the challenge stages you
might under provision it or you might
over provision it right it may it may
never be accurate in the way you know it
is never going to match the demand
actual demand actual real demand if you
production demand which will happen
right you will find that you know either
the server you have chosen is actually
kind of for small server or actually
have chosen a big server India know in
which you know you have some kind of
resources sitting idle which are rich
are free right so so this problem is
again solved by the cloud services you
can pick up a service you can start with
any of the server you can you can start
with say ok from the from the day one I
just want to start with the is two CPU
right and let me say I want to start
with the 16 gig of ram right that is on
the on the week one if the load is going
up so what we need to what we need to do
here is you know we will add more
capacity to it on this fly right or I
will have a tool and I will request my
cloud tools to monitor the usage and I
say ok see
view is going higher than 70% and add
more two CPUs to my to my server right
and if my if my CPU utilization is going
below 30% remove two CPUs from it right
so I am actually varying the hardware
usage depending upon the requirement I
have right I'm not I'm not just blocking
or reserving the capacity whether I'm
using it or not right I'm just just you
know going with the flow as I need I
will provision it I will pay for it and
as I don't need I will just go and decon
that right so that's that's the power of
the cloud that's the that's the kind of
a benefit of the clouds in terms of all
the infrastructure space which which is
just provided by the by the you know by
the different cloud vendors so the
reason reason it is getting you know it
is getting very popular with everyone
these days right so cloud is this is a
solution when it comes to you know
managing your infrastructure right when
it comes to management etc so a cloud
can help you with all the all the
requirement you do have a you do have
with the with in terms of a storage in
top of compute capacity or whatever it
may be with respect to the
infrastructure right so a local system
limited space you have a lot of data
which you want to store so go ahead and
utilize this space on cloud right so
cloud can help you store manage all that
data so you don't have to get the
capacity you have a unlimited space
available in the cloud and you will be
only paying for what all you are going
to use right okay so what what exactly
the cloud means right we we have been
discussing this cloud so what exactly
where the storage will be like where
this where this error will come from
right so this this all servers are you
know actually owned by the big cloud
providers so we have we have a lot of
cloud providers who do provide these
services so they have set up their own
data centers
so they have purchased this big storages
they have purchased the big hardware for
us and we are we are actually you know
renting it out from them and we have to
spank the rent for using using those
services the time we are just using it
right so so whenever whenever we are
actually consuming those are sources
right so we we are saying that we are
using the cloud resources right so the
best part is they are available over the
internet you can access and consume your
your software's your applications your
data over the Internet which is which is
available from the from the cloud right
and let's check it out what you know how
exactly how exactly this is working
right so whenever whenever you are
planning for any kind of an application
so it comes with the different tiers of
it right multi tier kind of an
application you have a front front end
you have a middle tier and then you have
a back end right so a front end is
usually a which can be accessed by the
end users or by a browser over the
Internet so middleware are the kind of
an application which actually CC
requests from the users and and help you
process that you know request with the
backend database is five so they store
the this with the information at the
backend right so this is a very popular
multi tier architecture and the same is
is available in the cloud computing as
well all right so this is something
which we have been discussing up
previously that you know why why why
cloud computing what are the benefits of
it right it's on demand
you just need can provision it on the
fly very quickly when you actually need
it so you have a stability you can
actually you know scale scale out of
scale up or scale down right depending
upon the requirement you have if you
think that you know you are using a
small server and that small server is
not able to cater to your requirement
you
actually quickly move up you can
actually switch to a bigger server right
so scalability in minutes that will give
you right and and you're gonna pay for
only the time you are using it right you
are only using it and and you are only
focusing on you know utilizing the
infrastructure not not exactly you know
the the other other associated tasks
right you know of how my how my physical
server will be secured how I need to
obtain the licensing for setting up the
data center right and how I need to
maintain the you know licensing how I
need to maintain the hardware at the
backend who will do the who will do the
hardware placement right who will
provide the uptime of those hardware so
so that all that stuff is you know gone
away from their mind you will be only
focusing on consuming these services
right so that's that's how you know you
can use your skill and knowledge to
actually apply on the work which is more
important for you if you are a developer
so you might want to just focus on the
on the development part of it right why
do we need to worry about that you know
is your operating system secure past or
not right it is getting updated
regularly or not so leave that leave
that task to the exports let them let
them handle that part you just focus on
on your area wherever new expertise are
and right and and all whatever you are
consuming at is actually measured right
it is measurable you can set some kind
of a benchmark you can analyze your your
consumption you can you know analyze the
trends of your consumption that how much
you are using what type of services
right how much you are using in terms of
compute how much you are utilizing in
terms of a storage right so so all all
that part you can actually measure that
okay so all these all these services
whichever services you have right some
time you use or you just use a email
service right sometimes you store some
of your document sometime you try to
edit those documents online sometime you
try to edit your pictures online right
or transform those those bitches online
so there are a lot of services a lot of
services which are available on the
cloud right and and we actually we have
actually segregated those services
depending upon you know the wind which
category that surface falls in okay we
we have distributed them on the basis of
are they part of a pass are they part of
a SAS or I asked right so when we call a
pass it's a platform as a service when
we say faff it is a software service and
when you say I a so it is a
infrastructure as a service so let's
let's look you know more closely on each
of these services because whenever you
talk about the hope whenever you talk
about the clouds these are these are
some of the stuff which comes first
right so SAS is a software as a service
so that means you are consuming this
software without worrying about that on
which platform it is hosted which
infrastructure it is hosted right
platform is or what kind of fun
operating system is there underneath it
right
it may be Windows it may be UNIX right
and you are not really worried and
bothered about it you are just focused
on focused on consuming these services
right example is the the online storage
you have right you have a Google Drive
you have a onedrive for Microsoft so
those those are the kind of way no you
know this these services which are given
to you you are not bothered about where
they are from coming from right online
online Google Docs right Google Docs
something which you are using document
editing you are consuming those online
right you are not bothered about that on
which operating system those those
packages are installed office 365 right
office 365 is a very good example for
your software as a service so that is an
online software which you of them's
going to consume via your browser so you
are not really very concerned about from
where it is hosted from where it is
being served to you you are just
consuming that piece of software
your gene your your your email services
right your Gmail urea how your are the
other email services so email services
are again kind of for and end services
which end users are consuming it without
worrying about that you know where my
mail server is actually working right on
which platform it is working which
hardware it is working on so those kind
of services where you are actually not
worried about the underneath hardware
underneath a platform so you know you
you don't worry about it you don't
manage that part so we call that as a
software as a service right so and next
is a platform as a service so platform
actually gives you more flexibility
right for example if you have and if you
have a software which require the
specific operating system and on which
it's gonna run maybe you have developed
some software may be some financial
accounting software and it has a
requirement that olcay it is only going
to work on Windows Server 2016 right it
is only compatible with Windows Server
2016 and your organization has having a
requirement that ok you are actually
going to use that software so you can go
ahead and pick up a pass services and
which you will be given a platform you
can actually build that up off from the
from the from the scratch you can
control that what kind of patches what
kind of additional software libraries
can go into it right and will be it'll
be helpful for you in that case and then
third one right we have infrastructure
as a service so this is this is a you
know gives you create flexibility you
just take you know bare metal you just
take a raw server and you actually
install your own operating system on top
of it right and on top of the operating
system then you can configure the
software whichever you want to utilize
right so this gives you flexibility that
you have you know you can you can have
your own custom operating system
installed right and you you can you can
you know actually customize with the
operating system whatever the way you
want right so you a lot of customization
and you know a lot of responsibility
comes with the infrastructure
as a service right so if you want to
have a kind of flexibility where you see
that okay I want to manage my own
infrastructure I just need a server in
the cloud let me install operating
system let me manage operating system
let me install software part on it right
let me create a platform one which I
want to work on let me create the
environment which is required to develop
it and then host a host or you know
software on it right so it's it's
basically a the last layer which which
is available on the on the internet on
which you can actually host your path
and SAS services right so more
responsibility for you because you will
be responsible for managing the
operating system a security of it and
all the resources associated with it
right so more responsibilities as well
as more flexibility
okay so lot of lot of service providers
these days available in the market like
we have we have a Oracle cloud which is
specialized in the Indy database
services we have Google Cloud we have
Amazon Cloud we have a Dropbox right
this is this online storage cloud so it
provides us a services we can just go
and utilize that as as you know storage
for us right so but the most popular are
are you know Amazon AWS they are the
legions then we have a Microsoft Azure
which are which are very close to eight
of us but on our you know they are on a
second up there on a second ranking then
we have a Google cloud which are
primarily at a third one right so there
are three three main players we have let
me show you or some data here very
quickly we call this as a as a Gartner's
Magic Quadrant okay
gardeners Magic Quadrant I'm searching
this out and is what I got let me click
on images here and there are the there
are the images here okay let me click on
this image and I hope you are able to
see this image
okay so this is this is actually or data
which is published by one of the data
analytics company which we call Gartner
right they do publish this data by
collecting the information from the
various source that you know how the how
the different people are doing and in
the in terms of you know providing those
services so if you see on the on the on
the right upper quadrant which says
leaders so in the leader space there are
two leaders which are in the cloud cloud
market first is the Amazon Web Services
so they are definitely the the market
leader here and followed by Microsoft
and the third number we have is for
Google so they are the visionaries so
they are again trying to create some
services in the cloud rest all are we
have a niche player so they do dedicated
to a services in a specific areas right
so they don't they don't provide or you
know all the services in the cloud
whereas whereas you know Amazon has
actually you know invested a lot of a
lot of time and effort in terms of
building a services which are purely
cloud based right and I'll show you all
that you know in a while here right I'll
show you all that in a while okay all
right okay before before I begin with
the Amazon Web Services let me know if
you have any questions here let me know
if you have any questions so far so you
can you can use your control panel you
can raise your hand if you want to speak
to me you can type your question in the
control panel as well right so you you
have all the all the different choices
to communicate with me so if you have
any questions on on your mind so far let
me know let me know if you have anything
okay looks like all good here let's
think it's let's get started with the
with the AWS let's look more closely
with the AWS and then the then this is
ops that what we are talking about here
right so aw services
they do they do you know why do you kind
of a kind of a computing services which
you can consume right with the help of
internet right let's see oh that more in
detail here all right so who are
actually using these services which are
being provided by the Amazon so as you
see this as is a great list it's a very
big list and this list is actually
growing with the everyday passing right
so mostly all the all the organizations
right all the organization worldwide
they have a some kind of a footprint in
the cloud right they are using some kind
of a services from the AWS right maybe
they are might be using analytics they
might be using storage they might be
using compute they might be using
databases right one or the other
services they are consuming consuming it
from from from Amazon so you might find
your your favorite brand what they write
you might find or your favorite brand
over there I know I personally know few
of the clients but I think they are not
listed on this on this on the screen but
up you know major pharma companies or
major FMCG companies so all those
organizations are part of the AWS cloud
right so when we talk about the AWS
cloud so how exactly the AWS
infrastructure looks like right so AWS
infrastructure is actually made up of
what we call regions and regions are
multiple data centers right regions are
a collection of zones so zones are
multiple data centers
so it's let's see more closely so I can
say that okay I have a one region and I
have another region so each region will
have a collection of multiple data
centers in it right there will be
multiple data centers in it right in
India we have a we have a you know
region in Mumbai right and in Mumbai we
have a to data centers to availability
zones in that right to make it redundant
to to give you high availability in that
okay this is a this is a world map data
where all the AWS is having their
presence right and and as you see they
are everywhere right there are
everywhere and they are also setting up
some new data centers as well as here
and and the number which you see in
mentioned in B and E in the red circle
is actually that how many data centers
of the how many well Big T zone they do
have in that geolocation right so they
are they are kind of four everywhere and
they are still expanding it okay how to
choose the right region right in which
region should I work because there are a
lot of regions who available worldwide
so one factor may be the pricing you
might want to check it out because price
different from country to country
because of the local taxes because of
the you know or the maintenance cost of
the data centers in some places the
Alexa T is cheaper somewhere it is the
you know Alexa T and property that is
that is expensive so all that once it's
computed the price will be calculated
for example data center in the London is
expensive whereas the data center in
Ireland Dublin is cheaper right so you
may find the same server expensive in
the London area center and we will find
the same server is C per in Ireland
Dublin data center for a the previous
and it also depends you know where your
customers are if my customers are in you
know a from Europe so I will I will try
to prefer to stick to your Europe region
right to have a better latency available
and some time we do have a you know
security and the compliance requirement
there are some regulatory requirements
that the government want that my all the
data which I am dealing with has to be
available in the same country
it cannot relieve the leave the country
right so that I should exist within the
country where I'm operating for and and
the third and the last one is you know
the last point is the service
availability that you need to make sure
that you know whatever the service you
are going to consume it is available in
that in that particular region
right as you know not all these services
are available in all the regions due to
due to various reasons okay so so here
we are talking about the SIS opps
working was as the AWS architect right
so so which one - which one to choose
here right so whether we should go for a
sis UPS or what we will go for the
architects what is the difference
between these two so so architecture the
people who actually understand the
requirement where she understand the
requirement and and those are the people
actually you know those are the people
actually who you know understand that
what exactly is required for end-to-end
application deployment what what servers
are required what kind of tools are
required for the front-end what we need
for the middle middle tier what we need
for the database what we need for the
storage right what we see what we need
for the for the for the network what
kind of our network diagram will look
like what kind of a security wing to
implement right what kind of what kind
of a tool is a right fit for this
solution right so there the other people
who are going to design all that so they
need to have a understanding of all
those areas right before before creating
a design so once design is created then
we need the need the you know technical
folks who are actually going to deploy
that design right who are actually going
to you know create that kind of
environment and then they are going to
manage that environment as well so that
is the responsibility which lies with
the SIS ops right so she shops the
people who are actually going to deploy
it and who are actually going to manage
it so architect job is to just to create
that design in the first place and hand
it over to the shops so shop see people
going to implement that right they are
going to you know create that particular
solution which is designed by the
architects so I hope I hope this makes
sense right so you will be deploying you
be managing the the of the
infrastructure operating systems storage
network everything onto the cloud and
maybe helping with the migrations of
your existing resources or over to cloud
right and and you know for responsible
for the day-to-day housekeeping job
right for your for your infrastructure
which you are managing right and and you
can always go back and forth with the
architect to understand that what what
exactly he means and if you have any
challenges deploying the design you can
always go back and check with the
architect that yep I am facing this
challenge this is how we were expected
to do but this is now not working the
way the way we designed it so is there
any and in the improvement or change is
required for it right so you will kind
in hand with the with the architect in
this initial stage and afterwards you
work with your customers to provide
those services so these are the these
are all software of Asus ops in
atmosphere right you deploy you manage
you operate all those services right
maintain the security for those right
and you know use identify the the best
operational practices so that you can
follow those and also keep a tab on the
on the cost estimates right so in which
way the costs are going to be consumed
for the different business units which
you are supporting for right the
different different divisions in the in
the organizations which you are
supporting for okay I think that's a
that's a pretty much all I want to show
you for here and you can actually
experience a lot of different services
on the AWS for free right you can go
ahead and actually you can create your
own account on an AWS cloud and you can
you can go ahead and you know try it out
for free so it abase offers a lot of a
lot of different services which are
which are free let me just show you that
here we go
and I'll say AWS a free tier and this is
the first link which I get here
and let me let me open that up so here
we are so this page shows that you know
what kind of or what kind of for free
tier is a way
Abell from Amazon and you can actually
sign that up for free you don't have to
pay any money to Amazon for that right
and what you will get in that account
like what is there in that account for
you okay so what you get for for the for
the first 12 months for the first first
year is you know 750 hours of a virtual
machine right for month so that means
you can you can run a one single server
for the entire month without having paid
any money to to Amazon but you can run
one cloud server you can you can have a
you know 5 GB of storage space right you
can have a 750 hours or 4 offer database
right so 750 hours means you can also
run a one database node for the entire
month and try that out 5 GB off of a
storage space
1 million requests per month for server
less computing right this is AWS lambda
is a Ferro less computing where you
don't need a server and you can actually
still execute your code and you can
still execute your you know existing
computer services right and then
starting a starting is very easy sign
that up and you know you can you follow
follow this tutorials there are
different tutorials provided to you
online over there and they are just
giving you the overview about the
service that what exactly the storage
services right and you can actually
start building with it
right and and for the details and the
specific to or specific certification or
the course so you can always take up the
course from from at Eureka which are
specifically focused on a certification
and you know covering the topics which
are required for that certification
right so here is a long list if you want
to go in the details that what other
services which are see oh there's a long
list given over there in the below let
me let me share this this link with you
you can actually go into the Google and
such that out
no no no problem in that so sending that
link to you right check that out in a
detail bookmark in your browser so you
are all set for that okay let me show
you if you want to if you want to sign
that up here so what you can how you can
go about that okay okay let me open our
internet explorer here okay and let me
open up a black page and let me go to
the free tier here okay
so you just need to create on say create
free account here right you need to
click on create a free account and it
will ask you few details there right it
will ask you your personal details right
and here you you need to say that I am
our new user like I am a new user and
provide your email right and say I'm a
I'm a new user here and I want to sign
up for the for the new account right so
you need to provide your email address
you need to type your password and you
just need to say create a account right
and on the next screen you will need to
choose that I want to use a account
without any paid support and and you
will not be charged for that and while
creating this account while creating
this account you will also be asked to
provide your you know credit card
details or or you know debit card
details don't worry for that this is
only if - you know validate that if you
are a legitimate user if you are a kind
of a genuine user you will not be
charged on that credit card at all right
maybe some time for the verification
purpose they do charge one dollar but
they reverse that money to your account
back just to verify that you know that
that account is a right account here we
did something a not robot is not a
creating those accounts right there are
actually the legitimate users of you
know valid users who are actually
consuming those services here right so
once you create this account so you are
all set to enjoy the free cloud
experience over there right so and if
you are joining this course we are also
going to show you you know how pH we
utilize these
sources optimally - to complete your
course on that right and you can
actually do the real time practice with
me right I can actually walk you through
that you know what oh you can actually
create - your sources over there if I'm
if I go to my account there which I have
already created I can log into that
account and once we log in we see lot
many services which are there right
you'll find all those services over
there and first section is a compute
services and we have a ec2 servers which
we call are the virtual machines in the
cloud now I do not have any running
instances there I do not have any server
which is running now how can I create
how can I create this this a new server
here right so I need to use the launch
button right and I need to choose what
what kind of an operating system I want
for that server right and how to get
started with it so these interactive
process these interactive classes which
are conducted by the at Eureka so they
will they will walk you through these
steps in a live demo that how exactly
you can use this this cloud services how
you can use the various services over
there be to compute storage or a
database right so so this this all will
be will be part of the this kind of a
classes period which you know real-time
demos and the instructor will be
involved and you can you can stop and
ask the question at any time wherever
you feel like you are not cleared about
it right so this is actually I want to
show you here that how you can actually
create your own account and start
working with that one okay so this is
something which I have shown you that
what all you will you will get as a part
of the you know free tier right and
that's pretty much all I have for you
that's pretty much all I have for you
and let me quickly show you that what
kind of job trends we do have in the
market right what kind of what kind of
or you know job market how the how the
job market looks like for this is ops
here right oh how could the how good the
market is
if you if you go onto the Google I'm
just opening a browser here and actually
they are thinking that the gartner
predicts the worldwide public cloud
service market with low eighteen percent
in 2017 so it will it will actually go
from 209 billions to 250 billions right
so so that's a that's the kind of that's
kind of growth it is they are predicting
and you know it's a again growing at a
very fast rate in which you know you
you'll find that you know most of the
companies are trying to utilize the
cloud in one or the other way right so a
lot of very good job perspective in the
in the market for the people who are
having a exposure toward the cloud right
and definitely Amazon being the leader
in that industry right so that's all
folks
so thank you very much for joining this
this today's webinar here on a AWS sis
