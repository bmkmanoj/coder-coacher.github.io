Eureka and in today's session we'll be
focusing on a regular expressions in
Python so without any further ado you
let us move forward and have a look at
the agenda for today the first we'll see
why we use regular expressions what are
the problems that regular expressions
helps us to solve then we'll see what
exactly irregular expressions and then
we'll focus on various operations that
you can perform with regular expressions
after that I'll tell you various
applications of regular expressions
we'll start with e-mail verification
then phone number verification and then
finally I'll teach you how to perform a
web scraping using regular expressions
so I hope the agenda is clear to
everyone if you have any doubts you can
write it down in your chat box or else
you can give me a quick confirmation so
that I can move forward all right the
day says yes
so does Theon Jason I you see Java see
my UNK update all right fine guys so
I've got a confirmation from almost
everyone so let us move forward and see
why exactly we use regular expressions
so as I told you earlier is well we are
going to focus on various problems that
regular expressions helps us to solve so
this is the first problem guys so over
here what happens you have a log file
and from that log file you want only
date and time and as you know with the
format of the log file is not
understandable to everyone so here's a
guy who only one stays in time from that
log file so what he can do he can make
use of regular expressions identify the
pattern and he can actually get the date
and time for that particular log file so
this is the first problem we'll see a
lot of our problems with a regular
expressions help us to solve so if you
have understood this you can just give
me a thumbs up and I'll move forward
alright fine guys so I've got
confirmation from everyone so we'll move
forward and we'll see the second problem
now this is a second problem that it
helps us to solve imagine yourself as a
salesperson and you have a lot of email
addresses and a many of them are fake so
what you can do you can make use of
regular expressions and all the email
addresses have a particular part and
they have a format so with the help of
regular expressions you can verify that
format and you'll get to know what our
email addresses are correct and what all
email address is a fake what so as you
can see obviously Etsy
komm is a fake email address so using
the pattern that is there in all the
email addresses you can verify whether
that email address is correct or not to
be help of regular expressions alright
so let's move on and see what are the
other problems so this is the third
problem that it has to solve we'll take
the same sales guys example that we have
taken in the previous slide now over
here that guy has a data of various
customers phone numbers and we know that
a lot of time people don't give the
correct phone number because nobody
wants a sales guy disturbing them at our
timings right so that sales person has a
problem he wants to know that what all
phone numbers are correct and what all
phone numbers are fake so every correct
phone number will have a particular
pattern or a format so using regular
expressions he can identify what our
phone numbers are correct and what our
phone numbers are wrong and at the same
time different phone numbers that
belongs to different countries or
different location will have a different
format so again taking that thing into
consideration he can again use regular
expressions and identify to which area
it belongs to now in this particular
example what I've shown you is I've
shown you two geographical areas one is
India another is USA so with the help of
regular expressions you can actually
find out what all phone numbers belong
to USA and what all phone numbers belong
to India so I hope this is clear to you
so this is the fourth problem guys now
over here what happens you have a
student database and that contains name
age address now what happens there are a
lot of students who live in a particular
area and the area code of that area is
five nine double zero six but what
happened the area code has been updated
and it has become five nine zero seven
six now if you go manually update that
for all the students I will take a lot
of time so instead of that what you can
do you can make use of regular
expressions and find out all the area
codes from the student database and
after that you can replace it with the
updated area code of the pin code so as
you can see with regular expressions you
can even replace a particular string so
I hope all the problems that we have
discussed in now are clear to you or
it's a Devon says yes so dusty on Jason
Sarah I you see jaggedy OBE - monk
alright
fine guys so we'll move forward and
we'll see one more reason of using
regular expression so now this is one
more reason to use regular expression
because even if you don't have a Python
background if you have any other
programming background like Java PHP C
has groovy swift Ruby you can use
regular expressions because it is
compatible with all of these programming
languages and it is even compatible with
JavaScript although it is not written
here but yeah it is even compatible with
JavaScript so till now we have seen
various reasons to use regular
expressions but I know you guys must be
wondering what exactly regular
expressions is right so don't worry guys
we'll move forward and we'll see what
exactly regular expression is so a
regular expression is basically used for
describing a search pattern so you can
use regular expression for searching a
specific string string in a large amount
of data you can even verify that that
string has a proper format or not you
can find a string and replace it with
another string and you can even format
the data into a proper form for
importing for example so these are all
uses of regular expressions now over
here I've shown you an example here
there is a string which is present in
which they have written Janus is 22 and
theon is 33 Gabriel is 44 and Joe is 21
so as you can see what are useful data
that I can find some here only name and
age I don't want the rest of the things
that are present in this string so what
I can do I can identify a pattern and
with the help of regular expression I
can convert that to a dictionary and in
that dictionary only the name and age
will appear now my question is to you
all guys can you identify a pattern in
order to get the name and it just give a
guess you just need to identify the
pattern alright so Sarah says all the
ages are in the form of integers all
right Sarah that's a very nice
observation but what about the names all
right so I've got a couple more answers
and they say the same thing that the age
is represented with the help of integer
numbers so you can get the integers for
the name they have no idea how to get it
though are you guys it's totally fine
just give a guess alright guys so let me
tell you so
basically if you notice that every name
starts with an uppercase first letter so
the first letter of all the names is an
uppercase letter and then we talk about
age all of the age are represented in
numbers so what you can do with the help
of regular expression you can actually
find out the two-digit numbers and at
the same time you can find out the words
that starts with an uppercase letter and
then it goes on to lowercase letters and
this star actually represents all of
them so you don't need to worry about
the syntax that is there in front of
your screen I'll be actually explaining
you these things in detail so you don't
need to worry about that so I hope you
have understood the pattern that I'm
telling you all right so we have a
question from Devon he is asking what is
this may contain a name of a place
alright Theon so this string does not
contain a name of a place that's all I
can say right now if there was a place
present here then you have to look for a
different pattern at that time so
basically with reg X you have to make
sure that you identify the pattern for
the string that you want so it is very
important so let us move forward and
I'll open my file Chum and I'll tell you
how to get a tan name all right so let's
do it
so this is my Python guy so over here
what I need to do is I need to first
import the module for regular
expressions for that I'll type import
Ari and now I'm going to type in the
string that was there in the example so
I'll type in name is equal to
and now I'm going to write it China's is
22
and Theon is 33 now the next line I'll
write Gabriel is 44 stuff about the
space and Joey is 21 now close it so now
for age I'm going to type in ages equal
to now you don't need to worry about the
syntax that I'm going to write I'm going
to tell you all these things in detail
so this is just an example that I'm
giving you that with the help of regular
expression you can actually get the name
and age after that I'm going to discuss
each and every operation in detail so
what I'm going to type in you don't need
to worry about that I'm just showing you
that you can actually do it I'm just
giving an example re dot find all
are
three because all of my ages are two
digits out of two digits and then write
the name of the string and four names
what are you going to do we're going to
type in names equal to similar to that
re dot find all or and my first letter
is an uppercase letter that is between A
to Z after that I have lower cases so
I'm going to type in 8 is it in lower
cases and then I'm going to put in a
star that largely insuit all of those
and finally the name of that strength
that is naming
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
define our variable and I'm going to
name it as age state equal to curly
braces let's keep it empty right now and
now one more variable I'm going to
define that is actually equal to zero
now I'm going to use a for loop I'll
type in for
each name in names
aged eight each name
is X X plus equal to 1 now print this
edge ticket yeah so if you're not able
to understand what exactly for-loop is
and what are dictionaries so you can go
and watch the previous tutorial videos
and Python and then come back again
go ahead and execute this so yep you
have got the dictionary that includes
only name and age of that person so what
I've done here is what is the pattern
I'm repeating it again so for all the
names the first letter is an uppercase
letter and all the edges are expressed
in terms of numbers so using that
pattern I have got only name and age so
this is just an example we'll actually
see how to perform various operations
using red X or regular expressions so
I'll go back to my slides or if you have
any doubts you can ask me right now so
there are no doubts so let us go back to
our slides
now let's move forward and understand
the cursor operation of regular
expression so basically in both strings
and regular expression both of them have
their own cursors so what happens is
suppose you are searching for odd and
you're at regular expression includes R
so your cursor is at R in the regular
expression but for text it will check
for B it is not equal to R then e then e
then again and it comes to R it will see
that this is what you are searching so
it'll stop right there
the moment I search for s it will go on
and will come towards s and same goes
for n as well so this is a pretty basic
operation but it will really help you to
visualize how things work with regular
expressions so guys if you have any
doubts with respect to what is regular
expressions and how things work in it
you can write it down in your chat box
although this particular slide is pretty
simple to understand I am just telling
you how cursor works in regular
expression this will basically help you
to visualize how things work alright so
everyone's clear so we'll move forward
and we look at various operations that
you can perform with regular expressions
so first we'll find our void inner
string so we have a string that says we
need to inform him with the latest
information and we need to find the word
inform so let us go ahead and execute
this practically I'll again open my
Python so this my Python guys let me
just first clear it so let's begin by
importing our regular expression modules
for data type import our E and now we
have a sentence and we want to find a
word in form there so what I will do
I'll just type in if re dot search
and farm
and our string is we need to inform him
with the latest information
so this is our string give a : and now
I'm going to type in print this is in
form so let me tell you what I've done
here first I've imported the regular
expression module and after that I've
defined a condition which says that if
it is able to search in form in this
particular string that is we need to
inform him with the latest information
then it will print there is inform
otherwise it won't print anything so as
you can see that inform is present here
so it should print there is inform so
let us go ahead and execute this so yep
you can see that it has printed there is
info now let's be more specific and
suppose we want to find all the matches
here so let's write a method that will
do it for us so for that I'm going to
use find on which will return a list of
matches for me so for that what I'm
going to do is I'm going to write in
here let me first remove this and now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
write in all in form which is nothing
but a name that I've given you can give
whatever name you want re dot find all
and I've told you earlier as well find
all will return a list of matches now
over here what I need to find I need to
find in form from which string the
string is we need to inform him with
the latest information all right guys
and so now I'm going to type in a for
loop which says that for I in all in
form give a colon print I that's it so
now what I've done here you can see that
I've imported the regular expression
module then I'm using final in which it
will return all the matches and what I'm
finding I'm finding in form and from
which string I'm finding in form this is
the string that I'm using and I finally
I have used for in order to find all the
matches so let's go ahead and execute
this so yeah it has found in form twice
because you can see that it is available
here as well in form and even
information over here you can see that
in form is present so this is how
basically you find a void in a string by
the help of a regular expression so if
you have any doubt still here you can
ask me or else you can give me a
confirmation so that I can move forward
and explain you other operations that
you can perform with regular expressions
any doubts case so Devon says all clear
so does Jason Theon Sahra are usually
jogging T alright spine guys so let me
first go back to my slides so we have
seen how to find a word in a string next
we are going to understand how to
generate an iterator so basically what
I'm going to do is I'm going to get the
starting and the ending index for the
word that I'm searching over here I'm
searching in form so it will give me the
starting as well as the ending index for
all the matches that it finds so let us
go ahead and execute this practically
I'll open my Python once again let me
remove all of this and over here I'm
going to define a string so what I'm
going to write here is I'm going to
write here we need to inform him with
the latest information
yeah
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to generate an iterator by using finite
Reiter and it is going to return the I
traitor of the matching object so
basically I will be printing the
starting and the ending index of the
matching object so for that I will use
the for loop so I'll write in for I in
re dot find iterator and I want it for
in form so I'll just type in in form and
now I'm going to type in the name of the
string that is STR : now I want that to
be converted into a tuple so for that
I'm going to type in log top equal to I
dot span
and finally friend lock top so basically
it will print the starting in the ending
index of the matching objects let us see
if it does that say up so as you can see
that for in form the starting index is
11 and the ending index 17 for
information it starts with 38 and ends
at 44 so this is how you can actually
generate an Idolator by using find I
traitor and this will return the
starting as it is the ending index of
the matching object so if you have any
doubts you can write it down in your
chat box it's pretty easy guys any
doubts Devon says all clear so does
Jason Davion alright fine guys so we'll
move forward and we'll have a look at
the other operations that you can
perform with ray X so now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to match words with a
particular pattern so we have a string
in which we have Sat hat Matt and Pat so
now my question is to you all guys what
is the pattern that you can see in this
particular string that is sad hard
Martin part alright so Devon says at is
common and also the saara jason Theon
almost everyone says that all right guys
nice observation so let me go ahead with
it and I'm going to show you how you can
match words with a particular pattern
using Reigate so first I'm going to open
my pie charm let me remove all this
so let me define a string once more and
type in SDR so we have sad mad hot
Matt and we have bad this is our string
now I want to match anything that ends
with at so for that I am going to define
a variable all STR and now what I'm
going to do is are e dot final now what
I want I want words that starts with s H
M and P alright and after that it should
end with at so I've written ad it's very
simple guys and now what I'm going to
type in I'm going to type the name of
the string that is STR so this bracket
where I've written SH M P it shows that
I'm matching specifically for the words
that starts with SH m and T now I'm
again going to use a for loop in which
I'm going to type in for I in all string
give a colon print I it starts simple go
ahead and execute this and see what
happens so yup it prints has Matt and
Pat but one thing to notice here guys it
will not print side why it is not
printing side because it is an uppercase
letter so if I go ahead and I make it as
capital S I'm go ahead and execute this
so yep you can see that even sat has
been printed so any question the guys
you have right now please write it down
in your heart box or if you are fine
with it you can give me a confirmation
so that I can explain you the other
operations that you can perform with
regular expressions alright so I've got
a confirmation from almost everyone so
let me go back to my site and see what
are other operations that we can perform
with regular expressions now over here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
match series of range of characters now
what does that mean let me explain you
what the example that is there so now
what I want here is I want all the words
in which the first letter is between the
range edge to M so all the words whose
first letter comes in the range edge to
M should be printed and it should be
ending with at so basically it should
print hat and mad because P comes after
M so does s so it won't print certain
path now let's go ahead and see in a
Python whether this half
not now over here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to remove this s so to
speak
- and - here and execute this say up it
has printed hat and mark
so if I want all these things to be
printed what I can do is I can write in
here Z and execute this so you have it
has printed hot mat and part but it does
not print it side why because it starts
with an uppercase s so if I make it as s
and I'm going to print this so yep it
has printed side as well because between
edge to Z of s H M and P life so it has
printed all the range of characters
whose first letter is president the
range edge to Z
so now I can use a carrot symbol doesn't
include all the words apart from ones
which have the first letter between the
range H to M so let me first make it as
M and now I'm going to use a carrot
symbol yeah so when I use this carrot
symbol this means everything apart from
this range that is H to M go on and
execute this and you can see that's
printed such and part but not hot and
mad because of the carrot symbol that
I've just shown you right so I hope you
all are clear with how to actually find
a range of characters in a string
alright so everyone is clear so I'll
open my slides once again and now what I
want I want to replace a particular
string so as you can see in the example
I have a string in which we have hot rod
Martin Park but I want to replace this
rod I don't like that all right to
talked about how it replace this rod and
I'm going to replace it with the word
food now let me show you how actually
you can do that I'll again open my
pycharm let me first remove all of this
I'll define a spring I'll name it as
food although there weren't many food
items in it but yeah just for the
demonstration purpose hot rod mat pipe
now I will replace rat with food so now
I'm going to compile a regular
expression into what are called pattern
objects and pattern objects provides us
with additional methods and one of which
is substitute let me show you how you
can do that just type in red X for
example yeah reg X equal to re dot
compile and I want to compile our which
ends with at and now in the string food
I want to substitute it so I'll type in
reg X dot sub
substitute I want to substitute food in
which string on a substitute I want to
do that in the string food itself so
yeah
and now finally go on and print it
so as you can see we have hot food
Martin part so we have replaced rat with
food so this is pretty simple examples
that I'm giving you right now but these
basics you can actually go on and find
out a pattern and you can perform a lot
of operations so if you have any doubts
or any queries with respect to how to
replace the string you can write it down
in your chat box any queries any doubts
case now with this one very important
thing that I want to talk about it is
called solving the back slash problems
now let me show you what I'm talking
about
so I have a string let me name it as a
random string so I'll write it around
STR equal to here is Drogba
all right so when I go on and print this
let me show you what comes so we got
only single backslash but we have dived
in here double backslashes so this is
what I'm talking about now in order to
solve this problem what I can do is I
can make use of regular expressions so
let me show you how you can do that so
all you need to do is you need to type
in re dot search so this is re is
basically we call it as a raw string so
Rossing will treat backslashes as
special so let me show you how it will
do as this type in our dot search then
our quotation rod path
and the name of the string that is
random string go ahead and execute this
up at a solar problem and you can see
that double backslash appears over here
so this is what I'm talking about the
backslash problem if you have any doubts
any queries you can write it down in
your chart box I'll be happy to help you
alright so we have no doubts let me open
my slides again and we'll have a look at
the other operations that you can
perform with random strings but there
you can perform with regular expressions
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
match a single character so I have one
two three four five is match string and
now I want to print only the fifth digit
so it should print five but before that
we'll have a look at a couple more
examples in which I will be telling you
about how to deal with white spaces so
let me open my PI term again let me
remove all of this yeah so now I'm going
to define one more string let me name it
as random string equal to
keep the blue flag
flying high
and Chelsea does not aim at my favorite
slab
and let me just print this random string
so that's printed keep the blue flag
flying high now let's go ahead and
remove the new lines with the space so
for that what I need to do is again I'm
going to define a variable let me limit
as reg X equal to re dot compile we have
talked about compile in the previous
example so I hope you can remember it so
the symbol for new line that is a
backslash n then I'm going to type in
the random string equal to reg X
substituted with what were you want to
substituted just a space right so just
give a space in between that's pretty
easy and just type in here random string
now go ahead and print this random
string yeah so as you can see earlier it
was like this keep the blue flag in one
line flying high in one line chelsey in
one line but with the help of regular
expression I've replaced the new lines
with a space so this is how you can work
out with the white spaces so this is how
you can work with white spaces now there
are other white spaces that you'll be
able to work with for example let me
just show you so you have a backslash B
that stands for what it stands for
backspace
then you have
backslash f4 form feed
then you have backslash R for carriage
return
similarly you have backslash t for tab
and you have vertical tabs as well so
for that we have backslash we vertical
tab
these are the white spaces that you can
work with now let's see how to match a
single character that we have discussed
in our slide so let me first remove all
of this all right so let me define my
more variable and name it as random
string again and I'm going to type in
here 1 2 3 4 5
and now what I'm going to type in I'm
going to type in print matches
I'm going to give a : and then I'll type
in length re dot find all
backslash D
random string now over here you can
notice that we have backslash T so
basically this backslash T will match
any numbers any any numbers which are
present but if I write a capital T over
here so it will match anything but a
number so let me keep it as backslash T
and print this and show you what it will
give us so we have five matches as you
can see that we have five digits now if
I make it as capital T so that will
return me everything but the digits so
let me just show you I've converted this
to capital e go on and execute this so
we have zero matches now
so now if I want to match a specific
digit I'll be using curly braces so let
me show you how you are going to do it
so in the curly braces just type in 5
and it should print that for us so yep
it has found one match that is present
over here so I'll now what I'll do I'll
clear this again and I'm going to define
in one more variables and let it be num
over here I'll go one two three so now
one two three four then our one two
three four five one two three four five
six one two three four five six and
seven now we can even match digits with
a certain range let's say our range is
between five to seven so for that what
I'm going to type in I'm going to type
in a print statement
and again I'll keep it as matches give a
comma and now I'm going to type in
length re
dot find all what I'm searching for word
I'm searching for digits so backslash T
and what is my range range is between
five to seven give a comma and then type
in the string name that is now go ahead
execute this and it finds three matches
because over here we have five over
where we have five and six over here we
have five six and seven so it has found
the three matches that we were talking
about so this is all you can perform
basic operations using a regular
expressions so if you have any doubts
any queries you can write it down in
your chat box I'll be happy to help you
guys any questions
so we have no questions so let me open
my slides again now we have seen all
basic operations that you can perform
with regular expressions now how about I
show you one of the various applications
of regular expressions I'm going to take
in some use cases a problem statement
and I'm going to show you how you can
use regular expressions in order to
solve those problems how about that guys
alright so I see a lot of people are
interested in that so without any
further ado let us move forward and see
how you can do that alright so we have a
first problem in which we need to verify
these phone numbers so we have a list of
phone numbers and the general format of
a phone number is it should start with
three digits then an - sign then three
middle digits and the three digits in
between and a sign and then fold is it
in the end so this is what a basic
format of a number is so let us go back
to our pycharm and verify these numbers
with the help of regular expressions let
me remove all this
so before I start
writing down the code let me explain you
something so we have backslash W so
basically what it does is it is same as
writing down lowercase a to z uppercase
a to Z even numbers and underscore so
lowercase W is actually equal to this
thing that has typed here so it will
match anything that is inside the
brackets when we talk about uppercase
backslash W it will match anything but
the things inside the braces so it is
similar to using a carrot inside the
brace so I'll just show you
so it'll match everything but the things
that are present inside the bases so
this is what I'm going to use in in
order to write the code for validating
phone numbers so let me just make a
string that has my phone numbers so I'll
just type in our phone and I'll put here
for one two triple five and say one two
one two alright now I'm going to use the
condition statement that says if I dot
search
so
anything that has three digits then it
should have a - sign then again anything
that has three digits then again a -
sign and anything that has four digits
give a : go on and print it is a phone
number
now basically instead of backslash W I
can even use as backslash T because all
of these are digits but let me just keep
it as backslash W only and go on and
print this so yep it is a phone number
but what if I am going to change here
and I'm going to make it as triple five
one let me show you it is not printing
anything because so because our regular
expression says that it'll take only
three digits now as I told you earlier
as well W takes a to Z lower case and
upper case as well so even if I replace
it with D it won't matter let me show
you go on execute this so yup it does
not printed anything but if I go on and
remove this one and print it again so
yup it has printed a phone number now if
I would have added here a as well it
won't print that so yeah so basically I
wanted to tell you what backslash W is
that's why I've written it over here
now let me tell you a use case of this
backslash W as well so if you want to
see that a full name is a valid full
name or not so what you can do is you
can use backslash W at that time so
basically if I have explained your
backslash W is this is how you can use
backslash W all right I'll give you one
more example so now let me remove all of
this and now we will see if the full
name is valid or not
basically there should be a space
between first and last name so for that
I'm going to use a backslash S with the
same as writing down backslash S that is
form feed or a backslash n that is a new
line or a backslash R that is a carriage
return or a back backslash T that is tab
or vertical tabs so it is pretty much
similar to that so it is exactly the
same similarly if I write here an
uppercase s can you guess what it will
be all right so everybody almost gets it
so basically it will be equal to a caret
and form feed new line v /r tab as well
as vertical tasks so it will include
anything but
backslash s backslash n backslash R
backslash T and backslash we let me just
comment this
all right so now let's go ahead and
validate whether a valid full name is
present or not so for that what I'm
going to do is I'm going to type in a
condition if re dot search
now over here what I need to do is can
you guys tell me
all right the first I'm going to type in
W and range of W should be between
to 220 then in between I want a space so
I can just type in us now in between
what I want I can have either a new line
or a table or a vertical table anything
like that so I can give a backslash s
and one more backslash W for the last
name and the range of the last name can
be from 2 to 20 and finally I'm going to
write the name I'm going to delight my
own name
give a : and print full name is valid go
ahead and execute this so yep as you can
see that I've printed the full name is
valid so if I convert this lowercase s
to an uppercase s it will basically be
equal to a carat and form the new line
vertical tabs tabs so anything apart
from all of these so I hope you have
understood the concept that I've
explained you till now if you have any
doubts or any questions you can write it
down in your chat box and it out guys
all right so we have no doubts so now
I'm going to move back to my
presentation again so now this was one
use case now a second use cases we need
to verify the email addresses so our
email addresses should I want to 20
lowercase and uppercase letters numbers
plus period underscore percentage plus
minus it should have an ad rate symbol
then again to 220 lowercase and
uppercase letters numbers plus period
and - then we should have one more
period and then at two to three
lowercase and uppercase letters so let
me go ahead and show you practically how
you can do it let me remove all of this
and let me first write a list of emails
so you can write that sk after 800 l.com
I can have MD ad rate.com add rate SEO
calm now I can have one more and I can
name it has TC added dot-com
let me just remove the space all right
so now what I'll type in I'll Drive and
print
email
matches give a : laughter the space I'm
going to type in length re to find all
open the parentheses and over there in
the square braces for a1 first I want
anything then I want a period our
underscore percentage + - close the
braces and it should range between say 1
to 20 after that what I want I want add
it after after it I want anything to
that I'll type backslash W dot times
period then I want a - and what should
be the range it should be between 2 to
20 characters after that I want a period
and then I want uppercase and lowercase
letters then it should range between 2
to 3 email all right guys go ahead and
execute this so it has found only one
match so which is SK at the rate a will
calm now if I actually copy/paste this
once more in the end and print this say
up we have two matches so this is how
you can match the email address you just
need to identify the format of it and
you can do it any doubts any queries
guys you can write it down in your chat
box any questions all right so we have
no doubts now let us move forward and
see the third application of Python
regular expressions so you can perform
web scraping using regular expressions
now what is that scraping let me explain
you with a flow diagram that is there in
front of your screen so we have websites
right and obviously these websites
contains multiple web pages now if I
want to create some useful information
from those web pages I can use web
scraping and extract that content and I
can save it wherever I want I can save
it in an XML format or CSV basically
however I want to say so you can do that
with Python a regular expressions so in
our case what we are going to do there
is a website and that website we have
phone numbers we have addresses so what
we are going to do we are going to write
a code in order to get only the contact
numbers from that and how are you going
to do that we are going to do that we
have
a regular expression so for that I'm
again going to open my pie charm so guys
I've already written the code so we have
imported a couple of libraries in the
beginning which are used to perform web
scraping I mean they are used basically
to read the web page then we have
findall which we have discussed earlier
as well now this is the URL that I'm
talking about right so let me just copy
this and I'm going to show you to you in
my browser how it looks like
so this is how our web page looks like
so we have name here we have the address
then finally we have the phone numbers
now notice a pattern in the phone number
we have three digits inside the
parenthesis then again we have three
digits then we have a hyphen and then
finally we have four digits let's keep
this pattern in mind and we are going to
write a code in order to scrape only
these phone numbers from this particular
website let me close right now all right
fine
so now you see the URL right so apart
from that whatever things that are there
actually we have covered that in the web
scraping tutorial so you are pretty much
aware about it so what is this we are
basically reading the content that is
there in our particular website now
we'll focus on the regular expression
part so you know what exactly findall is
we have discussed that now since you
want only visits so we are going to make
use of this particular identifier and
inside the curly braces I have written
three which means that there will be
three digits inside the parentheses
after that there is a space then again
we have three digits then we have a
hyphen and then finally we have four
digits then save it in HTML STR and then
finally print it now let us go ahead and
execute this and see what happens
so we have scraped all the phone numbers
that were there this is how it looks
like and we made use of regular
expressions so you can use regular
expressions for web scraping as well
fine guys this is it for today's session
if you have any questions any doubts you
can write it down in your chat box I
will be happy to help you Rajani say the
amazing session Thank You Jean it's for
those kind words any questions guys you
can ask me fine if we have no question
so I'll just move forward and give you a
brief summary of what all things we have
discussed in law so first we understood
why we need regular expressions and what
exactly it is then be focused on various
operations of regular expressions and
then we focus on three applications of
regular expressions starting with email
verification phone number verification
and web scraping so till now any
questions guys I'm again repeating any
questions you can write it down in a
child box fine so we have no question so
this video will be uploaded into
elements you can go through it if you
have any questions about you can bring
it at the next class or you can ask our
24/7 support team as well thank you and
