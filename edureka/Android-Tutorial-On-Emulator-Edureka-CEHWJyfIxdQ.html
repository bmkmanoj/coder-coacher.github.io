an emulator it's something that
simulates the actual device and that is
what we call an emulator right it is
something that gives you the same
environment where in what would be
housing on the actual device and then
comes on how the question for my side
can I run my Eclipse applications on my
actual device it's my question for
everyone what if I do not want to use
immolated emulator at all for example
I'm using the accelerometer for example
I'm using the gyroscope all right so how
should i go about running my application
onto my actual device all right in order
to run your applications directly under
the devices first of all what you need
is you need a pc suit for the app fuzzy
device that you are running it on HTC
has got HTC say LT has got a LG LG piece
issued solo I'm not sure about this la
about the solo phones of yours ashwin
but any piece issued that comes
associated with the device first of all
install this that easy suit for example
samsung has a keys installation if you
would have seen here on my desktop you
see i have installed keys onto my
respective machine alright because i do
a lot of debugging on to the devices so
i need an installation for keys alright
so that is how you have to first of all
install the pc suit of your devices then
in order to find where exactly you have
to find let me just pick up my phone
here and i'll tell you the exact steps
where you will be finding these settings
in order to enable debugging on your
device then we have the emulator control
here i say all see a call getting coming
up on my emulator just see a call coming
and everybody see this call coming up on
Miami later now so these are all the
options that are in use on the basis of
the emulators right I can give an all
answer it I can answer this call right
you want to just end this fall I can end
this party similarly if I try to send a
message I have all the options available
with me on this emulator control I say
once i do that and i click on sale you
will see a text message being sent on to
the emulator here you go alright so that
is how we can use make use of the
emulator controls suppose you want to
set up the latitude and longitude onto
the device or say onto the emulator when
you are not working on the actual device
so this is the place where you can set
it from
right so I have got my device with me
here in order to enable the debugging
settings on to your respective devices
first of all just go on to settings
inside the settings you'll be finding
something which we call it the developer
options right go to the developer
options under the developer options just
first of all enable the development
options under your devices as everybody
doing this exercise with me here enable
the developer options the toggle button
for the developer options then you see a
window at the bottom which says USB
debugging a checkbox against the against
the option of USB debugging everybody
confirmed me that everybody gets fine in
this up alright just check on the check
box so that you allow applications to
have debugging mode enabled once you
have done that alright once you have
done that just plug your device with the
USB cable and instead of seeing this
emulator if you have the device up and
working you'll be seeing our device here
no problems I think even that is all
fine with me alright so you can see this
particular window here it will be
showing you the actual device and when
you will be running in your applications
you will be running on on the actual
devices so that is how you can run your
applications directly onto the devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
