going to tell you all about the top 10
reasons to learn blotching you see
blockchain technology is moving at a
fast pace if you're still cemented in
your cube editing Java codes are just
messing the powerbuilder you are
probably living in the past but there
are only a few employers well things
have changed now you need to take a step
ahead and walk with the revolutionary
technologies where blockchain is one of
the leaders so here are my 10 picks on
why you should invest your time in
learning blockchain now let's start our
countdown in the reverse order as number
10 we have blockchain as a cutting-edge
technology according to Gartner and many
other sub-sites blockchain ranks at the
top as one of the most cutting-edge
technologies of the century the sort of
data protection and privacy required by
governments and businesses alike is
provided by blockchain in an efficient
manner blockchain in itself is being
team almost as revolutionary as
protocols like TCP IP and HTTP if not
more or number 9 we have high demands
for blockchain blockchain is a booming
sector there are ample opportunities
waiting for you in the market if you
think you have the right skill set to
work in blockchain and get adapted to
the trending wave then swim in the sea
of jobs and enjoy the power of this
revolutionary platform following which
at number eight we have calculated
investment in cryptocurrencies and I see
us there is no doubt that cryptocurrency
is a word that elicits a very strong
response these days every time Bitcoin
pulls back and tries someone has
something to say about it on the
Internet it's a new asset class that has
taken the world by storm
since Bitcoin first hit the scene the
volatility and the market often is what
leads to the fear but the excitement
around the tech itself is outpacing that
blockchain is an underlying technology
of cryptocurrencies so the understanding
of the concept will help you in smart
investment and trading also knowing the
technology will help you shortlist the
best I SEOs based on their concepts
the CEO of current once said if people
are going to day trade cryptocurrencies
as they do not know what they are doing
they're going to get slaughtered next in
the list we have blockchain as a
universal infra facility
blockchain and DLT which stands for
distributed ledger technology
essentially connects together to form a
new type of market infrastructure that
sits on top of and integrates into
existing systems and processes so
basically it offers a single
infrastructure and solution facility
connected with the other type of market
this way you can integrate into the
existing process and system moving on
next in the list is the most important
reason for you to learn blockchain if
you care about security and legitimacy
of your data and digital security if you
look at the current web infrastructure
you would find how vulnerable we are
right now which brings me to the
original web 1.0 concerns about the
commerce and identity online can my
credit card and number get stolen most
definitely am i being tracked almost
100% do they see my profile activity and
password oh yes is it safe well we
thought so in the above image you can
see how blockchain infrastructure
eliminates the need for any single
entity to keep and store your sensitive
data including you so blockchain can
solve all these problems then why not
learn to use it
next comes the exciting part on the list
of five I have integration with New Age
technology there have been some unique
concepts produced from a melding of
blockchain with voting systems
commodities training and even real
estate but the candidate most likely
push mass adoption of God field is the
Internet of Things this ability to build
a safe infrastructure for autonomous
collaborations makes it easy to be
creative without worrying about the
veracity of their data on number 4
I have industries on blockchain
blockchain is playing a dominant role in
terms of Technology in the market
banking isn't the only industry that
would be affected by blocking
supermarkets energy resources healthcare
voting and many other sectors could also
have blockchain in their future with
this you can begin the shift process and
ensure that transactions at the platform
of blockchain and maintain and ubiquity
of value is also driven now since the
industries have also started adopting it
it is suspected that blockchain is soon
going to bring an inflection of an era
so at number three I have inflection
point of an era I feel the world is on
the brink of another ARPANET moment
perhaps an inflection point which will
directly affect the way people do
business this moment is blockchain
with financial institutions as knowledge
doing the destructive nature of
blockchain predictions are that
blockchain will reach the critical mass
around 2 0 to 4 so I would suggest
that's better surf wave the first you
late another important reason why you
should learn blockchain is that it can
disrupt the value chain completely
blockchain is expected to improve
confidence and fidelity between the
operating parties it lessens the value
chain tricks down the workflow and thus
pieces of the inter party processes this
will in turn lead to refocusing of
certain players in the value chain there
going to be a lot of job opportunities
since players should be sizing up their
future positions and managers should be
reassessing their value in the chains at
number 1 I have high job prospects and
good pay from cryptocurrency startups
that have gone on to establish their own
companies the job market looks good for
block teen enthusiasts as it is expected
to grow exponentially in the coming
years
then players have been searching for the
following job rules senior software
engineer cryptocurrency analyst
blockchain developer crypto currency
trader of cryptocurrency mining
technician and the list goes on and on
and on so guys these were some key
reasons why anyone should learn
blockchain while it is still in its
infancy if you are intrigued by this
handsome technology and you want a
structured learning you can let us know
down in the comment section below it's
totally worth of guys don't learn it
