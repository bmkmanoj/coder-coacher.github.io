name is Verdun and on behalf of ADA
Rekha I welcome you all to this session
on what is DevOps so based on several
requests that we got in our previous
sessions we are conducting this live
session which will give a basic
introduction to what DevOps is all about
so guys during the session if you have
any doubts or any queries don't hesitate
to put them in the comment box because
we have a team I have a team with me and
either they or I will myself answer them
for you so just sit back and relax and
enjoy this session for the next 30
minutes to understand what exactly
DevOps is and to clear all your doubts
all right
so before I start with the session I
have a question for you people can
anyone tell me which are the most common
software development methodologies today
okay so you know you guys can answer
that you know some of the most popular
development methodologies that have been
there over the years are those of SDLC a
child development scrum and of course
now it's divorce right but what exactly
is a need for DevOps right DevOps is the
most latest and by far the most the most
efficient right why why is it that know
what caused DevOps to become so popular
and why was there a need for DevOps
let's look at that first okay that'll be
the first topic for today we look at the
different challenges with software
development okay and then I'll tell you
how does DevOps minimize that challenge
and after that I will talk about the
DevOps tools and techniques which of
course help us in enabling and achieving
orchestration between the different
develops tools and that's actually the
best part of DevOps implementing the
different tools making a job easier
achieving automation so that'll be
another important topic that I'll talk
about and then finally I will talk about
what is the demand for Doh ops engineers
before finally giving you a hands-on
demonstration of adop's engineer in
action ok but this again is not gonna be
a very detailed demonstration I'm just
going to use two tools in
and Jenkins I'm going to show you a
basic demonstration of how these two
develops tools which are the most
popular DevOps tools out there how they
work and how easily we can benefit right
so that would be the agenda for today so
without wasting much time I'm going to
start with my first topic and that is
the software development challenges so
the primary factor leading to challenges
during software development is the
sillas that exists between the
development team and the operations team
ok and as you can see from the image
here it's a very similar scenario out
there in the industry where you have the
development team on one hand on the and
the operations team on the other hand
and they always have tussles so they
always get take blows at each other and
they always have disagreements and they
point fingers at each other whenever
there is some kind of a mushaf that
happens
well that's because the developers are
responsible for just developing the code
and testing the code and then giving it
to the operations team and then it's the
operations team's responsibility to
deploy that to the staging server and
then to the production server and then
finally you know release it right and
over here where the problem actually
comes up if there is any problem
with respect to the code you know
whether there being a faulty bug in the
code then in that case the operations
would start blaming all the would start
putting all the blame on the developers
and in fact if there's a problem on the
operation side where if they are not
able to deploy the code properly then
the developers would start blaming the
operations there so they would start
saying that you don't have the system in
place you don't have the right
dependencies you don't have the right
tools and all these things so it's it's
a blame game that happens between the
two and it's one thing which has been
which has if it has a bad effect and all
software development so a lot of
projects gets delayed and there is very
inefficient planning and all these
things happen now to eliminate this is
what we have something called as DevOps
okay but before I go into more details
about DevOps let me talk about a few
more challenges and problems that these
people come up with so as you can see
here the developers besides just saying
that they also blame the blame the
operations for having legacy system
because the like the operations would
say that they cannot move everything to
a new system they need a lot of time and
there's a lot of dependencies and just
too much is there at stake for them to
leave their base to leave their legacy
system right and that is a problem that
the developers would have because the
latest technology that they would be
developing that cannot be run on legacy
systems that there that need like really
good and really latest hardware and
technology there and then the developers
also complain of tool tool turbulence
now what we mean by tool turbulence is
that I don't some set of tools which the
developers would have used to develop an
application or a software that cannot be
implemented on the production server and
the reason that could not be done is
maybe because of security risks or
firewall or many other pub many of the
reasons it's just it's just not possible
to do or to deploy that in production
server and that's where the operations
would have a problem so after the
developers build everything then they
would you know the operations would
complain that they cannot implement this
tool and the developers would have a
tussle and they will have to probably
rebuild the software from scratch so
that's one aspect of that that's one
aspect of the problem that they face
okay and developers most often complain
that automation needs to be in place
because a lot of automation helps in a
big way it reduces a lot of tasks okay
being the technical guy they are being
the technical people they know how to
achieve it but the operations would not
always you know coordinate with the
developers on that aspect so that's one
more complaint that the developers would
have now going to the operations people
those folks would start complaining that
since the software or the applications
developed by you or someone else them
monitoring it on their own is little
tedious right so that's one complaint
that goes out and they say that then
there needs to be efficient monitoring
and even the developers have to be
equally responsible for how the software
is performing if there is any bug in the
code then they should be able to fix
that bug right away because if it's not
fixed then there is the onus is on the
operations right so they are going to be
held responsible so they would be asked
to fix that
and besides fixing bugs there is no way
to revert back the changes so
operations you know they're their hands
are tied in that place and finally the
operations would also have problems in
the production environment like I told
you earlier so they would have different
set of dependencies and libraries
installed in their system and the
developers would have developed the
application based on the latest the
software they would have updated to the
bait latest dependencies and that is
something the operations would not have
done and that may be a reason why
sometimes the application does not work
well on the production some features
might not work even though it's working
perfectly at the developers end so
developers would be complaining that
it's your system that's what that's
causing the problem and the operations
would say that no that's it's your code
so this is a very common now analogy
that comes with the software development
challenges over the years and this is
what has caused DevOps okay and as you
people know the you people might be
aware of the solution to this right now
right so it's pretty simple
since there are two different teams here
working separately to achieve a common
task they have this chance to blame each
other but if you merge them you have the
problems goes away right so Debra ops
together
DevOps solves all the problems right so
that has to be the solution I hope
everyone here agrees with me
so on that note I'll go forward and now
let's see what is the DevOps strategy
and what are the folks here that are
working as DevOps engineers what is
their responsibility
so DevOps engineers would not just you
know Abby take care of one aspect they
would not just be taking care of
development or they would not just be
taking care of operations they would
have to take care of the entire
lifecycle okay they have to be part of
the planning coding building that
software then testing it using different
tools in they have to deploy to
production perform the operations on
that and finally monitor how the
application is performing and finally
whenever there are changes and with the
next cycle with the next release they'll
have to integrate those changes with the
existing system and this is a
never-ending cycle so this is what
DevOps engineers need to do okay and
that is the same image that you can see
her so this DevOps engineer that's
working on a system that's probably
coding and then he is the same person
here he's also working on the operations
aspect so he's getting all the reports
and all these things right so the DevOps
strategy since it involves the engineers
to have complete control of the
application that's being developed it
involves continuous development
continuous testing continuous
integration continuous develop LOI MIT
and continuous monitoring of the
software throughout its development
lifecycle right so that's what the
develop a DevOps strategy preaches that
more responsibility needs to be taken
it's to be taken up by these folks who
are Dobbs engineers so the developers
can't complain that it didn't work on
production because they are now gonna be
responsible for that and since they are
gonna do it so they will be able to
immediately know where the bug is why
something's not working on production
and if something cannot be you know
deployed to production then what are the
alternatives they can fix that and with
the help of DevOps tools we can there is
also scope for reverting back the
changes right we have version control
systems which can be used to go back to
the previous state and you know
achieve a lot of automation and save a
lot of time and benefit over the other
development methodologies so now that
we've spoken about the DevOps strategy
and what the DevOps in scenarios are
expected to do let me go to the next
slide and talk about
some of the most popular and used DevOps
tools so these are the most moving tools
in the market and we have different
categories so the same plan code build
test integration deploy operate and want
off
they are divided over various phases so
the plan and code here we have three
different tools in grid
SPL and JIRA okay this subversion is
also called as SPL and these three tools
are basically version control tools okay
and they fall under this plan and code
phase because as as version control
tools what they do is they enable
developers to write the code and build
the code over here okay they can plan
and they can code as per they wish to
and they can make changes to it you know
act free will so it's not like they have
they make they write a set of code today
and they make changes tomorrow and you
know they don't they can't work back so
that's the thing with SVN they don't
have to worry about that so even your no
matter how many changes they make to the
code they can always revert back to a
previous state because the version they
would have committed to the SVN system
or the git repository that we tagged
with a version so if they are not happy
with any version that they have released
recently or if there's any bug over here
then they can always revert back to the
previous state which is which was stable
so that's what these three tools can do
and that's what they do as continuous
development tools okay and for building
we again have tools like maven and on
and Gradle okay now these three tools
are raw for building and even they
follow there they come they are actually
part of the continuous testing phase
okay they are used with the testing
tools and the main responsibility for
them is to use whatever code has been
built right so it would just package
that and it would be ready to build for
testing so that's the responsibility of
these three tools and going on the
second part of the continuous testing
phase involves these tools of selenium J
unit and unit tests energy so these are
the testing tools which would actually
do the tests
so this testing phase and the building
phase they together
from the continuous testing phase
continuous testing part right so in the
continuous testing part the code is
built and it's tested so the actual
testing happens your and whenever
there's whenever the code is the success
or whenever it's a failure then that can
be worked upon it can be improved or it
can also be integrated or it can be
deployed so this deployment happens with
the help of in the you know for
deployment there is this phase of
integration and the integration that you
see your raw is one of the most
important phases and the tool that we
used for integration is that of Jenkins
so Jenkins is probably my favorite tool
because of what it can do and it is what
encompasses the whole DevOps methodology
okay I'm so it's at the heart of the
develop strategy where it integrates
everything so if there's a new code that
needs to be deployed Jen can stay and do
that for you
if there is a if your code suddenly
stops working then Jenkins will be there
to notify you of that problem and if you
want to make changes to the existing
code then Jenkins can do that for you we
can do the integration so it can do
monitoring so Jenkins is an all-in-one
tool it can do a lot of things with
integrations and the plugins to a number
of tools here right so and Jenkins
its main integrations are with both of
selenium maven gate and the
configuration management tools and of
course we're we're not talking about
docker here so docker again is really I
know it's one of the best deployment
tools which container Rises your
applications right so that's what is the
big benefit with Jenkins so it can it it
basically blends in well with all the
other tools and then we have the
deployment phase and the operation phase
so this forms the continuous continuous
deployment phase and over here these
four tools of puppet chef Saul stack and
as well they are the ER they are the
configuration management tools okay now
as configuration management tools what
they need to primarily do is to deploy
all the code and basically deploy the
code and the application to a number of
servers so on in the so what happens in
the industry is that you will have to
deploy your code or host your if
two web servers you have to host it on
multiple servers right you need to
enable high you need to have a high
availability and besides I've already
you know it needs to be accessible by a
lot of traffic since there'll be a lot
of load coming in it needs to be managed
so you need multiple servers and if it's
fine it's possible if you're having to
host just two or three servers you can
probably manually do it but if you want
to scale it up to 50 servers or hundred
servers suddenly so at that time you
will have problems and even doing it
once is fine but if you want to make
minor changes to the code that is
deployed on to these servers then it's a
problem right so that's where these
configuration management tools come in
so with these tools you can easily
deploy these code changes and deploy the
code itself from scratch on any number
of servers so they are basically they
work on the basis of master slave
architecture where with the help of
master we can deploy the code to
multiple slaves and each of these slaves
would be the different servers so that's
what the continuous deployment phase
comprises of it compresses or it holds
the deployment and the operation as a
part of it and finally here comes the
monitoring phase it may be the last but
it's certainly not least because it is
the monitoring phase which tells if your
application is working perfectly if if
it's all fine if there's any downtime if
something fails if something grievious
happens if your system is not working
all these errors would be you know you
would know only with the help of
monitoring right so you have to always
have a look at how your application is
performing and the tools for that are
those of New Relic sensu and Nagios so
these are some of the most popular tools
and yeah that's how they work together
they work in tandem right so any doubts
guys do drop it if you have any doubts
do let me know at this point of five
you
guys I'll just give you people a couple
of minutes to put in your questions okay
so I'm just gonna mute myself till then
you
you
okay so that's an interesting question
here from Bhupati he's asking in the
future would there be no jobs for test
engineers well obably it's wrong for
that so you would definitely have you
definitely have openings for test
engineers they are also a part of this
DevOps I have cycle okay so the DevOps
engineers would also be doing that part
and it would not be just different
phases so like I said the ops comprises
of a lot of things and they would all be
working together so you will have to
have multiple skill sets so go on are
the days that you can just sit on one
particular fruit and enjoy the taste so
you'll have to have multiple skills so
that's how this happens
okay so guys uh anyways let me get back
to my session here okay let me continue
with my real session so I'll take up
more questions later on so yeah there's
just one more slide here before I go to
my yo demonstration and that is what is
the demand for DevOps engineers okay you
guys might have by now realize how
adored Ops is the future so there is
some more proof your and as you can see
some of the top companies over here in
HP Tesla SAP Cisco and Amazon they're
all hiring DevOps and it is these dopes
engineers whom they are rapidly looking
to you know groom and hire so if you
look at HP they are they say that they
want to build a solution using relevant
tools because of course they are a big
MNC right so they have various services
and absolutely it makes sense when they
say that they want to make use of
multiple develops tools and it's the
engineers who would be doing that for
them and Tesla for advanced system
engineering SAP for end-to-end develop
strategist well this is another
interesting thing because there is just
so much to do with DevOps and it's an
unexplored field it's still young and
there's so much that you can do as a top
strategist and here SAP are just doing
that and this shows that you know how
much how important these DevOps engines
would be for them and the same thing
with Cisco and Amazon they are trying to
implement virtualization using DevOps so
this is just on our I've just given you
a basic idea of how the demand for them
is so I'm not even included all the
software service companies here I have
not included any of these startups it's
just some of the top companies so to
just give you an idea of you know how
the demanders so well in the meanwhile I
can go to my demonstration because
that's the end of my slides and go to my
demonstration what I need to do first is
I need to open my virtual machine right
so guys do give me a confirmation if you
can see my virtual machine can you see
it guys
okay
all right so please bear with me my VM
is a little slow but anyways the demo
that I'm going to show you is basically
using the two tools of git and Jenkins
okay like I told you get is gonna be
used for restoring my code and pulling
the code to basically be stored as a
central repository for my code right and
my Jenkins here I haven't used Jenkins
as the tool that would pull my code from
git and it would deploy it or execute it
it would build jobs based on the code
that is there and get okay so let me
just show that implementation on my
system so this is my VM this is my
terminal okay so here let me just see to
the git repository so here you can see
that there is one HelloWorld file and
then there's a readme file so the Z me
file comes with your gate repository so
if you initiate any repository and get a
readme file comes with it and my hello
fold file your let me just do a cat and
show you what is there here so it's a
simple password which I've created which
says HECO HelloWorld and HECO hi from a
to Rekha okay now it's a very basic
demonstration and I'm not gonna go into
details of how the code is you know
being managed over here and how it's
gonna be deployed I've done that in some
of my previous sessions where I've shown
you how to deploy an angular application
how to deploy your main sac application
and all those things so this is a basic
session we're here I'm just going to
show you how git and Jenkins can be used
together okay and get bingo very popular
and one of the most important or the
fundamental tool for code development
I'm going to show you how that happens
so this is what is there in my ear'
batch file and if I execute it from my
terminal this is the output that you get
right so even when I run my well what I
did here is I did I did cat HelloWorld
so if I X if I want to execute this
batch file
I do a bash and HelloWorld dot Sh right
and for those people who don't know what
bashes bash is basically to exit this is
used to execute any any shell any batch
file okay
and inside the batch file commands would
be specified and whatever is specified
that would be straightaway executed so
if you see here I have a set echo hello
world and echo hi from Edo rekha okay
now when I did batch hello world on Sh
these two commands are simply executed
okay the echo command simply executed
hello world and in the second line they
go command simply executed hi from in
Eureka so that's what a batch file does
sorry a batch file does ok and executing
this through Jenkins is what I'm going
to show you but before I show any
execution over there let me first show
my github repository okay so using my
Jenkins I'm gonna pull this code from my
github repository so as you people are
aware this repository of mine slash home
slash andraka slash git repo one this is
a git repository and this is linked to
my URL at this one github.com slash war
than n s slash hello world okay so we
have the same file over here the hello
world dot SH and as you can see we have
the same two lines echo hello world and
echo hi from a traitor now I want to
show you how it works okay before I show
you something with Jenkins I want to
make changes to this code and show you
how I can now push code using git and
when I push code from gate those changes
would be also tracked in my github
repository ok and from the github
repository I can use Jenkins to execute
this code so what happens in the
industry is whenever such good is you
know being developed it'll be doubled by
multi lot of people right at the same
time so you will have say five to six
developers working on the code and they
will all be making changes and
developing their own code and as and
when they make changes and azzaman they
develop a couple of lines of code they
will be pushing it to github and a from
github the final code will be will be
sent to deploy
it would first be tested and then sent
to a staging server and then it would be
released to production
so basically github is user the resource
from where the code is managed centrally
and yeah we can people can connect to
get up from their local systems itself
so as a developer look at me in action
see what kind of changes I make to my
get up repository and how I push my
scenes to the github and then I'll show
you how that can be executed through
Jenkins okay so first of all if I want
to edit this file let me do a sudo gr it
hello world dot SH okay and this is the
password okay so I don't want to make
major changes so let me just say let me
enter another echo command and say your
instructor is warden
okay I'm gonna see if this so there's an
extra line that I've added here so even
if it's with respect to any Python or
Java application any kind of change you
make to that code that can be saved like
this and sent to get up in a similar
fashion that I'm going to show you now
okay so now that I've added my your code
here what I need to do next is I need to
do a git add command okay so this would
basically track all the changes that you
do whatever you add all that would be
tracked with a help of the git add - a
command ok and if you want to commit
your changes then the command for that
is git commit with our EM flag which
basically is to specify any comment what
is this comment for so I can say that
this is this is the third line which
have added something of that right and I
can say this is the build number three
or something like that I can hit enter
so this is just the comment that would
be associated with this
get push of mine okay and to actually
push your changes to your github and to
get the changes there there's this
command called git push origin master
okay so this would push whatever changes
you have locally it would push that
changes to the github repository so it
will take a couple of far minutes so
let's just wait till then
okay the username is this and my
password is this
okay maybe my password was incorrect so
let me just try hitting the command
again or maybe there's a problem at the
github server so let's not worry about
that it should be fine by this executing
it a couple of times okay there goes the
username okay great so counting my
objects compressing them pushing them
done 100% so let's wait for the status
okay great so whatever I change whatever
changes I made has been committed and
sent to my github repository
okay hello world dot git so in a similar
fashion so developers will have a single
repository for their for their a
software application okay and in that
private repository they can develop the
application and keep making changes to
it and then through Jenkins they can
deploy that code now to verify if my
github has the updated code let me go
back to gently let me go back to github
and let me refresh this page which
displays what's there in hello world dot
Sh a new line should appear over here
right
okay seems like the implant is a little
slow but anyways that should be a
problem
great so the third line has also come in
here so my github repositories has the
updated code now it's all about Jenkins
right now Jenkins is always by default
hosted on port number 80 80 okay so if
you do a localhost colon 8080 then you
can access your Jenkins webserver and I
don't think you people need to know
anything more than Jenkins being a web
server which helps us pull code from
gate and it helps us execute tests
through test energy and selenium
it helps us continue eyes applications
with the help of docker it helps us work
with configuration management tools like
puppet chef ansible salt stack and of
course it helps us in our automating a
lot of things but getting back to our
session for today
the hello world build so this was the
project that I created so let me just
click on this and here to save some time
I've already added my github repository
or so let me just run through those
changes what I did okay to help you
understand what I've done so and up
configure if you go to configure you can
make changes and you can add your
project details okay
okay so first of all under general tab
you can add the project name some
description if you want to and in case
you want to execute some come some file
from your local system then you can
click on this Advanced tab and say use
custom workspace okay and then you can
add the path over here but since I'm
executing this through github I'm not
going to do that
and this going to quickly go down I'm
gonna say source code management I'm
gonna say get a repository and I'm and
I've certified the github URL okay slash
hello world dot git that's where this is
present my hello world bash file is
present under this repository right so
that's what I have entered over here and
you can just quickly go down and under
build triggers you can control how we
want Jenkins to execute well the actual
concept of automation can be achieved
over here okay if you want to you know
trigger builds remotely you can choose
that option if you want to you know
build some trigger of this project after
some other projects then you can do that
too if you want to build this particular
if you want to build this particular job
on a regular basis on a periodic basis
then you can do that too if you say
build periodically then you can in cron
period you can now in cron format you
can specify once in how many hours or
once in how many days you can you wanna
you can execute this file you can say
that or what whenever there's some kind
of change that you push to get up at
that times if you want to if you want
get to execute if you want get sorry if
you want Jenkins to build this job you
can choose that by checking on this and
various other options you have okay so
the automation concept is achieved over
here built triggers and then you have
build environment which we don't really
need to worry about now but the actual
build so here is where you specify what
you want to execute so I have given the
I've given the repository of my github
account and over there there is this
hello world dot H file right so the same
command which I executed on my terminal
I am saying Jenkins to execute that same
command over here so in my shell I would
be executing the bash command and the
file that powered executed with the bash
command as the hello world dot SH okay
it's as simple as that
so then I just build this job then I
would get the same output I got on my
terminal okay I'll get a hello world now
let's see how let's see if that happens
so for that me to go to build now so
I'll say I don't want to save any
changes and yeah you can see build
abortion over here right above configure
so you can click on build now and your
your job is would probably be getting
built now right away so the build number
16 is scheduled and if you click on the
drop down and if you go to control
output you will know what is the status
is the build successful is it not and
all these details will get so great its
success right the finished state is a
success and the same three echo commands
that I had specified in my bash file
they are executed here correct so in a
similar way if there is any application
that you have if it's a Java program or
if it's a Python program or if it's any
kind of web service or your hosting so
in my previous session it was angular
which I your it was angular and then one
other time I executed mean stack
application so these were the things
which I executed through Jenkins and
talker right so similarly I've done it
here but plays a very simple command
where I've you know is with a simple
command I have executed a bash file but
what you need to understand is this is
how Jen gates can be used in the
industry right and this eliminates a lot
of problems there's a lot of scope for
automation and there's a lot of benefits
with this so yeah that pretty much
brings an end to my session here so I
can just wrap up my session by going
back to my slides here and guys do drop
in your questions I will take them in a
couple of minute in a couple of minutes
sorry and oh yeah these are the
that I covered so I spoke about the
software development challenges that are
there that used to exist with the
various models and then I spoke about
what is the role of a DevOps engineer
and how the devups
strategy what are the phases involved
over there and then I told you one of
the different Nawabs tools and the
different techniques to achieve
automation and then I finally spoke
about the demand for develops engineers
so so before I take up your questions I
want to just quickly show you this I
want to show you this survey form and
the link of this survey form is
something that you would find in the
comment box okay
and it's really essential and really
important you fill this form if you want
to avail exclusive discount on any in a
raker course okay and since you've been
in session for so long you're getting
this link so do take the small trouble
of filling up these details and yeah so
next time I know you're buying any
clothes from in Eureka you can be rest
assured that you're going to get a
voguing discount on the course so that
was that and then we have a YouTube
playlist filled with the number of
DevOps videos you can check them out you
can like them subscribe to these to the
to our channel and follow our videos
like our like them and share them you
can also check out our DevOps blogs okay
so we have a number of blogs you're on
each of the different tools on gate
puppet chef ansible on docker Jenkins
and you also have an interview questions
blog here so if any one of you are
interested and if you are aspirant to be
a DevOps engineer I would recommend you
to go through this blog here okay I'll
do that and finally you can check out
our DevOps course at this link so you
will find other details with of our
course with you know with respect to the
course details the pricing and all these
things over here all right so that's
that's the thing guys now let me just
see what kind of questions have been
asked so
yeah there's a question here that says
that clear on Jenkins but there are
multiple monitoring tools like
SolarWinds nas PRTG BMC etc so why are
we staking only to nail yours we are not
just sticking to Nagios nag yours is
actually my it's the most comfortable
tool it's actually my most comfortable
tool okay it's one of the best and you
can how you can implement the other
tools also so it's all up to you and
your requirements right
so all these may be good enough so it's
if you feel any if you feel if it's
important you can execute and you can
use them all right and okay okay I have
another question here which says when
will I conduct a live as your admin
class sure sri will have it very soon
thanks for your you know question so we
would I would send this feedback to my
team and we would have one very soon we
have another good instructor for that
and we'll make sure that that happens
and there's another question Jenkins
used for development now yours is used
for monitoring well SK the thing is
Jenkins is not used for development it's
used for integration so whatever you
develop Jenkins would help you integrate
that to your production server and if
there are any changes it would help you
integrate even those new changes to your
existing servers or to your existing
code
okay so Jenkins plays a middle manual
it's the broker which enables automation
and you're right with respect to Nagios
it does use for monitoring
okay so seems like there are no other
questions there very basic questions
which will of course be answered by my
team I think on this note I can end
today's session right yep so guys it's
been a pleasure it's been a pleasure
with you people thank you for attending
this session we will come up with more

pleasure to have you on board with us
