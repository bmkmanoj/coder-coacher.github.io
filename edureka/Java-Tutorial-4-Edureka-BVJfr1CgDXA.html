everyone present today my name is
Bennett and I'll be the instructor once
again so each and every one of you I'd
like to tell that in today's class will
be going through abstract classes will
be going through interface and will be
going through in amps okay these are the
major topics that we'll be covering in
today's class we'll be taking samples as
well as we did in all the other classes
so first of all what do you mean by
abstract what do you think abstract is
any one of you please write down on the
chat window your fancy is incomplete
okay it is one of the property of
abstraction that is incomplete size is
empty what else
Yogesh is derived from one class Aaron
says hiding exactly correct hiding that
means you do not provide a abstract
thing do not provide the detail okay you
do not get to know what is inside that
you just have an overview of that and
that is called abstraction that is that
are hiding whence is brief Messines is a
part hiding exactly correct for example
let's take a real world example like a
car you drive a car you know that the
car moves on four wheels it does it has
many things inside that but you do not
know the details how it works inside you
move the steering you know that they
stare if you move the steering the car
will go left or right whatever
indirection you are using but you do not
know how actually the car is moving to
the left side when you move your
steering to the left right so that is
abstraction you know the overview you do
not know the detail of that car right so
in Java also you can create classes like
that that as you provide the overview
the definition is not present for
example right here abstract class shape
you have got a class say shape that is
abstract class now you do not know in
that shape whether that shape is a
circle whether it is a rectangle or it
is a triangle you do not have that
detail right so you have abstract class
shape
which gives an overview that it is some
kind of shape now when you further
classify it it could be a rectangle it
could be a circle it could be a triangle
so in Java what you do you define
abstract class and you put some details
into that just the name okay finally you
can extend this shape like rectangle is
a shape so what you did class rectangle
extend shape class circle extend shape
and class triangle extend shape okay
like this you can have many other kinds
of shape like octagonal hexagonal
anything they all will come under this
category that is shape and you can
implement this you can extend this
abstract class into that particular
class moving on board is an abstract
class I have struct class that is
declared abstract is called an abstract
class okay a class we just preceded by
an abstract keyword whenever you define
abstract class you write abstract then
the name of the class hence that class
is termed as abstract class example is
abstract class demo so this class demo
is actually an abstract class because it
has been declared as abstract right here
using the abstract keyword it may or may
not use abstract methods what do you
mean by abstract methods first of all I
hope you are clear with what our methods
because we did it in the last class now
last two last class I guess now tell me
what is abstract methods I have told you
what is an abstract class can anyone of
you tell me what our abstract methods
one says only had a nobody okay that's
correct
myungsoo's methods which do not have
anybody exactly correct both of you had
fun and my egg that's correct
moving on now as you said what is an
abstract class a method that is declared
abstract first of all a method that is
declared without an implementation you
do not have the body you do not have the
definition of that particular method
present okay so that that method will be
termed as an abstract method which does
not have a implementation and you
actually mention it as an abstract
example is abstract void add int X and
int Y so you have got a method that is
add which is taking two parameters
integer X and DDJ oh boy
so ICSI beneath them leaving for job now
so countered in the class so will you
will go through the video later thanks
we'll miss the class okay that's fine
sign you can move forward but I guess
you'll be present in the next class
right he says yes will surely that's
good
okay now goes on abstract methods you
mention the abstract keyword you write
void add index identify so this is an
abstract method that you have declared
it would be present in an abstract class
the example right here public abstract
class shape okay I've implemented the
same example that we saw in the starting
you have got a class shape which is an
abstract class in that you have defined
abstract void area so there is a method
that is an abstract method since it is
mentioned as abstract and you do not
have the implementation of the method
right here so after that you close the
abstract class now you have a class that
is rectangle and the other class first
circle in rectangle you wanted to use
this class that is abstract you use
extend shade as soon as you extended
this class you can use this method that
is area now once you extend this class
you have got this method area within
that you can provide
the implementation like when if I have
to find the area of the rectangle you
are using length into width okay now
when you implement the same shape when
you extend the same abstract shape class
then in that in the area of method what
you are defining 3.14 into radius into
radius in case of circle the formula of
area is different so what is the benefit
of this abstract method it is that as
soon as you extend this abstract class
you can implement this method which
would be common for both rectangle and
circle but you're providing different
definitions within there okay so this
way you have got the structure there is
no detail present you have to overview
you have this structure and what you can
do whatever detail you need whatever
detail you require in your application
you can implement that e-tail using that
abstract method and the class so all of
you are you clear with this please write
down on the chat window what she'll say
yes marcin says yes Sadiq says here mine
says yes what about the rest of you you
gauge this yes Vijay says yes okay okay
then before moving to interface let's
see the example of an abstract class
okay I've got many folders opened up
okay I already prepared few codes for
you as I do all the time
so I have got a project that is ID rec
underscore abstract I have a package
within that I've got three classes down
his circle there is rectangle and the
third one is shape so first of all I
have this shape class in the shape class
what I have I have a method that is area
now that is abstract void area double
size this is taking a parameter that is
of double data type as well as you have
got a method that is void output okay
and it is printing abstract method after
that what you did you actually extended
this class that you declared a class
rectangle you extended this class with
the shape abstract class as soon as you
did it you implemented one methods
artists area double side within that you
use this side to find out the area of
the rectangle or in this case you can
say that would be a square I will
mention it as square okay so I mentioned
double a GI equal to side into side and
finally I print the statement third I've
got a circle class I have extended this
circle class with the shape class that
is EPSA again I implemented the area
this time I'm taking the radius it and I
am printing the area as 3.14 in to
radius into radius system dot out
println the area of the circle is area
now finally what I'll do I'll create one
new class that has made where I will be
using all these classes which will
include the main method and finish so
creating the object for first of all
rectangle class will be equals to new
rectangle semicolon OB dot area whatever
may be the size like 10.0 10.1 and a
semicolon similarly for the circle I
will create an object or here itself
I'll do it circle OB one equals to new
circle a semicolon
OB one dot area radiuses two point five
and I put a semicolon
okay so this where we implemented the
same area we can find out the area of
rectangle as well as circle so instead
of mentioning both these methods
separately or doing that what I did I
wanted a structure to use so I made an
abstract class in that I had as abstract
method that is area sorry this one that
is area using it I am extended this
class and rectangle and circle and I'm
using the area method in the main
function I run this code I receive the
area of the square is one zero two point
whatever and the area of the circle is
19.625 you can calculate in on your
calculator it will be exactly correct
right so are you guys clear with this
the abstract class how to extend it
Sadiq sir is this what is the difference
between inheritance and abstract class
inheritance is a concept okay it is a
noop concept by which you can extend a
class as fact means you are actually
having an abstract class you have got an
abstract method inheritance does not
tell you that you can you create an
abstract class or an abstract method
okay but abstraction is a different
concept of hoop and inheritance is a
different concept that is why first I
taught you what is inheritance then I
came to abstract because it will be
using the concept of inheritance in this
are you clear are they yes exactly it
will be using the concept of inheritance
but the difference is you are now
learning to create the thing here to
learn is not the extension that is you
extend the class the thing is to declare
an abstract method in it and you can use
that method now show you one more thing
Nichols's abstract method can only exist
in abstract class yes
first of all in abstract class or it can
exist in an interface okay it can be it
can be placed in two times so classes
one is the abstract class one is the
interface which is is this for
reusability exactly not exactly for
reusability but for
structure a detail okay as soon as
you're extending a class shape so there
will be certain attributes like area or
you need the lens you need the width so
what you can do you can implement the
method now the next question person who
is actually implementing a particular
kind of shape so he wants all those
things but he is not really aware of the
methods that should be used so what he
does he actually extends her abstract
class as soon as he does it he gets all
the methods he knows the name what has
to be implemented finally he can
implement it right which is a same could
be used differently so are you guys
clear why we are using an abstract class
he actually give it a frame right that
frame can be used anywhere a person who
is not aware of anything he can use just
that frame you will get that these
heading should be present in that
heading he'll write something on his own
okay so that is the function of an
abstract class I will show you one more
thing just come in this part okay now
can you see an error as soon as you
extend an abstract class okay shape is
an abstract class as soon as you extend
it it will show you an error on the
class if you take your mouse there
you'll find that type rectangle must
implement the inherited abstract method
shape dot area double so whatever
abstract methods are present within the
class has to be implemented it is
necessary okay so this is the used you
have implement that structure are you
clear with this similarly in the circle
if you just come in this line it will
show you an error you'll have to
implement the unimplemented method are
st abstract methods now no one asked me
a question that is can we have a well
defined method within the abstract class
now can you all tell me this answer
answer to this question can abstract
class can have a well defined method
okay Basile says yes' nicole' says I
think yes widget says no mine says yes
okay I come back to my abstract class
here can you see a well-defined method
that is void output system dot out dot
println abstract method right so this is
a well-defined method so your abstract
class can have both abstract methods as
well as well-defined methods but the
condition is as soon as you extend an
abstract class what happens you'll have
to implement all the abstract methods
but there is no condition with the
well-defined classes I can also use the
well-defined class Oh B dot output okay
I can use the method also but there is
not it is not necessary in the class in
which you have intended the abstract
class it is not necessary to implement
that method as well okay so all of you
give me a final yes if you are very
clear with the abstract class if you can
implement your own abstract class okay
that's good I receive all the esses
getting back to the presentation once
again I come to interface now how many
of you have an idea of an interface do
you know what an interface is myung says
yes what can you please write it down
which I says no Adak says middleware we
just define instance variable and method
without implementation that's correct
Nikhil
okay then before understanding I like to
ask few more few poll questions so I is
not here today but rest of you answer
this question that is abstract keyword
is used to declare an abstract class
true and false what do you think is the
answer it is quite easy all of you bit
quick and answer this question
okay we have the results everyone that
is 100% of the people say is true and
that's the correct answer I have one
more question an abstract class can have
abstract methods well defined methods
both none of the above
I guess everyone should answer it
correctly if you one go through it once
again that is abstract class can have
abstract methods well-defined methods
both or none of the above only 82% of
the people have voted I request everyone
to give your answers 20% of the people
says abstract methods and 80% of the
people says both and the correct answer
is both you can have both abstract
methods as well as well-defined methods
in your abstract classes okay I told you
just now so I expected a correct answer
from each and every one of you nevermind
we come to interface what is an
interface the interface are declared
using the interface keyword whenever you
see an interface keyword you should
understand us this is an interface
interface is kind of a middle layer you
can say that not like that but what you
can do you can consider it as a medium
through which you can use certain
methods which do not have a you can use
certain methods which do not have an
implementation right now you can ask me
what is the difference between an
interface and an abstract method and any
one of you tell me
okay we'll come to back to this question
once again
now we were on interface can contain
method signature that is simple abstract
methods without any implementation it
can contain constant declarations that
could be both static and final right
nickel says in a Strad class we can have
well-defined methods but not in
interface exactly correct in interface
you cannot contain you cannot place a
well-defined methods into that okay it
will contain only and only abstract
methods now let's see interface a class
that implements now there is a
difference even the keyword that is used
to use an interface is different that is
for using an interface you'll have to
use implements keyword so you've got an
interface that has got three abstract
methods right here now this is a class
it wants to use this interface so what
it does it implements this interface as
soon as all of you can you all hear my
voice everyone peace yoga sages my visa
Jess Nicholas saying no okay yogi says
no just a minute mine says repeat the
last thing you said okay just give me a
minute I'll send a chart to Nicola
saying that he cannot hear me Nikhil
everyone can hear be
nikhyl says okay now I can hear you
that's good - ACP once again okay I'll
do that I was saying there is an
interface now this interface has got
three abstract methods one two and three
there is a class this class wants to use
this interface so what it does it
implements this interface the keyword
that is used to use and interfaces
implements instead of writing extents
you'll be using implements and using
that you'll get all the three abstract
methods you can use all the three
abstract methods within your class you
can define them in the class right now
what is the advantage of an interface
can anyone tell me do you have any idea
what is the advantage of an interface
any one of you
okay now how many of you know that
multiple inheritance Nikhil says we can
create a template for every object max
is a kind of protocol to be followed by
the class
Karthik says no idea of a seal says it
is you used as multiple inheritance
Vasile that's a good answer pratik say
supports multiple inheritance exactly
now in Java Java does not support
multiple inheritance but you can attain
it by using an interface you can only
extend a class particular implement
multiple classes as mine gave me a poem
lost in the last class that is sky is
blue something like that you can extend
one but implement two that means it
could be two three anything you can
implement as many interfaces as you want
so this is one of the importance of
interface in Java so that you cannot
take multiple int inheritance okay myung
sends me a smiley so I hope you are
quite clear with this diagram right here
the motive was you should understand the
keyword that is used as well as you
should understand all the classes will
be used in the class all the methods and
interface will be used in the class
machine says yes clear moving on how to
create an interface in Java you
understood what is an interface you know
what did it does and how to use it in
the class using the implement keyword
but how to create an interface so you
write public interface demo underscore
interface you will have to use this
interface keyword to define an interface
you open up the places in the braces you
define your abstract methods in this the
condition is that you cannot have a
well-defined method in an interface you
can only have abstract methods it could
be as many methods as you want it could
be 3 for any number right so I have a
got a method that is int and integer
value one integer value to this method
will take two inputs and give a return
integer but you do not have the
definition in that you do not know what
this odd function is actually doing you
have got a print function that
takes an integer value you do not know
what this print function will actually
do okay so this will be a demo interface
you have got two methods within that so
this is the way this is the code by
using which you can define an interface
in Java now how to implement the
interface in a particular class you
define a class one you use the keyword
that is implements you write demo
interface as soon as you implement an
interface what happens it will again
show you an error that is unimplemented
methods so you will implement those
methods like add and print these both
were abstract method so it has to be
implemented in your class we just says
is this not necessary to put abstract
keyword before methods here yes can you
tell me why Vijay while defining methods
while declaring methods in an interface
it is not necessary to mention abstract
keyword can you tell me why Vijay then I
will tell you Aaron says abstract an
interface body is likely same format
exactly correct
well but there is a difference of routes
in the machine says what must a class do
to implement an interface that is what I
was about to tell you which uh says
because this is known by default exactly
correct Vijay this is known by default
because an interface can only contain
abstract methods it hence you do not
have to mention abstract before every
method that you declare within the
interface okay and that was a good
answer cane now
machine I'll come to your question that
is how to implement an interface in your
class so you write implements keyword
you write demo in terms core interface
that is the interface you created in the
last slide within that you have to
implement all those abstract methods
that were present in the interface like
ad was there and print was there he
provided the definition in the add
function like in sum equals to value one
plus value two and returns are anti rate
override what it will do public void
print in
some system dot out println the sermons
equals to some so you provided the
definition in class when you implemented
the interface as soon as you did it what
happens you have to implement all those
abstract methods that is present with
within an interface right and finally
you provide the definition to these
methods now I'll use these methods I'll
use this class using the object of this
class first of all understand this
diagram you have a class one now you
want to implement an interface this is
an interface that you want to implement
so what do you do you use the implements
method and used it in right here in
class one so you have got your methods
and you define them in this class now
we'll be using this class I make another
class that is execute I have my main
method in that in this main method what
I did I created an object of class one
plus one equal F equals new class one I
use int sum equals two OB dot add I am
calling that add function so it I will
pass to individual sin and then it will
give the sum and some will be saved here
finally I will call the print function
that is OB dot print and I pass some so
it will print the value okay so all of
you are you cleared allow if yes I'll
move on to eclipse then I will show you
the same example on a clip and I'll
execute it more scene says yes what
about the rest of few witnesses okay
mine says yes Loki says yes 4-cyl says
yes okay then yogi says okay I come to
eclipse once again I'll close all of
this I come to interface now so I have
got my demo interface public interface
demo underscore interface so first
method int add int value one in value to
second is void trained in some okay so
I've got two methods in that I come to
class one here I'm using game commence
keyword to implement the demo interface
if I've used a
stands it will give me an error right
extends sorry it gives me an error right
change extends to implement so I change
it and it is fine now finally yes Aaron
now finally as soon as you implement the
interface you have to implement all the
abstract methods this is the condition
whenever you implement an interface you
will have to use all the methods that
are present in the interface right all
the abstract methods has to be used in
this class so I will just comment it
first of all both of them I receive an
error ad unimplemented methods so it
will add these two methods once again
now this time I'll only comment one even
then it will give you an error I will
only come in the first one it gives me
an error ad unimplemented methods so it
only adds one this time because the
second one was already present so I hope
you are clear as soon as we implement a
method it will use the same thing just
uncomment it
control seven finally I come to the
execute clause in it I defined public
main class 100 be in some equals to OB
dot add I pass two numbers ten and ten
now no B print some run the code receive
the result as sum the sum is 1020 okay
so all of you are you clear delay
okay mine says yes so Aaron does that
answer your query okay
all the members of the interface are not
final okay if you mentioned them final
you cannot use it Curran says query yes
I have answered your query I guess does
that answer your query man sorry Aaron
Nichols's can a class which is
implementing an interface have its own
methods okay first of all I'll come to
our ins please once again okay he was
saying that is the members of interphase
final so what I'll do is just mentioned
final before that what do you see
receive an error right even in the
second one so that means that you cannot
they are not actually final if you
mentioned it as fine as you won't be
able to overwrite them you have got a
variable your variable could be final
your variable could be static are you
clear not on the variables that you will
be defining in an interface can be final
and Static will be final in static but
the methods are not final okay
now I come to Nichols query that is now
since it was static nickel there will be
only one copy right that is why and I
come to a previous query that is he was
asking can a class which is implementing
interface have its own methods so I come
to XQ sorry demo this is implementing
sorry class one this is implementing an
interface in this I come and I define a
very simple public void display so I
define a method this method is present
in class one okay so this is class one's
method so the a class can have a method
a class can have methods of its own even
if it implements an interface is your
question answered Nikhil
okay machine says when you declare a
method as abstract can other non
abstract methods access a for example
machine can you give me an example where
you want to do it like let's say you had
an absolute limited a method so
just try to show you maybe it won't work
for the valuable print right give me a
situation where I can show you when you
declare a method as abstract and other
non abstract you are talking about the
same class where you are declaring an
abstract method okay instead of this I
come to abstract class again I come to
shape in shape I have got an abstract
method okay and I'll mention area let's
say ten okay
machine does that answer your query now
can you tell me why it is actually
allowing me to take this use this method
right here since we have this method is
actually abstract even though it is
allowing me to use it can you tell me by
Massey and everyone of you if anyone
have the answer please write down on the
chat window why this class is actually
allowing me to use this method even
though this is abstract even though
there is no definition present anyone
okay I'll tell you it is because what is
happening whenever you implement the
abstract class sorry whenever you extend
this abstract class what will happen
this abstract method will get
implemented okay like you come here in
circle let's say you're in circle what
you are doing you extend this shape
class it will implement the area even
though you do not put any definition
within that but there are brackets
present right so you have got a
definition present always so even if you
pass then it won't print any result
because there is no definition present
right but most probably whenever you
will be using this abstract class by
extending it you'll be first defining
them abstract method and then if you
want to use an well defined method you
can do that in the program okay so that
is why it is allowing you to use
abstract method within other methods of
that abstract class so all of you are
you clear with this please write down on
the chat window
Marcin says yeah clear that's good since
we are smiley ok pratik says yes
business is okay okay then let's see do
we have to play anything you have have
record anything to play with interface
okay what I will do I will implement one
more interface okay since we do not have
much topics today let's go a little leap
I will go to interface I am creating one
more interface and this time let's name
it on my name Vinnie and finish they
have got one more interface that is
beneath you can define any number of
abstract methods into it let's define it
like void detail okay so I've got one
method I come to execute or I come to
class one it implements one method now
can anyone tell me if I have to
implement one more class one more and
interface then how will I do it what is
the syntax that is followed if I need to
implement one more thing comma-separated
mining says exactly correct
I've mentioned comma and then I write
beneath VI n EE T so this way you can
implement to class I have done it and I
have to implement ad unimplemented
methods so detail method comes right
here let's create one more thing let's
create a class or an abstract class
anything so right let's say class test
okay I have a class also not this we
come to class one we want to extend this
class as well so you write extends you
write test and it is fine right so you
can extend one class but you can
implement two right you can have as many
number of interfaces as you want right
here by using the commas the teks is
second interface name a comma and then
second interface name exactly correct so
you have seen that how to extend a class
and sign
jealously how you can implement multiple
interfaces in your class right so I hope
everyone is clear with this now please
write down on the chat window then I
will come back to the presentation once
again or you guys clear with it ready
chase yes Vijaya Nikhil sage yes machine
JJ's Mahesh machine says yes that's good
and I come to enemies in Java enums is
actually an abbreviation for enumeration
okay like there are constants constants
like Sunday till Monday in a vague you
have got seven days and everyone knows
it
so they will always remain the same like
Monday till Sunday so whenever you have
to use these kind of things in your
program what you can do once first thing
is you can insert it like manually
Sunday Monday Tuesday you can use them
like that but there is a lot of chances
in that like you get an error and it is
also not optimized for that what you can
do you can use enemies in Java
other examples could be the names of the
planets okay let's say the role numbers
are in a class you have roll numbers
only from 1 to 10 so you can have for
that let's see the example right here
enumeration enumerations helps to relate
the variable with related constants so
that it will be flexible to work like
Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Friday Saturday to represent we use nm
keyword whenever you will be using it
whenever you will defining an
enumeration you will be using this nm
keyword it can be used in a drop-down
boxes now there is a drop-down there you
have to select these names one one thing
what you can do you can use it by a
Sunday Monday Wednesday anything like
that mention it in the drop-down list or
what you can do you can define enemies
and you can pass enemies into that
okay now why we need to use anonym this
is one important question enim is type
safe that is any constants cannot be
assigned to that variable outside the NM
definition if for Monday yes machine
that's the correct implementation if for
Monday you are assigning that it should
be one so like that you can declare thee
you can provide the constant values to
it but you state would be too Wednesday
3:00 Thursday for so outside that what
you can do you cannot assign any more
values to it so it is type safe adding
new constants will be easy with without
sorry it's not with it's without
disturbing already present code whenever
you have to add at once you see the
implementation of our enemy you'll find
that you can easily add any number of
constants to that particular and I am
without actually disturbing the entire
code so this is one more advantage that
anims provide finally I come to you can
assign different constants to variables
other than default values right let's
see how to declare an enum declaring an
anima is quite similar to a class the
way you declare a class similarly you
declare an Ana should be declared
outside the class in which it has to be
used or in an interface okay to be
declared in an interface or outside the
class in which it has to be used you can
make entire enum different class okay
now you write enemy you mention mention
the name of TN of like colors this time
you have to make an enum these are the
five default colors that you have so you
wanted to make an enemy you use the
keyword ennum after that you mentioned
the name of the enemy that is colors
variables which we will be assigned
constant values like red within the
curly braces what you do you mentioned
red green blue white yellow now all
these variables will be assigned a
default value from 0 till food these are
default constant values you can also
assign your user-defined values right
here there was the third statement
orders you can also
different constants together fills other
than the default values okay he'll get
to know in the next slide right now as
soon as you mention the variables within
the enim they get the default values
like 0 1 2 3 4 like this so all of you
are you clear deal here please write
down on the chat window if you are
machine says yes you are already clear
machine or scene says yes the gauge man
says yes ok good now simple program for
an enum enum you mentioned the Menem
name in the brackets what you do red
green blue white yellow as it was given
you can define it outside your class you
come to the class main within that way
you have got your main methods now you
want to use these this announcer what
you did you mentioned you made an object
right colors underscore random color
array you mentioned an array because all
those values will come directly to this
array right colors array colors and the
score random dot value so all those
values that are present within the
colors nm will get saved in this array
of colors which is of type colors
underscore ennum finally you run a for
each loop lattice for colors NMC you
pass this colors array and using that
you are printing all those values that
are present in annum so you get red
green blue white yellow okay so all the
values are right printed over here so
all of you are you clear with this
please write down on the chat window if
yes I will implement the same program on
Eclipse itself foil new Java project ok
I receive all the SS that's good Java
underscore enum finish
this is our project right-click new
allow dhyanam to it
and i'm name is colors so I've got one
annum a lot one more class new class
I'll add the main method to it let's say
main itself and finish instead of making
a different that for I can also use it
right here
now in that undefined the colors red
yellow green
I guess this much is enough now after
the rural do I come here
all right colors equals to I could have
used the given this and even this okay
you can define it anywhere so colors OB
sorry OB colors dot values now I'll run
the for each loop colors colors anything
colors to it could be anything and you
come with OB right I'll simply print
system dot out dot println in that
alphas colors - now all if you please
tell me if I run this code what will be
the result I would receive everyone
please write down on the chart window
it's been long that I have asked you a
question like this for run this code
what will be the result that I want to
see my ANSI screen Vasile says red
yellow green with a says red yellow
green
maybe stays red yellow green how they
say is red yellow green around this
control ctrl f11 I received the same
result that is red yellow and green okay
so this way we can use it like or you
have to use it directly like this so
what you can do OB dot
like system dot out dot println OB dot
okay that is colors dot sorry you can
use directly like this that is colors
green colors dot red colors yellow and
pray it will print the values right so
this is one other way if you have to use
it individually and you have to use it
collectively what you can do you can
simply make an array and you can run it
or else if without making array if you
want to what you can do you can just cut
this part instead of making a different
array pass this okay and remove this
line it will also do the same thing
control f11 and I receive the same
result once again that is red yellow
green so all of you are you clear with
this example the simple example for Ã±
anam please write down on the chat
window mine says yes
Karthik says yeah machine says yes yoga
stages fossils easiest location with
your Anthropy that's good moving on
another example for an enum enum you
have got chocolates there are three
kinds of choc share their email cat cat
munch Dairy Milk is 4/20 you pass a
value constant 20 okay last time they
were getting the default constants at is
0-1 Nikhil says how it is different from
array you are talking about
nm
okay in anonym in an array okay like
what I did that is why I showed you you
can also use it like this that is color
start you can use the options show you
the chances of errors or less you cannot
write the array and write like this
you'll have to pass the index in a in an
array then only you'll be able to use it
I can directly use it like this okay I
have to print it by system dot out print
ellen sorry
within that i'll place colors red
okay so this way you can use it Arun
says array has got indexing from zero
exactly correct our own so Nicola have
you got the point like this you can use
it you can use directly the name by
using this just have to you'll get all
those options in your program where it
says is it possible to select any random
color random color if you're saying like
this you can ill have to make a logic
okay in this color sanam all the colors
are present if you want to select it
randomly just to make a small logic and
you can do that by wish okay but if you
are mentioning it mentioning it red then
it will obviously bring you red okay so
I hope I am clear now now I come to
Dairy Milk I've got another atom in
which I have got dairy milk I'm
assigning a constant user value that is
20 a bucket card with 10 value munch
with 5 ain't cause chocolates in cost I
pass it this dot cost equal because now
I'm assigning this cost value a value
the constant that would be assigned with
this horrible now public main public
static void main I've got this in the
main method I define favorite choco
chocolate Daily Mail okay so I am
assigning Listeria milk to this I've
made a switch case every does their
email favorite choco it will print this
or gate card printers or munch printers
like this I can use an enemy now in my
program okay
a predecessor please explain random
concept also
okay let's get to the example for this
ennum second one
that is months months in this after
January with value one fair with two
three four five six seven I've got a
private number odd is indeed a value
that is num in this I pass in the
constructor what I do instruct int num
just got normal to num so it will assign
the value like if your January is called
located is passed then it will assign
the value 1 to num if it is Feb it will
assign to if it is March it will assign
3 and so on okay
now I've got another method that has get
numb so that I can fetch the number as
well the constant so I defined a method
that is nth can't lump it will just
return the value of now if I come to ear
in the ear class I have got my main
method in the main method I run a for
loop once again for months menu item and
I pass month start values it will pass
all the values to it one by one I print
this line that is first of all a next
line character newline character here I
am passing menu item dot get numb I will
get the value first of all for the first
value I get the number and it will print
one next time it gets like this it gives
me one more space and I print menu item
dot name so all of you if I print this
if I run this code what will what will
be the result that I were to see please
write down on the chart window everyone
what do you think will be the result if
I run this code I will just show you
there nom see a TARDIS first I'm
trending the number then a space and
then a number sorry the name of the
number I'm using is not name dot name is
already present you can directly use it
that is many item dot name will easily
find it right here gate number is the
defined method that has been defined in
months and um okay exactly correct Vijay
that's a good answer
I'll just run this code and you see one
dot Jan first I print in our
I come to your nd number right here and
I put dot after that and then I print
the name that is Chan then I print the
again number again then Feb 3 March 4
April 5th May 6 June and 7 July so this
way I'm using both the constant that I
have assigned to the nm values as well
as I'm using the name of the nm so all
of you are you clear with this please
write down on the chat window every one
of you with this ACS clear for she'll
say yes what about the rest you guys not
clear with that mine says clear 14 days
yes
pratik says all care that's good
okay then let's come back to the
presentation let's see if I have got any
questions for all of you okay first
question is an interface can have only
abstract methods only well-defined
methods both or none of the above please
write down on please click on the
polling screen only 50% have voted I'm
talking about an interface not an
abstract class
Haidee person have voted now ok 75% of
the people say is only abstract method
study inverse and says only well-defined
methods and 13% says both and the
correct answer is the first one that is
only abstract methods can be present in
an interface ok all of you remember this
move on to the second question
plus a ok class a inherits class B now
class a has to inherit an interface then
which keyword will be used will it be
extends will it be implements will it
both can be used or none of the above
all of you give you answer only 10% of
the people have voted I request everyone
to answer it
okay 38% of the people says okay 33
person people say is extends 56 says
implements and 11 says both can be used
and the correct answer is second one
that is implements whenever you have to
use an interface what do you have to do
you have to use implements keyword you
cannot use extends keyword to you in to
use an interface right so just remember
this once again guys even after telling
you so times you are actually giving me
the wrong answer
Wang says a has already inherited V okay
Class A inheritance feed now a has to
inherit an interface
he is exactly male question was class a
inherits class B now class a has to
inherit an interface there is an
interface which class a has to inherit
now it has already extended B but it has
to inherit one more class so one more
interface how to inherit an interface
you have to use the implements keyword
okay okay one more question when an
class implements and interface then all
the methods in the interface has to be
implemented in the class do you find it
true or false everyone give me a quick
answer is this true or false
got the results 88% of the people say is
true and 13% say is false
okay that's good okay now we'll have two
questions okay I'll be showing you two
questions and you guys will be solving
those questions but before that we'll
take a very short break of five minutes
okay is everyone fine with that please
write down on the chat window
maybe says yes thank you was he'll say
yes mine says yes mercy in pratik says
yes that's very good
so have a very short break of five
minutes and then we'll join back and
this time we'll be solving few questions
right I'll show you the question you
have to solve them and give me the
answer okay so we are off for break for
five minutes
you
you
you
you
so is everyone back all of you break
time over please write down on the chat
window if everyone is here now
okay maybe stays yes that's good so one
my little poll question and then we'll
have buying system okay one final poll
question on enhance and then we'll have
two questions okay the subjective type
first Philon semi-public
and i'm sued clubs diamonds hearts
spades then the statement that is used
to use club says suit club suit - -
clubs suit parentheses clubs or none of
the above you just have to click on the
bowling screen and cast your answers
every one of you request everyone to
give your answers I guess few people are
still not present honest nickel pratik
which a nickel says I'm here that's good
pratik says yes I am okay 80 percent of
the people say suits dodd clubs and
dirty person says suit clubs that is
parenthesis clubs and the correct answer
is the first one that is shoe suit
thought clubs okay then
so all if you can see the question right
here right now you have the code you
have to give me the output right just
tell me the output what would be the
output on the screen I've got five
minutes further just five minutes guys
hurry up and go through the code let me
know what will be the result you've got
a clue
that is ready Rekha of cornea Bane
methods within that then you define a
boolean variable which is set to true
you define an integer variable X equals
to 3 for 3 you have got another integer
variable in which you write new ad Rekha
you call the function that is go test
you pass the boolean variable and the
integer variable now some value will be
returned from deco method that would be
assigned to Y and finally you will be
printing that value so tell me what
value would be returned what would be
the value of y
come on guys quick quick okay nickels
give me a nickel gives me an answer so
nickel did you just write down the code
on your Eclipse and run it no okay
that's good then
about the rest of you all of you please
give you answers on the chat window okay
he says I read that deviation and
calculator
I'm still waiting for the answers from
rest of you everyone seems that they are
actually writing the entire code on
eclipse and then trying to give me the
answer
okay Nikhil can you just give me a
little explanation why it is so the
answer that you gave you're supported by
an explanation machine gives me an
answer now I need everyone to give me an
explanation with the answer okay you're
telling giving me an answer everyone but
give me an explanation as well with that
okay why is it returning this value why
so a short line you can explain it in
two lines nickel and every one of you
more seen you as well and the rest of
you I still haven't received an answer
from you from your end it is quite
simple question just have to understand
the basics and I'm sure Nikhil you have
the answer just give wrote write it down
in the in a form of a sentence my wish
Mayank
okay yes ma'am
why this why not the other one okay my
wish gives me an answer why do you think
my wish this is the answer because I'll
be also giving you the reason why this
answer is coming right okay Vidya gives
me to answer no Vijay only one answer
will will be coming not two then says
because of the parameter we have used
yes marriage starts correct
good yes maybe she has given me a reason
as well with the answer exactly correct
okay then no answer from location there
are many other people yes Vijay that's
the correct answer
okay let's go to eclipse
I have implemented this code already I
will just show you
okay you have
a class and Arica the same code explain
it line by line first thing what you do
declare a variable boolean valuable and
you sign the value as true which it says
a command says test X we'll take the
values of X as three for three and it's
off overridden by hint go as called to
the method is go through to go three and
the B is true execute return one by
exactly correct nickel that's good very
good as I say is for an after the
controller's passed to the calling
statement okay we define a boolean
variable right here we set it to true
you have an integer valuable X which is
initialized to three for three and
finally we have any teacher value Y in
which we create enough new at Eureka and
we call the Co here we are actually
trying to create an object okay using
the object we are using the method that
does go so go we passed the boolean
variable first and then the integer here
it comes it checks the boolean value
it receives the boolean value and saves
it to the variable B and saves the value
of x2 I now here you are first checking
whether the value is true or not if the
value is true it will come here it will
return a value that is 3 for 3 by 7 it
will get out of this method and it will
assign that value to Y and it will print
Y if the value is false then it will
come to this return statement it will
return the value to here and it will be
assigned to by and printed in this case
the value will be returned as 49 ok as
you can see for 9 because the condition
was true it comes here returns I less
than 7 and it passes right here okay
that is 3 for 3 by 7 is 49 49 is
assigned to Y on it it prints Y if I
change it to false now I change this
value to false I run this code once
again I receive 7 why because the
condition in F was false this time it
did not execute this statement it
directly came here
and executed this return statement this
is how seven was assigned to why and it
printed by so all of you are you clear
with this each and every one of you
please write down on the chat window yes
my entry 14 three by forty nine gives
you seven value buying CCS machine says
yes that's good okay then let's move on
to the second question right which is is
okay now this is your second question
guys go through carefully okay see what
is written and then on give me the
answer to this everyone you've taught a
class this is some things that are extra
from this today's topics that we covered
but they are really interesting you've
got a class that is at Eureka you've got
a main method you have got a double
value D you have assigned this value now
you have got three system out dot print
F statements you have got some things
like this now which code fragment
inserted at line fold that means right
here this is the fourth line one two
three and this would be the fourth line
okay which of the three statements
produces the output this one see the
output carefully and now give me the
answer to this question each and every
one of you think you've got five minutes
if you do not observe it carefully the
output that you have to receive you
won't be able to give me the correct
answer okay
has already given me an answer Mayank
has given me an answer
okay yes that's good
can you tell me can you explain that
thing Marcin gives me an answer all of
you the answer and the explanation with
that everyone this is the rule why do
you think it is that won't give you the
result okay man that's correct what else
what about the first part
nicolai guess there is a problem with
your third answer just have a look once
again okay my
it also gives me an answer marish where
is the explanation why do you think it
is correct
aha Nikhil first time you were right
okay
just it was a small mistake a small
silly mistake was there second time you
actually inverted the entire thing it is
wrong okay that's correct my wish what
about the first part you have told me
the later story but what about the prior
story the first one okay guys they find
it interesting first of all tell me then
I will come to the code and I will
explain it most of you have given me the
correct answer okay define these
questions interesting I am sure everyone
is actually implementing it on Eclipse
exactly correct man that's a correct
answer absolutely you're right
so I've received one correct absolute
correct answer from my UNK none of you
have given me the exact correct answer
the correct explanation answer you have
given me right but you haven't given me
the explanation right okay so answer me
I just want to see whether you are there
or not do you find these questions
interesting a lot if yes then I'll come
to eclipse and I'll show you the
solution I'll explain it
machine says yes' nicole' says yes
member states we have huge double and
two precision is 7 damn good question
Wang says nothing seriously this is okay
that means you guys are here itself I
come to my second question to answer
okay very small implementation I'll just
simply run the code these three will
give me the result first one means that
total of seven digits will be present so
twelve point three four five okay it is
showing seven digits have been printed
after that decimal now if you write
three point seven what happens
one two three four five five six seven
that is after decimal there will be
seven digits and including the dot they
will be three when he come to seven
point three seven actually means here it
is the seven count total and you have
got three four three I'll just comment
the other two right now
the trick was you have to also count
this space right here okay so that was
the answer third one we'll make few more
changes in here again says mean this
time I'll make it six okay let's make it
since I save it around the code I
received twelve point three four five
there is no space present
so as a total 1 2 . is 3 and then 3 4 5
right so you received 6 similarly what I
do I'll make it 8 this time I will
receive 2 spaces
I'll run the code 1 2 and then 1 2 3 4 5
so all of you are you clear with this
now he is right down on the chat window
every one of you machine says yes Mary
says yes with essays myungsoo's yes
that's good
ok then getting back to the presentation
ok this was the final thing so all of
you please tell me please write down on
the chat window by year all clear with
the topics that were taken up today
these were quite interesting quite
simple as well as the important ok
topics that were taken today but they
were small topics right so what they
clear now ok Loki is cleared now what
about the rest of you never says yes and
a smiley guy send me Smiley's I like
laughing faces
Oh scenes cleared videos ok predicts is
cleared
ok sends me a smiley very good minds you
super close thank you ok as I've already
said I have already said that I'll be I
have posted the assignments previously I
forgot to post it later assignments I'll
do it by today ok most probably I'll be
posting the assignments for class for
today's class itself right and guys I
request everyone of you to submit your
solutions on to the community submit
your questions those who are doing it
very good those who are not I asked them
I request them to do it right and
helping each other would be the best
thing that you would be doing like I
guess my god said someone I gave someone
a question gave someone an answer right
he just gave it a post try to post some
tough questions too
ok Mac I'll do it for you
this time you'll have a tough question
on community okay and my so this way
helping each other even I will be
helping you guys I'll be there I'll be
trying to answer all your questions and
queries and helping you out so first of
all initiative has to be taken from your
and then only I will be able to help you
okay
so as always don't forget to fill in the
survey give your comments give your
suggestions so that I can improve myself
and provide you a better class in the
future Nicolay is my internet connection
was lost my accessor learning advanced
java will will be good on learning
android Mayan both are good right one
way is learning advanced Java that means
you are going forward in Java right now
for me I like Android even I'm I have
been working in Android and I love it
even my wish was present in the class
she has already done the Android course
and she has already made an application
of own it was something like yellow
pages it provides all the important
places provide details for all the
important issues that are present in
cache meet the name of the application
was style cache me thank you my wish for
helping me out
okay it was dial Kashmir so Android is
quite interesting and one of the latest
technologies right today so - thanks sir
he has already understood my thought so
that's good
okay so we'll be meeting next Tuesday's
the same time that is for p.m.
requesters everyone register for the
class as soon as possible I'll be
posting the class details on this Sunday
or latest by Monday okay it will be
present on Facebook events I'll add both
the classes for the next week register
for both the classes will approve you
and then you'll receive the confirmation
link if you do it late what happens we
have we do not improve you at the end
okay like in morning there was our own
our own was strict Aaron was actually
chatting to me on Facebook he told me
that please provide me the link
he was very late while registering right
so it becomes very difficult for me to
actually approving you at the end
movement right so guys it's a very
humble request please register one day
prior to the class okay then all of you
bye bye take care thank you all for
being here today once again and let's
we'll be seeing you the next week
