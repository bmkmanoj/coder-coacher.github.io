did a traditional waterfall model fail
okay so as we all know in traditional
waterfall model we cannot move to
another phase till the first phase has
been complete
so in the process in a way if we are
working on the requirements till all the
requirement documents have been
requirement has been analyzed everything
has been done documents have been
created the sign-off has been given by
the client we will not move to design
phase so after all the design has been
implemented and everything has been done
it is only then that we moved to the
coding phase so in a way the output of
one phase becomes a input to the another
phase right and in the process or in the
process if there is something which
changes right and if the client realizes
oh I was not wanting the UI to look that
way if I have to go and change something
I would have to go and change all the
phases right which is again a very
time-consuming obviously if I'm working
on a requirement gatherings in one go it
would take months for me or probably a
few few weeks for me to compete to
understand the complete requirement
could come out with a well documented
SRS document so I'll have to redo all
those weeks again okay
so the cost of change so there are
change so in the way we are not able to
change it we are a little rigid towards
the change while in agile methodology
what we do we work or in very small
chunks we are not working in a big bang
way look here I'll take an example for
example if I want to create a login
screen in my traditional agile waterfall
model what I will do is I create a login
screen I would have had some
requirements and some kind of an idea or
a UI idea from our client and based on
that requirement I will create a login
screen and then probably I'll show it to
the clients so here I'm assuming my
login screen creation of a login screen
was just an example
was just the requirement right so but in
agile when I'll have so
I have to create a login screen so what
I will do I'll probably pick up just the
UI part of it in a first phase okay so
I'll talk to client I will have a client
collaboratively working with me I create
a UI I'll go back to client once I'm
done with the UI the testing would be
done in parallel everything would be
done in parallel I'll go back took my
client after of probably a week or just
creation of a UI and ask him if he is
okay or if he wants to go ahead with the
same UI so now in the now at this point
if client would realize oh this is not
the way I wanted my UI to look and if he
asks us to change something it would be
just toward probably one week of effort
had I'd given him the complete he login
screen with the all the field level
validations working and landing page
coming up back-end processing happening
for me it would have been a huge effort
but here in this we are working in small
pieces we are involving client at every
stage we are giving him their demo it's
not that the client is involved at
almost daily level ok so this is how
agile came into picture and then what if
a more adult phase this is not that what
a file model is of no use but what a
full model can be used from the projects
which are like a very small in nature
which are very small in nature all
probably client is 100% sure about the
requirement this is what he needs and
this is what he needs but the project
has to be pretty small for it to work it
should not be that project last four
years and by the time it comes out the
technology and the method or probably
what we need it has completely changed
does it make sense
any questions okay and one of the major
difference which I would want to point
out if you look at my slide the second
point says the leadership is more
bonding and controlling right in agile
where we say the leadership the project
manager though there is no term called
project manager in agile but then he
we're servant leader we don't believe
that as a manager I should get command
and control my team and get my work done
while in agile my eyes say my team
should be self-sufficient they should
have the feeling of the ownership and
they should be self manageable I should
not be the one as a manager or as a
senior probably I would not be the one
who would go and tell my team what to do
they would understand the things on
their own they would be self-organizing
and they would pick up this thing as its
own so as I'm just we are called the
leadership role there is called a
servant leader the command and control
doesn't work in EJ okay so just for the
heck of reading this I'll just go
through it and if you have any doubts
you can just pop up your questions so it
says the traditional waterfall model is
more rigid and it was always top-down
approach as we talked about it it's more
commanding and controlling style of
leadership
it follows poon feeding methodology that
is management tells everyone what has to
be done the teams are not
self-organizing teams need a guidance
what needs to be won and what mixed it's
a document oriented so one of the
biggest myth that we have in agile is
there is no documentation involved known
there is a documentation involved but
then we document it in a crisp and
shortest form which which is needed so
for example I don't go and create a
software requirement document software
SRS document right so how many of you if
you any of you if you have worked in
your waterfall a traditional model how
many of you in the middle of project
just went back and read their
requirement document in my experience
most of the time as a testing teams we
never just even went back and read the
strategy document so the way we had I
mean 50 40 bill documents describing
what would be the cross-platform
approach I mean cross-browser testing
none of us ever went and most of the
time we ended up missing one or another
requirement
right but in agile we do have documents
but there is in such a crisp and short
form or maybe they would be just a
simple sticky note saying okay test
cross-platform the heading would be
cross-platform and the browser memes
that's it that's it and it would be it
would be displayed in a common area
where everyone can be see where everyone
can see those it would not be hidden
somewhere in your version control
systems and you would not that you have
to spend some time it would be somewhere
on the common wall or on the probably a
whiteboard where every team member can
see and on the process they just
memorize it so there's documents are
there but they are short and simple
so here cushion has a question that if
teams are self manageable who will
prioritize the user stories among many
user stories in the scrum meetings it's
the product owner Bhushan
so we will talk about it it's product
owner is the one who is the intermediary
between the development of sorry they're
not development the Teebs and the
stakeholders so he is the one who acts
as a gate for the requirements he
prioritize everything and decided what
would go in one iteration okay so we
will talk about it okay so resistant to
changes no in as we said that agile in
implements changes so as I in the
example I mentioned so if there is a
change in the UI in a traditional
waterfall model I would have resisted it
because for me it would have been a
month long effort but for in agile I
would embarrass embrace change and I
would say okay it's just a few weeks of
effort or possibly a week of ever a few
days of effort okay we will go ahead and
change your requirements since we are
not working in a Big Bang way okay it's
more serious about process and not the
product so so yes so this is one of the
thing that we as Pratap even mentioned
the visual the visibility of the product
that is being developed comes at a very
early stage
in that similar example that we were
talking a client could see a UI and a
product in a very short span of time
otherwise in traditional model it will
he would have kept gauging or what what
he would get in after three weeks of
probably four weeks or probably six six
months of time but here in agile
whatever was being done he had the
visibility of that right he puts Jessie
oh you I was done he could see that how
things were progressing because he was
part of daily meetings and he was part
of he was interacting with his team
daily okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
