is Jay Kumar I'll be your host for today
and we will look at some of the design
patterns discuss it this first couple of
them understand why design patterns and
what I loves like it to be a little bit
interactive so any point in time you
have any questions or comments to make
please use your chat window or send
select send questions and you know just
press enter and we should have questions
here I'll try to answer the question if
they are in the in the flow of
discussion if not in the flow of
discussion then we will definitely be
answering it by the end of the session
so what do we want to really look at
today what is what is our objective you
want to know what really software design
patterns are we'll see why do we need it
and we look at a few design patterns in
the behavioral style of design patterns
but before I goes and you know talk a
lot about the objective I think I owe
you an introduction you should know who
is it talking right as I said I'm Jake
amar I am an Enterprise Architect if you
care to know about years of experiences
over 11 years entirely into design and
architecture stuff I've done lot of
application development still hands on
do lot of coding as needed have many
build systems enhanced it maintain it so
know how systems work in production have
even scrapped some other systems because
they just became become unmentionable at
heart I am a solution provider like
complex problems and therefore I'm
always interested in some of the
patterns that we see and therefore I am
here talking to you with a topic of
design patterns so with that
description let me get going with the
objectives I hope you're clear with the
objectives and then we'll talk a little
bit about software design patterns first
we will see what is a pattern right a
pattern is some way of repetitive let me
ask you a question I have at least one
participant and the participant
reporting that my voice is not clear can
somebody else please confirm am i
audible enough just want to be sure that
you guys are able to understand what we
are going to discuss today okay I have
multiple confirmation that my voice is
clear might be a problem with the
recipient we will make the recording
available in case you know if you are
interested in an and miss something so
let's come back a pattern right a
pattern is something which is a
recurring a pattern is when you walk out
of your office or your home you see that
all the all the cars have four wheels
and not five wheels or three wheels or
you know six or eight wheels car has
four wheels that's a pattern right and
then these patterns because they are
repeatable they are observable and then
when these patterns are solving certain
problems they are really the solution
patterns if the solution is in terms of
some design that can be repeated it is a
design pattern now since a design
pattern is a repeated repeated solution
obviously it must be solving some sort
of repeated problem and therefore the
definition of a design pattern will
become that it is a repeated problem or
recurring problem to a recurring or it
is a recurring solution to a recurring
problem that's what the design pattern
is
by the very definition of the pattern
because it is observable we should also
appreciate the fact that these patterns
are discovered and never invented right
people sit and observe many many systems
to see how a particular problem across
these systems could have been solved
what is the solution that is the most
optimal and that becomes pattern and
therefore you will see that these
patterns do not evolve every other day
these patterns are these patterns evolve
over the period of time right the
pioneer people doing this kind of work
were Gang of Four and for those of us
who are into some sort of design this is
a Bible right the original book as we
call it they are if I'm not mistaken
they catalogued 23 design patterns you
can always read that book and it is a
fantastic book to read I however it may
not be a book for mere mortals it but it
is a book that puts in constrains and
forces and gives a solution in a
particular way it's kind of a pretty old
book if you ask me still prevalent but
we'll give you some snippet in
pseudocode or c style code as I said
Bible it is the original book they are
the first guys who came up and
catalogued the existing patterns the
design pattern or space has evolved from
what it was there are new patterns that
we keep discovering some of them very
powerful some of them are not so
powerful maybe a variation of the base
pattern and other stuff so that spaces
really can become complicated if you
start reading the scientific journals
and therefore it might help if we come
and discuss some of the patterns
together as a team and ask questions and
you know learn from each other's
experiences
so that was about design patterns then
at a broad level and remember we are
gonna restrict it to a design pattern at
an application level there are there are
four categories that we generally go
with now many of the existing literature
will want you to categorize into three
categories uh namely creational
structural and behavioral however we
also have another category of some
concurrency design patterns these are
something to do with how do you solve
some of the inherent problems of
parallelism when you are trying to do
some sort of threading right some sort
of parallel execution in your code and
then underneath each of these categories
there are many different patterns and
you know in general we go in depth with
all today we will be going with the
behavioral category but let's briefly
talk about what each of the pattern will
really mean a creational category of a
design pattern is generally something to
do with how do I create an instance of a
class like if you are any convergent
with some of the languages like Java or
C sharp at a very very primitive level I
will say that creational design pattern
will say how do I eliminate the use of
new keyword it is a definite advantage
by eliminating a new keyword at the
layman term but at a technical term by
eliminating and responsibility of
creating an instance of a particular
type class has an advantage to client
the client does not need to know or the
client code does not need to know any
complexities around how do I get an
instance the client only needs to focus
on how do I make use of this instance
perhaps via an interface it also allows
you to replace underlying structures if
they need be and therefore their
patterns like object pool and
Factory and singleton and abstract
Factory and so on and so forth
maybe prototype a structural category
we'll take it a different approach well
we looked at how do I convert or you
know get the object created but it is
seldom that a single class will be able
to solve a problem and therefore
structural design pattern will combine
multiple classes together to solve a
specific problem in structural category
these glasses know about each other at
the design time in fact when you code it
the the the types will be some of the
adapter pattern or a decorator pattern
or a composite pattern a flyweight
pattern so on and so forth yet another
category is a behavioral category
wherein well we looked at how do I
create an instance how are these classes
related to each other in the behavioral
category we'll look at how these classes
talk to each other you know what is the
communication path and then we say some
of the problems could be solved by
changing the way objects interact or
communicate with each other and that's
where we have some of the design
patterns such as chain of responsibility
or mediator or observer so on and so
forth and yet other category which kind
of well relatively new to the to the
world of design patterns and I'm saying
only relatively okay is a concurrency
design pattern wherein we say okay given
I am designing a parallel processing
system and application how do I solve
some of the inherent problem related to
thread locking deadlock LifeLock how do
i improve my system throughput the
performance of the system in that we
will be looking at some of the reactor
pattern the scheduler part and thread
pool third specific story
a leader follower and so on and so forth
okay there is a question coming in from
Rakesh under which category do Android
patterns or OTP generation password
comes in well when you are a designer
are there nothing specific to a
particular programming language so
Android pattern should be no different
than any of these ones however we do
sometimes confuse between a paradigm and
a design pattern a paradigm makes use of
specifics of a particular technology to
implement a solution a single dot
pattern for example is between a
paradigm or a more specifically an ID on
an idea than a design pattern it can be
implemented only in spur ticular
particular programming language not
every language will be able to support
it so a repeated solution specific to a
particular language becomes idea and not
really a design pattern okay
OTP password generation will have
various perhaps algorithms and not
really a pattern or you know a design
pattern per se many strategies in fact
there are strategy patterns that you can
use wherein you can change the
algorithms okay now there are some
participants who have raised hand would
like to know if there is any specific
question in which case you can send a
question or you know kind of unlace your
hand another question which is different
but since I am going to make a
transition from this this particular
screen I'll answer Manas is asking what
is a child
well agile is a software development
process and it's not anything to do with
a software design pattern now we have
talked about a little bit about design
patterns what they are let me try and
emphasize why design patterns are
important to us
well we can all be good programmers we
can write a very cryptic program which
will allow us to you know kind of
showcase how good a programmer I am but
that skill has a limitation that it can
only solve certain localized problem and
perhaps not be sufficient unless you tie
it up with a good designing skills to
become a production grade application if
you are good at programming it just
means that you know all the internals
and workings of a particular programming
language does not necessarily translate
into you being able to develop a good
application in order to develop a good
application the application needs to be
simple for a complex problem and not the
other way around and should be
maintainable and should be
understandable or be understood by your
fellow colleague and likely the teams
who are gonna maintain it for the
lifetime of the software in general the
software will have a lifetime of perhaps
10 to 20% of the development time and
perhaps 90 to 80 percent of the
maintenance lifetime that's the entire
life time of software right the age of
the software so it is likely that the
software or an application is going to
spend more time into the maintenance
phase than in the construction phase and
therefore it is important that the folks
were gonna maintain the software know
about the software and just programming
skills are not gonna be sufficient for
that and that is we're designing aspect
comes into play and that is where the
design patterns come into play
wouldn't it be nice for you to go and
look at the code and quickly deduce that
well it is a factory pattern and I no
need to know every nitty-gritty every
variable and every method the moment I
know it is a factory part and I kind of
know how it will be working so if I am
to support certain things maybe fik
fixed defects I already know where all
it can be going wrong and how to fix it
right that is how you build on top of
what your earlier generation and I'm not
saying edgewise but you know
in a logical processing of a particular
software developer you can learn from
your earlier generation that is during
the maintenance even in the construction
phase if you already know a particular
solution to a particular problem it is
good idea to start with that solution
why reinvent the wheel that's the
question that we as architects will
always ask what's the benefit right for
example we are not going to invent a new
way for human to walk everybody walks
almost the same way maybe some people
run it if they are physically you know
kind of disabled or challenged they may
be walking little differently
nevertheless they walk that's a pattern
right so design patterns will make you
efficient and will allow you to build
better software that's why that's why
design patterns are important the first
pattern that we'll talk about is a chain
of responsibility pattern sometimes it
is called also chain of receivers but
tilting pause and see if there are any
any questions that you have in terms of
design patterns the applicability of it
or the importance of it okay
no chanting questions as always let them
come in let's talk about chain of
responsibility in fact let's step back
let's not talk about this chain of
response let us take a case many of us
must be using some sort of cellular data
or cellular connection or even better
maybe almost everybody will have some
sort of bank and let's say you have a
query to be made to the bank so what do
you do you perhaps know the customer
care number you pick up the phone and
call the customer care it is likely that
you will land upon an IVR you know
interactive voice response it will ask
you to punch in the key number the the
card number or your account number may
do some sort
validation and we'll give you a menu of
you know what all you want to do and
then let's say that that particular menu
does not suffice your problem you have a
very specific question as to why did
your let's let's assume why was your
account debited certain amount and you
want to know that perhaps a standard IBA
will not be able to tell you that it may
tell you five transactions but not why
they are there then to ask you whether
you want to talk to a customer care
representative and you say yes you know
you press perhaps nine or hash or
whatever that is and you get routed to
the next person you know the next
processor and you tell you he may do
another level of validation you tell
there was a transaction and I don't know
why it was made another stuff and he'll
take oh it was done on the internet
banking and I don't know you know what
is wrong do you want to lock your
account and you say yes I want to lock
my account but I also want to escalate
it so this person may lock the account
lock your web access no more
transactions and then may send it to his
supervisor or a specialized support who
may handle the customer transaction
dispute another department maybe and
that person may give you some
satisfactory reasons may not give you
satisfactory reason based on that your
call will get routed to many different
parties perhaps end up doing filing a
dispute complaint can you get some sort
of service request you see that in life
almost every time you are interacting
with any customer care levels of support
that levels of support is nothing but
chain of responsibility in this
particular chain every individual
processing unit has some specific
responsibilities assigned you know the
first time you call up IVR as a
processing unit has a responsibility of
accepting your input and you know
routing it accordingly maybe if you were
just interested in checking your fight
transaction and it tell you the
transactions and you're done you don't
need to go to the next level
perhaps you want to block your card and
you may even blocking card is these days
IVR enabled but maybe you want to file a
dispute you have to go to the next level
the next level of support is going to
just be handling certain specific type
of queries and next level and next level
what is advantageous here is you as a
customer are only going to know about a
customer care number to call and you do
not care about how many processing
levels are in this case receiver levels
are there in the chain
the advantage of for you as a client
what is the advantage for somebody who
is providing you this customer care
support they can internally change the
way the question outed you know they can
add in new processing units new
receivers or remove certain processing
units and you don't have to worry about
it
neither the service provider or support
provider has to worry about how will be
your experience that is the advantage of
chain of receivers I can explain the
screen you know the request comes in
first is received by the receiver one
receiver one has reference to receiver
two we see where one may may process the
request in which case the call may
return if it cannot it will send it to
the next receiver and next receiver
until the end of the chain is received
right we you call it a tail of the list
is hit in which case cannot handle the
the request may end up throwing an
exception may end up creating a ticket
in case of our customer care support
although the slide will say that a
particular Handler or receiver will say
will will decide whether it can support
a request or not this is a simplified
view there exist a variation of chain of
responsibility where in all these
receivers
could be collaborative receivers and
we'll talk a little bit about that but
if you allow me I'll move on and show
you a UML diagram of chain of
responsibility from the client
prospective client is still talking to
the handler there may be many different
concrete handlers implemented out of
this interface or an abstract class what
is important is a concrete handler has a
reference to the handler some sort of
handler
right that some sort of reference is
called a next reference or a next
handler or a next receiver name is your
you're choosing but something which is
next in the chain okay then if you have
worried about UML three important
elements a client a handler and a
concrete handler a concrete handler
differ in some of the implementations a
name a change in our implementation
Benini we may name it a support you know
let's say a request processor abstract
open request processor and one is IVR
processor and on uh there is a human
processor and so on and so forth but if
you look at at a very high level handler
concrete handler and client then here is
another problem statement that we
perhaps kind of describe it already you
give a problem statement to this
particular chain l1 support will try to
resolve it right and if it is resolved
then it is given back to a human as a
solution if it cannot be resolved it may
be sent to the l2 support which can come
up and check if it is resolved and then
if it is all given back to the the
caller or the problem statement provided
as an answer if it cannot be resolved it
may go to cannot handle as an error
condition
well this chain can go on and on as long
as you want then we described the
solution already what is important again
kind of reiterating is that the user
does not know what all kind of handlers
or support levels are their user just
needs to know the first and how by some
means the chain of responsibility
pattern does not talk about how does
user come to know about the first
handler or any any type finder and
therefore when you build an entire
solution you may end up creating some
sort of factory to give you that handler
chain that is when you go into
solutioning but if you are looking at
only at this particular pattern the user
or the client code just knows that there
is some sort of handler how many are
there in the chain does not the client
does not know is it in fact the client
does not even know that there is a chain
the client only knows that there is some
sort of handler who's gonna solve my
problem a quick implementation in code
this is a Java code or you can implement
an abstract class support important is a
reference to the next support class
remember here we are calling support in
UML we had shown it as handler some sort
of handle requests whose going to take
some sort of domain class in this case
it is a support request this is a domain
class knows about the support level or
ticket status and whatever that you need
to do in order to represent a particular
request we will implement the in the
concrete handlers the car in this case
we are calling it in l1 support we are
gonna just do it very simple way right
for demonstration purposes the l1
support can only handle these these
queries you know where can i download a
particular file maybe you were calling
ed Eureka in this case right making a
download a particular file how much time
will it take to learn maybe what is a
fee
and then Elwin supports handle requests
we'll check if it can handle the query
if it cannot handle the query it will
just send it to the next level of
support right it will say handle Falls
is just implementation it'll iterate
through find out if the question matches
if matches it is a handle true say set
the status if it is not handle and if
there is still a next support available
it will say next support handle request
if it is not there it may just say that
it is an illegal argument I can't really
help you then l to support will look
almost the same just that in this in
this case we will be handling different
set of queries how to run a project how
can I create a mapping file what should
be installed to run the the project
maybe you want to install the demo
project almost the same implementation
just that this is a different concrete
class again does not have to be this is
a very very trivial code that we are
showing you just to elaborate on the
design pattern then the actual logic of
you know what does the handle request to
then when you are let's say testing it
again we are keeping a simple test case
most of the professional guys will use
something like j-unit but we'll keep it
simple many levels are created or
support 1 through 4 l for level 1
through level 4 and we create a chain we
said the next handlers right l1 has the
next handlers l2 l2 has the next
hundreds L 3 L 3 has a next andrÃ¡s L 4
so on and so forth and then we create a
particular support request and we pass
it note to l1 and we will see what is
the status then we will also create
another support request and still pass
it to l1 note guys we're still passing
to l1 support only and it will be
processed by whoever whoever is the
right receiver for that kind of
okay there are some questions coming in
and I will answer them but before I
answer those let me give you some more
examples of chain of responsibilities
maybe at a Java EE level those of us who
may have worked on servlet there is a
concept of filter these filters are
configuration based actually but you
need to really implement the filter
interfaces you can accept an incoming
request apply a logging filter which
will log all the requests and then let
the requests flow to the next filter who
could be which could be an
authentication filter will check perhaps
is this request really authenticated are
they're authenticating headers in the
request or cookies and other stuff and
maybe if it is it will then eventually
let it go to the servlet and therefore
in this case you will see that we are
applying kind of orthogonal aspects if I
may use that word orthogonal logic
pieces of logic together to have if a
system that can log or authenticate and
do some real business logic wherein
servlet does the real business logic and
you can add and remove these filters at
will many such examples will let me
pause and answer some of the questions
that I have already here okay the first
question I have is from Ajith what is
the difference between a command pattern
and chain of responsibility command
pattern also looks similar or structure
like an action I'm just reading the raw
question ok I'll try and answer it like
in our action class in the struts which
with execute method action support
abstract superclass we have action chain
and ok so I will not read it further
let's first try understand the
difference between chain of
responsibility and c'mon
in chain of responsibility the client is
only talking to the first receiver and
client does not even know that it is a
chain of responsibility client is not
responsible for even creating the first
handler client has to be given that
handler by some means whereas in a
command pattern a command pattern is
just some sort of pseudo language for
example in the file menu you are going
to say save that Save button does not
have any logic of saving the data it is
just some sort of token that token is
what we call command okay remember
command on its own does not have any
logic of execution also command will
never delegate the processing to the
next command the command will be
executed by the what we call it the the
the the receiver of the command an
example could be a TV right the the
remote control that you have which has
on/off button that on/off button is
really a command where does it get
executed it get executed on the receiver
of that command which is your television
set so two different patterns can we say
that struts again question from a jet
can we say that action in struts
framework is chain of responsibility
pattern no not really
in struts struts really a combination of
a something called a front controller
pattern right and an illiquid processor
which is which is going to be a facade
pattern right so it the the action
classes in struts framework are not
responsibilities okay in fact if you
want me to be more precise than that
struts is really a front controller
followed by MBC okay and action classes
are really the commands that get
executed under the MVC framework where
are these commands defined they are
defined on your form tag right when you
say maybe edit do it do it it is the
command where does it get executed on
the under the struts framework it's
somewhere there will be an action which
will get instantiated and executed can I
give examples in JDK spring or struts
the chain of responsibility I already
gave you an example in standard Java EE
standard Java EE or space the web
applications there is another question
which is quite interesting coming from
mahtim if I am pronouncing it right
pardon me if I am not how will you
differentiate between a framework and
design pattern very important question a
design pattern is something that you
have at an abstraction okay when you say
chain of responsibility it is a abstract
solution to some recurring problem
however framework is something concrete
you when you say spring it is a
framework okay
it is going to be collection of many
different functionality that that
framework offers which may and
underneath be using many different
patterns combined together a design
pattern in other words is a very small
aspect or very small contributor to the
entire solution frame
has a very specific goal in in its life
for example spring we'll look at
inversion of control and dependency
injection as the base and then we'll
provide many different things starts
we'll look at how do I ease the webpage
rendering you know how do I build the
graphical user interface on the web
pages and still be able to do it do the
request processing to different piece
framework again is something that you
use as your underlying underlying
infrastructure to build your application
design pattern there are something that
is an abstract solution that you have to
go implement code in order to get the
benefits out of it what is the other
relationship if you understand the
design pattern understanding various
framework becomes much much easier right
if I tell you that let's say a in spring
right in spring the application context
is really a bean factory which is really
a factory pattern you you get the point
like you know that it is a it is a
factory pattern out there okay if I tell
you that really spring does it does the
aspect orientation by using something
called a proxy pattern you get it it is
a proxy you never get a handle to a bean
which is which has an aspect oriented
aspects weaved in okay perfect any any
other question before I move on and and
look guys this particular session is to
you I do not perhaps intend to cover all
the all the patterns but I want to be
able to answer your question and when
you go out of this session I I hope that
you have learned something something
more then when you came in okay so with
that let's let me move on the next
pattern that I hope to cover today is a
is a mediator pattern another
very important pattern if you are
worried about a tight coupling between
the objects again this is a behavioral
kind of pattern which means that we will
be controlling the way various objects
communicate with each other
as always let's start with an example
let's say I own a house which I want to
give out give out on rent
I want to rent it out and there are many
people out there who would want to rent
their houses out and there many people
out there who would want to lease house
or you know get some house on rent now
imagine a case if I have to go and talk
to all prospective tenants or as a
tenant one has to go and talk to all the
landlord's or you know house owners very
chaotic thing it will be right but
that's not how you do generally in
practice what do we do we go to an
intermediary maybe an online property
broker like let's say a magic brick or
you go to a local estate agent who's
kind of a broker will find perhaps a
property based on your needs and then
the initial that broker is going to do
the initial conversation upon the needs
and may offer and counteroffer between a
tenant and a in landlord but remember
the analogy breaks there right there is
a reason why we call it a broker but
this is a middleman who is going to talk
to the individual parties so that these
individual parties don't have to
interface with each other
they don't even need to know about each
other until the time comes perhaps to
you know almost finalizing the deal
where in our analogy breaks remember
there the analogy breaks but at least
for the initial conversation these guys
are not gonna talk to each other you
don't know where all you know a
particular broker what all prospective
tenant he kind of needs right
he'll perhaps only let you know about
those who are matching your cry
and similarly if you are a prospective
tenants he'll not tell you about all the
properties if you are gonna need only a
2 BHK house you're not gonna give you
tell you about a villa right or maybe a
1 BHK house or a penthouse or any of
that sort so this mediator guy is gonna
kind of control the communication so
obviously what could have been n into m
communication paths right n landlord's
talking to M prospective tenants M into
n mesh it is now really M into 1 &amp;amp; 1
into n communication so your number of
communication paths have become simpler
and on the both side of this
communication you may be able to add new
prospective tenants remove some
prospective tenants add new landlords
remove some landlords without affecting
the other end of the communication
everything is managed within the
mediator right pretty simple thing to
manage when you compare that immerses n
communication okay when you look at
mediator pattern this is how we show it
on you Emily you have a mediator and you
know this tenant and the house owner or
landlord we call it colleagues because
they are interested in talking to each
other just not directly so these are
colleagues and then you have a concrete
mediator which knows about concrete
colleague you know a particular estate
broker knows about particular part is
interested in a specific kind of estate
maybe there could also be the land
dealers right you are you are looking
for an open space plot not every state
agent deals into that so maybe a
different concrete mediator different
broker who's gonna only deal in the in
the in the land open open land
maybe another dealer who's only into a
commercial places to be
so different concrete mediator and then
you have different concrete colleagues
the it is what is important is colleague
knows about the mediator right not the
other way around the mediator may not
even know about the colleague it is the
concrete mediator that knows about
specific colleagues now there could be
variations of that okay maybe sometimes
you can wrap up the mediator and
concrete mediator together and do it do
it in one go three important terms when
you look at UML mediator colleague and
concrete colleague of obviously for the
the concrete mediator so let's look at
another problem statement let's say you
are to design a chat client okay and
let's just make it a little bit complex
let's say a group chat you know where in
you me and other people are going to
talk to each other and obviously if it
is a group chat it will be n into n
minus one communication right if I am
sending out message to 100 different
people 100 different people can also
send our message to other 100 different
people make each individual maybe there
are 1 0 1 participants in this
particular group chat then how can we
solve it so we already know that we the
n into n minus 1 communication is messy
we can't really survive with that so
then we say ok we can actually do it via
some sort of mediator a mediator has way
of communicating to the you know to the
colleagues and mediator can accept these
colleagues you know these participants
in this case what we are calling and
there is a concrete mediator called chat
mediator in this case which holds the
references to the concrete excuse me to
the concrete colleagues the concrete
participants in this case they are going
to be users I will tell you that it will
be in the next screen and then this
concrete mediator is going to implement
those methods such as
and participant in which case it will
add participants to its list and there
will be a method called send message
wherein it will send message to all the
participants on that group chat except
the one who has sent it right for
example if I send you a message I don't
want to see it back right I already know
that I have sent it too so we just said
that okay send it to everybody in here
for loop again this is a Java
implementation send it to everybody but
the sender of it okay then on the
participants tile or on the colleague
side we say that okay the colleagues
know about the mediator who's the
mediator right and colleague has two
methods in this case or send and receive
a concrete colleague is going to be user
and user when you say send on a user
that send method is really going to send
message to mediator and not any other
participant because see at this point
this participant or user does not know
about any other participant it only
knows about the mediator so when it is
asked to send a message it will send it
to the mediator with this reference so
that the mediator does not send the
message back to this participant or this
user and obviously there needs to be a
receive method because maybe somebody
else you know maybe a jet on this
particular meeting must be sending a
message and I should be able to receive
it as one of the participants in the
chat so that is the concrete colleague
again a test case we are going to keep
it pretty simple I know some of us who
are into the field for a long time may
want to use it in a j-unit style but not
everybody knows it so we will just keep
it public static void main will create a
chat mediator and will create maybe five
different participants and see we are
adding all these users to the mediator
these users do not know about each other
now if user cow user one comes and says
hello everyone that hello everyone
message will be received by all other
four participants via mediator
later on let's say a user named Kelly
wants to or Brian wants to go away
he make him come and say mediator
Daughtry movie of course we have not
implemented the remove method but we can
and then after that let's say Alex comes
and say how are you Brian who is left
already is not going to receive the
message and Alex does not even know
whether Brian was there or not does not
need to know okay so that's how we can
solve a problem where the communication
between the parties can become M into n
or any kind of complex mess well this
was a chat example there are more or
some somewhat you know more elegant and
yet simple solutions to when you go into
something like a GUI a graphics user
interface in this case this is a swing
application what it is going to do is
depending on what is the contact name
selected in this bit list it is going to
update the contacts name it is going to
update the Edit panel and maybe some
time it may even show the picture of the
person however picture of the person
let's keep it aside for now and we'll
come to it for now let's say if I select
another user called jaikumar it will
show my contact name and it will show
all other details here in the Edit panel
and I can edit an update so what happens
if I don't know about mediator pattern I
may end up that on the action perform of
this particular bit list I will have to
know that I have to go and update
contact and I have to go and update the
this particular I have to go and update
the read-only contact as well as the
editable contact well not only that
imagine the moment I update a contact my
read-only contact should also reflect so
that means this particular update or
editor panel must know about the display
panel too
so you are entering into a tight
coupling now let's say as your
application grows you want to show a
picture of Jake Amara or a picture of a
jet or you know anybody else and then
what happens you have to go and change
the code in the pic list and maybe here
maybe now because in update contact you
will have to be able to upload a new
picture right so your update contact the
editor panel should also know about this
new picture lot of communication between
these parties you can simplify that by
just saying that let's have a mediator
which knows about all three or four
panels and if anything changes in any of
these panels that panel just tells it to
the mediator and then mediator takes
care of updating their respective or
informing the respective panels to
update themselves with the refreshed
data okay so that's that's the mediator
pattern I have an interesting question
which I will answer now coming from
Manish and the question is how is it
different from observer pattern that is
the name changes all the rest of the GUI
needs to be informed very a very
prevalent question I get that all the
time so thank you for bringing it up
Manish the differentiation between the
mediator and observer is going to be
this observer pattern is generally going
to be one way straight right in observer
pattern what's going to happen the
update contact panel or the editor panel
and the contact panel are going to be
listening to the state change of the
pick list however what happens in this
case is if I change the contact editor
panel and I say update contact maybe
from Brian floor I say you know Brian
Adams and say update contact that should
also send
the state change or you know I should
not be using state change in this case
but that should also tell do the pick
list as well as the contact display
panel let's look there is a change in
this particular you know last name
so what can you do if you start
implementing the observer pattern the
display panel as well as the editor
panel needs to be the observers to the
pick list the drop down I mean right
similarly the drop down and the display
panel should also be the listener of the
change in the editor panel and now you
know that let's say between editor and
the drop down both are listening to each
other state change very soon you may end
up doing an infinite loop
both updating each other about you know
I did a state change of course you can
always plug that gap by saying that
check whether state has really changed
and only then the then take the
deflection or only then reflect upon it
of course you can do that but then you
are using observer patterns from both
think about it what is being observed is
also an observer for the previous
observer in this case the pick list
happens to be an observer of editor
panel and editor panel also happens to
be an observer of pick list well it
doesn't end there if you do the observer
pattern that style both your picked list
as well as your editor panel knows about
each other so you have not gotten rid of
the tight coupling tomorrow you add a
display panel you have to add that
display panel as a listener to the pick
list the drop-down as well as to the
contact editor so you still know about
what all components are there in your UI
with mediator pattern however that does
not apply mediator pattern if
net panel is gonna subscribe if I may
use that word very very vaguely remember
let me not use it every panel only gonna
gonna tell about itself to the mediator
and nobody else okay so that's the
differentiation between the observer and
the mediator pant so Manish as well as
Maryam as well as a Jade I know you guys
have ants ask the question do let me
know if I was able to answer it
successfully or in a satisfactory
anybody has any other conjugated
question or subsequent question please
feel free to ask
we are almost towards the closure of the
time but what I really want to be able
to do if you allow me to is spend only a
couple of minutes talking about observer
pattern and since we are on the topic
it's a good point to discuss in the
observer pattern what happens is there
is a subject which is being observed and
there is some party interested in that
subject maybe there is a stock right in
a stock market share market with a
fluctuating value and I as a stock
broker wants to be knowing about this
stock well let me not say stock broker
or trader because you may end up
refreshing your screen many a times
maybe I am a casual investor who wants
to know if the stock price goes below a
certain price so that I can go and buy
it so instead of I inquiring every time
about the price change
I can tell some intermediary that tell
me when this stock price goes below
certain limit maybe if you are into if
you use any of the you know trading
platforms they will allow you to set
alerts those alerts at a very very high
level are nothing but an observer
pattern what could be another example
let's say there is a weather station and
the weather keeps changing the
temperature changes perhaps so and you
want to know you are perhaps a
broadcasting network maybe a news
printer newspaper printer or a TV by the
station TV station right you want to
know what is the temperature
it is unlikely that you would want to
call up the weather station guy every
now and then and tell ask you know what
is it tell me what is the temperature
rather you will have some sort of
arrangement by which the weather station
guy may call you up or send you a text
or message or some sort of web feed to
tell you that this is the temperature
now that's the observer pattern pretty
simple implementations may cause certain
problems in some cases today perhaps we
may run out of time but let's also look
at a quick humor like you have a subject
which is the you know which is the which
is the class under observation which we
are interested in the state changes off
and there are observing the observer is
generally an abstract or an interface we
can provide various concrete
implementations what is important are
three methods an observer will always
have a method called update that gets
called by the subject the subject or
observant is has a list of observers
obviously not necessarily you can do
whatever you need to be need to have two
methods attached and something that we
have not shown in here detach some
people call it register and register and
then there needs to be a method called
notify some people call it notify all
observers doesn't matter but three
meaningful method one is to add observer
another is to remove observer and third
one is to notify and then whatever
whenever the subjects state changes that
state change is going to trigger the
notify observer which will call all the
observers in the list that's how the
observer gets to know what does it call
it calls the update method there are
variations sometimes it will just call
update method with the change state
sometimes it may call it update method
with this reference depending on how
much you want to expose the state
changes off okay looks like I have
a question actionlistener
is it a observer pattern question is
from from sonal and if sonal if you
could be more precise about an action
listener you know in which context
because there are many different action
listeners that I kind of know off so if
you could be more specific than that I
will definitely be answering the
question okay and so only suggesting
that in Java so so even in Java action
listener classes come in many different
forms let's say if it is a if it is an
event processing unit maybe if you are
looking at a JSF style all right so a JS
of style will have action listeners for
on-click it is a variation of variation
of observer pattern in that you are
subscribing yourself to a on click event
or a change event but depending on which
framework you go to some of the
frameworks may not allow you to
subscribe to the actions more than once
they can only perhaps with one action
listener to a on click event a limited
form of observer pattern in a generic
form of observed patterns there can be
any number of observers that you can
subscribe okay so the answer is kind of
yes if you are looking for only yes/no
kind of answer but remember variation
and that's the beauty of it once you
understand a specific pattern you will
understand all its variations so for
example sonal here could quickly relate
that maybe action listener is this kind
of an observer pattern so when tomorrow
she goes and kind of maintains a bigger
system she looks at in a nose okay this
is an observer pattern so many standard
practices where an observer pattern will
apply
so with that particular note let's
conclude hi I will take questions so
don't don't worry about that I'll wait
to see if there are questions and I
think I want it all but let's say let's
conclude so what did be what is the
takeaway from this session first if I
may conclude that way design patterns
are important if you want to be a good
software developer right it is it is an
important arsenal or tool that you would
want want to have and it is going to
complement your XP you're gonna really
learn from somebody else's experience
and then enhance on it so you can build
very good design it's gonna give you
those tools which will allow you to be a
better designer if you are into a
maintenance kind of project is gonna
give you a common nomenclature by which
you can relate to an existing software
if you are into a design phases perhaps
a junior designer or a developer and
some architect comes and throws you
saying okay use a leader follower
pattern I mean it will be embarrassing
situation if you don't know what that
means but maybe a leader part leader
follower is a less known say is use a
command pattern and well you understand
you kind of know what the command
pattern is go implemented show it to
your architect and says no no no this is
not a command pattern you turn it may be
incorrectly what says you implement a
good command pattern and you know you
get appreciated right but what is
important all these things yes this is
their what is important is really a
software is an art and a science art
comes naturally if you are into it but a
science part of which can really be
learned design patterns are one such
element in that science
Rahul has a question wherein the
question is an example of an action
listener which does not follow observer
pattern so Rahul first thing that I
would want to be clear is that action
listener is an observer pattern just
that it is in a limited form for example
in some cases and remember action
listener is a very very generic term
action listeners in some cases you
cannot subscribe more than one action
listener on a particular event if you
are not able to subscribe more than one
it may not be the truest form of
observer pattern was the point that I
was driving but I do not intend to say
that action listener is not it is
observer pattern okay perfect
any other question before I maybe
conclude and call it over and while you
do so we did try to cover some of the
patterns you might you might be
interested in knowing that there is a
entire four week course that we do on
design patterns and we kind of go in the
same manner that we have done today in
addition to that we also show some code
examples run it TWIC it on the fly if
you have questions on that we actually
code it while you are with us and then
all these code examples are with you
there are assignments that we give
quizzes and there is already once once
you are through with that four-week
course you may you will be assigned a
project which you will have to complete
and the project really gets graded and
only then we can issue a certificate of
you know completion that certificate
carries some value in the sense that
your current employer or future employer
can actually call up Eddie Rekha and say
has this guy really done it and how did
he do it Rahul has a question which I
will take is any pattern which is more
perhaps important another which is more
important to learn which you have seen a
used in many examples well I can tell
you that the the largest pattern that is
being used and it is really an item is a
singleton pattern but it will be a wrong
statistics to go against because many
people use singleton in the wrong manner
they just don't they just want to use it
and therefore they end up doing it
there's no reason to use singleton some
of the cases the simpler patterns like
Factory which are easy to grasp the
observer are more prevalent because
people can do it that does not mean that
they're important than other in fact
I'll tell you the more complex pattern
is to understand more powerful it is
because you can really solve a specific
problem right in other cases if you
don't grasp that pattern one of the
example is a leader follower wherein we
don't even talk about synchronization at
all and we are talking about concurrency
pattern here okay
imagine a case where you are talking
about multi-threading and you don't need
synchronization how powerful that could
be right it's just that people don't
know about it therefore they don't use
it so Rahul my request to you will be
you know what is important does not
necessarily mean that it is very
prevalent ok Sunol has another question
why do we actually use singleton pattern
well we use singleton pattern only and
only if we want one polymorphic behavior
and second we want a single instance of
that particular type in your application
scope and sonal has a subsequent
question perhaps a practical example
that I can quote and I am presuming that
it is with respect to singleton the best
use of singleton is almost always a
primitive level of cache implementation
you want to cache
some data you know keep holding it maybe
you your application has some sort of
big list it may be the states of a
particular country right or languages
spoken for a particular application
that's a cache data pretty much static
or semi static you can hold it in cash
in such cases you might want to do
singleton there's some other cases where
you want to route all your requests
through the single request processor in
which case you might want to also do the
singleton you really want to implement
something like a front controller and
force it so that all requests are going
through the single instance and
therefore you want to do some sort of
request tracking another example of
singleton although there are better ways
of doing it but here if I'm pronouncing
it right Lee's irani wants to talk about
a factory design pattern well we may not
be able to cover it in depth but I'll
tell you a brief summary of factories
and pattern is gonna say ok if you need
a car just tell me what kind of car and
I'll create one for you right or if you
know you seems to be a fresher so I will
not be talking about spring in that case
Rahul has a question
looks like specific to Java how to
implement a single part a singleton
pattern using enum or using class
synchronized method which one is better
Rahul the answer is it depends if you
want to do a lazy initialization you
can't do it with enum but if you want it
to be a eager initialization you can
always do it within them which seems to
be very popular these days with Java
community and I'm okay if you want to
use it with enums too just remember just
be careful enum skit initialized eagerly
and you may end up causing more trouble
if you don't initialize it properly if
it is just going to be some
about caching which does not have to do
any kind of initialization
enums may seem to be a better choice
okay so we are about 1213 minutes about
time but I I liked the the discussion
and the level of interaction and if you
if you think that this was useful that
you know that made my day or that kind
of I spend my time more productively is
what I'll say and with the hope that
I'll see some of you in the in the
design pattern course that we do in case
you know you find it useful and want to
learn more I'll hope to see you next
time around when you do the that design
pattern course with that note I say
thank you for listening to me being
patient being interactive be you been a
good audience and have a nice day or
nice evening based on this one where you
are thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
