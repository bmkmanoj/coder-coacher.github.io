Android all right so the person that you
see here on the left of your screen as
Andy Rubin so he is the co-founder of
Android Inc that is nowadays more than 1
million Android devices are using right
so it is an operating system that was
offered to us by Andy Rubin and every
day more than 1 million new Android
devices are activated so it's a huge
huge base that we are talking about in
terms of user acceptance so the larger
the user base the more is the demand for
the operators or say for the providers
of services to these devices so that is
where we step in we as Android
developers are the ones who are actually
catering to the needs of all the daily
users by creating various business
enterprise applications to serve the
various business needs of the industry
let's also talk about what exactly is
the ecosystem that this particular thing
works on are the android framework works
on so there's a wide variety of devices
manufacturers that make use of android
framework in order to customize their
own needs for example if I talk about
Samson right Samsung might be creating
or leveraging some of the ABI and that
are available onto the android framework
and may build up a few of the
functionalities that they feel like
building up on the aps that are
available as a good component to the
android framework Google everyone knows
Android is powered by Google so they are
the main producers of the Android
software then we have the consumers as
what to say the target user base so the
consumers are the ones that derive the
need for using the operating system the
more benefits they that they get out of
the operating system the more consumers
will be attracted towards the operating
system then we have the application
development houses let's come to the
point now I say if I'm building up or
say I'm buying an Android device what I
necessarily mean is or what my thinking
would be is that I need to have a lot of
applications that
so my knee if you talk about the Android
Play Store it has got n number of
applications that you can think of so
that is the reason why Android has
supremacy our over the other operating
systems just because it has got a very
sizable I would say the art store the
App Store is something that you people
can look into and find any any
application that you feel may be serving
your purpose so we as Android
application developers are the ones who
actually create those applications and
that is where we step in this also
immense opportunity in terms of
freelancing projects in Android
application I'll tell you few things
majorly the Android application projects
are not that large in size alright so
what happens is that freelancing
projects are easy to read on the with
respect to the Android application
development program and also you can
create them in a sizable portion safe
within a span of three months or four
months you'll be able to create an
Android application all by yourself
so that is where the freelancers also
step in and get the projects out of the
companies and also work as a part-time
basis however apart from the freelancers
also the Android system is also working
on in terms of the improbability also so
there is a huge demand for Android
developers professionals on a regular
basis also in the industry Android also
provides you the framework also provides
you app monetization so when we talk
about if for example what I want to do
is I want to create an application for
myself right I see an idea I want to
create an application and I have created
the idea of the application but if I
make it paid that'ss if I make my
application to be downloaded as a paid
version then what I need to do is I need
to have the user base decreases just
because my application is now available
as a paid category and most of the users
might not be downloading the application
but Android also the Play Store also
gives you monetization you might have
seen how many of you have seen the
application
wherein you see a few ads going on
anytime you're connected onto the
Internet I'll wait for your responses
back on in the chat window how many of
you have seen that the applications
getting some advertisements going on
when you click on an advertisement it
opens up a page and everyone right I
need some responsiveness from the batch
here everyone it's it's not only on
YouTube and Facebook sandy it's on any
number of applications that you download
under the free category apart from few
applications like the whatsapp and
everything right it's like it's a part
of monetization that we people do we
integrate an AdMob SDK that will create
or say a runtime what it will do is it
will create keep on adding the
monetization ad with advertisements it's
more so a pay-per-click concept where
wherever the user clicks on the algo
this will you just get some money out of
it into your account for example you are
having a developer account you have
created an application you have also
played placed monetization inside your
application using the AdMob SDK
once the application gets uploaded onto
the Play Store there's a download count
that goes on for the application
depending on how much downloads you have
for your application what you do get is
you get money out of it
the money person days depends on the
category of downloads that your
application goes into right so if your
application is the top 50 grossing
applications the money money that you
get out of the app monetization is a lot
larger and if your application is
somewhere in the back stack what will
happen is your app monetization would be
giving you some results out of it right
so that is how the monetization works so
if you have only created an application
and you just want to monetize it that
way you can also do it with everything
that you get will be credited to your
account and then you can actually get
the PayPal account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
