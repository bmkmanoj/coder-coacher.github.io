of Rekha I welcome you all to this
webinar on selenium testing well I'm
aware of the fact that a couple of
people over here in the session are on
you two selenium and a lot of you people
are still wondering whether it is the
right choice to take up a career in the
testing domain and in particular whether
it'll take up selenium as the testing
tool right so don't worry we will
discuss about the very same topic and I
will also tell you in this session why
testing with selenium is their best
career choice for you okay so without
wasting much time let me show you the
agenda so these will be the topics I
will be covering I will first start off
with the need for testing and after that
I will talk about different testing
types and the different software
applications which can be tested
okay then I'll talk about the relevance
of first lynnium as an automation
testing tool in the domain in today's
world and finally I will give you a
brief introduction to selenium and I
will get you started with this domain
okay these are the things that you will
be learning and if there are any doubts
that you people have or any queries in
this your during the session please put
them in the chat box and please
acknowledge if I can start the session
right now
Mahesh ethyl Akash
can we start okay all right we good to
go so first of all what is the need for
software testing right so you can a lot
of you people might know why should we
test software okay but get these six
points clear in your head these are the
main reasons why we actually test
software beat software or any product
you have to make sure that it's of high
quality correct it's somewhat of cause
any sorts of problems later you have to
make sure that it is the best notch
because once it's released to your
customers then they will experience the
product and then they will start doing
feedback and you don't want a negative
feedback from them right you want to
provide the best quality if you want
your product to be the best product in
the market software is also similar it's
as well as any product right so software
product at the end of the day you want a
software to function properly so even
when you're developing a software you
have to test that software okay so
that's why
thing is a very important part in this
software industry
alright in this ayah tea industry and
selenium is one of the most important
tools and are the most widely used tools
for testing that's one thing and another
reason why we test software is because a
lot of users when I say users I'm
referring to your clients or your
customers now those people they may be
using different browsers they may be
using different operating systems and
even different devices for testing now
if you want to make sure that your
software works perfectly across all of
these devices or operating systems then
you have to make sure that you've tested
your software well right it should work
properly all the time I mean if there
are any bugs maybe sometimes the
software might work well in Google
Chrome but it might not work in Internet
Explorer or it may become very slow in
Explorer so these are the kind of things
that you need to avoid so this is
another reason why after test software
and a lot of people are not aware of the
fact that testing has a lot to do with
handling the website traffic you know
rather than saying software applications
let's say if their applications at least
right so after which is delivered as a
service on the web especially for those
applications you gotta make sure that
they can be accessible on the Internet
at anytime and especially during times
when there's a spike in traffic because
what happens is when there's a sudden
spike in your web traffic supposing you
have let's say 100 users on an average
at any point of time on your web site
and suddenly the website traffic it
spikes right it becomes a 2,000 or 3,000
or 4,000 then at that time your server
might not be able to handle that
bandwidth it will not have the bandwidth
to work service all the requests coming
in from all your clients or people who
are ever tried so at that time you have
to make sure that there's a frame up in
place to handle that and you cannot just
directly deploy any new framework right
so to make sure that the new emergency
framework that you deploy in place you
have to make sure that also works so you
have to test that also right so you have
to be prepared for everything so testing
has a lot to do with even preparation
and one important part which a lot of
testers will agree with me is that the
earlier you detect the software the
lesser you will have to pay to fix that
cost because think of her like this it
takes time to
build a software correct and it takes
manpower human resource now if you build
something wrong or if you build of a
buggy software or a feature then if
you've spent two weeks they'll it's a
waste of those two weeks of mine and pay
for those two weeks right so the earlier
you protect any faults by our testing
the better correct so rather than
getting the input or the feedback from
your end users or you know them
complaining that this is not what I
wanted you have do only something wrong
instead of that you would self do it on
your end then it's well and good right
you will save these in two important
things of time and money and connecting
this point the next point says aligning
with customer requirements so like I
said testing also helps you rethink what
your customer needs are so when you test
it you are basically putting yourself in
your customers shoes on your flights
shows on your trying all the different
possible situations or scenarios that
can take place and when you do that
you're making sure that there is no bug
so even when they accidentally try
something which might not work then you
can basically realize that and you can
figure that out while testing itself and
that way you can eliminate that problem
once and for all
and most of all because of testing you
will definitely have a lab a lower
maintenance cost and you will get better
raw or more accurate results right so
let's say these are some of the six most
important points why anybody need to do
software testing all right okay so now
that I've was talking about what is the
need for software testing now let's see
what are the different ways to test any
software
okay so traditionally there are two
types one is manual testing and the
second is automation testing now this
manual testing is the kind of testing
which is done basically by humans okay
as the name suggests it is we that rule
our script and we will be executing all
those different test cases one after the
other manually and we will have to
basically check all the transactions are
they valid are they not valid we have to
ensure that everything in the system is
perfectly running all right and that
your software cannot produce any faulty
feature right now because of this
problem
your work gets tedious and tiring
because a man has to do it all on his
own right I mean how many times will a
man do it and for how long will he do it
these are two important things which
make life boring and they make it
unlikable so this is a very unlikely job
I mean it's not that there are no people
who are doomed manual testing at one
point of time that was the way to go and
it was a need right but in today's world
we don't need to do manual testing
because it's also error-prone since it's
humans doing it it's possible that every
human will do errors sometime here or
there and what if he fails to verify
some transaction I mean what if he fails
to do something which he was supposed to
do because maybe rows tedious or tiring
so you have all these problems
associated with manual testing and then
we have automation testing which is what
is moving in the market in today's world
and automation testing is done by
various tools ok and selenium is one of
the most popular tools and that's what
we are going to talk about in detail
today ok and we say that automation
testing is a little fun and it's a
little more comforting because it's
basically one I am at you need to code
ok once you've coded then you don't have
any other worries you can automate the
execution of various test cases because
your entire code beat a hundred lines or
beat a million lights it will be broken
into multiple test cases with a small
part of code for each and every feature
now these features you don't need to
test it manually you ready to execute it
manually you do not need to verify the
pass or fail criteria manually ok with
automation testing you have the comfort
of running them all one after the other
and once they are all done you will also
get the report not only sent to you ok
it will tell you whether your test case
is passed or whether your test case was
failed or it will tell you if for any of
your features working or not if you have
let's say 100 test cases which has
between them if there are million lines
of code which have four features then
your test report will also say which
particular test case failed indicating
which feature has a bug correct so you
will have this kind of a relation with
manual testing you just don't get that
so you'll have to verify the password
field criteria manual
check the reports generate the reports
and do all these things with automation
testing you have it at your fingertips
and you can also say that since it's
done by machines
it's very less number of errors which
you will encounter manual testing is
error-prone because it's done by humans
and we have to agree that humans tend to
make mistakes but with automation
testing that's Inara all right so that's
the different touch software testing
types now let me go to the next slide
and now I'll tell you what are the
different applications which need to be
tested okay so that's why the stropping
is called software test application
types now this is a very important slide
for you people because a lot of you will
have this doubt in fact Akash has
already raised a question and he's said
can a selenium be used for testing
anything well the thing is everyone here
and Akash especially you
selenium is used for testing only web
applications okay now in other Robert
all you that selenium is used for
testing only web applications you might
ask then what is what is the difference
between the three right see first of all
there are three types there is something
called as desktop applications we have
something called as web applications and
finally we have mobile applications now
selenium is used for relief web
applications for software applications
which is on the desktop let's say
Microsoft Word or notepad all those VLC
media player now all these are
applications will start local to your
system
okay they do not need an internet
connection to be up and running so these
software's cannot be tested by your
selenium okay selenium can neither test
any mobile application speed Android or
iPhone or anything selling em can only
test your web applications now when I
say web applications it's basically any
software that is hosted on the internet
or in other words to make it even look
clearer anything on the Internet can be
tested any webpage any web site or
anything right so YouTube is a software
as a service that can be tested using
selenium Gmail is a software as a
service Facebook all these are basically
software as a service which is delivered
on the cloud so these can be tested with
the help of selenium and the tool that
we use is selenium there
driver okay it's even in selenium there
are a couple of tools there is IDE that
is webdriver there is RC and there is
grid okay we will be using selenium
webdriver okay so now that you guys have
got a good understanding of the
different software testing sites let's
move ahead and go into more details
about selenium okay so selenium as an
automation testing tool what is it
it's basically an open-source tool which
automates web browser testing okay now
the very important point a lot of you
people should definitely remember is it
is open source okay especially for those
people who are new to selenium and who
are pondering whether to take up a
career in this domain okay when I say
open source it means that you don't need
a license to work with selenium okay as
a free user you can do it as an end user
you can use selenium and even as a
company you can implement selenium but
whereas most of the other tools in the
market today which are relevant and
popular these tools cannot be used
without a license okay especially those
like qtp rft because of two tepees by HP
audience are ft/s complete ranorex all
these are propriety versions and they
are all paid but selenium is our free
and open source and it's part of being
free it's one of the best I mean to work
with it's one of the easiest you just
need to have programming skills but
otherwise it's pretty easy and this is
what the world is in need of today
because it's all about cost cutting
right the cheaper you can get things
done the better and as organizations
especially in today's world there are a
lot of startups small to medium sized
companies prefer to use selenium instead
of paying lakhs and millions every month
for a particular software correct so
that's why selenium is something that
you should really think of and the other
benefits with selenium is that the
different programming languages it
supports the web browsers that you can
do testing on with the help of selenium
and the different operating systems
which can be used to to execute selenium
tests these are the big advantages
because a lot of the other tools in the
market they do not support all the
programming
especially your q-tip ers feet they work
only with vbscript and she shot okay but
selenium comes out of the box and these
selenium scripts can be written in any
of the languages that you see here it
can be written on to Java it can be
written on Python Perl PHP Ruby and
c-sharp right so there is a very big
advantage and this is the most I would
say this is probably the biggest reason
why selenium is the most used a testing
tool because developers from any of the
skills in any of these programming
languages can come over and start using
selenium and that's how people have
learned right people have taught these
languages and then since they are
skilled they can easily switch to a
career in selenium but with other tools
you gotta have specifically skills in
those programming languages and that's
why selenium naturally has a greater
movement and speaking of the browser
support selenium supports cross-browser
testing and cross-browser testing is
really important because today there are
many web browsers so a Windows user may
be using Google Chrome or you may be
using Internet Explorer or Linux the
user may be using Mozilla Firefox and
maybe a Mac user would be using the
apple bapple Safari correct since there
are so many the browsers out there it's
important that your software which is
posted on the Internet
whatever your website is whatever your
web pages all these applications and
these web pages should be accessible by
anyone any customer of yours using any
of these web browsers okay and I as an
end-user can use any of these right so
often make sure that the software that
is develop so as a tester you have to
ensure that the software that you're
developing works well on all these
browsers correct so since selenium does
it for you and lets you test the
applications on all of these browsers it
has again a huge popularity and it's the
most preferred for any company and then
speaking of the different operating
systems which can be used they are
window is there is Linux and there is
Mac right they pretty much dominate the
market and since selenium tests can be
executed on all of these browsers there
is no problem
or in adoption per se okay a lot of
people can this start learning and there
is no dependencies that you got to work
on your Linux or you got to work only on
Mac because a lot of technologies and
tools have that problem right that
problem is non-tenured so if you are
still wondering will it be easy for me
to switch to selenium testing domain
then stop hesitating these are some of
the benefits and these are also reasons
why you do not worry anymore
can you or can you not you can
definitely do it and we are in rekha and
show you the path all right and as
instructors we can help you teach help
you learn and easily grow so that is
about selenium automation testing tool
okay that was the introduction now
coming to this light I will talk about
the integration that selenium has with
other tools now I'm speaking about these
tools because a lot of these tools are
used for software development I mean
there's nobody in the world that can
tell me that they are not using even one
of these one reason is these are at the
code center of the dogs technologies
right github and get Jenkins maven
docker these four tools they are at the
center of software development if they
are especially being used especially if
the software is being developed that
DevOps way
well even if it's being developed the
agile way or even if it's being
developed via the sdlc way even then you
have to use some of these technologies
you have to use gate actually source for
storing your code you order you is maven
to build them or
Jenkins for you know deploying your code
and docker for of course
containerization so I don't want to get
into the BD ins of these their ops tools
or how these are tools play a separate
role okay but the point you have to
remember is selenium can be easily
integrated with all of these for tools
and testing with selenium is really
really easy compared to testing with any
other tools and even if you see in
DevOps
the reason selenium is probably the most
important tool for testing is because of
its integration and its compatibility
with all these open-source tools okay
the same cannot be said for other tools
because first of all the other tools
don't
test web browsers a few of the tools do
not all okay and even the ones that do
they do not have easy integration with
all of these tools so that's about this
slide guys any doubts all right no doubt
I'll move forward okay so guys now we
are on this light and over here let me
talk about the different tools that are
there in selenium itself okay and I'll
tell you the feature wise comparison
over here in selenium we have selenium
webdriver we have selenium RC and we
have selenium IDE okay besides this we
have another tool called selenium grid
now these are called the suite of tools
in selenium now the differences between
the three are that selenium webdriver
and selenium RC are used to build your
test cases or strips with a programming
interface okay you can design your logic
you can build your logic by coding using
one of the programming languages okay
selenium IDE that is not possible
because this is a recording tool and a
playback pool so whatever actions you
perform on your web browser if you are
navigating to google.com and if you are
typing something in the search bar all
those actions will be recorded and those
actions can be played back using
selenium IDE okay this is not a
scripting tool these two are you is for
scripting okay so that's why you can
also see the same difference over your
test case creation you use the
programming languages to create the test
case here you're simply recording it and
playing it back and are speaking of the
browser support that at least we have
selenium webdriver supports any of these
browsers right it supports Google Chrome
it supports Mozilla Firefox it suposed
Safari and Internet Explorer and
selenium RC it also supports a lot of
these browsers but you have to load that
in today's market selenium RC is
deprecated okay it's outdated and it's
not in use so selenium RC was probably
the first version of for selenium it is
actually the first version of selenium
and the selenium project kick-started
from here okay but over time there were
a lot of problems with selenium RC and
there were a lot of drawbacks and
because of that it has basically evolved
into driver so they merged
I see with webdriver which in turn led
to their being the product called
selenium webdriver okay so even though
RC used to support all the browsers
there were other problems with selenium
RC now those differences and those
problems are not possible for me to
explain right now and if you have doubts
you can get in touch with me or you can
get in touch with ed Rekha and one of
our future webinars we can discuss the
very same and selenium IDE like I said
before which is a test and playback tune
this cannot be again used with all the
web browsers it can be used only with
Firefox because it is a Firefox plug-in
so when you're using Mozilla Firefox you
download this plug-in or extension and
then you click on that button to start
recording your actions and then play it
back there again IDE is not very popular
and it's not a tool that I are basically
prefer because there are a lot of
drawbacks you cannot create your test
script in a very flexible way okay when
you scroll down it is very tough for IDE
to capture it when you do a right-click
it is not very easy to capture it using
IDE and a lot of those problems right a
lot of grated problems are there and if
you guys have any doubts between these
things if you still have confusion I
would say you can go back to it records
YouTube channel and you can check out
some of our videos over there right so
they have a detailed explanation so
there's an entire video on selenium IDE
there is an entire video on selenium
webdriver teaching you various things ok
go through these and you will learn a
lot ok and the speaking of performance
we are speaking of the speed ok
webdriver is really fast it's actually
the fastest but compared to RC RC was
very slow the very reason that RC was
slow is what led to something called
webdriver being develop and eventually
webdriver when it was developed it got
merged with selenium and then it became
a selenium webdriver okay so RC was too
slow and IDE is also pretty fast so at
the moment you do any actions
immediately it gets recorded and
immediately you can play it back but the
test scripts don't always work that's
the drawback which I also told you
earlier so that is the effete OS
comparison between these three products
of
okay now the food product is selenium
grid okay now what this one I did not
explain along with the previous three
tools because grid is not a testing tool
but grid is something that is used for
testing now what I mean by that is if
you have your script ready especially
your webdriver script then to execute
that script on multiple machines at the
same time then you can use selenium grid
alright so grid will help you in fact
execute multiple test scripts at the
same time on multiple machines having
multiple operating systems and it can
also be developed on multiple
programming languages so you have all
this flexibility and selenium grid is
very popular in the industry because it
can be used to test these web
applications which are there using the
web server okay now what I mean is that
table if you have a web application and
if you want to test that web application
and if it takes like two hours or three
hours then apparently if you want to do
it on multiple machines and multiple
programming languages then it can be
done okay you can test all of that
simultaneously on a Rubeus instances or
needleless servers or other servers on
multiple machines at the same time you
can do that that's possible the thing is
if you're using an e SS server or some
cloud server then you will have to
probably use something called as HTML
unit driver or headless browser but if
you are doing it on an actual machine a
laptop or a desktop then of course you
can go ahead with any of the chrome
drivers for testing on Chrome or get Co
driver for testing on Mozilla Firefox ok
yeah so well high level that's what you
got to know webdriver or C an IDE are
those which are gonna build the scripts
and grid can be used to execute those
scripts on multiple machines running on
various browsers and operating systems
at the same time ok and the way it works
is there's a hub and node architecture
where one will be the master and the
others will be the slaves and the others
will be controlled by the master and
these details we will cover in detail in
our next session ok so if you guys have
any doubts please put that forward
because I have one last topic
and here I'm going to tell you why how
much selenium is growing every year so
if you look at this graph which is taken
from a very popular job portal that is
IT jobs watch you can see that the
number of job postings for selenium
testers or professionals it's been
ever-growing right look at the graph
since 2008 it has been growing
humongously and this is where it has
reached now in ten years time in almost
nine years it has reached sure okay so
these are not absolute numbers this is
the percentage of growth and my advice
to you would be be a part of this
bandwagon all right there are a lot of
openings which are there for selenium a
lot of companies want people who are
skilled in selenium okay but they are
not able to find many so if you remember
this is the job vacancy right so these
are the number of jobs that are vacant
these number of jobs are T waitin
consistently and it's growing
continuously over the last decade so if
you want if you think that if you want
an exciting job in the IT industry then
yes you can do this it's all for you you
have so many postings so don't worry
about the competition with competition
also comes quality right so that is
there and even the pay is not something
you should worry about because testers
get paid pretty well and that's what you
get a CEO right so you can refer to this
video any time in the future you can
look at these graphs and now it's it all
the best think of what I've just told
you and take up what do you think is
right okay if you think selenium is
right for you do it I think on that note
I can conclude today's session guys and
if you people have any questions please
put them in the chat box and average
them right now
okay so since there are no questions I
can conclude today's session
okay Akash Boyet see you guys all right
see you guys are the next session I hope
you have enjoyed listening to this video
please be kind enough to like it and you
can comment any of your doubts and
queries and we will reply them at the
earliest do look out for more videos in
