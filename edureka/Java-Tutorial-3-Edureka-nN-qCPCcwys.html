one person today
my name is vineeth and I'll be the
instructor for all of you okay
so starting with methods as we did in
the last class also a method is a
collection of all of the statements that
are grouped together to perform an
operation a method takes some parameters
perform some computations and then
optionally returns a value okay so you
make methods so that your program gets
modularized and within that using that
method you can call that method and
perform certain operation okay certain
functionality now what a method contains
it has got five components one is the
modifier the second is the return type
that is what value will be return the
name of the method what parameters has
to be passed like for a particular
function you need two integers then
you'll be riding integer X and integer Y
and finally the last one is the body of
the method that means what is the
functionality that you want to provide
should be present in the body of the
method enclosed between the braces okay
now we come to method overloading
directly now what is Method overloading
in Java now how many of you have heard
about polymorphism anyone a few have
heard about polymorphous Deeside down on
the chat window
Shilpa says yes Raji says yes Ashwin
says yes absolutely yes
Holi for polymorphous is one of the
concepts of oops
according which you can reuse a
particular thing right you can use reuse
something like that one is a particular
thing is performing multiple things that
is termed as polymer film so using that
concept we have method overloading right
here now the method overloaded function
now you are talking about a function or
a method you can call it anything so
overloaded function must differ either
by the number of arguments or operands
or the data types okay either I the
arguments has to be changed either the
operands has to be changed or the data
type that is what kind of value it is
returning that is the data types right
all the data types of the arguments now
the same function name is used for
various instance of function call right
so the name of the function will only
remain same in method Overlord
overloading but the other on the rest of
the things out of which one has to be
changed or else you cannot overload the
method
okay the entire same signature cannot be
present in method overloading
you'll understand it in a better manner
when you see this example right here
okay so we have got our package in that
package we have a class that is animal
in the animal class we have got a
function that is not taking any
parameters neither it is returning any
value but it has a functionality that it
will print without parameters okay so
this is one function now after that we
have got public classic critic extends
animal that means this class equity
class is extending inheriting animal
class so what happens we have got public
void fun indigent number now this time
this function is taking an integer value
or integer parameter into it now this
time it is printing the number of pass
this this so we are actually overloading
this function because the name of the
function is same but we have changed the
argument it now this time it is taking
an argument
previously it was not taking an argument
so this is an overloaded method okay
what I did in the main method what
happens I caught a Megan object of the
aquatic class that is right here this
one equity class and using that object I
call the function in the first function
call I'm not passing any parameter so it
will call the function of the parent
class so that is written without
parameters defined in class per animal
second I am passing a parameter that is
an integer value with parameter
overloaded function in class equated
okay so we'll just go directly F see an
example of this okay then so I'm sure
I'll have a package for this I already
have implemented a sample for you let me
just search for it just aminute or I'll
just open directly
so all of you till now are you clear
with what is method overloading then
I'll be showing an example right now so
please please let me know if you are
clear with that or else I'll explain in
advance again
okay reduce is absolutely clear but he
could then what about others guys
okay I think this one is the one okay
we've got it
so I'll just import that package Shilpa
say is explaining shot okay I'll do that
now she'll / what is happening we have a
method okay you have a method this
happens generally in case of inheritance
but you can overload a method in the
same class as well now in the same class
you have a method like operation
operation is one method okay
now in that operation what happens you
want to make it general now if you want
to make a general that means it should
be able to add the two integer numbers
as well it should be able to add two
double numbers as well that means two
for float numbers every one can you all
hear my voice three side down on the
chat window shall Pasillas can't hear it
okay Sheila says yes now Ashwin says yes
okay good so I was giving an example
like you want to make that addition
function in gel and that operation
functions under Lal you just talked
about the addition function now that
addition function should be able to add
two integer numbers first of all it
should be able to add two double numbers
as well but you can only pass one type
of parameters into the add function so
what about that so what do you do you
make you overload that addition function
when you overload that you make just one
change the name of the function is same
the return type will be different or if
you are not returning let's say not
returning any value will just print the
addition so we are not returning a value
it is also same but the parameter
changes that is for the integer we have
got two integer numbers as parameters
and for the double they have got to
double functions so what we will be
doing like function right here what we
did we just change the parameters idea
similarly in the addition function
I'm talking about in that first you'll
be taking two integer numbers and in the
second one we'll be taking two double
numbers okay so the name change you just
have to call the same addition function
that is odd but the arguments will
change according to the arguments it
will directly call the function that has
to be called okay you'll understand this
right now so let us find our program we
have got method overloading you have got
three classes as an example so we have
got one animal class that is public void
function system dot out println without
parameters and second is public void
function integer I system printer length
in number first pass this whichever
number you pass it so right now in the
same class we're actually overloading a
method that is we have got function
everything saying but the parameter is
changing so we are lower overloading the
function that is right here in the same
class animal and when we come to a query
class you have got this animal class
once again and if you are writing this
so this is a different concept this is
actually we are over Lloyd writing it so
first of all I'll remove this okay so if
you come you have got on this trying
give in the second class we're actually
overloading it okay the same function
void fun but the parameter is changing
so this time you're overloading the
function in the second class which is
extending the class animal okay
finally in the main class
okay instead of animal we need now we
have a class of activity class we can
call the function that is present in the
parent class or we can call the function
that has been overloaded in the acuity
class right here okay so everyone let me
know how you clear with it so I will
just make it in three windows hope you
can understand it please let me know
guys please write down on the chart
Ashwin says yes what about the others
just a few are you clear with it
Shilpa says yes what about Sonia Nagi
you can all run the code
Raju says clear ok then so I'll simply
run the code right click run as java
application and you can see without
parameters and number pass the function
name is same now I'll just make a very
small change the example that I gave it
to you so I will make it a small a
double D integer X comma integer boy and
within that system dot out dot println
I'll friend X plus y okay that is an
equity class in the animal class control
see
control we can know this in the animal
class I made a function for double
values okay double-double okay now it
will also do the same thing I will just
copy this statement the sum is control-c
control-v okay now I come in the main
function in that what I will do I'll
pass two numbers five comma six and the
name of the function is a double D this
also I'll change a double D and second
time I call the same function a double D
but I'm passing parameters as six point
one comma six point two okay this is a
function so what how does the first
method executes ob dot fun what happens
when you call the ob dot fun what we are
doing in the activated class we are
extending the class animal ocassion so
when we extend the class we can use all
the methods that are present in the
parent class using the object of the
child class I clear with that okay very
good then so our function has been
fulfilled you does not matter as a user
what you'll be doing it will be simply
passing two numbers either they are in
detail either they are double it is not
up to you you do not have to think about
that but the user simply can pass the
number and in the background when it is
double numbers it will directly call the
double the third when it is integer
number it will directly call the integer
matter as you can see we receive the
result perfectly fine 56 six point one
six
point to okay it is actually printing
there is a mistake in the system out dot
println statement and even in previously
run I'll have to put in brackets
similarly right here let's run it once
again now this time you have the correct
result that has some is eleven and the
sum is twelve point three so everyone
are you clear with that please write
down on the chat window then I'll move
back to the presentation Ashman says yes
the jefes I say yes okay then I'll just
add back now we come to method
overriding the implementation in the
subclass overrides replaces the
implementation in the superclass right
now we understood all loading that means
we use the same function name but we
make few changes
now what about overriding what are the
changes that we have to do or what are
the things that will remain the same now
the name has to remain same in when you
are overriding a method parameters
should also be saying redundant as the
method in the parent class should also
be say okay so everything has to be same
that means the signature of the method
has to say has to be same only the body
of the method changes that is the
functionality of that method changes for
example now this happens only in
inheritance case of inheritance when a
class when a child class it is
generating a parent class in that case
only you can override something but you
cannot do it in the same method okay
sorry in the same class like method
overloading can be achieved in the same
class as well but not method overriding
for that we have class animal function
integer a be integer c equals to a plus
b return
see okay it is returning a serve of two
values now in the second classic critic
we have the same signature as you can
see indeed a function in DJI F and G a B
but what we are doing we are printing
some by superclass we call this super
function we can also do that using the
super keyword in the last class we were
having a we had a question that is on
superclass what is the use of that so
these this way you can do it superclass
actually you can call using the
superclass the constructor of the
sampleclass you can call the method of
the superclass like that okay so you
write super nod function a comma B and
this time you pray Ashley multiplying we
are getting the integer so functionality
of the method has been changed we have
overwritten the functionality of the
method that was defined in the animal
class okay
the main method when you make the object
system dot out println product by
derived class OB dot function 2 comma 3
so it will call the function that is
present in the derived class ok so
you'll understand it better when we see
the example for it now let's open the
example for method overriding animal the
creating an my in again so in the animal
class as in the example you have got
integer C equals to a plus b return c so
it will be returning the sum of two
integer values okay when I come to a
query class in the equity class I have
extended the class animal now to signify
whether this method is overwritten or
not in a class you can mention like this
method override okay are delayed
override if this method has not been
overridden then what will happen when I
place this a trait override it will give
me an array like if I change it and make
it a new method so this is method
overloading right now okay I just
commented this method is fine for me
okay
and I commented that this method is fine
that means this method is overridden
right now because the parameter has
change the name of the method is same
but what if I keep the method name same
everything the signature is same so that
means we are over it in this method that
is present in the parent class okay now
in the main class what I am doing in the
main method I'm making an object of
equity that is OB new acrylic and here
what I'm doing I'm also calling the
super so it will also write the sum and
then it will print in multiplication
okay so as object of equity class in
that what I am doing system dot out
println product by derived class space
over door function you are passing 2
comma 3 so it will first render some of
the methods some of the integers and
then the multiplication of the integers
simply run this code and I've got the
result some my superclass 5 that has
been printed right here that is some but
superclass 5 but it was returned by this
method right here okay and then the
second part is I will run it once again
product by derived classes sakes heart
is getting printed in the second line
product by derived class is this okay
everyone let me know a clever method
overriding
least right down on the chat window via
clay a Schwinn says yes what about the
rest of you come on guys right down on
the chart
Karthik says yes Roddy says yes
what about Science Hill Shilpa are you
clear with that sign says yes Shilpa
says yes so I come to modifiers again so
I guess everyone are you clear with
modifiers
Karthik say sorrowful it's being late
sir never mind
at least he came to the class okay
you'll be receiving the recording so
whatever the part that is left that was
kept you can just go through that okay
let me know guys how you can have it
modifier so you want me to explain it
once again today because we had it in
the previous class but since it is
related to this method so that is why I
kept it so that I can ask you so let me
know how you clear with modifiers if yes
then I'll move forward or I'll explain
it once again
okay Rajeev says yes so I consider it
yes for everyone so I come to abstract
class now okay we will understand new
more concepts start as present in Java
so this is an abstract class what is an
abstract class first of all let's
understand this with the help of a
diagram abstract class like say this is
one abstract class now this shape
includes every shape that is present in
the world each and everything like a
rectangle circle triangle octagon
octagon Pentagon and hexagon everything
comes into this shape now everything is
a kind of shape so that will be included
in this now for example when you write
abstract class shape now this shape
could hold any shape like it could hold
a rectangle that so you when you have to
use it in Java you'll be writing class
rectangle extend shape plus circle
extend shape and claw
strangle extend shapes all of these
three things are a skier saved so
abstraction means now when you write an
abstract class that is you're providing
a kind of abstraction that is you only
have an overview what it is but you
don't know the details you do not know
each and everything what it is okay like
you go on the bridge and you just look
down you see that there is a sea and
there is something present in that but
you do not know what is present inside
the sea okay by looking over the top
similarly abstraction provides outlook
it provides a prior detail that what it
is
or do you do not know the exact detail
what is present inside that okay now
what is an abstract class a class that
is declared abstract for example
abstract class demo it may or may not
use abstract methods okay now we
understood abstract class but what is
this abstract methods now similar to
abstract class abstract methods also do
not implement the definition within that
okay a method that is declared abstract
first of all second is a method that is
declared without an implementation that
is you do not provide a definition
within that that means the body of the
method is empty for example abstract
void add you pass the parameters and put
a semicolon right here itself the braces
are not opening up so this is one
abstract method okay
so abstract class can have abstract
methods within that for example public
abstract class shape abstract void area
you are calling a method right here okay
you yeah this is an abstract method
you're making an abstract method public
class rectangle extent shape public law
circle extent shape now we have got two
classes both of them are actually
extending the class shape now you are
overriding the method right here that is
a great override void area double area
equals length into the width and at the
rate override area double area three
point four into it radius into radius so
what you saw right now is you have got
abstract class shape in that you define
a method area now
whatever shape is present every shape
has got an idea okay so you just give
that you define it you make an abstract
method whenever you extern the class
what happens abstract methods has to be
implemented right here that is at the
date override so in the rectangle we
implemented the logic to find the area
of a rectangle that is length and the
width but when we implemented this in a
circle we used sleeper 1 4 into radius
into radius so everyone are you clear
with it what is the use of a stock
method please write down on the chart
window then I'll move on to be a class
and I'll run the code so I see a study
say there shall passes yes very good
then
ok so I go to eclipse now
you
you
you
okay then no varalu I'll create a new
project new Java project let's say
abstract okay next and finish I'll close
this now I'll just double-click the odd
and I'll add a class to it
class let's name it shape and we'll
mention it that it is an abstract class
and I click on finish
similarly I'll add two more classes that
is new class one is for rectangle okay
the other is for circle go to new class
and this is for circle and I click on it
okay
so first of all in shape class I define
a method that is abstract area okay
now within that I'll place the arguments
as well
and fire I just put a semicolon at the
end okay so we have got this little :
abstract I need to mention the return
type as well so in this case I'm putting
void okay so this shape class has got a
method that is returning a void type and
the name of the method is area in the
rectangle what I'll do I'll extend the
class extends shape okay now you can see
the it is showing manera as soon as I
extend this class it is because in the
shape class we have got an abstract
method so whenever you actually extend
abstract class what happens you have to
implement all the abstract methods you
have to override all the abstract
methods so I will just click on add
unimplemented methods when I do that
area method comes automatically okay now
in the Arbor I'll do I'll simply compute
the area that is integer of width length
first of all since it is our at angle or
you can simply write length equals to
ten point one sorry not individual it'll
let us make it double okay
similarly I do bigger for the width I
declare the width variable level word
equals to ten point two and I put a
semicolon finally I'll print system dot
out dot println
the area of rectangle and finally I just
plus it will simply send the
multiplication back okay
lourdes len x rid okay so we have the
implemented a method we have overridden
the method area that was present in the
class shape and in the rectangle class
we are printing the area of that we have
all over it in the method i'll just come
to serve the class i'll extend this
class also with shape extent shape in
this class as well after implement that
method off to override that method okay
so radius double variation or are itself
equals to 10.5 system dot out dot
println the area of circle
circle is finally I printed right here
that is plus 3.14 into R into R okay I
simply save it now so we have got two
different implementation you have
overwritten the same method that was
present in it abstract class area in
rectangle and circle finally let's have
one more method that is new class main
and that I have my main methods I will
just remove it now in the main method
what I will do I'll create objects of
both left angle class and circle class
rectangle sorry
tangle rec equals two new rectangle and
I put a semicolon in the end okay
similarly circle C equals two new circle
and I put a semicolon at the end okay
now it's using these methods record area
semicolon C dot area semicolon so as a
user you do not have to worry you simply
call area method and you just pass the
object okay you don't have to worry
about anything when you run the code to
receive the area the area of the
rectangle is one hundred three point
zero two and the area of the circle is
three forty six point one eight five
okay if you computed using a calculator
it will be the same because it is simply
calling the methods that has been
defined that has been overwritten in
that particular class so everyone are
you clear with method overriding please
write down on the chat window then we'll
move on to take inputs and outputs okay
ash wins
yes what about the rest of you guys
please write down on the chart Shilpa
says a-square sigh CDA's okay then so we
come to interface now now you understood
what is an abstract class abstract class
can have abstract methods but I forgot
to tell you one thing that abstract
class can have the completely
implemented methods as well okay like
this is an abstract method that is fine
but you can also have void like this XY
said method now you can also provide the
implementation when as soon as you put
the braces that means something is
present in the method something has been
implemented so enough abstract class you
can have abstract methods and you can
have to complete methods okay remember
this now we write of the just a glorious
you
I'm sorry now we were on interphase now
in interphase you cannot have
well-defined methods to complete methods
you can just have the abstract methods
okay but when you define them in an
abstract class you mention an abstract
keywords so can you tell me do we have
to mention they abstract keyword in
interface as well please write down on
the chart what do you think guys do we
have to mention it Ashwin says no can
either give me the reason as well
Ashwin why do you think we do not have
to mention the abstract keyword in an
interface that is in the method it is by
default absolutely right as I said
interface can only contain abstract
methods in that so there is no point of
mentioning abstract keyword before every
method right so moving on interface and
declared using the interface keyword
first of all in the face can contain the
method signature that is no
implementation constant declarations
that could be variable declarations are
not declared to be both static and final
okay our example is right here our class
that implements an interface must
implement all the methods described in
the interface because every method that
is present in the interface is actually
abstract method we have to implement
each and everything that is present in
that class okay so you have got an
interface you have got three abstract
methods in it there is a class that
implements all the three abstract
methods right here okay moving on how to
create an interface so you write public
interface keyword demo underscore
interface now integer add int value 1 in
value to void print in sum okay so
you've got two methods right here one is
addition when you spend so you just give
the abstract that is you give the
signature of the methods do not provide
the implementation of
particular method okay now how to
implement the interface you understood
how to create one now how to implement
it so you have got a class a class one
which implements them or underscore
interface in that you have to override
both the methods so in the first
overridden you have put the value sum
equals to value one value to returns a--
and second print is taking an integer
value which is printing the sum of D
whatever is passed whatever value has
been passed to print it prints the rot
value in the main method now it is
something like this you have got a class
one you've got a interface now this
interface implements this class one
implements the interface that is demo
underscore interface okay now using them
in the main class execute that is main
string arguments you make the object of
class one new class one integer sum
equals to OB dot at 10 and 10 and you
pass some so in the class with extensive
interface they have got two methods
print and add using add method you are
adding two numbers and using print
method you are printing the value
whatever is the sum of those method okay
so let us get to that and I'll close it
let's make one more project that is for
interface file new interface let's write
interface inter itself
just to read file new first I'll create
a project ok enter next finish now in
that inter project I'll place my
interface so stores folder I'll go to
new similar I directly go to interface
mention a name let's say demo the same
name as it is in presentation interface
and I click on finish
so God our demo interface the spelling
is wrong I'm sorry for that now in that
interface I'll define the same method
status void or integer add integer X
indeed Y or X comma int each of Y and I
put a semicolon at the end okay
similarly I have got void print and it
is also taking one integer value
integers sound and I put a semicolon at
the end okay
now we create another class that is
class 1 new class that I mentioned class
1 I click on finish which is simple
classes in which I am extending the
interface that is demo control space
sorry
now this is the difference okay the
mistake is whenever you use a you're
trying to use an interface you cannot
extend that interface will be
implementing an interface implements the
demo interface okay now it shows you an
error because there are abstract methods
present in the interface you have to
implement all those methods right our
unemployment in methods have got integer
are in boyfriend okay so in that you can
mention the functionality like even
simply return X&amp;amp;Y right here X plus y it
will return the value back
and in the print method system dot out
dot println the sum is forest coat and
finally put the plus sign and you write
some okay I save my file now I make a
main method main class new class
alright main public void main finish in
the main method while you I'll make the
object of class one so class one who be
equals to new class one parenthesis and
I put a semicolon at the end using the
object obj2 comma 10 and I put a
semicolon at the end now using the OB
dot some now I need to pass an integer
what I can simply do is that OB dot
print okay and simply I can place the
entire this method method call within
this as parameter because it will be
returning an integer value which integer
value will be sent to print function and
it will directly print about Crowley
okay everyone are you clear with that
I'll just run the code now
I ran the code is a the sum is 20 so it
was computed the addition was computed
and it was printed as well everyone are
you clear with this what is an interface
how can you use that please write down
on the chat window each and every one of
you Ashwin says he is clear Shilpa says
yes sai says yes very good then okay we
come to input and output now input is
the data given by the user to the
program okay output is the data what we
receive from the program in the form of
research
stream represents the flow of data that
is sequence of data the give out input
to give input we use input stream and to
receive output use output stream these
are a few turns that we need to
understand so I hope you are quite clear
with it these are very easy now how to
read input from keyboard system dot in
it represents keyboard to read data from
keyboard it should be connected to input
stream reader okay so it is connected to
input stream reader this represents the
keyboard and it has to be connected
through input stream reader
it reads data from keyboard and send a
data to buffered reader so it is
sensitive data to the buffer data right
here it reads data from input stream
reader and stores data and before it has
got methods so that data can easy access
be accessed okay so you want that the
user should put the inputs using the
keyboards the system dot it is kind of a
keyboard it will represent the keyboard
input stream reader has to be connected
with that so that you can listen you can
see which buttons are being typed
finally that tada has to be saved in
buffered reader so that you can use your
data for further computations right now
reading input from console console is
the window where you actually see the
output there itself you can mention thee
you can put in the input as well so it
put input can be given either from file
or keyboard it put god's word from
console in three ways first way is the
bufferedreader second way is the string
to string tokenizer
and third way is scanner okay so we'll
discuss each one of them one by one i
first come to the bufferedreader you
write the bufferedreader this is a class
that is present so you make an object of
this class bufferedreader bufferedreader
calls to new bufferedreader within that
you pass new input stream data which
takes an argument that is system dot in
okay so actually taking input from a
keyboard so you write new input stream
reader system not in finally integer 8
equals to bufferedreader dot feed it
will read that value that has been
entered
in the console window and it will be
saved in age okay finally string name
bufferedreader retreat line it will take
a string value that I'll enter and will
be saved in name okay so I need my
workspace to be changed so I'll open
that so okay we have got our kids now
okay first of all I come to
inputbufferedreader okay as it was
present in thee now before this I'd like
to ask a very simple question that
answer you'll receive in the example
itself I would like to ask
the question is right in front of you
which of the following statement is true
Java does not support inheritance Java
does not support multiple inheritance
Java does not have primitive data types
Java does not support multi-level
inheritance you just have to pick on the
polling screen and Kaster answer each
and every one of you without the
statement is true only 33% of the people
have answered till now I request
everyone to poll your answer Castillo
answer 67 what about the rest of you
guys please vote in okay 50% of the
people says that the Java does not have
primitive data types and 50% says Java
does not support multi-level inheritance
and none of you are correct the correct
answer is Java does not support multiple
inheritance that is you cannot extend to
classes at a single time that is why
where comes the use of an interface that
is you extend the class but you can
implement many interfaces okay I hope
that is clear that is why we have got
the concept of interface so that you can
use that can over look the limitation
that you cannot have multiple
inheritance in Java now we have got
bufferedreader new bufferedreader you
pick an object new input stream within
the are any pass system not in now you
are printing enter your name read lines
we enter your name second assistant or a
parental and anti age you've got in a
integer.parseint now read line actually
takes integer value okay it will be
returning an integer value sorry a
string value so you have to pass that
string value into integer okay all we
have got a direct method as well
to take an integer value that a simple
read method that will simply take an
integer value okay
I'll remove this and I will remove this
because it will directly take the
integer value and I save my file now
when I run this code you can see on the
console window it is asking me
enter your name so it will start till
then user inputs a value so my name is
vini and ru age my age is 90 years okay
I'm very 57 years old why is it printing
50 790
Plus age-old s printed once again we
need ages to fifty years old okay if I
just change it to control set and
control that save a file now I'll just
print it again we need and to this time
it is fine
I'm not very sure why it was giving a
wrong value that time using the reed
method okay so let's try to read it read
ok the character region it is an integer
in the range of 0 to this or minus 1 if
the end of the stream has been reached
reads a single character ok so you'll be
using like this that is you can take the
string value and you can pass the end
great is a problem with that I'll let
you know what is the problem
ok because I myself has to find it
because this is the first time that I'm
facing that okay so everyone are you
clear with bufferedreader please write
down on the sharpened oh I clear with
bufferedreader if yes then I'll move on
to the second input method Ashwin says
yes clear what about cyan Shilpa
Oh Chris I says yes Leah now we come to
Spring tokenizer okay it can be used to
accept multiple inputs from the console
in a single line whereas buffer data
accepts only one input from a line okay
as soon as you input one thing so it
will take one as an input but if you
want to put multiple inputs at one line
itself so for that even your string
tokenizer it uses delimiter del Amita
would be kind of comma or any other
symbol that you want to use so it uses
delimiter space comma to make the input
into tokens like you'll understand that
when you see the example it can be used
to accept multiple inputs now you write
buffer reader you need a buffer reader
as well but you'll be using the string
tokenizer to take the inputs so buffered
reader buffered reader custom buffer
read a new input stream reader system
dot in and string input equal to
buffered reader dot read line okay you
call this in that line you start
mentioning all your inputs now we use a
string tokenizer
so in that what we do string tokenizer
tokenize a custom new string tokenizer
you pass the input variable what has
been taken using the preferred reader
into the tokenizer
and you pass delimiter that is gamma so
you mentioned this delimiter when you
enter your inputs in the console window
finally string name tokenizer dot next
not using the delimiter it will keep on
moving to the next part so dot next
token well take the next thing integer
is equal to integer % tokenizer dot next
token so we are taking two values first
value will be the name the second value
will be the age so let's go react let's
see how our tokenizer works so tokenizer
is right here main now buffer reader
takes the input saves it to the input
variable we have not read lines if to
the input variable we have got a
tokenizer input it is taking a comma as
telemeter tokenizer dot next should get
the name and save it in the name
variable should get the integer value
should name and should save it in the
age
finally I'm printing the same thing so I
run the code simply now in the same line
it's Elyan and their name and he
separated by comma and the same line
itself we need comma age whatever it is
I mention it and I receive result by
using the comment got to know that the
first value is this the first value is
beneath and the second value is this age
that is 90 so I get I am gonna eat 90
years old everyone I clear how to use a
tokenizer so that you can enter all your
values in a single line and using the
delimiter you can easily find out but
how many inputs are there okay so let me
know if you are clear with it okay
Ashwin says yes okay then moving back
I come to scanner now now this is the
best thing this one is the best method
out to take an input in java it accepts
multiple inputs from file or keyboard
and divides into tokens on its own it
has methods to different types of my
inputs like in DJ fluid spraying double
long bite anything it has four different
methods for different types whereas
tokenizer does not have it
scanner you make the object of the
scanner class new scanner you pass
system dot in within that finally when
you have to take integer value roll
number equal to scanner dot next int if
you have to take a string value name
equals Tristana dot next simply like
that okay so let's go to eclipse we will
see the example for scanner now inputs
non scanner in the main method I create
an object of scanner that is scanner
scan a new scanner system not in system
dot out rental and enter your name in
age so name is taken by this that is got
next which will be a string tight
edge is taken by India value that is
next end and finally printing the same
thing okay and there you name an age we
need enter dimension the age
i'ma need 90 years old okay this is
quite simple to use you just know that
whenever you have to take a string value
call them 1/3 next whenever you have to
take an integer value you know that
there is an intra sense he'll be calling
next end in that okay and for using all
these methods you should have a object
of the scanner class that a scanner can
name it anything new scanner you need to
pass system dot end can you tell me why
anyone of you why do you think we need
to pass system dot end within that
waiting for your answer lies because it
is the stream assurance ace okay
absolutely is because we are taking the
input from a keyboard it will be acted
as as kind of stream so we need to save
it we know we are mentioning that input
is coming from the keyboard okay so I
hope you are clear with scanner as well
these are quite simple concepts everyone
let me know I you clear with this please
write down on the chat window
Ashwin says clear what about Sian Shilpa
very good then now I come to writing
output to console the output can be
written to console in two ways you
understood how to take inputs now it's
time to understand how to give outputs
so two ways could be you can write print
string system dot out dot print hello or
you can simply write write int int a
giant puts I equal to I system dot out
dot realm right input and this is a
newline character that will take you to
the next line okay
these are two output methods so let's go
to eclipse now we'll simply open the
project for output
so system dot out dot println now can
anyone of you tell me I'll just copy it
control C control V all right
print simply write print and I'll just
copy the statement once again control C
and control V here I'll write Ln okay
similarly I will do the same thing with
this control see both of the statements
and control V here I'll mention Ln and
here also I mentioned Ellen now can you
tell me what will what is the difference
between print and print ellen yes the
right function can only handle yes can
write only handle single characters yes
it will be handling the single
characters okay that is what you
generally do not use right Ashlin okay
now tell me what is the difference
between print and print ellen okay ash
when you're right what about science and
/ Ashwin says thanks I'll give the
answer for - Ashwin said but I want
science Shilpa to give me an answer
please write down on the chat window
waiting for your answer guys please
write down what do you think is the
difference between print and print Allen
okay
Ashwin says new line will be added in
println absolutely correct when I run
this code the result that I were to see
will clear your doubts so this is right
here first thing prints right here that
is you can see print Ln in the same line
then again print is printed then there
is a next line present and then it comes
to Ln okay hence Ln is coming to the
next line because print has been printed
as println so it prints first and then
it takes the control to the next line
and
Ellen is printed in the next line if you
print something after this what will
happen it will be printed in the next
line okay so everyone are you clear with
this system daughter println and print
control 7 and this is 1/4 right simply
prints a character it only prints one
character Shilpa says yep Clea
Ashwin says yes Clara what about Sonia I
clear with that size is a very good then
that was the final topic for today guys
so everyone let me know body topics that
pertain you came today easy and were
they understood to you or not
all these questions first of all tell me
where the topics that were taken today
easy or the topics easy today please
write down on the chat
waiting for your answer guys do you
think the topics were easy Shilpa CCA's
so everyone let me know the topics
Ashwin say is input using console
included a lot of coding no that was not
a lot of coding that is why we gave you
three input procedures okay I told you
three things but you will be using most
of the time the third one that is the
scanner that reduces the coding part
okay that only you just have to create
an object and finally you can take the
inputs okay but if you talk about the
other ones bufferedreader there is a lot
of coding tokenizer there is lot of
coding she will be using that scanner
Ashwin says yes I'm happy with scanner
so am I so I see is easy very good then
so guys let me know but the topics that
were taking today clear to everyone send
me Smiley's if you ace
Ashwin sends me a smiley what about the
rest of you
Shilpa sends me smiley I wish I sends me
a question mark
smiley somewhat like this I'll send all
of your smiley
sighing you can check it if you do not
know what is a smiley okay
so sigh Dario understood what is a
smiley you can send one to me waiting
for you okay then I hope so you are
quite clear with the concepts each and
every one of you sighs easier so
everyone practice it and I'll just post
some assignments on Facebook community
today itself just go through them
attempt those assignments and put the
solution on there itself on Facebook
only after solution after solving the
problem this assignment just send that
assignment on Facebook itself you can
just post it and I'll review that
assignment and I'll let you know okay
so I hope you'll do that right after
this class you'll receive a survey to
fill in give your comments give your
suggestions so that I can improve myself
and provide you a better class in future
so guys should I expect that you'll be
posting assignments sorry the solution
to the assignments Ashwin says thanks
you're welcome all the posting
assignments will you guys attempt that
assignment should I says yeah I'll do
that
I shouldn't say they'll look into it
very good and what about you Shilpa no
Studies won't you be doing that Michelle
policies yeah me too very good then so
but just wait and watch for the
assignments those of you are not on
community just join yourself I'll just
show you the community for a while you
are having a lot of discussions there
guys so you need to actively participate
on the community so you can see sixteen
comments there was a post by shadi can a
Java program run without means we are
discussion there thirty nine comments
that is huge chain of comments okay so
everyone post in here and keep trading
for your assignments right so it's time
to
leave guys bye-bye take care thank you
all for being here today
don't forget to fill in the survey okay
and we'll be seeing in next class I will
be on tomorrow okay
so Baba I take care thank you for being
