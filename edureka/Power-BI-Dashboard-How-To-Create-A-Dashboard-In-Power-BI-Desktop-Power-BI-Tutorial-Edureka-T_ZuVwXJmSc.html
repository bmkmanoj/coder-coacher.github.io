and welcome to the session on power bi
dashboard and without wasting any time
let's move forward and look at today's
agenda now first thing that we'll be
doing is we'll be trying to understand
what are the interfaces in power bi what
are the various functionalities of power
bi then we move on to understand how to
create a report and dashboard in Barbier
and finally we'll see how to use
Palmilla in real life scenario I guess
they've introduced agenda can I have a
quick confirmation okay it's good to see
that you guys are all following so let's
go on and discuss the first topic of
this session that is what exactly is
Poppaea now Fabia basically is the
self-service business intelligence tool
released by Microsoft in 2030 which
basically was a combination of different
add-ons that Microsoft had issued for ms
excel now in comparison to your other
business intelligence booth this is a
cloud-based tool but the interfaces that
you have here are all three different
platforms you have power bi desktop
which can be downloaded and installed
onto your system wherein you can create
various reports get better insight with
respect your data then you have power bi
service where are you working with
respect to dashboards you can also
manipulate your data here and finally
you have Fabia mobile which is also
helpful for you to watch your reports
while you're on the go so you guys clear
with respect to what is power bi okay
that's great
so moving forward let's try to talked
about the major concern of today's
session that is what exactly is a
dashboard now there's always the
ambiguity that you get so let me tear it
off a dashwood in power bi basically is
a single page wherein you have all your
visualizations with respect to a
specific requirement preceptive now this
dashboard could be with respect to
different domains now let's say if it's
a HR - then what would happen is you
would have the details of the employees
you'd have the ratio of the employees
you'd have number of employees that have
come in today you'd see the number of
requests that have come to the HR and so
forth okay now here what you're seeing
basically is a marketing dashboard now
it basically is accounting based
marketing dashboard let you see the
different opportunities opportunity
count the revenue and so forth so to be
very short a dashboard is just one
single page of visualization which tells
you a story now this story basically is
to me
the end users requirement so it's up to
the user who's creating this - book to
customize the story as per their choice
and make a happy ending a selfie now if
there is always the ambiguity as to how
a dashboard is different from a reporter
let's talk about that next now as I had
mentioned earlier a dashboard basically
is just one page canvas here which tells
you the complete story that you want to
know however a report can contain more
than one single page what happens here
is the report is way more detailed with
more inside it and we most specific with
respect to the requirements so let's say
if you want to have a complete analysis
then you would go for a report rather
than our dashboard now here again when
you talk about the data sources that a
dashboard can take since a dashboard is
a combination of different visuals this
basically can come from different types
of reports thereby you can also
integrate your data from different
sources as well but when we are talking
about a report here you mainly working
with one single data set that is
specifically used for that report
purpose so let's say you want to create
a marketing report then you're going to
take just the marketing data but let's
say when you're looking at
organizational data then you even have
data from the marketing you can have
market data from the sales finance and
so far then you have the option of
pinning now what do I mean by pinning
basically it means that you're adding or
copying a specific visual now in terms
of a dashboard you can pin an existing
tile from a current dashboard to any
dashboard that is if it's already
present in the current dashboard then
you can put it to any other - how in
case of a report you have a broader
opportunity where you can pin it to any
dashboard as such if you want you can
pin the entire page of the report to
your dashboard as well are you guys
clearly huh good now apart from that
let's see if you want to filter or
modify your data to get better insights
then what happens is this cannot be done
with respect to your dashboard in your -
put the data is already fit so filtering
and slicing it there would not be
possible now when you're working with a
report here you can basically filter
your data you can highlight it you can
slice it as per your requirements you
can join your data you can separate them
you could group them all this can be
done another report level however comes
on a dashboard level it basically cannot
beat up so
achieve this slicing of filtering on the
report level definitely will be
applicable on - but however it cannot be
directly implemented on the - then you
have the option of alerts that is when a
certain condition is met then you can
get an alert from that this could be on
your while application that is the power
of your mobile application you could get
a notification or let's say this could
come to you as an email so this again
can be set on the dashboard itself so
let's say you're comparing multiple
parameters let's say at one given point
your sales and profit values has changed
it has come down below a certain value
then what happens is as an
organizational person you need to take
the responsible measures so this can be
very useful when you're monitoring your
data on a real-time basis as well and in
cases when you are working with multiple
- put to differentiate with respect to
different dashboards you can set them as
feature - put now feature dashboards
basically are those - modes which are
highlighted from the rest
however in case of the report it cannot
be set as such and then going on from
there you can also use natural language
query now what exactly is a NASA
language query we'll be looking at and
the later part of the session but to
give you a simple idea or an
understanding here what it basically
refers to is that you can directly feed
your queries in English itself you don't
need to write them assess SQL statement
or anything like that so let's say you
want to identify which is my top-selling
store then definitely you can just write
that and your power bi dashboard will
convert it and give you the output in
form of for bischmann and don't worry
we'll be seeing that as part of our
demonstration as well later on so I hope
you guys are quite interested now apart
from that on a dashboard level you
cannot change the visual representation
of a certain form of pressure that is
let's say if you're using a line chart
to denote something then as per your
requirement you cannot change it in a
dash book so you need to go back to your
report then you need to modify it there
and then you need to pin this updated
version so what happens is it gets
updated in the dashboard asthma but when
you directly modify it in the report it
does not get reflected so you need to
repin this updated visual as well now
when you come down to the customization
capability of both a dashboard basically
uses visualizations in form of a read or
a method
so any changes that you make are
basically with respect to the changing
in names you can either link them you
can resize them rearrange them and so
forth in the dashboard however in our
report here you have complete right with
respect to the visualization as well as
the data that you're working so you can
modify it change it as per your
requirements it's completely left to you
as to how you can work around with it so
I you guys clear with respect to both
how the report is different from a
dashboard okay I seem to have a question
here do we need to create reports for -
but it's definitely you - because it's
from the reports that you will be going
on to create a dashboard so to put it
more simply in reports give you a
complete idea whereas a dashboard will
give you a complete over so based on
your requirements you can use whichever
meets your necessary said okay that's
great so moving forward let's look at
the data set that we'll be working with
today so we're going to work with a
superstore data set of a United States
organization which was collected
basically from 2011 to 2016
ok now I'll be showing you the data
serozha just a minute so this is your
complete data set you have basically the
date of order you have ship indeed the
ship mode the customer ID customer name
which segment it was from postal code
city state country apart from that your
region market the product ID the
categories of category and so forth ok
so I hope you've got a general idea of
what the data set looks like ok that's
great
so what we need to do is we need to
mainly achieve for insights from these
data first what we need to identify is
the overall befox that is we need to
identify the sales and profit of our
complete superstore ok
apart from that we'll also try to
identify the performance in different
regions and we'll see which are
profitable regions and which are non
profitable regions then what we'll do is
we try to identify the performance of
each state as a whole
ok now which state is gonna show you the
opportunity of growing which is
basically pulling your market down and
which is something that you can look
forward to in investment or marketing as
well ok after that you have inside three
where we'll be seeing the preference of
different segments involved in the
superstore and how do they contribute as
per find what we're doing is we try to
understand the revenue generated by each
category of
now there are different categories of
the product so we will see which
category is hampering our growth and
which is feeding our growth as well okay
I guess they're great now the first
thing we need to do is that you need to
install barbier for that you need to go
to power Bears official website that is
power bi dot microsoft.com I need to
directly download the option here let me
show you how it started so here you have
the option of power bi desktop so first
what we need to do is that we need to
create our reports then we want to
create a final dashboard which has all
these inside so what we'll do is we'll
be creating a report for each of the
insights in the power bi desktop so here
just click on download option and it
will automatically initiate the dark
so once you've downloaded this file okay
then you need to install it it's a very
easy installation step and once you're
done with that please let me know so
that we can country great so now that
you Reeve all install power we're
desktop let's begin with the demo
session so for that we need to launch
our power bi desktop that means launcher
so this is what your power bi would look
like when you've been launched so one
thing I would like recommend is that you
sign it if you not created a sign it
then definitely a make sure that you
create a sign in off of your desktop
so once you've successfully logged and
you get this notification here of your
username as well so let me just give you
a simple overview with respect to how
power beer works and then we start with
respect to our session now first you
have a simple workspace that is the
first work space that you're seeing is
the report workspace this is the
workspace where you will be creating the
different visuals as well as creating
the different reports as well then you
have the data workspace so when you're
loading a data any data that you're
working with can be viewed here all the
modifications that you want to perform
with respect to the data can be done
here and finally you have the relational
workspace now the relational workspace
is one of the useful workspace when
you're working with multiple tables now
this helps you establish as well as plan
is the different relationships between
the multiple tables as per okay so let
me just go back to my report workspace
and here the first thing we need to do
is that we need to import the data set
now for that you have this option here
called get a task you can get data and
you have the most common data types here
you have external power bi service SQL
Server analytical service so for seeing
the complete list click on more and here
you have the complete list of different
data sources that you can connect with
respect to a power bi desktop now we're
going to work with an excel file so let
me just keep on excel and it's going to
ask me the location so let me go down P
over superstore and it's establishing a
connection to the data set okay so since
my data set has multiple pages it shows
me the different pages as per you have
orders you have people and you have
return once you are on a sheet it
extracts about 200 rows and gives you an
overview with respect to what is present
in your data set because this basically
helps you verify what data set you're
working with and visitor value data set
or not so since we need worry orders
detail let me skip on orders and then
click on load so now you can see this
successfully the data has been loaded
because you can find the options of
fields here okay so this basically is
because respect to the orders table so
let's say if you work with multiple
tables each one of the tables as well as
all the columns present in
those tables would be highlighted here
okay so this is where we'll be working
on right now to get a more insight with
respect to your data you can go to the
data workspace and here you have the
complete preview of your data so this is
your complete data set present here and
you get to see whatever data is present
and if you wish to perform any operation
on this so let's see if you want to
modify this data then you can click on
edit Granny's option here and you get
the query editor so this becomes the
workspace where you can perform all your
different operations on your actual data
set now by default RBI does perform
certain amount of operations on your
data while it's loading itself so these
steps can be viewed here okay so any
operation that you don't want Barbier -
can be remove you or let's say if you
are performing any operation then that
also can be removed from this option
here so every step that you perform gets
added to this applied step option so far
now let me just close this and let's go
back to our workspace so first what
we'll be doing is we'll be trying to
create a sample wish okay so this
basically will give you a feel of how
power works so what we'll be doing is
let me call it profit leaders here so to
rename any movie report you can just
double click there and let's call profit
leaders
okay now what I'll be doing is I'm going
to create a combination of my different
states as well as the profits that each
of them have got so let me just bring in
the state's okay so this basically is
going to create a default visualization
okay
and since its States what it's doing is
trying to put it on a map Pushpa okay so
for that what I will do is I'll add in
the profit details as well okay now when
I add the details of profit what happens
is it sees the difference with respect
to the size so let me just filter a
little more I'll add in details with
respect to the country as per okay so
this basically will filter out all the
data so let me just bring this up
and here you can see the profit across
different states that I am making in
different countries as well okay so this
basically is a geographical
representation of all the profit that
I'm making across the bill okay now let
me show you how to filter out the data
as well okay now when you come down in
your fields option you have this option
called filters now in filters if you
click on country okay you can see all
the countries present here now if I just
select one specific country so let's say
let me take United States okay then what
happens is my complete visualization
changes with respect to United States a
look okay so here basically it becomes
with respect to United States okay so
all the profits that you are seeing
right now is with respect to the
different states in United States okay
so if you just go down Hoover over them
you can see the different profits and
you can see some states are negative
okay so what happens is I need to
identify which are my positive states
and which are my negative states so what
we'll do is we'll try to change the
colors with respect to which they are
represent so for that to go to the next
field that is the forward field okay now
here you have the option of data colors
now the same size with respect to the
profit scene can also be represented in
a different map based system also that's
called field map system where and what
actually happens is that the color
intensity of each of the states is with
respect to the value of profit that they
make now let's say if you want to vary
eight the value to identify the regions
which make profit will form I tap here
under data colors option you have
something known as divergence when you
turn on divergence what basically
happens is there is a variation with
respect to that color so let me just
change this color set up as a whole
because it seems a bit confusing right
now so I'll make the minimum a slight
creep okay I'll make the middle asked
the medium grid and finally the maximum
has decree okay so this basically helps
me get a better idea with respect to
this as well now let's see if you want
to go more detail let's say the minimum
or let's say the center okay I'll set it
as 0 okay that means states which are
not giving me negative profits are sent
up okay states below that should get
let's say I give them a blue color okay
Center let me give a different color let
me see yellow and the maximum profit
making states are angry okay so here it
starts from blue ok menu look at Texas
it has a complete negative value okay
these are my mid-level profit-making
states but whereas California is giving
me one of the highest profit similar to
New York as well ok so you can see the
variation with respect to the color and
how we have not related with respect to
that so I hope you guys have got a
simple feel of how to create a visual
with respect to power ok I have another
question here it's how do you know which
wish were to work with ok so by default
you get multiple date kinds of wish was
present in public self and there are
more of custom visual zaspar so it is
completely left to you as a
representative as to work a form of
wishful that you want to represent it
certain data that may be represented in
a pie chart would be very helpful but
when I bring it back to a bar chart or
line shot it may not give me a clear-cut
picture so it's finally in your hands to
decide which kind of wish words to use i
clear ok so let's go back to our
presentation and start with the first
inside now the first thing we need to
identify is the overall trend with
respect to our sales and profit as well
as get an insight with respect to the
different regions and identify the
regions which are profitable and
nonprofit so for this let me go back to
our Pavia and let's begin by creating
our first inside so let me begin by
creating a new page for this report so
click on this option plus here
to create a new page ok and let me call
it overall performance so now click
and then we said now what we need to do
is that we need to identify the seals
and profit okay so for that drag sales
from here and drop it on your workspace
and similarly drive profits okay by
default what is happening is you're
creating a clustered column chart okay
now you can change it as per your
requirement so let's say you want to
create a line chart so just click online
so the sales and profit data gets
converted to a line chart here but since
we don't have a second parameter or the
axis based on which these values have to
be math it's just giving me two points
now this is the sum of sales and sum of
profit that I have made on a given
interval so for that what I do is that I
bring in the order date that is the date
on which it was hotter okay so when I
said order date here indeed different
parameters here you have your water
month and D so let me remove here I'll
make a month and E and I'll make it in
terms of quarter so it is giving me in a
reverse order that is with respect to
the different quarters so you can see
here it is giving me a descending order
as to the sales and profit now this is
basically because it is getting sorted
with respect to the court to change that
just click on three dots here okay then
you can see it by default it has set
sort by quarter so you can change it
sort by sales or sort by profit so you
can see here by default it is giving me
quarter four quarter three quarter two
and quarter one okay so I wanted in an
ascending order this is something that
is set by default so to change that just
click on the three dots present here
okay you can see it is following a
descending order so I want to make it in
ascending order so just click it again
and then you can see it changes into an
ascending order
well it's quarter one quarter two
quarter three quarter four okay so the
size seems a bit small so let me just
increase that as well so let me make it
similarly let me increase here as well
on the y-axis so this is basically how
you can increase the size of the font
that are present accessible to the
different axis so I hope this is a
little more clear so you can see with
respect to quarter one my sales was
close to 2 million wherein I had made a
profit almost about 240,000 dollars but
when I went to quarter 2 it increased my
sales reached about 3 million and my
profit equally increased to 325 million
finally by third quarter I had a sale
closed three point five made but a
profit at the same time was more it was
about four hundred thousand dollars
finally in my fourth quarter four I had
saved close to four point three million
at the same time a profit of five
hundred thousand dollars okay so let me
just increase the legend size as well
because it this is your legend so it
helps me identify which is my sales line
which is my profit line as well so here
again let me make it let's say 27 and
let's see if you want to change the
color of the line as well you can do
that in the data color option here so
see us can let's say if you want to give
it a blue and for profit let's say I'll
go thread okay so this is a blue and red
combination that is happening here okay
so I hope you guys are trying this out
simultaneously
now one thing you need to understand is
this is a combination of the different
quarters data and this data as I had
mentioned is a collection of number of
scenes from 2011 to 2015
okay so here what happens is all the
dates get grouped up with respect to
different colors so this value that you
see okay this basically is a summation
of all the sales and profit you have
made in the first quarter for the year
2011 2012 13 14 and 50
okay so this is a complete combination
with respect to that C okay that's the
only reason that you have four points as
well but if this was not happening then
you would have 20 points rather than
four points but now what is happening
it's combining the different quarters
then it is helping me understand what is
happening exactly now let's say if you
wanna fill it up this data little more
so let's come back to our field stuff
and here I come down you can see here
the different options already present
you you can see with respect to the
different quarters you can see with
respect to different profit
as well as SIDS now let me bring in
something interesting here so let me
bring in my category here as well so
just drag and drop category here and it
gets added so let's say I want with
respect to only furniture so if you
select furniture ok the visualization
completely changes so earlier when I was
making 2 million sales now it's only six
hundred and seventy thousand dollars
these are actual sales are not and my
profit is close to fifty thousand four
hundred ten dollars so again this
basically radiates because this is the
details with respect to my furniture now
let's say if I remove furniture and add
office supplies then it slightly changes
with respect to let's say so I nicely
with respect to how our data
visualization is created and how we
achieved the first insight any doubts
with respect to that now if you remember
this insight is not complete because we
need to identify this with respect to
the different regions as well so what
we'll do is come back to our filter
option let me to select or minimize this
and let me add in the region option from
here to my visual level filter okay so
what happens here is that I can see all
the different regions present here okay
so here these are the different regions
you have Canada Caribbean Central Africa
Central America Central Asia Central
u.s. eastern Asia Eastern Europe and so
forth so you have different regions as
well so what we'll be doing is so let's
say I want to see it with respect to
eastern Asia when I click on eastern
Asia the visualization takes a change
again here so with respect to eastern
Asia I have made a hundred and fifty
thousand worth sale and I had made just
a profit of thirty thousand okay
although it grew in my fourth quarter to
almost three hundred thousand and sixty
thousand profit let me check on others
region let me calm down let me see the
eastern US region okay
so here you can see a huge group my
first quarter there was just a $65,000
say but when I come to my fourth quarter
it's still three hundred thousand and my
profit is
forty four thousand only okay so this
helps me identify which are the regions
that are not doing well and which are
the regions that I can put my interest
to hurt market my product no okay so if
I again come back here if I say Central
America so you can see here it is not a
normal crow so I had 150 thousand in the
flow
squatter second-quarter is almost the
double third quarter is close to the
second quarter itself but my fourth
order is really high so this means that
there has been a growth in the fourth
quarter as well as the second quarter so
this basically calls in more
investigation so I need to try to
understand why there was not much growth
in the third quarter but at the same
time what led to the growth with respect
to these two corner okay so I hope this
helps you identify what are the insights
also that you can receive from these
visualizations are you clear with
respect to our first visualization any
doubts with respect to this
okay that's quick so moving forward
let's look at the second insight that we
need to achieve as part of today's
session we need to identify the
performance of different states okay so
for this what we'll be doing as we go
back to our VI and let me create a new
page I'll rename this state performance
okay so here what we're going to do is
first we're going to create a
visualization and then we're going to
give it three so let me select the
visualization that is a scatter chart
again you can see it has been added here
to this what I do is I'll take my sales
from here added to my x axis I will take
my profit hand it to my y-axis
and then what I will do is
I'll add my state details here so this
basically becomes a scatterplot here
okay now what I'll do is let me come
down let me add a filter where in my
country
it's just United States so this
basically will give me a state wise
representation of the different prophets
I make in United States okay so this is
basically a scatter plot between mice
profit to my sales okay so you can see
here the highest profit to sales ratio
is from California when I have almost
four hundred and sixty thousand worth
sales and a profit of eighty thousand at
the same time this is followed by New
York New York has almost close three on
$11,000 worth sales and it has a profit
of 74 thousand so it's almost close
because these regions have a huge
difference with respective sale I'm not
but the profit is almost same in New
York okay but when you come down to the
switches the next state that is
following it is Washington now
Washington what is happening is that I
have just one hundred and thirty eight
thousand watt sale and my profit is
thirty-three thousand but when you see
this line right this line is what you
need to concentrate on when we first
increase the size of the font here so go
back to our filter
okay yeah this should be better now if
you see here these are the regions that
are giving me negative profit that is
I'm wasting my money here even though
these regions are bringing in sales but
they are not bringing in any profit so
if you look at the state of Texas
I have almost one hundred and seventy
thousand watt sales coming there but my
profit is in a negative theta which is
minus twenty five thousand that
basically tells me that I'm investing
way more to get these sales than making
a profit so these become the regions
which I need to concentrate more okay
that is these are my highest priority
states okay
apart from that let's see you want to
add a specific trendline here
so for that you need to come to the
analytics tab here so trendline
basically is a reference line that you
can set okay based on your overall group
so this is your standard sales to profit
group so anything above this is
definitely good for you but anything
below it's not really good no let's say
you don't want to try and like we remove
this let's come back let's say you want
to add an x-axis constant line so let me
add the value of let's say which are the
regions that come below the x-axis value
of 100,000 okay so these are the regions
that I need to improve myself anything
that is on the right side of this
definitely is doing good in terms of
sales but same time let me hide a y-axis
constant line so let me keep the value
of the Y constant about 22,000 this is
basically a rough number okay so
anything below this and the intersection
this area right this is supposed to be
my highest priority area anything below
this definitely it requires an attention
so if I divide them into different
quadrants let me just write it down here
let me call this one let me call this to
me call this 3 and let me call this 4
okay we have sorry with respect to how
it looks odd but I hope this gives you a
general idea here ok now here what
happens is quadrant 1 does not mean any
attention because these are my
high-priority quadrants and anything
here is also bringing me good service
and good
as per quadrant you can improve itself
it can slowly move to odd red one so I
need to concentrate more with respect to
the six okay so it is bringing me profit
but again I need to increase my sales in
this region quadrant three is the
biggest mercy even though it is bringing
me good amount of sales but the profit
is negative this basically means that
I'm throwing away my money in these
regions as such quadrant four are the
regions which are performing moderately
ok but in terms of numbers they are not
really anything there neither crossing
my cache holding number of sales nor are
they cross my threshold in number of
profit so this is going to be my second
region of interest my first priority is
going to be the regions in quadrant
three and my second priority is going to
be the regions in Quadrant II so if I
have time I can try pushing the states
in quadrant two to contract one and
quadrant one is always above my
benchmark but this doesn't mean that you
don't put any attention to this feature
okay you can always come up with new
ideas to increase them pure okay maybe
some understanding as to why only these
three regions are making this may help
you grow with respect to all your
quadrants as well okay so these are just
solve the various insides you can get
from these visuals so I guess clear with
respect to the insights that we have
achieved here
any doubts with respect to what I have
discussed great so the third inside what
we'll be doing is we'll try to identify
a segment wise performance they will see
how each of the segments are doing in
the different states so let's go back to
a power bi desktop now let me create a
new page here and let me bring the
category CEO okay so rather than picking
the categories what I take is the
subcategory so this will give me a
broader idea so I bring in the
subcategories okay and I'll add to it
the number of sales so this basically is
going to be represented in a table form
but a table form is not really helpful
for me so what I do is I put it in a
clustered bar chart so when I do it in
this way it becomes a clustered bar
chart give me the different sales made
by each of the subcategory okay now what
I do is I mediated a little bit okay now
that this what I do is I just bring in
the profits as well
okay so I'll add the profit into the
color saturation option okay so this you
can see has waited now if you go back to
your format option you have data colors
here okay
so here let's again enable divergence
okay so let me make it light green let
me make it mid green and let me make it
dark green so you can see with respect
to which are the categories that are
giving you profit and which are giving
you seats
so if you see folds are the regions with
respect to the marks of upsets our
copiers are the regions with respect to
the maximum profit okay so this also
gives me a different insight with
respect to how these regions are
performing okay so this again can be
represented in a different way you can
also try the sort with a pie chart but
this is my suggestion so here's a
homework for you why don't you try
representing the same chart in a
different way and it will be interesting
for you as well so I hope you guys are
up for that okay that's good to see
so let me just rename this finally once
more I call it segment performance
okay and let's go back to a presentation
and let's see the final insight that we
need to get now this basically is to
identify the revenue generated by each
category of the product okay and
identifying which category of product is
hampering my growth let me create a new
page so I'll call it revenue generated
okay so cook it I mean what are the
different data that I need for this
visualization you can take a guess guys
okay yes so I need the category
definitely so let me put in category
I need my sales I need my profit and
finally let me also bring in the order
date but here what I'll do is in my
order date I'll just stay here instead
of months this will help me understand
how the different category of products
are function throughout the year so what
I do is I just variated a bit let me
take a line chart graph so here what
happens is you can just see two things
status with respect to furniture office
supplies and technologies the sales to
profit ratio okay so let me just
fullscreen this now here what happens is
you have the option of going to the next
level of hierarchy so if you just click
on this what happens is it becomes sales
and profit by here okay so you have
sales profit per year so this was our
sales per profit distribution but when
you go out what happens is it's the
profit made by each of the categories
over okay now I'll just bring this down
so here what I'll do is I just remove
the categories from here and then it
just becomes a sales to profit ratio
okay that is the sales and profit made
in different years here what you can do
is that you can actually filter it so to
have issue a level filter what I'll do
is I'll bring in the categories so this
basically will help me identify the
sales and profit made in each of the
year so let's say for furniture alone
this is the sales to profit ratio made
in each here so 2012 2013 15 and 50 okay
similarly with respect to office
supplies you get a number let's say
furniture and office supplies so this is
a different number and you can work
around with respect to them so this will
give you an insight with respect to all
the three categories at the same time
you can also compare multiple categories
together okay so this rather than
applying it directly to the visual can
be added as a filter to your visual
okay so with this we've achieved the
four major insights that we are trying
to achieve
at the beginning of the session and
we've created multiple reports for this
now it's time that we could want to
create our dashboard before that what
you need to do is that you need to save
this file so let me save it
so let me call it my first - hope okay
so here when I save it it's gonna be
saved in form of a dot B bi X file which
is supported file from Poppaea now that
I have saved it
it's time that I publish it to my second
Pavia interface that is probably a
search that is going to be the interface
where we will be creating our dashboard
so for that what you need to do is that
you need to publish so this is one of
the major reasons that I had mentioned
that you need to sign up for power bi
okay because this is going to go to
power bi service which is an online
browser-based interface and that's where
we want to create our dashboard once you
click on publish so you can see it's
publishing to my power bi service okay
so here itself used Dipti notification
that has successfully publish it to my
power beer and click on open power bi -
but so you can see here the browser is
opening this report so you can see here
it has been opened asked different pages
for a report now let's say if you want
to edit this report you can do that on
power bi service less power so just
click on edit reports and you have
almost the saved features present here
as you had power in power bi desktop but
again what I need you to understand is
you cannot manipulate the data that is
associated to this report to do that you
need to work it on your power bi desktop
not on power bi service ok so here let's
say you remove this so this is profit
region with respect to all this was the
first sample representation that we had
created first so this also has a next
level of hierarchy if you see ok so what
is happening here is that it is
considering the whole profit of United
States rather than individual state so
if you go to an upper view it basically
becomes this so that internet would be
helpful when you're working with
different countries ok so we had set a
filter here that the country is just
United States ok now if I remove this ok
then it sort of becomes a mess so if I
do that you if it happens to be a global
level representation ok so that time it
becomes slightly hard for you to
identify which so that time what happens
is you need to see the bigger picture
here so you can drill down to your
visual report and then what happens is
it becomes a representation in terms of
a global scale so earlier what was being
represented as individual states now
becomes with respect to different
countries okay I guess clear ok great so
now it's time that we begin by creating
our first dashboard ok so you have the
option here of report - so you have the
option of work so you can work with
multiple workspaces ok so by default
you'll be working in my workspace and
under that you have first of all that I
had created earlier and the present
report that you were working with that
is my first dashboard so you can also
load an Excel workbook here in case if
you want to use a lower for different
visualizations and apart from that you
have the data sets associated to the
different reports also Presidium ok now
let me show you how to create a
dashboard now creating a dashboard is
quite easy all you need to do is just
click on the pin
which will option okay and it'll ask you
whether you need to pin to an existing
dashboard or create a new dashboard but
since there are no existing dashboards
I'm gonna create a new dashboard I'll
call it my first dashboard and I'll pin
to it
okay similarly I'll take my state
performance okay I'll pin it to my
dashboard segment performance also goes
to my first dashboard so you can see
here by default it is showing me it
there's a dashboard present so when you
work with multiple dashboards you can
select it a quality could have been let
me take Travon you generated also I'll
pin it there okay so with this we've
pinned all the visuals that we have
created to our dashboard so let me show
you how how the dashboard would look
like so here you can see now there is an
entry for my first dashboard if you
click on that
you have all the full visuals that you
had created as part of your dashboard so
this is what a dashboard would look like
in a web view but let's say if you want
to see it in terms of a phone that is if
in our power to would look like so just
do the same you just pick it change it
here so this is how it would look on the
phone application so this would I can
radiate with respect to how it is set on
your phone the screen size and
everything would magnify any pitch but
don't worry okay let's go back to the
web view now here let's say if you want
to set it as feature so then you have
the option of satis feature so if you
say satis feature this becomes your
feature dashboard as such okay then you
have the option of favoriting the
dashboard so when you're working with
multiple dashboards then it becomes easy
for you to manage with it then you have
the option of sharing your dashboard now
to do that you need to upgrade your
account to power bi Pro which basically
would cost you only $10 a month okay
they do have a 30 days trial period as
well but since I've completed my I
presently is being disabled so once you
do that you can always share this report
to anyone that you ok any dots cleaner
okay now let's see if you want to review
all of this as well it's quite simple
it's just to drag and drop operation so
let me show you one of the most unique
feature that power bi dashboard allows
you to this basically is your power
reactivity so let's say if you want to
have any idea with respect to your data
let me ask which state has highest sales
so the stance may bridge state is
bringing me the highest sales so it's
coming from England
okay and accordingly it has given me a
wish with respect to all the states that
is it's giving me the maximum first and
correspondingly it is following it by
sending bottom okay so let's say which
state has the highest profit let's see
with respect to profit so let's say
profit okay now again you can see it is
changing here so it's England again here
but the values have changed okay so if I
say is profit and sales so now it has
completely changed
it's giving me a scatterplot okay but
this is slightly different from this
category have created this is
with on a global scale and this
basically is an insight that is being
achieved through Barbie is Q&amp;amp;A feature
so for any dashboard not to create you
can use Barbie s Q &amp;amp; A feature marine
you can simply just put a browser
queries and Poppaea will create a data
which will and give you a complete
insight so you need out with respect to
the visualizations the insights that we
have achieved the reports that we have
created or the dashboard that we have
created finally okay so before we end
this session let's just take a simple
look at how popiah is performing in
today's market because it's always
important to understand the market for a
technology before you completely dive
into it now in terms of job vacancies
power bi is something that is going
rapidly now the rate of growth is
somewhere about 3% every month and the
current synodic but again it's something
that is going to increase because how
effective power has become in today's
market how easy it is for anyone to use
power is going to bring in a lot more
opportunities so it's always helpful if
you move into this field the beginning
itself and that we have a lot more
experience when it becomes a popular
technology so apart from that when you
look at the salary average it's
somewhere about fifty thousand pounds
for a three month okay the three month
tenure is what this graph is
representing so this basically is a huge
amount but then again I would not tell
that this would be less because power
BIA is something that is used by people
from different of MIT this could be a
corporate business head everyone today
is comfortable using power because it is
a self-service business intelligence
tool it can be used by people who have
some technical knowledge and also can be
used by people who have no technical
knowledge as well so it caters to need
of materials with respect to their needs
ok so with this we come to the
conclusion of today's session hope you
had a great session thank you and
