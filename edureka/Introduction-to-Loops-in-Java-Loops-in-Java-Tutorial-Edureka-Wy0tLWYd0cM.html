here will be understanding three kinds
of blue first as the for loop second is
the while loop and the third one is the
do-while loop there are three loops
present will be learning each one of
them one by one okay we'll be learning
the procedures we'll be seeing their
floor diagrams and everything and we'll
also run the code on eclipse now with
first of all come to for loop now we
come to the for loop for loop allows
code to be repeatedly executed okay loop
means that it will do the things again
and again he go on right so when you
have to do something again and again
repeatedly in that case what you can do
you can use loops and one of them is for
Lu they are typically used when the
number of iterations is known for loop
has a there are three kinds of loop okay
now when to use which loop now in case
of for loop the condition can be the
favorable condition is if you know the
number of violations if you know that
you loop should run exactly for ten
times in that case you should always use
a for loop okay so this is what is
written right here
if you are aware of the number of
iterations then in that case always use
a for loop moving on if we see the
syntax of a for loop you use the keyword
for you open up the parentheses within
that first thing is you do you do the
initialization you initialize a value
second is the condition now based on
this condition this for loop will end in
the time the condition is true this for
loop will keep on running and as soon as
the condition becomes false it will get
out of the loop finally you'll be
incrementing the value of the variable
as well as you can also decrement the
value to run they do and whenever the
condition is true all those times these
statements will get executed again and
again if you see the sample right here
for integer I equal to zero that means
you are initializing a variable you
check the condition that is I less than
five till the time the value of I is
less than five this loop will run and
you are also
incrementing the value of I because if
you do not increment the value of I I
will always remain zero and zero will
always be less than five so this loop
will run for infinite times okay so that
is why you initialize up you actually
increment a value so first time second
time third time fourth time but this
loop will run for five times from zero
to four and as soon as the value of I
becomes equal to five it will get out of
the loop
how what is the working of follow the
initializing the initialization
expression initializes the loop first of
all it's good it gets executed once as
the loop begins it only gets executed
that is we are talking about integer R
equals to zero so that expression gets
executed for only one time when the
termination expression evaluates to
false the loop terminates that is when
the condition is equals to false it will
get out of the loop the increment
expression is invoked after each
iteration through the loop so you saw
that for loop has got three parts one is
the initialization second is the
condition and the third one is the
increment part so these three lines are
actually explaining why these three
parts are divided and what is the
function of these three parts okay we
have got a for loop okay for
initialization is integer I equal to 0 I
less than 5 is the condition or the
termination expression okay I will show
you how it works first initialize the
value it is only called for one time
after that this is checked with the
condition it will check whether if the
value of pi is less than five or not
okay why to take a right after
initialization because you can
initialize the value of I to 10 then if
it we are not checking the condition
then this loop will run in a wrong
condition right so as soon as you
initialize the value it has to be
checked with the condition if it is true
it will directly come here and execute
the statements that are present in for
block after that it comes here in
increments the value of 5
okay that is I plus plus will increment
the value of I by 1
but presently it was zero then here it
will become one I equals to one it will
again come here and check the condition
after checking the condition if it finds
it true
it will move inside and it will again
execute the statements right here come
here it will increment the value of I it
will become 2 right now again take the
condition like that if we go 3 it again
goes 4 and when the value of I is become
5 it will check the condition that time
5 is not less than 5 it will get out of
the by for loop and it won't execute
these statements that time moving on I
come to a while loop
okay the while statement continually
excuse a block of statements while a
particular condition is true similarly
others as it is in a for loop it will
keep on and it will keep on executing
the statements again and again till the
condition is false right now if we see
the syntax of a while loop we have got
boil place a condition within the
parentheses right here on the basis of
this condition in the time it is true it
will keep on executing the statements
that are present in the while block now
if we see the sample right here you have
initialized the value I outside use the
while keyword in the parenthesis you
take the value of I you take whether the
value of I is less than 5 or not if it
is less than that it will move inside it
will first of all print the value of I
and then increment the value can you
show the definition again earlier says
the definition is the while statement
continually execute a block of
statements while a particular condition
is true okay
is that clear to you all you know every
one of you moving on
I hope this sample is also clear to you
ok I get yes is now now let's move on
and we'll check the while loop working
how does the while loop actually work
the while statement exactly evaluates
expression if the expression evaluates
to true the while statement executes the
statements that are presented
I'll block the while statement continues
executing it's block until the
expression evaluates to be true to false
okay until that is as as soon as the
condition is false it will just get out
of the while you now I come to the
working of a for-loop so if I loo first
of all the value of I gets initialized
then it is checked okay the value of I
gets checked in the while condition that
is whether it is less than five or not
as soon as it finds true it will get
inside it will execute the statements
right here and it will increment the
value of I after that it comes again
comes back and checks the value of i if
it finds true again that's come here it
will increment the value again it will
check the condition so it will keep on
running the cycle till the value of I is
not it less than five that means as soon
as it is equal to five it will get out
of the while loop so this is the flow
diagram this is the working of a while
loop right here we come to do while you
do while loop allows the code to be
executed at least once okay based on a
given boolean condition it will proceed
further similarly as in a while loop
there is a boolean value that it takes
similarly here it takes the boolean
value as the condition now instituted at
least once you'll understand this line
soon okay Elya says and the sentence for
a while loop be no idea it cannot be
like this it is the syntax for for loop
not for the while loop okay now if we
see the syntax right here offer do-while
loop how to write it write the keyword
do open the braces right here in the
braces place your condition statements
at the statement one and two after that
you place the vial keyword and within
that you place the condition on which
this loop will run sample is integer I
equals to zero do keyword open up the
braces place the statement right here
that the system dot out dot println I
you will increment the value of I and
finally close the braces after the are
try to buy
keyword and check the condition that is
I less than five now what is the working
of a do-while loop first the code within
the block is executed and then the
condition is evaluated okay that means
whatever is the court present in the do
I'll block gets executed first and after
that it checks the condition if the
condition is true the code within the
block is executed again this repeats
until the condition becomes false so
this is the working quite simple working
of this right here first the execution
of the block then checking the condition
okay and it will do the same thing
till the condition becomes false now
let's see the diagram and understand
what is the working of a do-while loop
first initialize the value of I that is
initialize a variable that will be
considered as the counter of the while
loop sorry the do-while loop then check
then move inside and execute the
statements right here after that
increment the value of I checked the
condition right here if the value of I
is less than 5 it will again come here
and execute the statements right here
increment the value of I and then check
the condition this process will be
followed till the condition of I is
equals to 5 as soon as as soon as it is
equals to 5 it will get out of the loop
and it would it won't execute the
statements after that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
