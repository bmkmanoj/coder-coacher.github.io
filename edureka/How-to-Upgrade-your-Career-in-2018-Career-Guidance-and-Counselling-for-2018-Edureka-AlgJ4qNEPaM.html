channel today I'm going to discuss about
10 ways to upgrade yourself in the IT
industry
I feel change is the only constant and
you need to continuously upgrade
yourselves reason is pretty simple the
technology is evolving really fast so
let's begin with our list at first we
have artificial intelligence so
artificial intelligence is a buzzword in
the industry right now everybody is
talking about AI if I have to tell you
what AI is in a nutshell yeah is about
creating artificial beings or software's
that have the power to think analyze and
make decisions on their own so there are
multiple job profiles that are related
to artificial intelligence but the
question is who should go for this
particular role I mean who can think of
making a career in artificial
intelligence so if you are a
statistician or a data analyst or data
scientist or even a senior manager who
has good business knowledge can
definitely go ahead and make a career in
artificial intelligence because you are
somewhere or the other might be using
the artificial intelligence concepts and
I would suggest minimum of two years of
experience is required for applying for
a role that is related to artificial
intelligence to all the freshers who are
watching this video right now don't be
disheartened you can definitely go ahead
and make a career in artificial
intelligence but you need to have the
required skill sets let's see what we
have in our list next so now we are
going to talk about blockchain so
blockchain is a technology that has
gained immense attention and interest
and he passed here being the core
underlying infrastructure for the most
popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin it has
grown well beyond the financial domain
and spread its root in all possible
domains let's talk about job roles now
so there are four major roles under this
technology freshers and developers can
look out for the job openings titled
blockchain developers these openings
mainly require knowledge of languages
like go solid atif Python Java and full
stack technologies like JavaScript
angularjs node.js this will help land
some really good opportunities
administrators and developers with
strong knowledge and Linux can also look
for blockchain engineer openings
blockchain is a technology which has a
great need for senior professionals and
those architects and consultants having
more than 10 years of experience can
definitely go ahead and move into this
domain with a nice alright and minimum
of two plus years of experience but
again experience doesn't really matter
if you have good hands-on knowledge on
the technology let's talk about
analytics now the rise in the digital
data in recent times has
analytics domain in the fourth front now
the question is again the same who
should go for it to name a few prominent
or relatable ones we have statisticians
developer system admins business admins
and even students with good quantitate
and analytical fields can give it a shot
now let's talk about the years of
experience required so companies usually
prefer with at least two years of
experience in the related field all
right
freshers have to go the hard way of
interning to gain some valuable
experience in the domain now one of the
job profiles available in the market so
analytics actually opens a lot of job
profiles like data engineers business
analysts business intelligence big data
architects machine learning and AI
engineers and data scientists but to be
a data scientist you need to have a lot
of experience and exemplary analytical
skills let's see what we have in our
list next now we are going to talk about
data sign now data science is all about
making the data talk to us it is an
umbrella term which encompasses multiple
domains such as statistical analysis
machine learning data visualization data
manipulation and these are few that I'm
telling you right even the data
analytics an artificial intelligence
that we discussed is a part of data
science broadly speaking you can target
job profiles like data analysts data
scientists machine learning expert
business analysts and data architect for
targeting the role of a data scientist
you would need to have an experience of
at least five years and should have a
strong base in statistics there's a lot
of demand for statisticians in the field
of data science as a job requires you
want to come up with complex ignored
them to deal with ever-increasing data
so I hope you have got my point and
understood the difference between data
science data analysts and artificial
intelligence as a data scientist you
should be familiar with the machine
learning algorithm which is nothing but
a subset of artificial intelligence
let's talk about cloud computing now the
cloud computing is all about using
someone else's server rather than your
own machines you can think of it as
renting servers on the Internet whose
usage is measured in minutes that is if
you rent a server for 20 minutes you'll
only have to pay for 20 minutes now this
business model has become so successful
that Gartner a popular research firm
says by 2020 a corporate no cloud policy
will be as rare as in no Internet policy
today interesting isn't it obviously
since the demand of cloud computing is
growing so rapidly
a large void of jobs has been created in
this domain the few Joe profiles that
you may come across are cloud architect
cloud developers and cloud
administrators again the question
remains is safe who can apply for these
jobs I believe it's very easy for
developers and administrators to map
themselves with cloud developers and
cloud administrators apart from these
roles you guys can upgrade yourself to
architects the architects role can also
be mapped to DevOps professionals and
also anyone or everyone who is from a
technical background the job and salary
that you guys will grab as a cloud
professional will depend on the kind of
experience and the kind of knowledge the
hands-on knowledge that you bring to the
table let's talk about DevOps long now
this might be an odd one out because
it's not a technology it is a
methodology DevOps is an amalgamation of
two groups of professionals involved in
the software development lifecycle
software developers and idea operations
these roles are brought closer to
eliminate the friction that can arise
between them because development and
deployment go hand in hand separating
the folks working on either projects can
lead to internal conflicts related to
day-to-day tasks and I think who are
only working the industry right now can
actually relate to these kind of
problems that they face in their
organization so who can become a divorce
from passional the obvious ones include
software developers and testing
professionals who are directly involved
in building the software application
beside IT admins or IT operations who
are responsible for deploying the
software to production and monitoring
the application even network engineers
who work on security and infrastructure
setup can also move into this role
finally even cloud architects who have a
keen interest to implement various
DevOps tools on the cloud can make their
career in divorce anybody with an
experience of 1 to 8 years can seek to
become a DevOps efficient now what are
the various roles in the market there
are divorce engineers there divorce
infrastructure architects divorce cloud
architect release manager software
developers QA engineers server
Architects implementation experts etc
etc few of them we have listed down in
the slides there are many more now even
if you're a fresher you can go ahead and
make a career in DevOps
you should have basic understanding of
Linux and anyone scripting language you
should be familiar with that is the
prerequisite for DevOps guys let's talk
about web development now as a name
suggests web development is about
building and maintenance of websites it
is considered as evergreen field as
every company needs a website now the
best part is that - bag of web
development job you don't require any
specialized degree let
anyone can hop into this field provided
you are good at programming namely
JavaScript CSS and HTML overall you can
say that there are three job profiles in
this case front-end developer that takes
care of layout design and interactivity
of the website they can take an idea
from the drawing board and turn it into
a reality what do you see in the website
are all brought together by the
front-end developers second is the
back-end developer who is responsible
for handling what is going on behind the
scenes that is handling the server
hosting the website and app for running
it on a database last is full stalkers
who take care of both that is front-end
and the backend I need to know how the
web works on all levels naturally
working up to this level of expertise
will take longer as there is more to
learn so at 8 we have a big data in our
list the big data is no longer a
buzzword in the industry most of the
industries are using big data analytics
to gain business insights as per a
report from the International Data
Corporation there's a serious shortage
of skilled workforce in the big data
sphere and big data market would be
worth at least forty six point three
four billion dollars by 2018 so people
with deep analytical expertise will be
needed by 2018 and I would say this is a
right time to move to Big Data
technologies let me give you a few
reasons first is soaring demand for
analytical professionals and there are
lot of job opportunities in the big data
field and the salary that you can expect
after that is also pretty good and big
data analytics has become a top priority
in a lot of organization and especially
now when this unstructured and
semi-structured data is rising
exponentially you need people who can
handle that and that is not nothing but
what a big data professional does in the
company and if you're a fresher or you
have experience between one to four
years you can start with the big data
technology like Hadoop and spark and can
become a Hadoop or spark developer but
the actual power of Big Data can only be
understood if you master multiple Big
Data framework and this will only come
with experience let's talk about
cybersecurity guys we are all on board
of the Internet chip started in 1908
today Internet has grown deep into our
lives much like our genes every aspect
of our life involves the Internet and
the cyberspace in this era cyber
security is one of the most sought out
professions in the IT industry cyber
security or IT security is all about
protecting computer systems from the
theft and damage to their hardware
software or information as well as from
disruption or misdirection of these
services there are a lot of job profiles
available in the field of cyber security
namely networking
cloud architects quality analysts
database administrators typically you
need somewhere around three to five
years of experience in the profiles that
I've discussed to move into
cybersecurity the few jobs which are
available for you to grab our cloud
architects security adviser cyber
security consultants plunk enterprise
security admins and implementation
engineers let's see what we have lost in
our list so now we are going to talk
about project management project manager
are change agents they make project
goals their own and use their skills and
expertise to inspire a sense of shared
purpose within the project team they
enjoy the organized adrenaline of new
challenges and the responsibility of
driving business results for targeting a
project managers rule you need to have
minimum of five years of experience
professionals who already have
leadership experiences like being a
technical lead engineer delivery lead of
people management skills a best suited
for the project manager role as a
project manager you could be either be a
program manager who is responsible for
multiple related project or you could be
a portfolio manager responsible for
selection prioritization and alignment
of projects and programs within an
organization strategy so by this we come
to the end of our list guys I hope you
