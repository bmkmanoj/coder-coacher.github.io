Eureka and welcome to this in Eureka a
live session on power bi tutorial now
Poppaea has gained a lot of popularity
off recently and is considered next to
tableau which is the markets Dominator
as well now in today's session we'll
start off by first understanding why do
we actually need business intelligence
solutions and what exactly is
self-service business intelligence now
when I talk about business intelligence
and self-service business intelligence
it basically is a level below as such
now we'll go on from there and talk
about why power bi in comparison to the
other self-service business intelligence
tools in the market and then we'll talk
a little more about what power bi is
what it does and we'll be playing around
by creating a demo wherein we create a
report and a dashboard as well
now I hope you guys are quite excited
for this session please make sure that
you put across your questions in the
chat box so that either you or my team
can take up all your questions now
the first topic of this session is what
does business needs today now one of the
major thing that any business needs is
that they need to crew now for me to
grow I need to understand how I am doing
and for that I need to go back to my
data as such today there's a lot of data
that gets generated in the market but
the challenge there is that they need to
get insights they need to understand
what those data represents are such now
to do this and who basically needs this
data there are basically two levels or
two kinds of people who actually need
this data first comes your business
executed and then comes your business
analysts business executors are those
people who make the decisions out there
people who decide how the company grows
are such now as an analyst one of the
biggest challenges that you have is that
you cannot present raw data like this I
cannot go up to someone senior to me and
tell them okay this is the data of the
organization please understand and make
a business decision it becomes a
challenge for them for them to
understand better they need it in a way
which catches their eye makes it clear
in just one go that how it goes now what
I see here firstly I can see my number
of sales in the pipe
my total accounts I can see my opening
opportunities that I can conquer as well
as the expected revenue for this year as
well so there's so much data here at
this so it makes it easier for me to
make decisions get better understanding
and this is what is helpful as well but
let's say if I want some more details
then I can go on to one of the reports I
can just open up okay this gives me a
little more insights as well so it gives
them a lot of freedom to play around
with and get insights from a senior
levels aspect so this is what is
self-service business intelligence
actually it is a combination or it's a
platform wherein people who are coming
from a technical background as well as
non-technical background can play around
with the data and get insights as well
you don't need to work with very
expensive tools like tableau out there
to get to create great visuals or you
don't need to buy expensive
transformation or processing tools like
informatica which costs a bomb as well
if you're not generating enough data
these are the kind of tools that help
you now we've talked about what we can
do but there are certain challenges to
reach this stage as well now when I talk
about the challenges one of the first
challenge is that usually within an
organization the data is scattered
across different domains in different
locations as well departments so it gets
scattered around so what I need to do is
that I need to extract the data from
different sources as well now apart from
this another challenge here is that the
data in itself can be stored in
different formats as such there could be
some log files that would be some
database tables there could be some flat
files my data could be scattered across
different file types as well and the
third challenge would be is that I need
to bring this data
I need to bring it to a uniform format
as well and then finally I need to even
store that so I need to load it
somewhere as well from where it becomes
a single source of truth as well so this
is what is one of the major challenges
which business intelligence actually
tackled across now business intelligence
is not a setup
it basically is not a predefined process
as such it's a combination of various
techniques and tools which will actually
you gather your data from the different
sources where it's scattered across and
then process it and store it into a
single location known as data warehouse
now data warehouse and database
themselves are not quite different as
such basically the difference is with
respect to the purpose what you use them
now in a database what you basically do
is that you write your data mostly
whereas in a data warehouse it's mainly
used for reading and understanding as
well so this is one of the interesting
differences between both and one of the
major cycles or what I would say
techniques use there would be your ETL
process data warehousing steps so there
are various ways that you can achieve
this as well but if I have to define the
entire process involved here I need to
first prepare my data I need to
integrate it to a common source I need
to manipulate with respect to it which
then becomes my single source of
information from here on even a
non-technical person can come in they
can create visualization and go on to
give better insights with respect to the
data to the senior management as well
now this would have not in this section
itself one of the major challenge was
the left-half was done by technical
people and right-half was done by
non-technical people
so this is where self-service business
intelligence came in and made power bi
quite effective so self-service business
intelligence basically is an approach to
data analytics and ETA visualization
which enables business users to work
around with the data play around with
whatever they want as well as at the
same time not having in-depth technical
knowledge with respect to the
applications are such so it's a very
interesting approach which has gained a
lot of popularity and has bought in a
lot of people from different domains to
this domain as well now when I come to
why power bi as such there are a lot of
tools that are available in this market
these are just eight of the top reasons
that I would pick up now when I go in
the anti clock manner the first thing
that I would definitely like to
highlight can see oh that's low upfront
cost now in comparison to most business
intelligence tools out there barber
offers you a lot of feature at a cheap
cost you
if you ask me about the pricing it's
about $10 a month for using power bi
that's on a pro version and you always
have a free version as well now when you
come down to the next feature that is
the API for integration what Microsoft
has done here is that they have created
various api's through which you can
integrate your data from different
sources as well it's made it quite easy
for anyone without to have even write
code so you just have to select which
kind of data sources and then give them
information so the API completely comes
pre-configured making it quite easy for
us to use as well in terms of
customization with respect to the
application then it gives me a lot with
respect to that same I can change things
around as I want and I can go around and
visualize it as for my interest or play
around with the data and itself as per
my interest as such so there's a lot of
features there with respect to that now
one thing that I really appreciate about
Microsoft is that they've still made it
extremely user friendly as well it's
quite easy for anyone to do not used
tools business intelligence tools before
also can come down and start with power
bi as such now one thing that really is
interesting here which is basically in
the beta stage now but is gaining a lot
of developer interest as well is the
code 9 integration it would be really
interesting if I can actually have an
artificial intelligence or a virtual are
still present there would make all my
work easy as well so this is something
that's quite interesting in the market
right now in comparison to the other
tools and even in terms of analytical
feature power Barre is not behind yes
we've seen we've talked about the data
integration part the data visualization
part but in terms of data analytics also
it's not quite far it has its internal
and analytical engine as well as it lets
you write and execute our script as well
as python scripts on the tool itself
thereby making it quite easy for you and
in terms of mobility and machine
learning q features these are something
that are in development but again
mobility it gives you the ease to watch
your reports and dashboards on your
phone itself so even any application or
that power bi supports its present its
present on the Android store its press
on the iOS tool even on the Windows
Store as well so you can have your
reports and dashboards on the go as such
now if you are integrating or storing
your data on ashore then you can also
perform machine learning and get
real-time data and understanding of your
data on power bi itself so you can
configure it with respect to as your
platform as such now the key factor here
that does not come into the picture here
is that power bi in itself by default is
a free software as such so if you want
to make the payment definitely you can
do that if you are impressed by it
there are various additional features
that come with the Profi feature so
definitely you can do that if not your
well and good to stay with the free
application as well now what exactly is
probably and we've been talking about
power bi power beer for this long so I
think you might be wondering by enough
now Pavia basically is the latest of
business intelligence tools released by
Microsoft in 2014 and is has gained a
lot of popularity of recently it is a
desktop based application but at the
same time has a cloud-based
infrastructure present to it which makes
it quite easy faster and effective in
comparison to the other tools as well
now let's actually look at Barbie let's
start from power bi desktop to get a
good understanding and exposure to how
it works on a day to day basis now again
let me show you the data set that we are
using this is basically a financial data
set of an retail organization and we'll
be working with this as part of the
session so this is my power bi desktop
interface so this is these welcome
screen that I always get when I open
power bi now if you are interested to
download and work with power bi you can
always go on to the power buys website
and download it and get started as well
now when I want to start off let me
first show you how I can pulled it off
from where I can get my data as such so
these are the various data sources from
which I can get my data into power bi
now this is also something that is
helping power bi grow so well because
there are multiple sources most of the
common most of the popular data sources
I should say a present on power bi so
let me begin by loading the retail or
retail financial data set okay now one
good feature that power where does is
that before you load your data actually
it gives you a preview of your data's
but so let's say if you face or if you
see some inconsistencies you can
directly go on to edit them before it's
loaded on to power bi okay I see a
question asking will it support Oracle
DB definitely it will support or actally
B so my data has gotten loaded here now
just to give you a simple tour of the
tool as such now what you're seeing here
by default is the visualization or
report workspace so this is basically
the workspace where you'll be creating
all the reports visualizations and
you'll be initiating the dashboard
creation as well
now the next workspace is the data
workspace so this is the place where you
can play around with your data and
definitely anyone coming from our
database background will love this space
as such because it gives you a lot of
opportunity to play around as well now
power bi in itself also has a separate
query language known as Dax which is
quite interesting and easy for people
who are coming from non-technical
background as such now if you take a
simple overview of the data I have
different segments to which my product
goes I know the countries product which
discount band does it fall into the
total number of units sold and so forth
so basically it's a simple data set and
there are about 700 rows present here
now the third workspace is the relation
workspace so basically when you're
working with multiple tables one of the
major thing that you need to always keep
in mind is the relationships between the
tables themselves how a primary key
foreign key relationship is defined
whether it's a one to one relationship
it's a one-to-many relationships so all
these things need to be kept in mind and
this is the workspace that you will be
playing around with so you can
manipulate with different data source
well if you I would have shown if I had
a different data set with respect to
this but not a problem next session
we'll definitely look into that where
we'll be creating a complete structure
or relation between database data
sources coming from different formats we
can
create database we can have a flat file
we can also try to include a drawer with
respect to that definitely that is
something I'm quite sure most of you
would like to see now coming back let's
oh one thing that I would definitely
like to show here is that if you want to
play around with your data this is the
workspace where you are actually getting
a preview or the complete view of the
data as such but if you want to play
around you have to go on to this option
called edit queries and it gives you the
query editor so this is the actual place
where you can play around so again there
are a lot of predefined options present
here itself which makes it quite easy
for even non-technical people to use it
people who are coming who are not used
to distance intelligence tool makes it
quite easy for them as well now let me
close this and let's begin by creating a
visualization now there are two ways
that you can create a visualization
first is that you can click on any of
the default visualization option present
here and it will create an empty shell
of that visualization or what you can do
is you can select one of the data
sources and then drag it and drop it to
the workspace so this in turn will make
it quite easy for power bi to create a
default or a sample visualization as
well now let me show that to you now if
I bring the sales data and I put it on
here what it has done is that it has
given me a bar chart and it's given me
with respect to my sales data but this
is not what I want to see I want to have
a single view that tells me what is my
total sales as such so I'll use
something known as a card visualization
so here what it has done is given me a
single point of information which is the
updated information regarding my sales
same time I want to see my profit as
well so I'll take my profit I'll drag it
and drop it here and I'll change it to
the card which lies Asian so in one
place I have a view to my sales as well
as my profit so it's an easy view okay
now let's say with this I want to also
define this based on the date I have
sold these products so I'll bring in the
date and I'll add it here but what it is
doing is that it's crying to create by
default a cluster column chart so
is not what I want I wanna have a slicer
where I can change the range with
respect to the dates as well so I'll
click on slicer and automatically it has
changed to visualization now again most
of these visualizations are
interchangeable so this gives you a lot
of playground to play around with and
when it comes to data visualization
tools there's no defined wave to
represent a certain data as such so it's
all left into the imagination of the
creator how you want to represent this
insight or information as such now what
I want to do next is that I want to have
a map based so for that what I'll do is
that I'll bring the details of my sales
okay so my sales comes here I'll bring
in the detail of my discount and I'll
make it based on the countries which I
have shifted to so immediately when I
bring in the country it is again going
to detail so let me change it to a map
visualization so now what it has done is
that it's taken the locations and it has
given me the sales amount okay and the
color of the region is defined by the
discount as such now how do I know that
I'm just seeing it in the workspace here
so this basically is a drag-and-drop
interface as well when you can lower or
play around with the data so the third
way to improve or change a visualization
is that you can select a column from
here and you can drag and drop it into
this workspace as such now if you don't
like the color here there's the format
tab present here and where you can go on
and play with the color as well now
let's say I want to give different
colors then I'll enable divergence I'll
say red as my minimum white as my center
and green as my maximum so if you see
here the color has changed there's a pre
pred there's a light red this light
green and then there's dark green so
there's a neutral color here as well so
and this is how you play around with
visualizations are such now one thing
let's see if I have a very if I want to
create a very detailed
view or let's say of detail
visualization which gives me an insight
then what I'll do is that let me take a
slightly complex one let me take the
profits I'll bring in the discounts and
here or let me say let me remove okay
let me keep this visualization for later
what I'll do is that let me bring in the
details of my segments the number of
units sold in these segments and then
let me add I think segments to count of
distinct segments let me keep it count
as such okay and here again let me bring
in the details of product okay so this
is something that power bi is trying to
fit in but this is not how I want it as
such I want it in a three map format so
what it has done it has given me the
details of my segment by unit sold and
in terms of products as such so this is
a combination of multi-level data inputs
that have come together okay now I want
to create something more interesting for
you let me see a scatter plot so this is
something that will definitely be
interesting so to my scatter plot let me
add a level of complex values let me
bring in my sale price let me bring in
my manufacturing post profits as well
and I'll do it based on my products now
what it has done is that it's given
various combinations here I have just
thrown a set of a certain amount of
columns and power bi in itself has
understood that these are the new values
that come in let me try to improve this
let me see what suits best and
definitely it creates a visualization
here now again in terms of separating
these regions are such let me just go on
here you have options for different
values that come as the final output so
I'll give this let's say black I'll give
one red one gets the light color blue so
this is the combination now I just mixed
out the colors and since I've changed
the colors themselves it's made it quite
easy for me to differentiate as well now
one of the things that you might be
wondering at this point is some of you
might have heard about tableau as such
and you might be wondering how is this
visualization tool different from top
now the reason that it's different from
tableau is that firstly even on the
freeware or the free app free mode of
power bi you can connect it with
different data sources as well and you
have a level of data analytical
capabilities present here as such now in
terms of visualization definitely I feel
tableau is a bit higher but tableau
basically is just a data visualization
tool here you have various features as
well as additional usage for both
technical and non-technical people
giving them a lot more ground to player
out with okay now the same thing now
let's say if I want to go and create a
dashboard from this information so then
what you need to first do is that first
you need to save this report and let me
call this
and I'll just save this now the default
extension of a power bi file is dot P bi
X okay now it's saved so you see this
option here so what it does is that it's
going to publish this report on power bi
services as such
now power bi service is basically a
cloud-based platform for your power bi
and that is the workspace where you will
be actually see creating your dashboard
as such ok so now what it has done is
that it has published this report on to
my power pier it's those we can let me
go here let me just so this is the
default power bi service workspace now
I've basically connected the previous
data to my Salesforce cloud so what you
had seen initially was from my
Salesforce cloud itself so definitely
I'm sure that that would have seemed
interesting for most of you as well now
here you can see there's a report called
power bi live one so that was what we
had seen the report us so now what you
see here is that the report is present
here as well now you might be wondering
ok if the report is present here and you
also have an option to edit the report
here as well why should I actually use
power bi desktop which way I was using
earlier as well the reason being is
because you would have a lot more data
manipulation capability and it's quite
flexible as well for the user as well so
now if you're manipulating and creating
everything on the cloud then if you need
to have constant connectivity as well
using the desktop application I can even
create a report while I'm on the go as
such ok so this is the report and in
case if you want to create a dashboard
then what you need to do is that first
you need to pin a visual to the
dashboard as such pinning basically is
placing the visual on to the dashboard
as such now the first time that you pin
a visual it will ask you whether you
want to create a new dashboard or pin to
an existing dashboard now it's since I
had don't have any existing dashboards
let me call this bi life and I'll pin it
to it now once the first visualization
has been pinned
I can move on and I can see it in my
existing dashboard as such
okay let me pin this sorry about that so
the eight slicers are specific to your
visualize reports I'm sorry because when
you go onto a dashboard as such it is a
static view as that's where in it does
not give the use of the complete freedom
to change with respect to anything
depicted that although the data which
comes into the power beer report is
always refreshing and growing as such
but the dashboard visualizations are
static as such we saying that when we go
on to our works dashboard let me pin
this one as well and the third option is
that yes okay now let me go on to show
you my dashboard which has been created
here so too many notifications with
power bi okay so here what it has done
it has created and given me a single
view which I can see for B whatever
information I want as such now one of
the interesting things here is that if
you want to play or you want to go more
in detail with respect to anything or
you want to change any differences with
respect to that then you just need to
click on that visualization as such so
this in turn will redirect you to the
report where this visualization is
better so even in case you are working
with multiple reports or you're working
with multiple data sources and reports
one single visualization can be
interesting to someone so if they want
more information they just press on it
okay and one of the other interesting
features about power bi dashboard is
that once you've created a dashboard
it's quite easy for you to share this
dashboard with anyone as well so once
you click on the share option it asks
you the email of that person and they
have the access to view this dashboard
as so whenever they want to see it they
can just go to the report as such and
the other interesting fact that has
bought my interest into power bi as such
was the Q&amp;amp;A feature of power bi now
power bi in itself has a natural
language processing system associated
with patellas server which makes it
quite easy for anyone now let
say I want to identify total sales on
January 2014
so what cure it has done is that it has
converted this request of mine and it
has given me an output in terms of over
schwa now let me go a little more detail
let's say which region or let's say
which month had best sale
I'm sorry about that now again when it
has continuous increase what it is
understanding is that it's not able to
identify this now this is again a work
in progress but definitely this is
something that is interesting
okay so again profits month okay it's
given me profits per month so this is a
different visualization so definitely
this is something that makes it easier
for anyone to work and play around with
now again there are various filters that
you can add on to this visualization
there are various fields that you can
play around with here as well so it's
quite interesting for your factor as
such now let me go back to my
presentation and with this let me just
summarize what we have discussed as part
of the session we started off by first
understanding what is power bi but
before that we talked about business
intelligence we understood about self
service business intelligence we talked
about the major features of power bi we
talked about what is power bi and you
had a look at the demo as well with
power bi and power bi service now in
