and I welcome you all to today's session
today we are going to get started with
AWS that is Amazon Web Services but
before we do that let's quickly take a
look at today's agenda first well I
would be starting things off with why
cloud and what it is I would also
discuss its different features and why
are we doing this because AWS is a
secure cloud service provider and it is
important we understand what is cloud
first once we've understood this then we
would get into the nitty gritties of AWS
that is what it is white is needed what
is its global architecture and how to
choose a region in a diverse I would
also talk about different AWS domains
finally I would finish things off with
the demo part I hope this agenda is
clear to all of you so let's not waste
any time and get started then well this
was the scenario before cloud computing
came into picture in order to host a
website you would be obviously needing
some space so there was a need to buy a
stack of servers also keeping the peak
traffic in mind the servers as in
whether to buy them more or buy less
servers was considered and monitoring
and maintenance off your servers was
another thing that was considered now
what did the situation give rise to well
they were following disadvantages one
the cost now servers are very costly and
if you are buying a stack of servers it
is going to cost you a fortune
now imagine you have to buy say 2 to 3
petabytes of memory and our servers
rather so what you do in order to buy
this space you invest money upfront and
say for example you need this space for
2 years there's a high possibility that
you might be using only 10% of these
resources what about the remaining 90%
well they are kind of underused for
maybe 6 months 1 year or whatever it is
and after that they come into use so in
this case you are wasting a lot of
resources that is your space plus you
are also investing a lot of money so
this was one disadvantage again
troubleshooting these problems as an
taking care of servers and all those
things was another tedious task and that
kind of diode had people from the main
business goals and that wasn't
convenient apart from that this traffic
it varies now there might be some odds
in the day where the traffic is very
high and in remaining gas your website
or your server is idle and it's doing
nothing so say for example you invest in
10 servers and those 10 servers are
fully utilized only for 3 hours a day
and remaining 21 hours the traffic is
very less say only 3 servers are
required so you are actually wasting 70%
of your resources so you end up paying
more you end up underutilizing
or at times while utilizing your
resources and that can be a problem
apart from that there is another
important factor which one needs to
consider the amount of data that is
growing these days this data is huge and
the fact that people are using Internet
so much it's understandable that people
would be referring and using this
digital data and it has expected that
this traffic is going to rise three
times in coming two or three years so
yes there's a lot of data and there's a
problem where do we store this data how
do we keep it secure how do we manage it
whatever the hardware issues the
maintenance issues and there's so many
questions and what is the solution for
all these things well it is cloud you
can move your data from the local
systems to cloud which has infinitely
huge amount of space which you can use
you can store all your data there on
cloud and let the cloud providers take
care of all the issues what this does is
this kind of helps you solve a lot of
problems one you are paying only for the
services and resources which you are
using this payment which you do in most
of the cases is on timely basis that is
you pay only for the time duration for
which you use the services also it is
highly affordable so you do not have to
worry about your app scaled down scale
you do not have to worry about the time
for which you would be using the
resources and you do not have to worry
about the other hardware and all those
issues as well so this is where cloud
comes into picture and it helps you
almost all the problems that were there
before cloud came in to exist
so what exactly is this cloud and how
does it help us solve all these problems
well you can imagine cloud as nothing
but a connection of networks servers and
computers basically and these servers
and computers are basically owned by
some third party and they reside
somewhere on the globe what
organizations do is this is go ahead and
keep and by these huge stacks of servers
and you're only expected to go ahead and
rent these services so that you can make
optimal and proper use of these services
it actually lets you manage store
process and access your data and all you
need is internet you can sit anywhere in
the world and you can have access to
these resources or your resources which
lie on the cloud so this is where cloud
computing is so effective so what
exactly is this architecture and what
does it do normally the applications
these days which people use are multi
tier so what you do is you are sitting
at some place on the earth somewhere
with your internet services and you want
to access your data or your resources
what do you do is you just have your
interface and your internet you type in
your request and there is something
called as a middleware which takes in
your request and forwards it or sensor
to the backend where your data resides
now this is a collection of servers and
different computers which are kind of in
a network so what happens is your
request is sent there your data is fist
and it is sent back to you where you can
easily refer it and you do not have to
worry about any complications whatsoever
because your data is residing on the
reader base or on the cloud and there
are people who take care of your data
your hardware issues you do not have to
worry about the hardware issues as an a
my resource is getting updated are my
applications getting updated is the
sufficient space to use this data how is
this data getting stored who is taking
care of it what about the security
issues the compliance issues well
everything is taken care by experts and
all you have to worry about is just
consuming this resources and this is
where I feel cloud computing or cloud
has solved a law
of problems that was related to data
website and online applications so this
is about the basic architecture as far
as the cloud computing goes now let us
quit and take a look at different
features with cloud computing has to
offer
and we've discussed quite a few of these
already but let's try to put little more
light on these points now what cloud
computing does is it provides you with
on-demand provisioning when I say this I
mean you can ask for whatever you want
whenever you want and in the amount you
want this means when you talk about
scalability it can happen in minutes and
you can up scale down scale depending
upon your acquirements and your business
problems basically then what to do is
you only pay for those resources which
are actually consuming so it is very
cost effective and when I say you pay
only for those resources even the amount
you pay is again very lists as I've
already mentioned in the beginning
servers buying those can be very costly
but when you rent those using these
cloud service providers they are very
very affordable and the amount that has
been invested these days is very less
compared to what it was invested back
into thousands or early to thousands so
yes even the cost for cloud computing
investments or the cloud has dropped
down a lot in last 10 to 15 years and
whatever you paid these days is very
very very less abstract resources now
you have to stop worrying about as I've
already mentioned what happens in the
background the hardware and all those
things you just focus on your business
goals and that's it plus you can focus
on the things which you are efficient at
and the experts will take care of the
remaining problems that we just
discussed
apart from that whatever you use is
measurable so the time factor the cost
factor and the money factor everything
gets optimized here so these are the
features why cloud computing is so
valuable now that you've understood what
cloud computing is what cloud is let us
go ahead and see what are the different
cloud service providers to be honest the
quite a few service providers in the
market we have IBM cloud Microsoft Azure
we have Google cloud platform Dropbox or
these service providers are great but it
obvious leads the way now why is that
well the quite a few reasons why a de
base is so popular let's move further
and try to understand these reasons
first of all the cloud computing market
share
well a Debus has the highest share and
when I say that it is 69% that is it is
twice the amount if you compare it with
all the other global cloud service
providers combined that is which is just
31% now if you compare it with Microsoft
Azure which is the second best it is
less than twice the total amount which
it abuse has to offer and that is a huge
amount now if you talk about server
capacity similar is the case actually it
is even better for AWS here how we talk
about server capacity all the other
competitors combined they provide you
with a server capacity of X whereas AWS
would provide you with 6x of server
capacity and that is again huge and used
by huge margins if you talk about
pricing a Amazon Web Services highly
flexible it provides you with two
options one is pay only for what you use
that is you'd be paying only for those
services and only for the time duration
you use them for say for example I'm
using maybe 2 petabytes of data for 2
hours a day I would be paying it for
only 2 hours of day and 2 petabytes only
plus it also provides you the feature
called as pay less as you use more
resources that means the more the
resources you use more the services you
use you'd end up paying a lot lesser so
when you have such flexible pricing such
great share in the market and server
capacity no wonder you would be the best
tool in the market or the service
provider and that is what it abuses now
let us try to understand what exactly a
double uses well it stands for meson web
services which I've already mentioned
what it does is it gives you a platform
or a policy with cloud computing
capabilities it is a remote computing
service it gives you storage abilities
provides you with bandwidth to do all
the things you want to and it has great
customer support and you
huge customized approach to our api's or
application protocol interfaces all in
all a great tool to have when you talk
about the cloud services so who are the
companies that use it of yours and the
quite a few companies in the market that
actually use database and to be honest
almost every company has its foot into
it obvious in some way or the other
because everybody needs cloud services
to name a few you have Netflix we have
Adobe we have read it Amazon now all
these companies the amount of traffic
which they handle every day is huge and
they're being used globally so it's
understandable how powerful Amazon Web
Services is and if you are using aw
should be sharing space with these
companies which is a wonderful thing to
have so what does AWS do as an how does
it go ahead and provide you with all
these services and all those things
let's go ahead and try to understand it
architecture are its approach towards
providing cloud services well basically
it's architecture or at framework is
kind of divided into regions zones and
as locations let's try to understand
these a little more well the structure
is basically divided into regions and
availability zones
I would also come back to education but
let's stick to these two first
well what interface does is it kind of
has its multiple data centers across the
world in different globe locations what
this does is it helps AWS expand its
reach now if I'm sitting in India I
would be wanting a resource that is
close to me or the cloud service
provider that is close to me so if there
are data centers in India and if I'm in
India it would be easier for me to
access this aww platform so what it is
does is it does exactly that it has its
data centers all across the globe and
these data centers are called as your
regions and each of these regions will
have multiple replications and these
replications are called as availability
zones say for example the one in India
which is in Mumbai has two availability
zones now this is how the architecture
looks like or this is how the reach is
when you talk about a database I can see
the Centers almost everywhere you talk
about
again you talk about California Virginia
Sao Paulo
now Sao Paulo for example it has three
availability zones that is indicated by
the number in the circle which is there
now again if you go to Mumbai as I've
already mentioned it has two data
centers or rather to availability zones
so this is how the infrastructure or the
global infrastructure of AWS looks like
so what are these as locations which I
mentioned about a while back well say
for example I'm based in India and I do
not have a data center here I'm kind of
forced to use a data center which is and
maybe Virginia so I have to have my data
in Virginia and I have to access it from
India which might cause a lot of
problems the latency issues and all
those things what if there was a center
which was there in the interim or in
between or maybe a bridge or a platform
kind of a thing that helped me connect
these two places
well that connector is called as an his
location which helps me overcome these
problems of latency and all those things
so yeah this is how the infrastructure
basically looks like and I believe it is
fairly easy and simple to understand so
let us move further and try to
understand the next topic then how does
one choose the right reason now yes if
we have so many regions there would
obviously be a question if I am based in
India what are the things I need to
consider if I'm based in London what are
the things I need to consider there's so
many points to start with we have
something called as pricing now these
pricing they vary from region to region
for example the one in London would be
costlier than the one that is based in
Ireland that is in Dublin so you might
want to consider that as well other
issues are customer and user location
also where are you based
since you are based in a movie on the
eastern end of the world and you want to
access something that is on the western
world that might be little inconvenient
for you and also for the service
providers so it is wise you pick a
region or choose a region that serves
your purposes
apart from that we have latency which
I've already discussed depending upon
the latency would also want to choose
the region so that your services are
provided to you at a faster rate
security and compliance requirement now
these might also vary from government to
government different countries have
different laws and accordingly these
compliance require
may also vary service availability now
this is also another important point
because not all the reasons will have
all the services which you need so
depending upon that you might also be
forced to choose a region differently so
these are the features or these are the
reasons rather why you need to be
careful when you choose your service
provider or your region so based on
these reasons you can always go ahead
and pick a right region that meets your
needs I hope this is clear to all of you
so let's move further and try to
understand the next topic so yeah next
what we have here is different domains
in AWS and they're quite a few domains
which provide you with different kinds
of services we have something called as
compute a computer has various services
like we have ec2 lambda
elastic Beanstalk auto scaling and etc
now ec2 this a very popular service that
is called as elastic cloud compute you
can think of it as a Ross server using
which you can basically host your
websites applications etc and in simple
words it's a clean slate
say for example you buy a new laptop
where you start from the very beginning
where you install the OS which you like
you install the applications you like
and you start using it it is that kind
of a thing and it is highly flexible it
is highly resizable and customizable to
be honest then we have other services
like lambda it is something that cannot
host websites but it takes care of all
the background tasks that are there one
more application similar to it is
elastic Beanstalk but yes it can host
websites and how is it similar or
dissimilar to ec2 well in elastic
Beanstalk yes you can go ahead and host
our websites and do all these things
with ec2 does but ec2 as I've already
mentioned it is more of a clean slate
kind of a thing whereas elastic
Beanstalk think of it as a place where
you already have libraries say for
example you have to use Java so your
elastic Beanstalk is something that will
have all these our libraries and you can
just go ahead and use Java there
so this is the difference between ec2
and elastic Beanstalk where elastic
beanstalk
I will support the defined applications
whereas your ec2 is more cleanslate kind
of a thing so these are the compute
services which AWS provides you with
then you have something called as
migration now this is where you move or
migrate your data to and fro from your
applications or the place where you
reside
to your cloud now this migration happens
online as well as offline yes there is
something called as snowball what it
does is this service actually lets you
physically move your data now why do you
need to move your data physically well
say for example you need to move your
data from XYZ place to your data center
at AWS which is at maybe ABC place so
and if this data is huge it is wise to
move it physically it is similar to
sending a mail to one of your employees
now if you are just supposed to send him
mmm our minutes of meeting what you do
is you just go ahead and type of mail
and send it to him but what if you had
to send him say maybe 10 or 15 movies or
video clips you would instead give him
the hard disk in person and ask that
person to use it right similar is with
the data which you have if the data is
in huge amounts it is affordable and
advisable to transfer them physically
and that can be done by using one of
these services which is called as
snowball next we have security and
compliance now the quite a few services
again that come under this demand we
have I am we have kms now I am is
basically nothing but identification and
authentication management tool where
users are identified they are validated
and authenticated to use the services
that AWS provides then you have
something called as kms which is more of
an encryption kind of services and where
you can create your public and private
keys but it is very important to
understand that the private keys which
are created are kind of risky to use
that is you have to be very careful with
it that would not lose access or use of
these keys so yes kms and IMR the
security and compliance services which
a de base has to provide you with then
you have something called a storage and
database services now storage and
database services are little different
from each other that we'll discuss those
first let's stick to storage well under
the storage domain they're quite a few
of the services we have your standard
object-oriented file system called as s3
now what s3 does is it basically deals
in objects and buckets kind of a
scenario now what do I mean by this your
files are treated as objects and your
root folder is basically a bucket which
holds your data now when you dump these
files or when you store these files into
a bucket you have to make sure that it
is on the root folder and you kind of
store your data using or in the form of
objects into this root folder so this is
what s3 does then you have something
called as CloudFront now what CloudFront
does is it basically provides you with
content delivery network we talked about
as locations in the past and that is
what CloudFront helps you do it provides
you get rid of all the latency that is
there in your system then you have
something called as glacier which is
again a storage service it is a very
good data archiving service basically
and the best thing about it is it is
available to you at a very low price
next on this list we have something
called as networking and content
delivery now this domain basically has
services like VPC Direct Connect and
route 53 now what VPC does is it
provides you with virtual networks for
better networking and traffic management
basically then you have something called
as Direct Connect you can take a look at
Direct Connect as an internet service
basically which is more secured and more
in line with your AWS service provider
and then you have something called as
route 53 which is nothing but a domain
naming system so all these services they
come under your networking and content
delivery domain
next you have messaging now this is like
the simple messaging which we do yes
there are quite a few services under
this domain as well we have our cloud
rail and cl3
now your cloud rail is something that
has a bulk messaging system whereas you
is more of a buffer or chewing service
then we have database now as I've told
you that both storage services and
database services the kind of deal with
storing data because what is the
database database basically holds a data
right so what is the difference between
these two well you have to understand
one thing database will not hold
executable files so if you have
two-story executable files they have to
be on your storage and not on your
database so this is the difference
between the two so what are the
different database services that a
device has to offer
you have Aurora which is again a
database system basically but it has
claimed by Amazon that it deals with SQL
data and Beals with it five times faster
than what SQL has to offer to you so if
you are using this service and you have
to deal with the SQL kind of thing this
is a very good tool to have or a service
to have rather then you have dynamo DB
this deals with non relational or maybe
unstructured kind of data or is a
service that helps you deal with these
databases there quite a few unstructured
databases I won't be talking about those
that is a discussion for some other time
but your DynamoDB service basically
helps you handle these kind of databases
and then finally we have the management
tools basically and the management tools
are something that helps you manage your
resources and data much better say for
example if we have our cloud watch which
is a very powerful monitoring tool and
then you have cloud formation which is
again a great tool when you talk about
templatized in your applications or your
infrastructure basically so these are
the different domains which AWS has to
offer to you I hope you all have
understood this in that case we can just
move further and get started with the
next topic of discussion so next what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead
and give you a demo of how to sign into
AWS free tier because yes edibles has a
lot of services to offer to you which
are at free of course and normally
people hesitate to log into AWS and
there are reasons for it because they
have few constraints which in abyss put
you into and when you sign and you have
to give in few details like credit cards
and all those things on this is where
people think twice before signing into a
double
but let me quickly give you a walk
threaten how do you do it or how do you
sign into your database account so bear
with me till I switch back to my browser
and we can move further with the demo
part so there you go what you do is you
just go ahead and go to a device's free
tier basically and you can just have
access to the website yes there you have
it this is how the free tier or the
webpage for the free tier looks like you
can just go ahead and click here and
create your free account but before we
do that lets go down and take a look at
the other details which the free tier
has to offer to you now first thing you
need to understand is this free tier is
available to you for one complete year
now what does this mean
basically you can use few of the
resources or almost all of the resources
for free for first year but there's
certain limitations on its usage and
when I say one year it starts from the
day you first sign up for head of this
and when you do that you have all these
things at your access say for example
Amazon ec2 which we just talked about
that is elastic cloud computer and what
it does is it gives you 750 hours of
access to the server node for the first
year and when you say 750 hours a month
that is a lot of fun to have and you can
do a lot of things using this much
amount of time secondly you have Amazon
quick site now what it does is per
spiced capacity it gives you one GV now
I won't get into the details of what
this thing is it is something that is
used for analytics and let's stick to
the main discussion so I won't get into
the details of analytics and what
exactly does you provide with or does
the software or service provides you
with then you have the database
capabilities or the services that is
your Amazon RDS which we talked about
and again it gives you the database
space for again 750 hours per month and
the instances T 2 dot micro instance
this is something that you would again
be seeing in the subsidy sessions or the
following sessions that would follow
this session so yes
talking about these things in detail
again as you can see we have Amazon s3
which again provides you with 5 GB of
standard storage and interface lambda
now what it does is it helps you process
1 million requests per month for free
and again this is great to have then we
have these things where it gives you
step by step solution as on how to sign
in and how to learn about the basic
capabilities which aw has to offer to
you so these are more introductory kind
of video basically 10 minute sessions
which talk you through or walk you
through the basics of aid abuses and the
ones which we discussed in the video or
we have discussed still time in this
session is what I am referring to you
can also go ahead and get into the
advanced things as in how to build
applications and all those things so in
order to create a free account what you
have to do is you can just go ahead and
click on this icon and your AWS website
will redirect you to a page where you
can go ahead and create your own account
as in a free account now I being an
existing user I have an access to
getting into AWS in signing in for free
so that is not what I would be doing I
would be coming here and I would be say
I log into some AC I create a new
account so this is what I would be
having at my disposal basically I'll
have to go ahead and put in my email
address my password and I have to
confirm that with the economy amuse us
what it would do is it would just ask
you for your credit card details now
people feel that it abuse might charge
you for services but then again they've
specified the limits very clearly and as
long as you stay in the limit nothing
would be charged from you and before you
do sign and it asks you whether you want
to use the services for free and when
you click on it saying yes what it does
is it makes sure that you are updated as
an amount of access which you do out of
this website and how many services do
you use it would keep you updated on
those things as I've already mentioned
that it has great measuring capabilities
and it keeps you updated with all the
resources which you use of
yes the only thing that happens is menu
enter your debit card or credit card
details I've actually gone ahead and
entered my debit card details and it did
accept those details as well so yes you
can go ahead and use a debit card
details as well credit card is something
that is preferable when you do that what
it obvious does is for the verification
purpose it would initially kind of
deduct one dollar that is one USD from
your account and once the verification
is complete which is a five-minute
process that amount is refunded back
into your account so when that one
dollar gets deducted you need not worry
because that is just for the security or
the authentication purpose that's it and
once you do go ahead and create this
account what you can do is you can
always go ahead and log into your
account and you'll have all the services
which are available for access now I
would be going ahead and logging into my
account which I already have here on AWS
and once you do that this is what the
console would look like now you have all
the services available here stable you
can build a solution that is you can
launch a virtual machine you can build
your own web app you can host a static
website connect to an IOT device get
into development projects and even
register for a domain we talked about
DNS and all those things so yes it helps
you do that the others have suspended by
AWS which is DevOps which is very
trending and highly turning in the
market this is something that combines
our developers and operations point of
view and gives you something which is a
combined approach and helps you overcome
various problems which both developers
and basically system admins face so yes
this is a great tool or resource to
study or the tutorial struttin basically
because that would help you under well
various other concepts again as far as
the aw services are concerned we have
all these services which available here
you have your ec2 management tools
mobile services here and VR which is
augmented reality and virtual reality
basically an application integration and
all those things you can just go ahead
and click on these icons and you'll be
redirected to those services that is you
can go ahead and create your own ec2
instances and all those things so for
now I don't think I've created any
instance here see that zero running in
no sooner you go ahead and launch an
instance you'd be getting the updates
here as in okay this is the running
instance and all those things to do that
you have to come here and you have to
say launch instance and there you go the
perfect guides available for you whether
you want to launch it on your Linux
environment and all those things so you
can go ahead and select that you can
select the Machine and all those things
and you can just launch instances and
get started with a debase this is fairly
easy and fairly basic to get started
with I hope you've all have understood
whatever I've talked about real time if
you all are really interested in knowing
more about as in how to go ahead and
create the ec2 instances and how to go
about the architecture and how to
understand all this concepts in detail I
would highly recommend that you go
through one of the videos created by mr.
Heyman Sharma he actually creates videos
for Eddie Drake I and he creates those
videos on Amazon Web Services and his
videos are very nice and very good to go
through so yes that is a highly
recommended video if you are really
interested to know what these things in
detail and I would suggest that you all
go through that video for sure as far as
this session is concerned this is where
I would be taking a pause and I would be
ending this session because my prior aim
here was to get you started with AWS and
I hope you've talked enough about
database to get you started as I've
already said you can go ahead and visit
the other videos that are there in the
buffer and I'm sure that you would be
good enough to get started and even kind
of achieve some kind of expertise in it
obvious if you go through all the videos
that are there in the buffer so all the
best of all of you and I hope you like
this video I hope to see you all again
