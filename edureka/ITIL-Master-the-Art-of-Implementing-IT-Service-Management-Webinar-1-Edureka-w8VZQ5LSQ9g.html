objective of the IPL foundation session
is of this particular webinar session is
about the context setting about
describing what is ikea and the ITSM how
will the ideal foundation base will move
you toward the expert road back doing
the ITIL training and certification
program how would L help you in your
further career opportunities how will
add Eureka will help you out in meeting
your goals and objectives for ideal
training and last our question and
answer session what a service management
for understanding what is a service
management it is important to know what
is the servants a service is a means of
delivering value to customers by
facilitating outcomes customer wants to
achieve with all the ownership of
specific cost and risk so what is
service management then if service is
this the definition of service
management is highly dependent upon the
understanding that you have of the
service so let me give you a layman
definition of service management and
then we'll come to applause the more
technical definition is / ITIL the
service management is about having the
ability to do something and be able to
provide something to someone i am
repeating so Wis management is about
having the ability to do something and
be able to provide something to some
one here something is your service and
someone is your customer getting into
the more technical definition of service
management from the perspective of ITIL
Service Management is a set of so what
is service management who understand
about service it is important to know
the definition or understanding about
service before so service in respect to
or in relation to this between the
service provider and the customer is
here it is a service is a means of
delivering value to customers by
facilitating outcomes customer wants to
achieve without the ownership of
specific cost and risk so basically one
needs to understand why a customer wants
to avail the service for service
provided the customer wants to avail the
service from a service provider in order
to avoid the ownership of specific cost
and risk for an example if I an
individual want to avail the telecom
service providers voice data service I
will not be setting up the whole of the
IT network infrastructure it would
always be practical and feasible to take
across the service from any service
provider
be it eight with waterful or beat any
other service provider what is the
benefit of the benefit of it is that I
as an individual do not have to bother
about the network costs about the
infrastructure costs about the risk
which is involved in providing their
service based upon this definition let
us understand what the service
management service management is about
having the ability to do something and
be able to provide something to someone
over here this something is your service
and someone is your customers getting
into the more technical definition of
service management as per ITIL Service
Management is a set of specialized
organizational capabilities for
providing value to customers in the form
of services over here the keywords are
specialized the keyword another keyword
is organizational capabilities we have
value to customers and services let us
are you know have a brief understanding
about what these keyword needs over here
specialized means something for an
example which is focusing on high-tech
IT infrastructure environment something
which not everyone can do that
something which few only are able to do
at present with the sword is specialized
IT infrastructure cannot be useful until
and unless we have the organizational
capabilities by organization
capabilities we mean that we should be
having the right functional units you
write business units the right
departments right roles right skills and
right knowledge without having the right
function business unit departments roles
skill sets are knowledge it is cannot be
possible that the service provider
generates the return on investment all
the value on investment from that
particular specialized field or the IT
infrastructure as an example who were in
the form the service is given we have
already discussed above value to
customers it is a saying I don't know
whether you have heard it at our quality
is not what the service provider is
providing to the customer quality is
what the customer is getting therefore
when we talk about service management we
also capture the value to customer which
is been passing on
what do you mean by value to customers
in value to customers there are two
components to it what are those three
components the first component is
utility if any customer is availing
service from a service provider it is
utmost important from a cell thermos
point of view who understand that this
service which he or she is availing will
it's all the purpose for which it has
been a will in other words what the
service does to put it in a different
world utility means or is a measure of
the desirability of consuming a good or
service so we are will you know if he
I'm availing the service from our
telecom service provider the first and
foremost important thing is to know
whether that given telecom service
provider is providing me the voice
service will I be able to call up is
there are the network over there or not
in the area in the geographical location
in which I am reciting or walking if I
am not being a will the basic service
which is calling one person to another
word in other words the voice plant
service my purpose is not being met
which is my first and basic criteria in
that case
what I need to do is I have to look out
for any other service provider so when
we talk about value the one of the
critical components is utility once my
purpose has been met by willing the
service the next thing I that is
customer would look into is how is that
service delivered is it fit for use or
not does it has the warring key
component into it let me take in an
example when we as a customer why buy an
electronic product the first and the
important thing that we look out for
days Hey look well this component will
this refrigerator or the television or
any other component will it be serving
my purpose or not this is forcing the
second thing is will the service be able
to secure safe or not is it is i mugged
enough if it is not then probably how
good that service is in terms of helping
me out in delivering my purpose or
meeting my purpose I will not be
availing it so when we talk about value
we are talking about two components
which is utility and warranty so I am
repeating this definition which I stated
regarding service management again
service management is a set of
specialized organizational capability
for providing value to customers in the
form of services
the next thing is infrastructure
management what do with our
infrastructure management we cover a
service provisioning we do network
management too we also perform virtual
environment management we do the
security server or the storage
management and we also involve the
monitoring tools for Al Ahram generation
for notification so basically why what
is the organizational need the
organizational needs changes that the
passage of time what we have today what
we need tomorrow and what we need to
improvise upon so the highly effective
workforce in the organization will help
us in meeting our objectives so what
does the highly effective workforce
comprises of the comprises of the
competencies they have the inbuilt or
the develop over the period of time the
capabilities we should have the right
roles and yes the right stuff
person why we were dealing into the
service management infrastructure
management all the service definitions
and how the ITIL is correlated with all
these concepts so a year you know we're
back in 1960s 1970s the role of ITV
wasn't there or if it was it was
negligible however with the passage of
time I tea now in today's world has
grown into each component in the blood
vessels of the organization hence it
becomes important that an effective
management of IT services takes place
and that is where we have the concept
known as I PSM which stands for IT
service management so I p sm is a
concert which describes about how the IT
service will be managed so what is an
ITIL ITIL is an approach approach for
him approach to whom approach to the IT
service management so what does ITIL
suggest ideas such as managing the
entire business service along with his
underlying components cohesively assures
that we are considering the every aspect
of a service
it also assures that we are delivering
the required functionality and service
levels to the business customers let me
put it in a more simpler way to do an
effective and efficient I t sm or in the
words the IT service management there
are various ways or approaches which an
organization can follow the one
approaches developing the metalogic
in-house the other approach could be
following the best practices or the
processes or methodologies which is for
being done by the other organizations in
the same industry or the geographical
location or the third approach could be
of adapting the models which were
developed by a lot of research by the
famous scholars in and around the city
or across the globe or the other
approach could be following certain
standards the one of the other
approaches of doing an effective and
efficient itsm is I aisle ITIL was
formerly known as information technology
infrastructure library so the ITIL
framework which is also known as the
best practice framework has been dev
loved by the people by taking into the
account the best practices which has
been followed across the globe
irrespective of the industry
irrespective of the domain is respect to
the tech technology for the maintenance
or management of IT services
and through the learnings from all those
organizations or individuals or team
this framework has been developed and
that is the reason it evolves over the
period of time from the earlier v1
version it is now into the v3 version
phase and it will evolve continuously be
involving over the coming period of time
to the ITIL complements you would say
rather itsm in the best possible manner
and that is the reason I p aisle has
gained such an important focus from
people across the globe and hence the
ITIL framework training program
certifications has been valued by each
and most of the organizations in today's
world the practices the frameworks which
has been prescribed in ITIL is now
bender adapted widely across all the
industries that you can think of so how
does the IT aisle has been divided into
or how the structured program ITIL is
so the ITIL is known as the breast
practice framework it was developed by
the ogc it's currently running its we 3
211 upgraded version ITIL framework is
currently being an open soul is still
being owned by the body known as Axl
offs it is spelled as a x e + 0 s so the
ITIL has been designed in the ideal
service lifecycle rather has been
designed into five phases the five
phases are on your screens right now the
first phases service strategy in
strategy we design our vision goals
objectives of the organization the
second phase of ITIL is service design
the service design phase looks after
designing of new or change services into
the organization the third phase of ITIL
Service transitions the purpose of
service transition is to ensure that the
new service the modified service all the
services which has been retired meet the
expectations meet the expectations of
whom meet the expectations of the
business
which is documented in the service
strategy and service design stages of
the life cycle from surface design stage
the next phase which is captured are
designed by ITIL is service operation
the purpose of service operation is to
come together and deliver the service
where the utility and warranty is
present this is this stage where the
customers actually experience the value
we deliver we needs the service provider
so what are the journal activities in
service operation the general activity
is in the service operation airs to
think like a technician that is to
manage the day-to-day activities and
technology to execute processes to
optimize the cost and quality to enable
the business to meet its objectives so
service operation is where the actual
value is perceived to be delivered the
last phase in ITIL is continual service
improvement what would prescribe bears
you cannot do an effective IT service
management if you're not improvising you
are not improvising upon what your not
improvising in
technology if you're not improvising on
your processes or you're not improvising
on your services so the motto of
continual service improvement is to
improve in a continuous fashion the next
boy in tears how the exam of ITIL has
been divided how is it structure so the
structuring of the ITIL exam is
generally divided into three phases the
first and the important phase is you
know if you want to make a career in
ITIL you know if you want to get
certified for all the itl module this is
the structure that any individual needs
to follow the first and foremost is
attaining your ITIL foundation exam mind
you if you are not an ITIL foundation
certified person you are not eligible in
any respect to move further up the
letter of the further ITIL
certifications once you clear your ITIL
foundation certification you get to
credit points so moving up the ladder by
an ITIL certification program one needs
to have ITIL foundation exam clear or in
other words you need to have the two
credit points the next stage is the
intermediate stage in the ITIL
intermediate stage you have two
different paths that you can choose
either of them or both of them those
name of the pitar the intermediate
lifecycle modules are the intermediate
capability modules the difference
between the lifecycle modules of ITL at
intermediate level or the capability
modules at the intermediate is one the
ITIL lifecycle modules have five
different modules under it and each
module carries three credit points
whereas under the capability in
intermediate lifecycle module there are
four modules each covering for credit
points so one needs to have at
intermediate level 15 credit points
until unless you do not have the 15
credit points for sure what you cannot
move to the next ladder ladder of ITIL
expert so the next level of is the ITIL
in May LC exam or the certification
clearing upon which you have been
certified as an ITIL expert let us have
a brief know how about the processes
which are covered on your ITIL lifecycle
space so I stated you that ITIL
framework is divided into five moon
phases the five phases are the service
strategy so this design service
transition it is incorrectly written
it's not transmission if this transition
so this operation and continual service
improvement
and the service strategy you have full
processes demand management financial
management strategy generation and
service portfolio management under
service design you have the processes
service catalog management service level
management capacity management
availability management service
continuity management the information
security management and support Anthony
so this transmission you have the
knowledge chain assets release
deployment transition planning service
validation and evaluation in operations
you have it is in operation it is
divided into processes and functions the
processes are the incident management
problem management even punishment
recursive movement access management the
functions are your service desk
functions application functions
technical management functions and IT
operational management the CSI is rather
have the process and end models with
include the service measurements
reporting's in him service improvements
so what is itsm we covered it in
somewhere earlier in the session which
refers to the entity of activities
directed by policies supporting
procedures and organized and structured
in processes so the activities are
performed by an organization or part of
an organization to plan to deliver to
operate to control IT services offered
which are offered to the customers the
iso's in ayia seas are the helping hand
in the ITIL framework in the
organization one do not use the ITIL
framework in silos you will have with
ITIL maybe the enterprise architecture
frameworks like the flow graphs or maybe
the governance framework which is the
cupboard or you may have the iso's
you may have the project management
which the PMP or pencil standards or the
guidelines so when we talk about service
management we need to keep in mind the
four piece of service management which
are our four piece our focus our people
process products and partners all these
four piece has to keep in mind by whom
by this service provider for whom for
this service management why for the
business of the organization it does the
snapshot of the ITSM landscapes how does
an IT service portfolio would look like
I would look like there is a brief
sample shot in front of him which has
divided the IT service portfolio of the
organization into for business heads the
enterprise commute shooting services
infrastructure services network in
conversion service and end-user
computing service all you may have lot
many different structured way of
dividing your service portfolio how does
simple organizational structure look
like why it is important for what
for having the organizational structure
in the organization if we do not have
the organizational structures in the
organization the effective and efficient
itsm which was a stocking earlier is not
possible or is not effectively or
practically possible to do the most
efficient IPS Emily of magician so be it
in the organization today's world all
are well structure so how is the ITIL
certification organized it is organized
into three different levels the first is
your basic level in which generally the
expectation from the participants or the
examiner e is that they should be
knowing the basic general know how about
ITIL finger at the intermediate level it
is expected that the participants or the
candidates must be able to comprehend
those basic key words and are able to
apply into the real world problem
solving situations at the expert level
which is an advanced level it's not just
about application of the knowledge or
the comprehension of the knowledge part
the analysis part which is turns into
the picture so earlier I was talking
about the structure of the ITIL
certification exam this is how it has
been structured at the base you have the
ITIL foundation for service management
certification which carry the two credit
points then you move at the intermediate
level
life cycle model carries the 15 credit
points and the capability carries the 16
credit points however you need at least
15 credit point at the intermediate
level who go to the next level which is
managing across the life cycle which
carries five credit points so in all to
become an ITIL expert one must have
minimum of 22 credit points recorded
against your profile in thick capability
streamed which we were discussing add
this give us like this one so this one
on your right hand side you have the PPO
you have this SOA you have the RCV and
you have the osa so generally the
capability module the capability
intermediate module is being adapted for
certifications and training purposes my
whom it is done by the people who are
working into the processes so it is
really meant at the certification is
meant for the individuals who work in
the processes who responsible in
carrying out the daily process activity
so once you do each of these
certifications the individual
specialized in the process level Nova
sir capability module in comparison to
the lifecycle module is more process
oriented the lifecycle module is more of
a phrase oriented structure
under the RCV the OSA for the SOA or the
PPO you have different processes cover
the names are there on your screens
right now so what do you offer will you
be opting for the capability stream or
will you be opting for the life checking
audio stream so let me tell you briefed
about the structuring of life cycle and
capable contactus tunnels and I would
reiterate one of the few points to start
with the life second module is a phase
oriental where is the capability module
is more of a process-oriented structure
the life cycle lays emphasis on the
faces lays emphasis on the process
relationship process relationship it
also lays emphasis on the roles
responsibilities and implementation
considerations however they pay less
attention to the process capability on
the other hand lays emphasis on
improving and implementing the existing
created processes I am repeating the
capability stream lays emphasis on
improving and implementing the existing
related processes the third difference
which I would like to highlight above
the lifecycle and capability is before
the capability which I already covered
pause that this certification is for the
individuals who work in the process how
about the life cycle life cycle
certifications are for individuals were
working on the processes and are
responsible for itsm implementations so
basically this life cycle module is
been taken care by the people who do the
management roles or the lead role
profiles and job opportunities there are
ample jobs in the market across the
globe for the people who are ITIL
certified professionals the reason
because just as the framework which has
been adapted by many organisations
tilted and is being in the process of
being adapted by several thousand other
organizations in hand the job
opportunities in this area are ample
people appreciate that the process
owners or the process managers the
process comes hilton's the tool
consistent in fact the solution
architects the technical writers the
support stop that they have the service
managers all these are solar and last
but not the least the vendor license
individual professional must be an ITIL
certified professional or look at these
job opportunities these are just the few
job opportunities to list down over here
so what is the benefits of ITIL and why
there are so many job opportunities the
first benefit of the idea is that it has
aligned with the business needs the IT
strategy groups recommended in service
strategies and the implementations of
service portfolios gives IT the
opportunity to understand business sis
current and future needs and develop
their offerings which can address them
the other benefit of ITIL is it helps in
negotiating your achievable service
levels
what it means is the business and IT
become true partners when when they
agree upon the affray listing service
levels which that can deliver the
necessary value at an acceptable cost
the other preferred of an ITIL is that
it helps in predictable consistent
processes what do you mean my
predictable consistent processes if we
have the right dial ideal framework set
in our organizations and if it has been
abided the customer expectations can be
sick and it becomes easier who need with
those expectations by with the use of
predictable processes that are
consistently being used in the
organization ITIL also efficiently helps
in service delivery in what manner does
it help them it helps in very deed
defining the processes with clearly
documented accountability for each
activity as recommended to the use of
crazy matrix which can significantly
increase the efficiency of processes the
other benefit of ideal framework is it
helps in measurable improvable services
and processes this is an old saying in
the nursery what you cannot manage you
cannot measure so to ITIL it helps in
consistent repeatable processes which
can be measured and therefore can be
better tuned for for what for accurate
delivery and overall effectiveness
the last but not the least benefit of
itls it helps in bringing a common
language language to what language
between two individuals the terms are
defined for an example the change
management incident management so when I
talk about change management being an
ideal certified to an other idea
certified professional I need not to get
into the nitty gritties of what exactly
this term means we already are set on
the same page all the terms and it's
definitions once united certified you
can also help the IT service community
building up through the platforms which
is there on your screens like the IT
Service Management forums or the back to
itsm groups all the ITSM fus a is ori
EAC 20,000 35 groups or give any known
community platform that is Linden so how
the edge dereka would help you out in
meeting out the ITIL foundation course
objectives the IQ course has been
divided into six modules the first
module is service management is practice
which gives you brief general know how
or base for the IPL framework we move to
the next phase in the other module which
is our strategy followed by service
design then service transition service
operation and lastly the continent
service
improvement so how the at Eureka has the
value differentiation among the other
organization existing across the claw
for training the first and foremost is
an tariqa offers you the best platform
when I say best it literally and
figuratively is the best in providing
the live online classes all the classes
are federica on the live platform for
which you have the schedule and calendar
ready a depending of the month so you to
be so you have the clear idea and
picture in which you can schedule your
sessions well in advance the other
benefit of doing the ideal or any other
training programs who enter requires all
your classes which is being conducted on
the life work online platform is
recorded and available to thinks it's
recorded and available into your head
Eureka account once the session finishes
that Eureka is the few of the
organization which provides each and
every participant not only not only the
24 cross seven post class support but
also support in various ways you have
forums where you can post your questions
you have people on the chat room you can
talk to you have the other platform on
calling of the service desk
or you can email them so there are
various ways in which post class session
you can get in touch with a director for
any support that you require maybe the
session based or maybe technical non
technical support each of the edori car
sessions are broken down into modules
and at the end of each module you have
the quiz question sample papers to salt
in the relevant given certification
programs you also have the project work
which can be performed and yes you have
the verifiable certificate at the end of
the session once it is completed so
