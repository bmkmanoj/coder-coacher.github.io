one instead you have to install the
library foreign so if you have not
installed the package library foreign it
would be worthwhile that if you go to
install packages and to the foreign I
already have it installed so I will not
go ahead and install it but those who
have not really done it can you please
do it so once you do it what would
happen is that you would next you do
library foreign and then make sure that
your file is there in the working
directory it's better to set the working
directory also for me the set WD I
should do this set WD here say WD where
is my file copy address s text
so we'll come back to your question Ajit
the cancer data is there so we just see
the cancer data the cancer data is here
so we will read the cancer data and once
you have the cancer data rate then you
can to the class of the cancer data
that's a list and then what you do is
that you can convert that list into a
data frame so here what I am doing is
that I am doing a store data frame
cancer data so if a store data frame it
will convert the cancer data into a data
frame and once you do that you can find
the names of the cancer data here you
can find the top six rows of the cancer
data also through this so this is how we
can do this how we can obtain the values
roman spaces file so while I was doing
this part I presume that you guys we're
doing it with me or you have done it
earlier so I just wanted to be sure that
you guys understand this very well
because I see that this is in one of
your assignments and you could excel in
those assignments as well as Salerno how
to import data from different formats
before I move on to the next section
I would try to answer the questions that
have been asked so Ajit is saying I
pride it using library hm is C so Ajit
in our there're multiple ways of doing
it so if you have tried and if if you
had got the result if you have obtained
the data frame and if it is not null
then you are correct please make sure
when you are when you are trying
different things you should have error
checks like whether it is the data frame
that you've got has value in it or not I
also see a section a question on the
previous part okay so this is regarding
the demo to dot R what I will do instead
before we move on to the sections let's
let me open demo to dot our demo to dot
R Jota has requested about a question in
okay so just now is asking what does
this statement mean e minus C 1 3 comma
C 1 2 1 3 4 what it means is that we are
getting rid of the rows 1 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; getting
rid of the columns 1 3 &amp;amp; 4 so let's try
to get into this and prove it once more
so what this is is a matrix column so if
you have a so this is the matrix with 4
rows and 4 columns so a minus 1 2 or
here it was minus 3 1 3 so it will
remove this row and this 0 and then it
will remove the 1 3 &amp;amp; a 4 so what
it will remain is that the second and
the fourth rows and the second column
see if I execute this that is what you
see the second row is left fourth row is
left and the second column that is six
and eight is left bricked it removes
columns one three and four of rows one
and three
that's that's correct so what minus C is
doing is that it is removing the rows in
the first part and in the columns it is
removing this part so rows and columns
so that is a thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
