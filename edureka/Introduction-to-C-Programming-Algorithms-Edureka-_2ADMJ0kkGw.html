the basic difference between giving an
instruction to a friend and giving an
instruction to a computer as they
discussed in the previous chapter you
need to think of a computer as a
three-year-old kid and break down your
instructions to the smallest step
possible so we're going to take a real
life example to help you understand what
i mean by breaking the other
instructions to small steps in this
chapter you're going to learn two basic
concepts one given a task how to break
it down into small steps and the
necessity to actually break it down and
write it down as an algorithm so before
we start explaining the concepts let's
take out your life example okay so let's
say the semester results have just been
announced and you are unable to go to
college to see your rank so you ask your
friend to check your rank on the college
board so you have a board in college
basically starting from ranked number
one it lab names the first name has a
rank number one second name is ranked
number two and so on and so forth and
the task here is your friend has to go
up to the board search for your name
check what the rank is beside it so this
is like one two three four search we all
named this board check what the rank is
and come and tell you so let's see how
will you give these instructions to your
friend I'm going to split the screen now
in two halves to show you in one half as
to what the steps are going to be to
your friend and the second half we're
going to talk about how the steps are
going to be explained to the computer
okay this half we're going to have the
instructions to a friend and here
the right side will have the
instructions to the computer okay so
let's first start with the instructions
to a friend the first thing you're going
to tell them is go to the College Board
what the second step he needs to do
search for my name on the board and
finally check the lank against my name
that's it when the task is done so these
are instructions you would give to a
friend you'll have to explain anything
more than this now the same instructions
will not work with the computer let's
see why go to the College boodle okay
you can if a computer understands this
or even let's say we're talking about a
three year old kid you can tell them go
up to the College Budaj is fine now the
problem is with the second step when we
say search for my name the term search
does not make any sense to a computer he
does not know what search means well
let's say his three-year-old kid will
understand the term search what are you
going to tell him how do you explain to
him if you just tell him go search for
my name what does he do he doesn't know
give me the dynami stare at the board
and come back so the second step needs
to be broken down into smaller set of
steps to explain what we mean or how to
actually search for the name on the
board so now let's see how we write the
instructions to the computer okay the
first step to the computer is similar
let's say go to the College Board the
second step like you mentioned search
for my name will not be understood by
the computer so you will have to break
this down how do you break down search
for my name we go to edit one by one
what does it need to do read the first
name on the board
now if this name that his red is your
name then good check the rank and come
back if this is my name see rank and
come back now if this is not your name
what does he need to do needs to read
the next name so read the next name what
happens after you visa next name he
needs to again check whether it's your
name so which is nothing but step 3
again so we're going to keep reviewing
step three and step 4 till what time
till you find my name so we repeat the
above two steps until you find my name
so these are the instructions to the
computer so as you can see we had to
break down steps two and three into
three extra steps so now instead of
three steps we have five steps but then
the whole term search had to be
explaining how do we search so as you
can see we have now explained the steps
or how to search for a name breaking
down off a task into smaller steps is
called an algorithm so basically an
algorithm is the steps of how to solve
the problem for any program that you are
asked to write you should know of three
things what is the program need as input
to what is the task to be performed by
the program and three what is the output
expected from the program once you have
these three things you can write an
algorithm in plain English for the task
that needs to be performed so in the
example above input was my name
the task was to search for my name and
finally the output is my rank it's
always a good practice to write down the
algorithm before you start writing the
program itself as an algorithm is always
in plain English and as humans it's
easier for us to think in English rather
than in the programming language so once
you have an algorithm in place each step
in the algorithm would get converted to
a line or a set of lines in a
programming language okay to get the
concept of algorithms more clear let's
try a few more examples the next example
would be to tell a friend how to boil
water in a kettle boiled water and a
kettle before we start writing the
algorithm for this we first need to
figure out three things like I mentioned
earlier first we need to know what the
input is in this case we know that the
input is the kettle itself and there is
water now what is it task to be
performed there are two tasks here
boiling water is one task and what is
the other one you need to fill up the
kettle with water fill up the kettle and
finally we have the output in this case
the output is boiled water like in the
previous example you're going to first
start with instructions to a friend the
instructions to a friend are pretty
straightforward one is asking to fill
the kettle with water water to place it
on the stove and turn on the burner and
finally three turn off the burner then
the water starts boiling starts boiling
the last two steps basically tells you
about the task of how to boil the water
the first step does that simple fill up
the kettle with water now again like I
said earlier these three steps will not
work for the computer why mainly because
the task fill the kettle with water does
not make sense when you say fill up the
kettle with water the computer does not
understand what you mean by fill-up a
fill-up could be one hundred percent to
the brim it could be ninety-eight
percent of the kettle ninety percent of
the kettle it could be fifty percent of
the kettle we are talking to a computer
you need to specify exactly how much
water you need to fill up so the first
step needs to be broken down place it on
the stove and turn on the burner is
straightforward and finally turn off the
burner and the water starts boiling to
the computer you need to define again
what is boiling in this case we say it
turn off the burner and the water hits
hundred degree Celsius so let's see how
the instructions to the computer so
first task fill up the kettle with water
we need to break it down so if you have
to break it down one of the first stars
now put the kettle on to the top
under the top now was the second step
turn on the tap the third step will be
check if the kettle is filled with water
would we mean the filled with water in
our key will see many percent of the
kettle the me turn off the tap so check
if the kettle is filled to ninety
percent if it's not we just say repeat
the above step so you'll keep putting me
above step until it's filled with ninety
percent of water once that's done say
close the top now you've done the first
step of filling the kettle with water
what's next place the kettle on the
burner the burner then we have turn on
the burner
now the final step again we need to
specify what we mean by boiling so we
just check if the water is 100 degree
Celsius if it's not repeat the above
step either what has touched hundred
degrees we should have to turn off the
burner so these are the steps that are
going to tell the computer if you need
it to boil a kettle of water so I
actually explained earlier first we
start with breaking down the problem
into input the task and the output once
we had the three data is in place we
then sat down and wrote the algorithm
for the task to be performed the two
tasks were filling up the cattle earth
water and boiling the water so we row
the algorithms of both of them and you
put the steps together you had the
entire problem salt okay so let's do one
final example the reason we are doing
this so many times is because beginners
generally have one tough problem which
is grasping the concept of steps or
algorithm they always wonder why do you
need an algorithm given a problem they
start thinking of writing the program
directly and fail miserably because your
brain does not work like a program so
once you break down the given task into
a set of steps in plain English the
mapping each step to a code makes it
very simple so let's take one final
example which may go for the ladies so
let's say we want to go shopping on MG
Road or we want to buy a red colored
shoe but maybe a bow on it and from the
butter showroom one mg road so let's
call this shopping on mg road
what are the first thing that we need to
do we need to know what is the input in
this case input is but a showroom that
is the name of the shop and we r mg road
so we have the name of the road then we
have the color of the shoe which is red
we could describe other stuff like shiny
let's not make it complicated so let's
stick to a red shoe and let's save you
one size 52 size of the shoe so we have
the input where the task the task is to
go shopping and finally what is the
output output is the shoe itself if you
find it now before we start writing the
algorithm for the task let's look at the
problem diagrammatically so let's say
this is your road this is mg road and
you have shops along this side you know
multiple shops and this is your friend
who's going to start shopping from start
off mg road so what's he going to do
he's going to basically walked on mg
road looking at one shop at a time and
when he finds let's say this is the
bella showroom when he finds the polish
bata showroom he goes in ask them for
the shoe that he's looking for and walks
out if he finds it the task is simple so
we go to ask your friend to do it he's
just going to tell him go to mg road go
to the bellagio room find me a red
colored shoe size 5 and come back simple
and straightforward so i'm not going to
spend time writing the algorithm for a
friend so let's start with the algorithm
for the
bureau okay so what are the first thing
that the computer needs to do walk to
the first shop and mg road where the
next step check if this is a butter
showroom if it is then you enter the
shop and ask for or red shoe size five
if he has it you buy the shoe and come
back now what if this was not a but a
showroom in that case you just go to the
next shop and then you go back to step 2
P from step to go to the next shop again
you check it to the bala showroom if it
is enter the shop as for let's choose
size 5 by the shoe and come back if it's
not about a showroom you again go back
you come to step 5 and then you go back
to step 2 okay the reason I'm making you
practice writing algorithms is that
given a problem for a programming
language you don't have to really write
down the algorithm on paper but if you
have the algorithm in your head you can
easily convert to a program but without
an algorithm writing a program becomes
extremely difficult so getting the
algorithm your head directly is not such
an easy task so the best way to start
doing it is given a problem start
writing it down on paper write the
algorithm right where is the input
required to the program where is it task
to be performed by a program where is
the output required from the program now
write the algorithm for the tasks that
are gonna perform
once you have it all on paper converting
it to a program becomes a very simple
task and make it a habit to always put
down the algorithm on paper so that over
a period of time it just comes to your
head automatically and you don't have to
worry about thinking of every step every
step will be automatic in your head just
to get used to this just pick up any
real-life example and try to convert it
to steps that you have to give to the
computer to perform the exact same task
practice it with daily tasks like go
shopping for vegetables break it down to
task just try a few examples on your own
and see if you satisfied with what
you've written that is small enough say
if you give it to a small kid and ask
him to read it he knows exactly what he
needs to do if it works then you're
almost getting there then when we start
talking about the C language or any
other programming language you easily
know how these steps get mapped into the
programming language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
