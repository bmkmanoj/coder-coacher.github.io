are the various ways of storing
information under the device so if you
all remember right so the Android
storage comes up in four segments one is
the internal storage then the other one
is the external storage then we have the
shared preferences and finally we have
the sequel I'd database so as you all
know every Android compatible device
supports a shared external storage why I
call it shared is because other
applications can also make use of this
particular space right that you can use
to save the files so you can use this
area in order to save the files under
your devices the files that are save to
the external storage are the ones that
are world readable because it can be
read by the user and also modified by
the user so whenever you are storing
some critical information just make sure
that you stone that critical information
enter the internal storage if you are
not using and making use of any critical
information then you have to make sure
that whatever information you are
writing has to be written out of the SD
card alright so let's cover up that
sample for it first of all in order to
see or say work with the SD card first
of all firstly you have to check whether
the SD card is present on to the device
or not it is no point in using a SD card
when you do not have any SD card
installed on the device so there are
various ways of doing it up if you are
using API level 8 or greater so you will
be using on get external Cashin
directory method in order to open a file
however if you are using API level 7 or
lower the method name will change steady
will be using a an external storage
directory to open a file from right so
these are the various API level
differences that we have up let's take a
look here
so the Yale remains the same one that we
used for internal storage will be using
this thing without external storage as
well so I have a text view here i have
an idiot box i have a phone number I
have an inbox then I have a partner at
the bottom it says same information very
much they say I go here take all the
object references here said the content
view take up the edittext name and a
fixed number here you see I have set up
this input type from program it moda
robber this is for you if you want to do
it from the program itself you can do it
like this right button save I have a
button save then I have a readme file
method i'll just comment this up for
some time right I say button save
onclicklistener read the value from the
file or say from the input boxes create
an end of line separator get the file
information it is just that I'm getting
the input stream or say the SD card
content I get the SD card from this
particular method which says environment
God get external storage directly I
check whether i can write something out
of the file system or not so if i say i
can write something or the SD card what
am i doing i'm creating a user info file
right giving it as a first argument i
given the directory so then directly
that i'm making use of s SD card now i
am creating a file inside the SD card i
hope this is understood to everyone what
exactly a file path information is
containing all right so i get this
information file path i check or snake
create a user info file append user info
dot txt file to the hd2 the i would say
the SD card spot i'll just show it to
you by debugging up can we also name the
folder that's current we can also name
the folder ratchet in this case we want
to create another folder you can say
create folder and then a forward slash
so it will append this up audio folder
right so that is how you can create
another folder inside it I create a file
right project so similar to the one that
we did for the input stream or say
internal storage I'm creating a file to
run hitter object here my file driver
object is taking as an input argument
the user info file the one that I have
created above all right I create up
again a bufferedreader object which is
going to write something on the file
system for me I do one output out object
dot right name plus the end of line
separator similarly another number
that's the end of line separator right
so this is all that I am doing here but
are we asking you a few questions after
this complete example gets done
so here I have the example can we write
other types of files what God all types
of files exhale it's a try the ones that
are not supported here Richard that's
correct we can always write the media
files we can always write the media
files onto the external storage project
but in that case we will be keep picking
up the bitmap and then storing it up as
of written up onto the SD card project
right so that is how we will be doing it
up I click on save information whenever
I click on save information i will be
getting the file saved up now see the
change in the part where i will be
looking up for it i'll go onto the SD
card mount SD card i have a file user
info txt let's pull this out onto the
desktop let's go to the desktop now
let's open it up in the word pad can
everybody find the contents in the file
which i had stored on the defiled my
name and contact number right so this is
holding both the information and it's
close this up go here let's read back
information from the farthest right so
let's uncomment 3d file method similar
to the one that I did for internal
storage i'll be doing the exactly d of
opposite right exactly the opposite in
terms of object usage then I did right I
created a directory created a file
instead of the bufferedreader i will be
using our buffered referred right that i
will be using a bufferedreader object
give it the file again the same
mechanism the counter while i can print
alliance from the file count or equal to
0 that means i'm reading the first time
if count or equal to 1 that means i'm
reading the second
just show you by running this up
all right it gives me an exception here
let me check him what exactly bugs in it
find out userinfo dot txt is this file
which far am i using to store here i
think that is all fine here let's
this up again see if there is any
problem you will see what exactly is the
problem all right it gives me a trash
again it's gone with knock can and find
this a little problem here teach me
another point of exception here where is
it giving it to me
it says um create external storage
actively dot Java 43 let's find this up
all right it is giving me a null pointer
by 3d file what is that is it not able
to find out the final let's find out and
as present here all right let's go on
create external 43 all right it gives me
a file readers know 293 let's find out
thus line here all right I assume that I
haven't used the textview name here all
right that's the reason here all right I
have commented a few lines of code here
which was initializing it takes you name
and takes me number right for
initializing he takes you name and XP
number of the end invoke a text views so
that's what was causing a null pointer
here now you can see the information
being picked up from the file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
