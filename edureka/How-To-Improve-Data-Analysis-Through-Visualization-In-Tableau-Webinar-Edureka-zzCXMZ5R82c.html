visualization using tableau we all know
that tableau has a new version which is
in the market now which is called as
version 9.1 we will be first discussing
them on what a few of the interesting
features of tableau post which we will
continue in this case about the new
features of tableau 9.1 so the objective
of this session is to understand what is
visual analytics what is data were
utilization and what are the various
statistical packages which tab look in
connective and why is tableau so
important when it comes to data
visualization one and why is tableau
number one in a market we will look into
a few features which have been
introduced off late into tableau nine
and then tableau 9.1 which is probably
10 or 15 days old right there launch
this new version though in this case
even about this version 9.1 so this is
visual analytics all about bringing in
the power of analytics through
visualization right that is tableau all
about now let me show you what
interesting thing even before we proceed
further and that is tableau gotten a
quadrant gardner is a research body
which performs a lot of third-party
research for instance it looks into who
is doing a great job with respect to
data visualization and we see here that
tableau is in the leaders quadrant and
no one else can compete with tableau
when it comes to the ability to execute
and the key difference between tableau
and other visualization tools is that
tableau has not just the visualization
part it also has a lot of analytical
capabilities
for example let me show you one quick
example here this establish I point one
this is these are the inbuilt data set
to which you can connect to using
tableau and we have connected to an
unbuilt data set which is called as
sample superstore now if someone wants
to do an analysis on building a linear
regression model all right people who
are 92 prediction models knife to
statistics i would say that this is a
way to predict the future given the
input values what's the future you and
the weight of the car number of gauge
that the car has what is a hot spot of
the car so on and so food you can
predict what could the possible mileage
be of a vehicle for example we're given
the miles driven given the make of the
car given the year of manufacture and
all that you'll be able to predict what
could be the price of the used car so on
and so forth right so let us quickly do
this we want to predict the profits
based on sales so I'm quickly doing a
small visualization for your this is cat
a diagram let me disagree eat that now
I'm not going to explain each and every
step in detail however the intuition is
important too let's do that now all you
can do is go to analytics here and drag
and drop the trendline and once you drag
and drop when when you try to drag and
drop your exposed or you are shown
various options on do you want the
linear regression or logarithmic or
exponential or polynomial if you know
these distributions in statistics will
be easier for you but this is what after
just pranking crown now if I hover my
mouse on these lines credit lines which
you see here there's an equation we just
come up with says profit is equal to
zero point one eight double 0 67 * seals
said someone tomorrow comes to me and
says hey this is your sales I will say
wow I can predict my profit based on
that
right and all you need to do is write
upon that click on describe friend model
these are the weighted statistics right
this is your linear regression output if
any one of y'all are aware of p value
our screen and all that this is how
simple that right now will you be able
to understand that the relationship
between sales and profit is a positive
relationship can you make sense out of
that if I see okay let me view the data
this is a raw data by the way right if
someone is going to come to you and say
that hey here are the weirdest things
here I have profit and the same spot
then if I ask you um will you be able to
predict for me and see what is the
relationship between these two variables
it would be difficult for you extremely
cumbersome because we have approximately
10,000 rusev right and okay that it's
extremely difficult for you to establish
a relationship in that way right hence
data visualization comes in handy and
that is tableau all about that's a power
if someone wants to know what the key
difference between tableau and other
visualization tools this is one
interesting thing there right let me put
in a slight mu and let's proceed further
and what is data visualization all about
data visualization is all about drawing
some true business inferences which will
help you and your business grow right
Ryne some tea inferences which cannot be
drawn by evaluating the raw data right
so that's data visualization all about
and what is tableau tableau is once at
software which helps you come up with a
lot of dash boot in
resting dashboards interesting reports
which will quickly give some business
insights to the key decision makers
right and that is our job all about when
we work on tableau one another good
thing about tableau is that tablet
connects seamlessly with a few of the
statistical packages well-known
statistical packages we have sass SPSS
from IBM and our which is open source
these three are the market leaders in
analytics peaks and you can connect to
all of these data sets let me show you
one such example this is tableau if I
click on connect to the database here
add new data source it says statistical
fine what are the statistical files
which you intend to connect right if I
click on that it says here you can
connect to SAS you can connect to IBM
spss and the are in the interest of time
what i've done is i had keep these
things handy right there is this is
called as our our is a statistical
package there in even before that you
need to install the package that's a
command to install food there so you
first need to install the ourself
package and once you install that right
sorry i think right it's already
installed on my machine so all you need
to do is load that once you load that
you need to run this ourselves and it
has thrown me an error if you see it's
saying hey what is that no save or
vanilla or say what do you want me I'm
saying don't save that right now once
this is done all you need to do is come
to tableau go to hell right go to
settings and performance there and click
on manage our connection here you can
test your connection that successful why
because there is something which is
running on our which is called as ours
which helps our connect to the external
applications now once you do that this
is an example that I've taken right all
you need to do is click on any one of
your visualizations right this is an
hour file which has our code right in
interest of time rather than load it
I've already done that so this is how
you can actually see a what are the
errors which I'm encountering now MV
outlier is an error right what does that
say this package is not running in our
so let me show you quickly on that so
there is mbark liar that's the package
which we need to call it's saying that
there is no package what does that mean
we need to install the package installer
packages that's command and be outlier
so let me install that in the first
place once you install you also need to
load this package so while the
installation completes right in here the
right sign that you've seen say is that
an operation is in progress at any given
point of time if you want to have the
operation you can take on that there's a
lot of things there are a lot of things
lot of packages which are getting
unzipped as part of this installation
and it's taking awhile but we are not
far away from the spanish completion
while this happens if you have any
doubts you can please go ahead and ask
me not so that I can I am answer your
questions yeah it's installed once its
installed you need to load that now if
the package is loaded all you need to do
is go to that click on ok let me just go
back and come in once again and here you
are able to see this right
that's a good part here the entire this
is our code if I show you on edit this
our code library and the outlier in if I
show you on far this is your my outline
all right let us proceed further a quick
check are you guys able to hear me
alright perfect so there's one question
can we connect HDFS to our yeah how do
can our connectivity exists but this
session is all about tableau is
realization but yeah we can do that I've
done so we can connect Hadoop and
tableau all soo ah McCullough has this
question is it open source which one
makalah are you up I asking what tableau
RR r is open source tab will come for a
license all right let's proceed now this
is all about that and you have this
feature of splitting the data columns in
tableau and you have the responsive
tooltips let me show you that also and
then we have another thing which is
called as data interpretation so I'm
going to explain these three now and
then we will proceed with the features
of tableau 9.1 let me go here the first
thing that is a new feature failing new
feature which I want to show you guys is
the split splitting of the data columns
so let me do this there is custom Oni
let me drag and rub that on the rules
here you see the first name and the last
name of the customer now why do not want
the data to be represented in this
format instead I want the first name and
the last name probably what do I do just
write it and
go to transform and split the data there
you go that two splits which get created
automatically now that's your first name
that's your last hey do you know what I
want to split in a different way in
darling I do not want to split based in
the furthest team and the last how do
you want to split is something which you
can choose right so this is called as a
custom suit first secondly it's it has a
very responsive tooltip what is that let
us do a small map visualization here all
I've done is that selected latitude and
longitude from the measures I've
expanded the show me panel and I
selected the symbol map there now let me
collapse show me pan now if i drag and
drop profit on the color and if you drag
and drop probably profit also into
detail there and if i drag and drop
probably this into label there in so on
and so forth not sure why it's not
appearing just give me a minute there
uh-huh yep let me drag and drop country
into the detail now you see that there
is only one country which is us which is
coming up there now if i want all the
other details also to appear I'll take
in that way profit and drop it on the
color p and the marks right and the
marks car in the color being a drop
profit and you can see the profits now
right based on this so you can do a
bunch of experiments around this you can
change the shape you can come up with
the film app
all all is yours now you can just change
the visualization of your choice but all
these things are possible now the thing
that I wanted to show you with the
lightning fast tool tip that is what I
wanted to show you so let me do this I
hover my mouse here it says United
States profit is so much do you see any
difference right there's absolutely no
lag there there's absolutely no lag
there I can hover my mouse anywhere I
want right the mom and I home amongst
the tooltip appears now let me take you
back here and let me change this to a
circle rather than a sheep now let me
start whoring my mouse honest let's wan
datapoint the second one this third
fourth fifth instantly dynamically you
see those values there is absolutely no
law that's lightning fast tooltip all
about get that right this is another
good feature of tableau nine point nine
point one and also nine and if i leave
my mouse pointer like that code on a
particular data point it would appear
like that forever right and in the
earlier versions of tableau this would
this would go off after 20 seconds but
that's not the case now and this is real
time that's a good fun that's a
responsive tooltip papa there is another
intelligent feature in tableau and that
is all about let me show that using an
example rather so there is a real asset
called story point laureate nothing on
it there you go right this is how easy
it is to connect to data sets now let me
show you this there is an interpreter in
built in this when a drag and drop this
it's a
tableau data interpreter might be able
to help you data does not look right why
because there are laughs null values
there right look at that look at f6 f7
and fa there are lot of null wanna sell
a lot now if you do not have time to
read all of these things and make sense
of that you can actually ask tableau to
do it to do the data interpretation pop
just click on turn on it has fill in a
few details if you see if you notice
clearly earlier everything was a now now
it has replaced a few now if you want to
know more about what has tableau done as
part of this data interpretation you
need to click on review results and
that's going to open up an excel sheet
for you which sees hey the right one is
data interpreters column headers green
data is interpreted as values in your
data source in what are the values which
tablets excluding and where did it leave
blank right everything is there and if
you order data see data sheet to you
will see one of the changes which
tableau has done right what are the
weightiest things where it has added
data which was initially missing because
of misinterpretation so this is yet
another interesting feature in tableau
right that's all about the responsive
tooltip data interpretation now moving
on to the new features of tableau 9.1
which is amazing let me show you a few
one is you can connect to Facebook
Twitter and not the google sheets if you
have any in extract the data from these
social network seamless very easy using
a new connector which is called as web
data connected right so let me show you
that
let me open a new sheet there and let me
go there all you need to do is click on
this connect to database go to more
service click on web data connector now
here you can provide connection to any
of your data sets let me choose Twitter
this is the URL to which I wish to
connect and instead of tableau let me
say data scientist and enter there now
this activity if i'm not mistaken would
take a while because there are a lot of
what are you calling twitter there are a
lot of twitter handles there are a lot
of hashtags with the name data scientist
and there is a lot of discussion going
on so for us to pull all the information
into tableau it will take some time
right because we need to you know expo
extract a lot of stuff from the net so
while that happens let us proceed with
the slide in I'll leave that for five
minutes and then we'll look into that
there are a few native connectives which
are available with tableau 9.1 which
were not available with the earlier
versions here you can connect to
critical data services such as SI p
which is more of a structured data it
gives you structure data and then you
can also connect to Google Cloud sequel
these two are the additional data
sources which are included and you can
connect to these two as well using
tableau 9.1 that's that Vantage now
tableau 9.1 right has something called
as SDK now we know how to extract the
data from tableau from Twitter to
tableau you should install something
called as tableau SDK just an insight
find the new ones I'm giving you
so that you can connect to the data
extract the data and publish the data to
the wider audience as part of tableau
9.1 you can connect to Amazon Aurora
which is a fast release tell database as
a service from AWS Amazon Web Services
you can also connect to Google Cloud
sequel a feature filled my sequel
database which is hosted in the cloud
right in earlier the work connectivity
issues with respect to ASAP Hana and SCP
VW now we have improved processing speed
when connecting to these two data
sources and whatever newer variables
were there there is support for that and
you need not enter the user credentials
with single sign-on authentication right
that's a good path right and there's one
more thing which is called as we can be
proximity for example say you're trying
to find out the distance between two
variables you can find out the distance
using radial selection to let me show
you that and there are a few more things
which makes sense if I show you in
tableau all right this is still
extracting so i think i can use a
different set there let me create a new
one and let me connect to the invalid
asset which is sample superstore there
you go I have the samples at the store
now let me show you quickly on what are
the new features right we have Amazon
Aurora which we have just discussed
about and if you guys remember on what
other few other things which are
spooking around you can connect to
Google Cloud sequel right in there are a
lot of other additional things which are
available here for example
map our Hadoop hive right this
connectivity for mac i'm using mine by
the way for a mac wasn't available now
we have access to Michael's right and
Microsoft Azure is a new addition there
all right so these are the way these
data sources which you can connect it
now with respect to radial selection
tool right I'm going to show you that
particular visualization on Twitter data
which is getting uploaded so until then
let me show you another quick example
here on a new feature so all you need to
do is select latitude and longitude and
do a drop down off show me panel and
select your symbol map now if you drag
and drop maybe this time let me do it
with sales or what is profit don't let
me do profit on all right let me drag
and drop profit into the color region
all right and it should appear by the
way something's weird in this particular
visualization why it's not coming at
much let me also drag and drop sorry the
country into detail now that's showing
these two values now if I hover my mouse
there you see an option to zoom in and
zoom out which we maximize this for your
benefit so there is an option for you to
actually zoom in and zoom on what if I
want a person not to zoom in on Tamar
and view the visualization as is because
the information that you want to pass on
to the people might get distorted right
if you give this provision for people to
you know zoom in zoom odd and all that
the important visualization is gone
probably you do not want them to have
this axis on zooming in zooming out so
is there a feature available for me oh
yes what is that you all you need to do
is go to map and select our do and
uncheck on this option which is a lo pan
and zoom there you go now their option
is disappear to do not have that option
any longer right in another good part
about this is you have drag and drop of
analytics what does that mean let me
show you once again let me drag seals
and drop it on columns let me drag
profit and wrap it on the rules by the
way this call is column shelf and Rose
shelf in this is your measures pain now
since you are seeing only one data point
that itself means that the data is
aggregated so let me discipline get that
here is your data set now if i go to
analytics in say i want to drag median
with core times the moment i cry it's
giving me options right it's saying that
do you want to do it on sales of profit
do you want to do it for the entire
table or entire pain or entire cell or
any particular cell there that's the
beauty that's the power of analytics
right and this is called as
drag-and-drop analytics feature within
tableau which is extremely fast now let
us see whether the Twitter data got oh
yeah now look at this Twitter data is
successfully loaded into tableau right
now if you want to visualize this first
of all do not forget that
you need to download tab Lewis DK and
then only after that you can do this
analysis so let me do this let me drag
and drop latitude on two rows or
longitude on two column shelf right and
let us drag and drop use a location on
to detail there there you go right these
are the wages locations where people are
tweeting in from and you can also change
the background off the map by going to
map map options right here the
background can be changed to dark if you
feel that that's going to make
interesting visualization right tableau
is extensively used for showcasing when
the aesthetics of the visualization not
just selling the stool so there's a
power of this and then you can't extend
your wash out to make the background a
little lighter so that it's not scary
let me minimize the shimmy panel and
here we are once again so if you want to
know how many people are tweeting from
the various locations and if you want to
please that in the size there you can do
so that actually maximizes and says that
these are few locations from bare
minimum number of people are tweeting
right sometimes your longitude and
latitude values might do for our cause
you need to manually rectify those but
otherwise the maps in tableau are pretty
dynamic show most of it or not you'll
not see that problem and if I want to
know or if I want to color based on the
country i can do so let me see
yeah that is why shriniwas I was seeing
that latitude and longitude values might
be skewed here so there are a few
questions which you guys have asked me
let me take those questions first erin
has this question is it necessary to
learn are no it's not mandatory to learn
are however if you learn statistics not
our stylistics you can better use delize
the features of tablet because tableau
as I've told you the real strength lies
in data visualization no doubt about
that however if you know statistics you
can make even better use of tablet how
is it different from click view is what
our own is asking me Aaron tableau and
click view your competitors but as I've
shown you even before we got started
with a webinar that tableau is the
market leader why because of all these
things right and do you have any more
questions you can start shooting the
questions now right though there are a
few things which which I need to explain
you you can shoot in your questions what
are all other prerequisites for tableau
shriniwas there are 0 I'm not sure
whether I've got your question or not
there are no other prerequisites for
tableau however if you know how do if
you know are if you know any other
database right you're good to go I
has this question how statistics
knowledge will help if you know
statistics what are you going to do on
tableau you are going to do reporting
you are going to create reports for your
end users right you're going to create
reports for your stakeholders however if
you know statistics you can predict for
example your customer see is that they
show me my sales data based on different
departments based on different years
different quarter's different locations
you create a report for them what if
rather than showing that static report
you actually build a prediction on top
of that and say that based on this
historical data this might be our sales
moving forward for the next quarter this
might be your potential seems will they
not be interested in looking into those
kind of enhanced reports right for that
reason statistical knowledge what is
going to help ashish now fragile has a
question what kind of volume of data are
we talking about for quick responses so
I work with 1gb data and it worked
absolutely ok for me and if you have a
higher database right for example if you
have five gb of data are 10 gb of data
tableau has a provision where then you
can write your own code so let me show
you that just a moment if your say
trying to export an excel sheet just as
an example now here rather than copying
and pasting this entire thing I can
actually write a sequel query right and
extract only those things rather than
extracting entire thing so if
see here I have fifty two rows are all
50 tiros equally important for me I
don't know right if you see this there
are thousand fifty tea rose and a lot of
columns are all columns equally
important for me I don't know however if
you know on what are those things which
might be of interest to you you can
actually connect only to that rap for
example the here is my samples store let
me see edit data source all right so
artists here there's a lot of data
people there's a lot of data there in
riddance right there's a lot of data
there let me drag and drop in for
everything right when you know for a
fact that there are a lot of values
within that you can write your own
sequel queries to extract only those
columns of interest to you rather than
extracting the entire stuff in there my
father last question so let me start
ignite can we replace pentaho bi with
tableau here yam what you can do so now
she says
not get I'm not sure what you did not
get how statistical knowledge will help
was your question my answer was oh yeah
so you got it fine what kind of volume
of data are we this is something I've
taken the establish in the gartner's
magic quadrant for data visualization
technology oh yes DB aren't you I've
shown you that the tableau features in
the leaders quadrant above all the other
players shrinivas's and from dotted
background with 13 years experience what
are the opportunities as you know data
analytics data visualization these are
the buzzwords which we are hearing as of
now right in the current Poland this
trend would continue for the next
probably ten years or so because the
amount of internet penetration than
amount of our the number of smart
devices the amount of data which is
getting generated will not come down
hence the demand for extracting
inferences from those kind of big data
sets will not come up so there are
flitter of opportunities in that is
there any certification related to data
anna data analyst by clouded ya makan
there are a lot of certification courses
available on cloudera what is the
maximum count of colors that we can use
from color palette a nickel there are a
lot a means let me show you that so for
example with me rub down on that let me
say I want to edit the colors a lot of
colors you know and you have a custom
sequential custom diverging right so
there are a lot of things which you can
do we will step in all that considering
all that I would say there are a lot but
I cannot really comment in the count
however there are a lot
in one of the basic functionality
differences between etl basically what
informatica does here you know whatever
transformations that you want to do on
the data sources you need to perform on
the raw data only then you can load it
into tableau right tableau is and
warehouse came back in Cognos there is a
framework manager that transforms data
base layer to presentation layer in
tableau is there a similar framework
manager equivalent yeah tableau has we
server and a different layer all
together presentation layer which works
on similar lines to what your framework
manager does in columns in SAS we we
have predictive analysis forecasting is
there a similar feature in tableau oh
yeah we can use predictive analytics so
let me show you that that's what I've
shown I believe in the first place yeah
these things are your forecasting right
so based on that equation so let me say
describe trendline right so this is the
model that you that we have built a
prediction model let me maximize that
right and here you have all those things
right profit sales intercept and all
that based on that you have this
equation if I hover my mouse and that
you see that profit is equal to 0 point
3 to 5 9 8 8 x 60 if you have the scenes
value you can forecast your profit in
that way if you know the sales for say
the past 10 quarter's then for the 11th
and 12th or 13th quarter you can
actually forecast forecasts is nothing
but time series peace yep in short we
have the treat Ashley
how does it auto pull from an XM file
database it's going to Otto pull with
the Jewish can database queries be run
on tableau absolutely do Bianchi
database queries can be run audio sequel
queries can be run you win it can we use
the native mdx to exhibit that or I
should say or lap analysis data visit
sorry VIN it I didn't quite get that
question can you be a little clear water
all scripts tablet supports any of your
leading scripts ramish to put it in
sharpie any of the leading scripting
languages that you have everything is a
put in tap in trial and I'm unable to
see this features are yet which feature
in trial also you should be able to see
her head if it's in the 14-day trial you
can actually look into that Ashley thus
tablet in memory concept and does it
have sentimental analysis yes you can
perform a lot of sentiment analysis also
in tableau you can do word cloud you can
come up with a positive negative word
cloud you can do all that I schweet
that's extremely easy in tableau or it
says this i'm done with big area
certification working on Big Data
project now how can tableau add value to
that let me give you a small example if
Nestle is your client for example right
there's a lot of data that you get from
facebook there's a lot of data that you
get from Twitter social media you can
actually use Hadoop as a platform hi and
you can have a connectivity to tableau
the output of your hive can be used in
tableau for visualization visualization
for example a swing was asking on
sentiment analysis if I have thousands
of tweets available how many people are
going to tweet positively how many
people are tweeting negative things
do all that announces right in nickel
says I'm working on top of the line and
I have dimension that has different
values more than 20 but when I drag this
the color palette I'm getting duplicate
colors any reason probably you need to
select the appropriate color from the
color panel or nickel we need how
tableau is good when we integrate with
external application data application I
mean tableau ensures that it meets your
life easy by connecting to all these
kind of external data sources right and
remember the strength of tableau licen
it's visualization so whatever you are
building using your whatever application
you have external application you can
integrate with tableau and look into the
visualization fragile how our dashboard
shade with relevant uses and how is data
level security applicable on reports for
that you need to have something called
as tableau server within tableau server
you can set your security on who should
be given read access who should be given
write access and all that alright so
I'll take your questions in just a
minute let me show you one important
feature in tableau and then i can
probably take your questions so there is
yet another good feature in tahoe which
is based on a histogram histogram is a
very good visualization tool when it
comes to looking into your long till
concepts and all that so i've connected
to the sample superstore data set let me
select the profit and just x
span the show me panel and say hey show
me the histogram right in tableau
earlier version it used to take the
default bin size there the pin this is
called as a bin size and it used to take
the default bin size however and the
default was 10 mins 10 such pins would
get generated however in tableau 9.1 you
have this additional option in which let
me show you that just right click on
that particular measure go to create and
click on Vince it's going to show you
what suggests bin size based on what
kind of data set you are using real-time
tableau 9.1 is going to suggest you on
how many such bins you need to have to
represent your data rather than taking
10 as default which was in tableau 9 now
this is a very good feature right it's
going to suggest you on how many bins
you need to have in a data set that's
the beauty of tablet right now let me
show you one another feature and then
now we can you know I can probably take
your questions so with I connected to
this sample supuesto data set let me
drag country into the column shelf there
and let me drag sales measure in two
rows and profit measuring two rows there
now let me select the scatter plot and
let me do this exercise of
disaggregating the measure now
the main menu we can select the analysis
tab here and this feature is extremely
important because you know by default
all the values are actually aggregated
so that is what I have just shown you do
not forget to do that because otherwise
most people say that hey there is only
one value appearing though I have
selected all the countries that's very
important and the next thing is you can
drag and drop the state onto your
filters shelf and here if I go to
condition and by formula look at the
beauty of this you need not just filter
based on whatever values are there
instead you can write your own formula
you can filter the various fields based
on your own formula right and this is a
new feature once again right in tableau
9.1 all right and it has a lot of mobile
features wearing you can download
tableau on your iPad or Samson notepad
and then you can operate tableau just by
using your finess that's two fingers and
the entire visualization can be done and
there is also one small thing which is
called as a motion chart let me quickly
show you that and then we can move on
let me go to world indicators and all
you can do is let me drag life
expectancy of male or female and the
health expenditure let me Seguin
desegregate and that's the most
important feature let me drag and drop
ear on the filters there and let
let me see that hey we want the art
sorry let me drag and drop the two pages
there and you see all these values let
me change that to circle it makes life
easier let me select drag and drop
country on to that now this is called as
the dynamic map which actually changes
so what you can actually do is when you
go to your client you can have your
reader represented in this format and
you can create this animated graph and
while this animation happens you can
actually explain your entire story so
instead of showing you country let me
show you region that makes muslims here
you'll have lesser data points Alyssa
colors so you can probably see that here
I have us its GDP is increasing however
Africa also health expenditure has
increased and slowly and steadily this
is the status as of 2012 so you can
create these kind of animated maps and
make your story even more interesting
there all right how can we connect a
blow with high hbase spark so Mohit we
have few connectors called connected for
high connector for HP a spark in all
that once you do that within tableau
itself you have these connectors so you
can connect with mapper Hadoop 5
haughton works hi Claudia also is 0 do
so you can connect to all these years
it's
there is a small setting which you need
to do it on your hive and one and then
you need to take you need to type in
ifconfig which will give you the IP
address of your hive and then take that
and put it in tableau when you click on
connect to the data source you'll be
given an option to clean the username
and all that can we use OLAP analysis
database and mdx we need has this
question yes we need we can use that can
you share the URL using the web data
connector absolutely I can do so prachi
al do so will the tableau run fine if I
replace a geography the map in the
background by statistical maps bar
graphs pie charts normal curves or
Poisson distributions absolutely the V
anshu it works well let me quickly show
you right it's extremely easy in tableau
if you want load an image right all you
need to do is click on an image right
and it's going to ask hey which image
you want me to place here right or if
you want to place a a web page there all
you need to do is provide a URL for
example let me give this URL into your
dashboards you can add even YouTube
channel set right so this is how simple
it is to actually you know create a
dashboard with all those options can you
suggest some open source data sets on
web to do the analysis on tableau re
hand there is tableau public tableau
public itself has a lot of interesting
data sets there right you can directly
download from you muha a moment that
would take a lot of time right instead
let me quickly mohit wants me to show on
how to connect to data source if you
have hype i haven't installed on this
mime
nah but if you have high go open that
right and say I of config you'll get the
IP address take that IP address guru
whatever beat put the server IP there
and it this has only five server I
believe but if you are using Windows you
live you'll be able to see five server
to which is the latest server there and
probably you can give their respective
authentication and then connect to that
right and there will be a lot of
connectors let me show you that for
instance there is odbc connector for
right within cloud itself you'll see
that all you need to do is go to flower
or whatever well application you're
trying to connect there you need to go
there you have all these things right
you have hot and works Hadoop 5 you have
Cloudera Hadoop you have mapa map are
hadoo 5 all that so whatever you are
trying to do go to the appropriate you
know version if you are using Windows
there and download that once you
download that there is a small
configuration setting which you need to
do but explaining that here might not
make sense um Ashwin has this question
in SAS we it has a feature where in it
automatically selects charge depending
on the number dimension and measures is
there a similar feature in tableau
absolutely we have one so for example i
think i have already shown you for right
Lottie cure and much if i do not select
anything for example say i do not select
anything there here are nothing gets
I light in the show-me panel however if
I select only profit let me click on
Santos opposed to if I select only
profit now nothing none is selected
right and this is you know a floating
panel so none is selected there now if I
click on profit suddenly you see that
these two bars sorry suddenly you see
that way didn't you yeah these two
visualizations got highlighted what does
that mean so if you have only one
measure these are to the to appropriate
graphs visualizations and what if I also
select say scenes along with that or let
me select sales and profit right if you
select to two such things or let me
expand the century once now if i select
highlight those to scatter plot got
highlighted there so tableau has this
intelligence within that which sees that
hey given these to measure these are the
three visualizations which you can
perform you can perform a bullet graph
or a scatter plot and if you see and if
you notice clearly scatter plot has a
blue blue bottle there highlighting and
saying that I as a tool would suggest
you to go with scatter plot however you
can also do a bullet graph are a
horizontal bar yeah this is a good
father wore to Templeton let me take you
know the questions can you please show
how to save a report on how to publish
it and send across to my company so
a lot of ways to do that one is if you
have your tableau server you can go to
server and you know publisher workbook
on to your server so that all your
audience can see on server you can also
set your security which says that these
bunch of users should have read access
our tableau public is open search a free
for download but you not have all this
database connectivity and a lot of
features would be missing in that and
say your people do not have any of your
tablet stuff you can actually save your
file in an PDF format you can save your
file in ppt format PowerPoint
presentation and all those things are
possible right you can export your
package workbook and yeah these are the
various ways that you want to probably
save and you know share it across your
community there can you also suggest
some complete open source software like
tableau which is equally good as them re
hand with in data visualization space
you do not have anything which is even
closer to tableau which is open source
right that's the sad part action can we
have
number of visualizations in one view and
an option for the users to select the
dimension in majors dynamically what do
you mean by the rush we I saying that
can we have multiple visualizations and
then when we change the dimensions and
measures see those changes in multiple
other visualizations is that your
question our schwing so while Ashwin
gives more clarity on that question let
me take this question what is it that
tableau has that cognos definitely
doesn't weigh the girish I'm not sure
whether cognos have so many analytical
capabilities of building your prediction
models building your forecasting models
on the fly as compared to Tampa odbc
drivers need to be installed and tablets
over no you need to install that on your
desktop OOP Indra so Ashwin if you are
questioned ease on these lines let me
quickly clarify that right for example
let me create a new dashboard there so
you can actually do all these things
drag and drop multiple things right
that's your dashboard collapsed assuming
panel right if your quest
is can I place all these things in this
way and then make changes in one
location on measures and dimensions and
see how it's going to impact all of
these things exactly that's your
question I do not think so number of
visualizations in 1 mu by that I mean
three different graphs in one view so
for that you know we can create this
this kind of a dashboard which objection
and you can have a lot of visualizations
in 11 place all right do you have any
more questions if you have no more
questions then thank you so much for
attending the session this recording
will be shared across with y'all good
night folks if you do not have any
doubts or you can ask me now all right I
see that there are no more questions so
thank you so much for attending this
session hope you have enjoyed on hope
you have got few key insights and all
the best if you are wishing to pursue
your career in tableau or data
visualization profession along with
analytics thank you so much folks thank
you we need thank you mark on good night
when eighth thank you d-1 you my name is
Barney with a garish good night deviant
you Thank You Finland thank you needle
thank you so much oh yeah ashwin if your
question ease if you give your reports
to customers will customers be having an
option to select the dimensions and
measures yes they can do so all right
thank you so much friends why it's not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
