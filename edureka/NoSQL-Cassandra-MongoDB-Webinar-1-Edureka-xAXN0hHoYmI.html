like to welcome you all the webinar on
no sequel databases Cassandra and
MongoDB two are the most widely used no
sequel databases currently so my name is
Suren kumar so i have close to seven
years of experience working on databases
so both relational non-relational
databases and distributed systems
architecture etc so i'll be
demonstrating i'm going to talk about
these databases and also demonstrate you
some of the related topics ok i'm going
to show you how to perform some
installation do some basic operations
but one of the notable database is that
i'm going to present today alright so
during this session I mean I could see
that first of all I would see that there
are too many participants from join for
this session i'm very glad and happy to
see so many participants so since this
is going to be an one hour session so
there I know that I mean there will be a
lot of questions from lot of
participants so after every topic that
we want to talk about there will be a
small big during which i would like to
you know answer the questions I would
like to take the questions from you all
all right so and again by the end of the
presentation we will also have another
question answer session ok i will be i
have the question box in front of me so
whenever you have a query feel free to
post your questions ok and after a few
slides or after winning specific topic
i'm going to answer these questions all
right so let's get started alright so
the objectives of today's session our
first of all we'll just quickly go
through the no sequel databases all
right the different types of no sequel
databases that we have
and then we're all the fundamental
concepts behind this database is like
the cap theorem the absolute based
properties all right which these
databases support and then we'll quickly
see like what are all the different
options that must be considered when
opting for a specific type of no sequel
database all right so what are all the
different ones playing for all that
wanting to decide one is that must be
considered when you want to go for a
specific no sleep you little mix and
then we will quickly go through some
information about data modeling we have
two different no sequel flavors today
Cassandra and MongoDB so we have data
modeling concepts an introduction of
video modeling concepts and then some of
the real world use cases of both these
technologies who are all the companies
for making use of these technologies
what are they use cases how they are
making use of this technology is how
they are scaling up 48 etc those are
some of the things that we'll see and
after this finally I'm going to show you
how to perform some operations on this
technologies like I'm gonna show or some
operations on how to perform
installation of MongoDB on a Linux
system how do you connect how do you
tell them the server and a client a
really basic example how to create
tables how to query the data some of the
operations basic operations that are
performed for it so that you can have
some feel of how the technology works
all right so so this was the objectives
for today's session so moving on so the
first topic for today with understanding
a sequel database all right this no
sequel moment has started somewhere in
1992 I'll to that we had as you can see
on the screen we had a relational
databases will give you based and and
also the other model that you can see is
laughs all right so you must be pretty
much aware of the list of databases
which are shown here Oracle my sequel a
sequel Milo subsequent and he be to
follow all these databases I mean these
are like databases that are in the
market for a long time right so there
are a set of rules that must be so that
every application developer has to
remember when making use of these tools
or these databases all right so mainly
the application developer when he starts
downloading something right so he knows
that there is a database out there this
is this is what this particular database
supports so according to that I have to
come up I have to develop my application
and then integrate that's the day of all
right so that is how the thinking was
previously but you know gradually the
kind of applications that are being
developed you know you might have seen
that there are a lot of social
networking apps or no applications that
are coming up the pace of development
has changed drastically the development
cycles have shortened and and also the
kind of data that is getting generated
so far all these are diminishes the only
support relational data table data that
is stored in rows and columns all right
but with and then the last decade the
number of social networking sites than
plastic in the increase you know
resulting in generation of different
types of data structure semi-structured
unstructured data and since the reason
need in order to generate in order to
develop such application at the same
time the kind of output that the kind of
data that they generate so there isn't
need to have a different kind of
databases that can support all these
kinds of data formats right so obviously
they would have tried a relational
database
along with these applications but but
they haven't seen some any good
performance or kind of scalability that
they were expecting so they felt a need
for a different kind of database that
would suit the modern requirement select
modern applications so that's when the
movement of no sequel databases have
started all right so till that moment we
had only relational databases the table
format with structured data and and the
data from multiple relational databases
will flow gradually to a data warehouse
on top of which we run some analytics
all right this is what is the native
databases that we had that we have been
using so far so so once they fell in the
knee so a lot of musical flavors have
started coming up or if people have
realized the potential of no sequel
databases so that's the reason we have
lot of different types of no sequel
databases available in the market so
what if one of the reasons behind this
you know if you look at the kind of data
that is getting generated it's huge
tremendous right huge volumes of data
are being generated on Twitter or
Facebook every day event from all these
messages and all and then the pace at
which this data is generated is also
huge so these are all different
parameters that you can see on my screen
okay so with respect to all these
parameters there are you can see that
there is a huge change all right so even
it's not just the normal format on fixed
amount of data but given people in
addition with different messages to
share the messages the shade videos all
right so data of all sorts of types you
know that is being moving around all
these applications and all it is
generating huge volume
and better it is alright like that you
can see there are given other parameters
you know the type the value of the data
the type of data that is getting chain
raised and the value that it holds and
then the volatility so it keeps changing
content asp all day and it is and there
is also this parameter public curiosity
and variability so with respect to all
these parameters all right so they can
see a lot of changes with respect to the
data that is getting generated and
people were really eager to see a gator
beef all right that supports all that
that comes as an add-on to all these
features so they have got even even a
testing all these scenarios on how dbms
they have realized that you know that
this is not the right fit okay so so
basically the audience cannot satisfy
all these aspects okay so that is when
we have that is where we have almost no
sequel databases unless me a no sequel
database can never be a replacement for
an rdbms but you need to understand that
the applications are different the
fields are different the use cases are
different all right so previously we had
only one solution rdbms for all the use
cases but now that with the no sequence
is that we have no sequel databases that
we have we are slowly you know dividing
that space alright so we are trying to
identify that okay so these are all the
applications or the use cases which
would be a right fit for no sequel all
right so no sequel would be right fit
for those applications applications
would scale better would perform better
with no sequence so gradually that
that's how not the most equal database
modest and that we have lot of database
if not of development is happening with
respect to the no sequel databases so
basically there are some a good set of
features that are there so
I'll just walk you through that slide
has been so no sequel basically it
refers not only sequel ok so it's an
acronym that is used in the initial
phase to say that you know it's not just
the sequel databases that are present
and market but we have come up with
something which is something other than
which is something beyond the sequel
which is available currently current so
we have different flavors of your sequel
databases some which support SQL there
are some which have been own formatting
a very language format all right there
are different different types but this
is in general actually that is used to
represent all the nos sequel databases
alright so basically even by the end of
the rates database where the data will
be stored but the basic important there
are some important difference like how
the data is being stored what is the
data model how is the retrieval
happening ok and how how does this
database is skill alright so what would
be the performance of these databases
will they will there be finished FEMA's
as a part of these databases how is it
going to because all the different types
of questions that people usually have so
we'll just go through one after the end
of the hall right in having it better
understand we have a better
understanding of what these are what
this parameter sorry so bigger they're
handling capacity first the first point
y mas equal because they get a bigger
data handling capacity the first point
what I would like to mention before
moving on to this data handling
capability right so previously first of
all first important thing that we have
to remember is the scalability part all
right previously for example you have
started an application all right and we
have taken for example an instance which
is half thousand klicks away and 100 gb
ram some random numbers that I'm taking
all right and you have started of their
application for example upon consider it
as a gaming application so people have
start
playing that game and suddenly within a
week or a month time from him the Lord
has increased 10 or 20 times all right
and you file the maid for having higher
capacity because the current capacity
may not support what if the load still
keeps increasing all right so that is
where either if you are using an R dbms
in such a scenario so what you have to
do the only option is every hardware
will have certain limitations you try
increasing the ram or you find prison
with this and that who you can do only
to a certain extent all right so like
those are the hardware limitations even
if you reach that you have to replace
that with a better higher range of
hardware all right so like that people
ended up not spending a lot of money in
getting all the IBM machines alright so
so the first thing is there people have
identified that you need to have a
downtime with your application whenever
if suddenly if your application goes you
know beyond its capacity again we need
to spin it in reverse a lot of money and
again the scalability is making real
problem the scale would be linear
scalability if you can keep increasing
the existing hardware only up to a
certain links of course at an instant
and this is gonna take a lot of this is
gonna take a lot of a lot of efforts
most people take a lot of time and a lot
of other things are involved right but
imagine a scenario okay so charmingly
the lord has increased okay and within
few minutes i have doubled my
infrastructure or i have made it twice
or four times alright so as the load
keeps on increasing if i have the
capability to appease my infrastructure
without any down time without any
performance impact so like a horizontal
scalability you are adding you know n
number of instances paddle early which
are capable of handling all the load
that is coming to your instances so much
as if that is the kind of model that has
come up
at the same time in spell spending
millions of dollars on the higher
emissions the people have started coming
up with technologies which can scale on
commodity hardware which are cheap
hardware you can even bring 100 normal
rhythm cheap instances you will combine
all the instances and start your
application if an instance fails just
replace it with another instance because
they are really cheap alright so that's
how we have started painting with high
scalability part we are able to scale it
so this is one area first important area
so they are able to save money we are
able to get the scalability so once you
have got scalability the load will be
evenly distributed across so
automatically your performance increases
the load on an individual instance gets
produced right so like that so those are
the two important parameters first of
all which you have to remember right so
other than that every audio image along
with our DBMS in every architecture you
might see a caching layer right so which
is always the return the data retrieval
operations retrieving the data from the
memory is faster than returning from to
this okay so obviously every application
would have a caching wave but when when
it comes to no sequel databases they are
supporting the caching layer internally
hits the inherent quality all right so
you need not have to set up a new
caching layer nor the speed of the
things that is an inbuilt functionality
available okay so here itself we have
come up with three different important
perspectives apart from that the RDM is
the only support relational did right
but the no sleep well databases if
support non-relational did any kind of
data can be converted and stored inside
that database all right and then in
order to store such a kind of data the
schema part has been removed so there is
no he
no simple databases are schema-less the
people who work use it to the relational
side they might wonder like how does the
database look like if there is no schema
so basically here it's respectful if you
take any one one of the no sequel
database to explain this concept the
schema would remain at an individual
object level or document level all right
but but not at a table or a database
them so you can insert different
different types of data so you know
imagine the ease of storing the data if
you have a database supports like that
so imagine the ease of development so
even the developer's perspective is also
very important than we talked about the
data bits other than the features that
have explained so far even the
development developer should feel no
easing in order to start developing
applications that would support a so so
these no sequel databases they even have
this functionality they are similar /
feels very comfortable very easy the
time taken in on develop an application
has reduced drastically because so
because of when a no sequel database has
been considered but by the end of the
day as I mentioned before they are never
a replacement for a DBMS all right but
they have their own specific use cases
supporting use cases to which they are a
good fit so such kind of applications
for such kind of applications if you are
no simple database then your development
time will be faster and you will have
will get a better performance all right
and and also there are a lot of other
feature if that I'm going to talk about
okay so if you look at my screen there
is another interesting feature called as
replication okay say for example you are
having a single single node which is
handling all the Loon all right suddenly
if fifth instance has crashed then then
how do you face
scenario so we have this concept of
replication where instead of you know as
I've mentioned before one expensive
instance you come up with commodity
hardware and you make use of one heart
one commodity instance all right as your
server and then have some replicas
replicas of nothing but you know the
instances that continuously stay in sync
with the master okay so whatever the
family or consider them as primary and
the second with this poor understand six
your primary will have its acts like a
master with all the data and these
secondaries so they are not available
all the time that means they don't take
up any kind of inserts but what they do
is they always try to sync the data from
the master so in case if the master is
done automatically one of the secondary
comes up and it starts acting like a
master and then use it the best thing is
the end user will not be able to
understand that something like this has
happened on the bags so imagine such a
such a feature what if such a future
lies with risp it with this big data
bits right so these are all some of the
good advantages with features of these
databases but the contrary we also have
you know some negative options if you
compare them for relational databases
but honestly these are not the negative
points but these are features that have
been removed in order to you know scale
the database like a joints for example
ok so the rdb a mistake databases
disapproved joints but the non or DBMS
is they do not know the merciful
databases they do not support they don't
have table structure they don't have
joints that means you will not find this
function fengdu by an order by all these
things I mean mainly related to the
joints here because joints basically
what happens is
and you use a giant brain so basically
tries to combine the data from multiple
tables and imagine if your table has a
million records I'm just going to take a
lot of time in order to fetch the
information group it and then display
information for the end user right so
here what happens if so we have
completely promote the concept of joints
okay so in one way it's played one date
for the nurse equal space and the other
way so we cannot say that it's a
disadvantage but it is mainly targeted
for such kind of applications the data
modeling will be done keeping in mind
that there are joints are not supported
by these databases all right and then
there is no transaction support all
right so here acid properties are not
supported all right that means so as
I've mentioned before that is where you
know our DBMS has this unique support
you know how did we miss the support
transaction that is no sequel database
Leslie you do not support the
transactions so it's all about you know
in order to gain something we have to
lose something so these are the features
that have been lost and in and for that
they have gained performance the game
the scalability food came so if you have
such kind of applications where you know
the performance is a major thing
scalability is a major thing along with
the other factors all right then you
might want to go for no sequel database
so that is how to disturb their split
the overall application use cases in
between relational and no relational
non-relational databases the next one is
kept here all right so
you have heard about the captive theory
believe these are three properties
consistency vail ability partition
tolerance all right these are the t
important features that are expected
from distributed databases all right but
it is impossible to have a system that
satisfies all this key features added
I'm at a point of time alright so it has
been so and for every distributor system
so at least two out of the these three
features a distributed system must
satisfy two out of the three features
that are part of this theorem all right
let's go one after another the first one
is consistence which means that the data
in the database it remains consistent
after the execution of an operation
imagine a let's take an example of an
application all right so there are
different points all right so multiple
users can open the application from
different points and you have a common
database all right so for example
whatever changes that a particular user
has done ok so this change must be
consistent across so all the users solid
wherever they are they should be able to
see the consistent data whatever change
that helping read that must be same
across all the point all the access one
all right that is what consistency the
next one is availability all right which
means they shouldn't be found that
system must be available all the time ok
so you need to come up with such an
architecture so that as I mentioned
before right with respect to the
commodity hardware so if you are using
Android instances even if a single
instance is down you have a replica that
automatically comes up so that the end
user will not be able to see that
difference right so that is a perfect
example
availability but that's how you make the
system available all the time and then
partition tolerance so with respect to
partition in dollars in form so now we
are seeing that the databases are
distributed geographically so so you may
have a cluster with some ten instances
those are distributed across the globe
so there is a possibility that there is
a network outage pay or or even if you
have five instances in a single country
and five different places there is a
possibility of a network outage so we
need to ensure that even if there is a
network outage alright so the system is
not down the application is not done and
the user is not going to get affected
all right like that these are the t
different three important things that
must be considered when developing and
using a merciful database harder so I'm
just going with the questions all right
quickly I'm going to answer a few
questions none so while the question is
what is velocity for among all the
factors that are being unscrewed with
respect to the way data is getting
generated for right so velocity or
refers to the pace at which data is
getting generated all right so just
imagine that how many people must be
making use of Facebook you might see
that there will be lot of views of
straight everyone will be sending
messages or posting some ad which will
be shared across be like so every click
that you do will generate a lot of care
of you generate data Atlas to click the
related generated so this year this
dealer the pace at which this data is
getting generated is huge so that is
that is what refers to the velocity part
okay and another question is about
document level schema which I have said
so in an R DBMS alright so before for
example you have you have you wanted to
create and your database already create
a few table spread so before inserting
data before storing the data inside and
our DBMS you have to define the schema
that this is what the table is going to
look like these are all dishes this is
these are all the number of columns
inside of the type of the columns this
is the type of data that will be stored
so the basic definitions which you make
with respect to the schema right so all
all these operations you know they have
been there completely avoided with no
sequel databases that means if you want
to insert some data just tronic variant
insert the data the table may not be
present the database may not be present
all right but still without the creation
of any kind of schema you can insert the
data inside the database so imagine for
example take another example ok say you
wanted to p8 a new table and dump the
content from or you want to come up with
a new database you are doing some
migration part ok so what happens is you
need to create the industry my entire
table structure and then you need to
copy the content from one database to
the other one but here it's going to be
very simple ok because the schema is not
involved you need not have to explicitly
define anything imagine that how much of
an administrative asst book gets
produced here so by the end of the day
the developer has gonna decide what kind
of table you want to create all right he
is going to choose the column names and
all and he'll simply start the
application which will automatically
create the table and dump the
information into that table all right so
that is where no sequel databases are
very beneficial and they're very fast
there it is a lot of system admins work
all right next there is a question
another question about the partition
tolerance how how does the systems work
when there is a partition tolerance okay
so I'm going to explain this concept or
if I if I see it generally right I mean
I'll give an example when we go to
ascend out mongodb there I will explain
you about the partition tolerance we
will take very simple cluster all right
so even though there is a network outage
these two systems how did the two sides
of the cluster your application is not
down so the requests would still be
taken by these instances all right and
I'll give you more details let me
explain that architecture first then it
will be easy for you to understand this
concept with an example all right and
there is another question it's from car
p so he's asking you have a small doubt
storing the data in the hardware using a
DBMS system and distributing the data
over hardware's you have no secret can
you please explain further okay so for
now let me give you an example ok so
imagine touch there is a single silver
ok and I hope you might have heard about
the load balancer so the end users are
facing your application so some hundreds
of users are connected to your
application and the load balance is
basically it helps to distribute
distribute the load but here you have a
single server which is linearly scalable
and all the load is going on to that
single salute it is handling the entire
load now imagine a different scenario
where i am talking about the distributed
database ok you have ten instances all
right all ten instances are sharing the
load now the load balance of what it
does is whatever irrespective of the
number
requests that are coming the data is
distributed among all the ten instances
so the load will be split among ten
instances so paralleling the ten
instances will be serving the requests
all right so imagine the load will be
equally distributed the beta is equally
distributed and imagine that since the
look obviously the load will be less the
performance will be more and the
additional advantages imagine that okay
all the ten instances are taking a lot
of loot I mean the end users have
increased all right so obviously load
has increased now what happens is knew
you wanted to again you know increase
you wanted to horizontally scale you
bring ten more commodity servers add to
the existing ten now it became 20 all
right and automatically you auto balance
the load that means whatever data which
is there again redistributed among all
the 20 instances all right and the load
balancer would automatically understand
that okay now before it were ten
instances in order find instances again
it will start distributing the load
across the pointing so if that is the
kind of architecture that you have so
imagine how the performance would be and
found the scalability all right so
basically whatever inserts that you are
doing they are not going to a single
instance but they are distributed among
10 or 20 instances so parallely along
with the insert even the read operations
are also distributed all right so
automatically the Lord gets ready you is
the performance and other factors would
be improved I let me know if you have
any further question regarding regarding
this all right so I'm going to explain
more with respect to all these features
when we go to the corresponding database
like Cassandra or MongoDB then you will
understand better all right i will show
you maybe i will quickly product
architecture and show that you how how
these things work all right
hello just one last question maybe our
nobody i'm going to make a note of all
the questions in case if your question
is not answered we'll make a list and we
will reply back to this question all
right so one last question so from a
participant is j so is asking like how
does the system decide which instance is
to be communicated for which request
that's a good question J so has a
mentioned right there is a load balancer
so and which distributes the load across
all the instances right so this is just
a and a simple example that I have
mentioned but other than the load
balancer so it also there is also
another system in place that maintains
the metadata of all the instances for
example imagine that along with the load
balancer there is a functionality as a
part of the lower balance of itself okay
so what happens is whenever the data
gets redistributed among all the ten
instances okay this information is sent
to the load balancer the moment the
radar is redistributed so the road
balance of gets gets that information
and whenever a request comes alright a
database update has to be happen the
load balancer will maintain all this
information it will look there in which
nor the corresponding request has to be
sent and then that request will be sent
from there okay there is a mechanism in
place also to understand how the data is
distributed all right so you can it's
like the metadata of the data so that
information will be maintained and it
will be sent to the load balancer
alright let's move on to the next slide
now so among the three properties that
we have seen from the cap theorem all
right these are all the databases and
where they would fit in so
you see the are DBMS so it comes so it
mainly you know considers the
consistency and availability part all
right and similarly these are some of
the most lethal databases MongoDB HP's
and Freddie's so so they consider
consistency in partition tolerance so
before you know coming up for any
specific application before you want to
start using database so you might want
to check this particular picture all
right so which database supports what so
what parameters are being unscrewed for
that database all right so as as the
caption says 2 must be satisfied with
this is how these properties are being
considered by these databases all right
so as i have mentioned a sequel database
you know they do not satisfy the acid
properties but it is the base properties
that they've satisfied which means the
base refers to basically available so
the system does guarantee the
availability will be up and running all
the time okay and the next one is soft
state soft state means this is with
respect to the consistency all right so
what happens is you might have heard
this feature of journaling just to make
you understand about it the journal in
what it does is when you try to lose
some inserts okay there is a journal
file maintained in the system that
maintains a track of all the changes
that you have done and first of all it
will write those changes for the journal
file and then at a later point of time
Kate no update on your disk all right so
this is what is eventual consistency is
so so the soft state means so even
though it may not update it the very
next moment but these later basically
ensure that the database is eventually
consistent alright so that's how they
maintain that so that is the third point
the eventual consistency which means the
database
be consistent for a period of time okay
so most of the nurse into databases they
satisfy the ACE principles so as I've
said you're around once more than 5000
sequel databases in the markets which we
categorize all these types of databases
all right so these are like four basic
types of database this one is document
database that means the data is stored
in the form of documents all right and
then we have key value stores so it
basically supports only so basically if
you look at the data rate and it's all
about a key and the corresponding value
is not his present already so if you
take you have heard about non-cash p so
that's an in-memory database all right
so it is it is basically very simple key
value store alright and then we have
draft databases which are mainly used
when your data is mostly length or
related all right so this is you might
have seen this application in lingdon
alright so next year profile it shows
the length like how we are linked to
different people in your network so that
is where i grafted of it so those are
the use cases where craft stores are
used okay and then the next fourth one
is the pole m store so where data is
stored in the form of columns okay so
Cassandra basically is a column store
and the MongoDB is a document store okay
alright so here is another list of all
the other databases the key value stores
and then we have column based
document-based couchbase already are the
document oriented databases and then
with craft stores we have similar
flavors of no sleep in like new 4g
oracle no sleep collects data
all right now selecting another sequel
database so now that see initially the
categorization was between our dbms and
no sequence so we understood like what
our degree which is good at and what we
can achieve using no sequel database
right now again we have seen different
categories under no sequel database so
we have document oriented databases all
right and we have a key value pairs so
imagine you have a simple application
where the rhythm only the generating
only key value pairs so you might want
to respect to a specific type of noise
equally ailable ebay right so again
under no sequel you may want to go for
the key value store so maybe if you have
a requirement like I don't want to
persist the data on the disk but I just
want to know what ever the data gets
generator and I want to do some
processing of the data and again you
know display that later from the
application so and caching layer would
be sufficient for me so that is where
you might want to opt for a key value
store because like memcache d okay so it
has it only has the caching layer the
data is not stored on the disk holiday
like that so first of all we need to
come up with the list of things that are
important from an application
perspective and having you know the pros
and cons of all these different no
sequel database books so the first
category is if you know the first thing
we have to think about is about whether
it should hear a DBMS or a no sequel
database and then coming to Los equal
again based on the different categories
that we have and based on the
application requirement you may further
decide which no sequel flavored would be
most suitable for your application ok so
here of as you have passed and some of
the queries we have so this is the
general architecture we can just refer
to both these slides
okay so as I mentioned before no sequel
databases you know you know we may not
find this caching layer over there so
here it is a different layer but with no
sequel they have this thing here and you
know property of supporting that
replacing that caching layer so this
would be a simple example you know this
is the application the database player
and then you're caching layer has been
replaced all right let's go through this
individual databases quickly so starting
with Cassandra SNY again is an open
source distributed database system all
right so it is it is so if you look at
the advantages of Kessel right is no
high-performance it is mainly used for
distributed database data storage all
right so it has it also supports high
availability with no more single point
of failure so these are all some of the
advantages you don't need a caching
layer these databases they also support
a little bit they also support they also
have invented a competition utilities
okay and then they also they are also
trout compatible nowadays every
application is I know every organization
is opting for club so all this
technology should be supporting the
supporting the clouds in this session
raise one and open okay again so looking
into each of these features okay so it
has its own query language like SQL it
has cql it's not very language it also
has a MapReduce support solid so and
then it supports tolerance for a torrent
consistency and as I mentioned before
regarding the concept of replication
okay so it supports replication it has
the N build support for multi data
hundred replication we can have n number
of instances among which data is
distributed and and again each instance
will have
we'll have a number of replicas all
right configured so that you know in
case of a disaster recovery the replica
will be turned to a primary and it will
start serving the request serving the
load again so what are all the use cases
where cassandra is a good fit where you
have billions of records and columns
like the big data and then there is a
velocity is hyping the pace at which the
brilliant right operations are happening
if they are very high then so Cassandra
can be a good fit for those applications
and and also you have wide column
requirements and then you know there is
a change of schema every time or once in
a while you might want to change your
schema all right so that is another
requirement and the next one ends no
multiple secondary indexes so as I
mentioned before to an extent these
databases they do support indexes but if
you if you require multiple secondary
indexes and all this may not be the
right fit all right and then if you have
low latency then also you might want to
offer Cassandra okay so don't use
Cassandra if your application has or
required secondary indexes number two
relational data Cassandra mainly
supports non-relational data
semi-structured or unstructured data it
does not for relational data okay and
then if your application is expecting
transaction that means you might want to
do some operation and if you feel that
it is not really wanna you might want to
roll back so these are not the kind of
data bases that support the
transactional model okay and then if you
were expecting secured expect security
and if you are expecting authorization
at the data level so assembler may not
be a right fit for you okay other than
that the other two options for searching
the column data and also having dynamic
release from the columns all right so if
we have these specific requirements and
Cassandra may not be the right fit for
you okay
so these are some of the use cases for
Sarah for Cassandra some of the
companies that are making use of the
columnar database in order to store the
data so you can see your supportive use
cases as well so they have migrated from
our dbms to Cassandra so it's all about
as you can see great the number one
point analysts of 1.5 billion fault and
storing 80 million records alright so if
it only deals with you know huge amount
of data and also this data will be
distributed across so it performance is
is so if you're looking for a single
instance alright then Cassandra may not
you know you may not feel the
performance of it only when you have
clustered multiple instances and only
you can see the performance how how you
can achieve the end goals using
Cassandra alright so the next one is
MongoDB so nobody is document-oriented
database which means data is stored in
the form of documents inside MongoDB
alright so so what is the format of the
documents so data is stored in the form
of JSON documents all right so
JavaScript object notation internally
the data is stored in the form of beasts
on all right which is a binary JSON
which is a body to an advanced level
next level of Jace one all right so any
kind of data so there are a lot of you
know you can write your application in
any language mogul to be basically
supports lot of languages Java C C++
thought it like that folder and these
vendors there they make all all kinds of
drivers available / to use its three
respective of the development platform
that you have you can start making use
of MongoDB all right you can download
the drivers and
integrate your the application with the
Mongo database okay so coming to the
features of MongoDB so it is
document-oriented you can run a doc
bailey's and then indexing is supporter
so even the MongoDB documents do have an
index field primary index and then it
supports replication so for replication
and sharding are then build features of
MongoDB okay and then we have load
balancing usually with our dbms a
separate load balancer will be used that
distributes the load but I Spit MongoDB
there is an inbuilt functionality which
acts as a load balance but i will show
you what the load balancer is a good
performs okay and then we have
aggregation function which means so
MongoDB also has a query language so
basically it is the dress in the JSON
format okay so but it is rich with the
ingre gation framework that would
support that means all I mean most of
the functions that you see in our dbms
like grew by order by sorting right all
these functions are many they are also
available with the education framework
of MongoDB it supports all those
functions so we will see how how those
functions are and then we also have a
server-side JavaScript execution and cap
collections so in the MongoDB world the
tables are called an election all right
so a a collection again here this is one
specific type of collection for this cap
collection so which is you can imagine
that to a circular buffer alright so
instead of what do you see a normal
table that you imagine you can imagine
circular table okay which is of a
specific fixed size in nature so the
data can be inserted til the extent
tilde know the size
you have located for the table after
that the data will be overwritten all
right so it's almost like a circular
buffer which is there where you are
inserting the pinna so this is that's a
different category of collection we will
see that collection as they're like how
it look like so next one is so here we
have a quick example to explain the data
model of MongoDB all right so imagine
that he wanted to have a blog already
you wanted to post blog so these are all
some of the general information it's
best to the block like you wanted to
have even a title description URL
alright and you wanted to have a lot of
tags and then you know some specific but
not like your tag and the comments that
these are posts all right so all this
information related to the blog now let
us see how this data can be placed
inside a DBMS as well as inside a
MongoDB alright so I'm sure you'll we
might have this in your mind that in an
R dbms there will be multiple tables at
least with the kind of data that you are
seeing at least three different tables
all right so one table okay i'm going to
put comment ID post ID all this
information which will be linked it to
another table called posts and the third
one is the board packs so you're going
to store this information in three
tables and whenever you query for some
information you may want to join these
tables and display that for the end user
right this is the general are they be a
mess way of storing the data now if you
go to MongoDB all right so you can see
this is called as one document so this
is the which is a JSON format so we have
key value pairs okay so this is P the
corresponding value and it also supports
erase that means inside the value again
you can have a nested key value pairs
all right that is the basic JSON format
JavaScript format so then
it is stored in three different tables
so here we are storing all that
information in a single document so if
you want to carry something you just
have to request this document only so
from this document the fetch you pull
the fields whatever you want it to
display and display that to then use
them so here no joining 71 right so like
that imagine a huge volumes of data with
multiple tables alright when you perform
a joint operation all right it's it's
very expensive whereas here all the
information all the related information
is stored in a single document and that
information you can filter it and
displayed as per your requirement so as
a developer so you define all the
information for a document and when
retrieving it we also define the fields
so everything price in the hands of the
developer so it will be convenient to
develop the application that week so
that is how these databases have been
designed so these are the way to use
MongoDB so it is mainly a replacement
for web applications content management
and high-speed locking real-time
analytics because it supports a very
good framework right and then we have
caching late mom already supports memory
mapped files for it so that's how the
operations would be very fast for it and
it also apart from you know the paper
concept it also supports high
scalability we have a concept for
Charlotte where you know the data will
be split across the instances so we will
I'll explain more on that so that is how
it supports a high scalability aspirin
alright and then also it supports it is
a right fit for staff and gaming related
applications so what it is when not to
use MongoDB again the same like other no
sequel databases for highly
transactional applications what if he is
not right fit and then
applications where we have foreign key
constraints normally we cannot be right
with for those businesses that's good ok
so these are some of the users of
MongoDB alright let me go to a few
questions and then I'll show you a demo
of these databases how to install how to
run server and the client instance all
right okay so all right this question
which I have seen the last one I prolly
see one question this is regarding this
different function i will update happen
on one would if you wanted be costly as
compared to our dbms hell it for this
question i was just you know Oh saying
that since na dbms you know we have
multiple tables and joints are in world
so with respect to no sequel databases
like Mongolia right there are no joints
your old as you have seen the simple
example which have given so all your
inserts would be happening on on that
particular document or you so it is at a
document level you will not be combining
there is no concept of combining the
collections but we it supports the
concept of having you know the nested
fields you may want to have collection
inside a collection that is what it
supports so by the end of the day you'll
be wearing only one particular
collection for them for your data
alright so there is another question
does MongoDB support happened or update
operation yes it does support all these
operations as I've said it has a very
good framework all right aggregation
flavor it supports all these operations
you can also remove by you on way all
the operations and we have another
question from Shashank can we use
indexes in MongoDB yes we can use
indexes one more go to be it is
supported all right so let me give you a
quick demo and then maybe we'll go
through the question answer session
again
hold it so i'm using a centos instance
all right i am showing a demo on my st.
OS instance so this is a center is six
instance alright so what i did is i have
quickly downloaded the MongoDB package i
hope you have gone to the MongoDB side
or all right let me show you the package
so this is the the latest version
available Modig III is the latest
version okay so i have taken this tzz
format or entire organs and i have
extracted this particular package to
this folder all right now here inside
this package so even if you take a
windows / should not in the next
question alright once you extract the
package you would find a folder inside
called as bill okay this contains all
the binary is related to mongodb okay as
you can see mom Goldie in this list
mongo d is the binary or the demon
behind the Mongo database alright and
then we have something called manga
which is a client okay like you have SQL
the mysqld and mysql similarly we have
one body and one room okay and then some
of the other binaries that are available
are Mongo import and export if you want
to import and export the data from went
to MongoDB it supports different types
of file formats like JSON she asked me
like that so those are the tools that
are useful in on to those operations and
then we have one go dump and Mongo
restore operations so basically if you
want to dump an entire database or you
wanted to maintain those stumps
periodically in case of any failure you
wanted to restore it to another system
and make it up and running so so for
those operations we have Mongo dump and
restore and then some of the other
binaries here are useful in order to
monitor your MongoDB so Mongo start and
also manga top
like that ok so just giving you a brief
of what these tools are and if you want
before starting a MongoDB you need to
make sure that you have data folder
where the MongoDB is going to store the
data ok and then you will also be using
a log folder where you may want to store
the logs in case if your instance
doesn't start it would dump the 0 msgs
into those logs all right some quickly
showing you how to run the MongoDB so
dot slash mom would be so that is the
demon that starts your server ok and
hyphen hyphen DP path so what is it is i
have created a data folder in my
previous directory ok which i will be
using in order to store the data and
then hyphen hyphen log but even i
created a lox and you can name you can
give any name all right sebago do not
lock it is going to create it and store
that information inside that look ok and
I'm going to run this server in the back
room now the question is what is the
what is the port on which this service
is going to run so one going to be by
default runs on the port to 70 17 ok so
the server will listen to the client
requests on the port to 70 17 ok now
what I'll do is I'm going to take a new
fight Mongo new dot log ok let's see
what is there in that logs molonu not
lock ok so these are all the list of
logs that aren't generated ok here if
you see server instance I've started in
this line yet I started on the default
to 70 17 ok so here you will get all
their error messages as well so now that
your server is running that is your
manga d instance now you can run Mongo
that is the client ok so the client will
try to connect to the server
that poor to 70 17 so now i have
connected to mongodb okay so some basic
commands maybe to have to give you some
understanding so BB so i have connected
to the test TP so if you want to run
your server on a different port you can
pass that as an argument when running
your server so along with type type and
BB but you can say hyphen hyphen port as
that port number then using the client
so here I ran dot slash Bongo whereas
you will be mentioning host name colon
port okay and then maybe name and then
connect so that's how if you are running
on a different port you will be
connecting to it server okay so let me
connect again so i have connected back
so this is the database to which i am
connected you can do show db's to check
all the databases that are present in
the system and you can do show
collections basically collection is
called as a table in one would it be ok
so here you can see that if i'll got
generated called a system dot indexes so
whenever you create something then the
corresponding indexes would get
generated someone has asked this
question like whether it supports
indexes or not yes in their support ok
and so these are all the collections
which are there i will show you the
format of these collections and so
basically there is a format that that is
followed in order to query the tables or
in order to insert or do update
operations ok so here debby dot you can
see so that is the default convention so
all operations that are performed on
databases so they'll start with Libby
door ok so debbie dot my column is cold
one so i hope you might have observed
that it supports tab completion feature
Cole one dot I say insert so again
inside insert we need to follow the just
notation that is key value pairs ok so
for example X colon one
okay it's a given lipid ender so it has
inserted it similarly comma I'd say y
colon to enter inserted I mean between
these two examples I hope you have
understood that it doesn't support
schemas right so in the first first
entry I word is I have updated a single
document in the second line I've updated
to documents like that so there is no
specific format define your scheme are
defined now I am going to do is e colon
this time I am going to insert an
array-like that detail have nested
document structure okay so this is how
you perform the inserts no debe dot Cole
one dot five off so it will display
those documents for you now do this dot
pretty off so you see so its key and the
value key and the value pair that text
there inside now if you observe in all
these fields that I'm inserted so there
is a additional field called underscore
ID is equal to object ID some random
number so that is like your primary key
alright so by default when are you in
certain document automatically this
field would get created along with the
other fields and the default by default
the indexing is enabled on that
particular field you cannot modify this
field so this gets generated by default
but if you want it is possible to
suppress the output suppress this field
from the output current but you cannot
avoid it so like this you can see you
can randomly if now I'm in this database
if you want if you want to create a new
database just say use chef boo boo so
the database get created all right
similarly you can you just have to save
the vdot collection not inserting need
not have to create but directly you can
start inserting the data
so this is how data gets inserted inside
the single instance all right so for
this single instance so this instance is
running on a particular port now what I
can do I can parallel lead on three more
instances on three different ports and
configure them as a replica set all
right so there was one question like how
does you know the beta gets identified
so basically imagine that there are 100
records already 100 records are split
across ten instances so this process is
called as sharding all right we have an
auto shorting feature in MongoDB so for
example if you add new instances
automatically this data will be
distributed among all the 20 instances
all right it's an inbuilt feature p need
not have to manually trigger anything so
whenever this sort of redistribution
happens all right I hope you have
haven't mentioned about it so here along
with Mongo Mongo d there is another
binary called Mongo yes ok so Bongo yes
is called as a router ok so it performs
you know the operations of load
balancing and it also takes care of
maintaining the metadata of the system
that means now all the 20 charts that
are mentioned that means each having ten
dell documents each total hundred
documents so this distribution if when
this is called as sharding now every
instance is having ten ten record
straight so Mongo yes what it does is it
will maintain that information so it
will say that ok instance number one is
having the courts one to ten instance
number two is having records 11 to 20 so
like that every time an auto rebalance
happens this information will be sent
and that information will be maintained
so along with Mongo and one would be
basically if you take the architecture
right
let me show that to you so basically
it's the mongol d that is responsible
for starting your server okay and with
respect to MongoDB architecture
basically there are three different
types of servers the first one is the
shard server that maintains the data you
have something called conflict server
okay so previously I have combined these
two functionalities like load balancer
and also storing the metadata basically
it is the config server that maintains
metadata and the shard server has the
data and Mongo yes which is the router
that takes care of the load balancer
operation okay so if you take the
architecture of MongoDB so you have an
application layer and then you have the
drivers the driver layer okay let's
think with me show this so take imagine
this as an application layer okay and
then you have your application specific
drivers for job or any one that you have
chosen okay and then you have a router
which is basically a long way yes okay
here
and then you have something called it's
the same mobile d instance but it will
be run as conflicts over all right now
at the bottom you have short swords so
as I've said if you have a hundred
documents you have split all the under
documents across these servers okay now
what happens is let's take five so
automatically whenever a request goes
from your application layer okay using
the driver it will try to connect to the
router ok now this router what it will
do is it will try to contact the config
server the config server only has the
metadata ok so the conjugate will
contact the convict server and it will
understand that ok this information is
present in charred one so the request
will be routed to find one similarly the
request will be routed across all these
shorts ok like that you can you can
maintain multiple config servers for
production is mandatory to have three
and then you can have a number of
routers as so like this if you want you
can keep on our know increasing scale it
horizontally and increase the number of
instances as per your load requirement
so this is how basic architect lies with
respect to MongoDB so we have all these
topics as a part of our syllabus ok you
can go through these slides the course
related information like what are all
the crude operations that are performed
how to design the scheme on random
modeling how to administer so I haven't
mentioned about the security features of
MongoDB but there is a very good amount
or list of security features which are
there respect to authentication
supporting Kerberos support the data
communication happens at an F using a
special so that is the one there are
also some other good features which are
part of the syllabus ok so we covered
the scalability available in replication
and the sharding
part regarding the indexing aggregation
framework all right so all these
features are covered as a part of this
course all right so other than this
similarly even with respect to Cassandra
so starting with the data modeling
regarding the architecture an overview
and how to configure it how to monitor
and maintain tuning the database alright
for all the important topics are
included as a part of this coast alright
so let me quickly pick up questions now
yeah so that is question from frumpy can
no sequel ever be used with transaction
purposes the answer is no you cannot use
Cassandra or MongoDB for transaction
purposes they are not supported all
right and then so another question from
initial so see if in your example if I
get one more comment then first I need
to update that post and then update the
JSON file one more comment in LXE
basically the rail I stored in the form
of JSON documents all right so even a
can so when you do a fine all right when
you find query that displaced output in
the JSON format so if you have a new
coordinate so basically in the example
that I showed you all the related
information is stored in a single
document okay so if you do a new comment
all the associated information along
with the comment will be stored in a
single document if that is the kind of
data model that you have okay can I so
another question from honey Ruth can one
key has multiple values associated with
with it yes as I have shown you this
example all right here maybe i will
quickly show that to you again all right
oh okay this is one example I showed you
I go to another database bebe.com one
dot find up see here so basically key
values okay how you can also have
multiple values so you can insert an
array inside and the value field so key
and the value again you can have array
or you can also have nested arrays
Sookie and send the value place again
have a key value again in the value
place you can have a key value like that
ah yeah so there is another question
from insertion code since the ids are I
mean how do we know which data to
retrieve and which one to update when we
don't have the primary key ID see here
underscore ID is the default you know
field on which indexing is done okay and
you need not have to remember those
ideas on how i'm sorry i don't think i
have understood your question will if
you want you can also enable indexing on
the other field so what i mentioned if
so you have this underscore ID field
where by default and then mixing this
enable other than that if you can you
can also have multiple indexes so
another question from Isaac I thought
Cassandra and MongoDB has GUI for query
etcetera yes there are tools available
alright so one is robo Mongo or that you
can use that as a front-end gy you can
connect to wrongo database you can
perform all the operations using that
GUI ok and then there is another
question alright so another question is
will be used goes GOI in the training
yes those gos are also used in which in
the training we will be using both the
CLI as well as this you the GUI part
so the next question we have is will
training cover both admin and
development so so far you can see topics
that are being covered here all right so
let me take mongodb course as an example
so starting with the architecture
installation crude operation scheme are
designing the schema designing is kind
of comes under the development part all
right and then we have indexing
aggregation framework all these are
there as a part of our syllabus so we
also covered the replication and
sharding part so other than that there
might also be you know topics on how you
can integrate the database so how to
make use of the driver how to integrate
that to your application like that okay
so as you have as you can see on my
screen I'm not sure if you have followed
this on how to retrieve the data so they
be dot collection name dot find off so
that will print all the information that
is present inside the database okay you
can use pretty off to display in a user
readable format the way I have done
similarly you can do DB dot call dot
remove off in order to delete the
content and VV dot you can simply say
drop database off in order to completely
drop the database so as I have mentioned
before there are a lot of commands
available most of the things that you
perform are the corresponding functions
are available here there is another
question like in terms of performance
which is the best MongoDB or Cassandra
see I mean as I mentioned before it even
if you have compared this with an R dbms
we cannot give an exact answer it
totally depends on your use case on the
kind of application that you wanted to
come up with the kind of data model that
you are looking at so you need to know
assoc
that along with the advantages of these
features that when there is with the
features of these databases and then you
need to pick one among the two all right
let me take a one last question maybe if
there are any questions left we will
follow up on those questions all right
and we will post it in enough four
blocks so that you can refer to those
queries so one last question from lithia
Shankar let's see I'm on facebook and we
have data score in JSON from many users
okay how do i retrieve data just about
my company so here see you say you are
saying that when Facebook you are you
have they restored in the JSON format
yes basically the driver convert
students towards the data in your
database in the JSON format and again
when it comes to the queering part okay
so how can i retrieve this data what if
my data is split among multiple
collections in MongoDB so so here right
basically the concept comes from the
developer end to the database it's not
like the database has been built
everything has been said now you come to
the dryer the developers position and
think how to query the data but
everything lies in the hands of the
developer the developer decides how to
store the data if you are expecting that
all your company related data must be
part of a single database if the single
collection so you come up with a data
model like that and store the data and
know based on that your retrieve
operations will be dependent all right
so that is how we have to model the data
from like quite the other way around the
way you rode an RD be mrs. opposite to
what we do here if everything lies in
the hands of the developer so as per
know the model that he has in his mind
based on the head the application will
be developed and the data will be
queried
