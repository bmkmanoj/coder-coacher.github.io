tutorial of selenium today we are going
to cover selenium grid so what are we
going to learn in today's session why
what building a selenium grid and
hands-on so basically if you see these 4
circles why
as in why selenium grid what is selenium
grid how to build a selenium grid and of
course hands on why you selenium grid so
you can see a picture here this guy is
thinking how kids reduce tea time for
completion of a large desk suite I need
a tool to run test cases in parallel if
I could run my tests all at once in
parallel so first is thinking about how
you can run these test cases in parallel
so that he just reduces the time of
running the running all the test cases
in this test suite now I think how is it
possible I mean how can I run these test
cases in parallel so the solution and
selenium grip now it's not just about
running test cases in parallel there's
more to it why in one place why using
selenium grid yes of course selenium
will let us run our test cases in
parallel so in save a lot of time as
well
now that's there that's the main thing
by anybody would use selenium grid the
next thing is that let's say you've
created a new web application right now
you're going to launch a web application
you would want that all your users
whether they are using a Mac system
whether they're using any version of
Windows or they're using an advantage
system or Linux system or any kind of
browser for that matter they should be
capable of running every function on
your web application without any issue
that's your requirement now to do that
test whether your application is working
fine or not on all platforms selenium
grid is D solution because here we will
be working with different environments
as at the different systems with
different in one
when I said different environment I
basically mean different operating
system different browsers different
languages whatever you want to have but
maybe having different environments and
maybe running test cases if you want
parallel then parallel and if you want
to execute a test case only on a
particular system having a certain
configuration then also you can run your
test cases so what is selenium grid
let's understand selenium precisely as I
go through the slide first then I'll
explain it allows us to execute a script
on different machines at the same time
now you won't understand until you get
to know what does selenium grid comprise
of so this line is saying it will let us
test crypt on different machines at the
same time and of course if I'm saying at
the same time that means on different
environments I need to run test cases
Baddeley
execution is possible on different
machines with different browsers same
browser with different version as well
it saves a lot of time and effort for
execution I mean that's obvious if I'm
able to run my test cases Baddeley on
different machines then I'm saving a lot
of time it consists of a heart and
multiple nodes that's the point to
understand hub works as a central point
controlling all the nodes nodes are
actual machines on which execution is
done so if you read this line this point
you get to know that hub and node are
actually the systems and these systems
will comprise of selenium grid hub will
be a parent PC which will be controlling
all the child systems and your child
systems are nothing but nodes so if you
look at this diagram this is how hub
works
okay now understand it here you've got
four systems this 1 2 3 4 5 sorry 5 not
4 ok 4 nodes I just use my spotlight so
this is how
one system second third fourth and fifth
now my entire grid consists of five
systems wherein this is one system which
is hard it is controlling these four
nodes let's say this is node 1 node 2
node 3 node 4 now as I said you can run
test cases on different environments you
can see that node 1 is using or has
Ubuntu as its operating system and is
using Firefox you can see node 2 is an
Internet Explorer working on Windows
node 3 is a Safari on Mac and node 4 is
in droid don't get confused guys you're
not talking about mobile applications
we're talking about applications running
on mop is okay you cannot test mobile
applications using selenium ok now you
can see that this hub this line shows
that test cases are written here that
means actually all the scripting entire
scripting will be done at this end and
the execution will happen on these nodes
that's the reason we've specified
browsers here because execution happens
on browsers right however we'll be doing
all recording on this hub and then from
this hub we'll be calling these
different systems now if it's your
choice my choice whether I want to call
all these systems parallely or I want to
call a particular system ok depending on
my need ok let's go to the next slide
now these versions of selenium grid
requires a batch a and installation
which is selenium 1 does not need Apache
and installation has its own remote
control bundled with selenium server jar
file now earlier with selenium 1 you can
relate it to selenium 1 as well you can
relate selenium grid 1 with selenium 1
since Lehman one we had remote control
right here we needed Apaches and
installation to run grid whereas here in
selenium 2 what I need to run grid is
only selenium server standalone jar RA
and this can support our C commands
selenium Britt - can support both RC and
webdriver scripts in selenium grid 1 you
can automate one browser by remote
control in selenium grid 2 you can
automate up to 5 browsers all right so
these are the difference in the two
versions of selenium print hop and node
I just go through the points first hub
is a central point where you load your
tests now I've already explained this
point hub is a machine where you'll
write all your scripts so if this point
is saying where you load your test it
means that all your death grips will be
written here only one hub in a grid so
in this entire grid system will have one
hub and multiple nodes launched only on
a single machine say a computer
now if you want to launch a hub
obviously this is dieting this entire
configuration consists of systems so you
can launch this only on a single machine
let's say a computer node selenium
instances that will execute the test ok
now when it says execute the tests this
basically means all the execution as in
the running of test cases it will happen
here on these machines all right you see
a browser coming up and then all the
tasks a steps working on your browser
one or more nodes in a grid sets your
choice whether you want to have one node
or multiple nodes launched on multiple
machines with different platforms and
browsers so you can choose to have
multiple machines with different
platform each machine can have a
different operating system can work with
different browsers also ok building a
selenium grid I hope you've understood
the outer architecture of half n node
all right so we've got multiple systems
here we've got half the
just apparent PC and we've got nodes
which are the child systems right till
now I've been saying that you'll be
writing your death grip on your help and
then all the execution will happen on
your note how so I said your hub will be
giving the instructions now how can any
machine instruct another machine until
and unless both of them know about each
other so that is what we'll be doing
here we'll be doing some configuration
and we'll be running a few commands to
do that consecration so that your hub
nodes which all nodes have been
registered to her and even the nodes
should know that who is our parent
system from whom are we going to take
this command right so these are the two
commands now how do you run these
commands to run these commands we need a
command prompt okay so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to open up my command
prompt laughs you guys you need to
understand one thing before I do
anything further you have to understand
this point that grid is all about having
different systems this is alive I mean
sorry that's not a nice class now
obviously you're going through this
recording now in life classes also if it
is an online life class I can
demonstrate grid just through my system
right so I be considering my system as
harp and also as node I'll tell you what
to do on your systems okay don't worry
about that but here we'll be considering
my system as have and also as node ok so
right now I'm trying to create my system
as the hub system ok the parent system
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come out of this directory structure
I'll tell you the reason CD dot dot
isn't man to come out of the current
directory structure ok and now you can
see that I have come to see now why have
I come to see because what I've done is
and what is suggested is you place your
selenium server scandal
not char file okay at a particular
location on all your machines so that
you'll know where this jar is present so
that's a requirement okay if you don't
know that to prerequisite I'll just
write down on my notepad that's a
prerequisite okay
what is the prerequisite prerequisite is
to have your selenium server standalone
file handy video so where do we need on
your hub and all your notes okay what is
suggested it is suggested that you place
this jar at the same location when I
think the same location I mean to say
same directory structure create a folder
in particular I mean anywhere where you
want and follow the same thing on other
systems as well okay on all the systems
so if I'm saying that you're working
with or you think that you want to work
with two systems so what you can do is
you can have one hub as your system as
your hub and create your system as node
one and want another system from your
friend or spouse or anybody okay and
make that system as note to all right
now please selenium server standalone at
the same location everywhere so where
have I placed it I've created this
folder I just open it right I've created
this folder and seed Drive selenium and
here I have placed my selenium server
standalone so I'll quickly show you if
you see here I have created this folder
selenium and in here I have placed the
server standalone file now I want you to
do the same thing on all your systems
including all the nodes huh and all the
nodes because that's how you're going to
configure your grid okay now this is
there I have to run my jar and assign
the role of help to my system so the
command that I'm going to write is not
difficult at all to remember understand
like this Java any Java - sharkman to
run this jar okay and what is my journal
selenium silver standalone so I just
write a CLE because that's the only jar
present here and I'll press tab okay
I'll pick up the entire name
automatically now I want to specify the
role so the option is - role and the
role is off hub so that's what I'm going
to write here that's it it's very easy
to remember and press Enter what did you
see did you see launching selenium grid
hub okay and if you can see here
selenium grid hub
up and running that means I've already
started my hub with the simple command
selenium grid is not difficult at all
alright it's only perception people
think it's difficult no it's not
difficult at all alright my grid my hub
is up and running the next thing I want
to do is start the node so like I said
you can choose to have one node on the
same system and not do by having another
system alright so since I've got only my
BC here to demonstrate this I'm going to
open another command prompt okay I'll
just shift it here alright so that you
can see both of them I will again come
out of this folder so that you know I go
to the same folder selenium because here
one node as well we need to go at the
same location why because we've placed
the jars here now Java
- jar ok Java - jars selenium just press
tab this time your rule is of unknown
right because that's your note it's very
easy Java - jar and jar name to run your
jar then you need to assign the role so
- role is the command to assign the role
node is the option because here you're
working with the node okay now since
this is a node every node needs to know
which is the hub so - hub ok now come
back to this window
and look at this carefully ok note
should register to this location know
what should register - HTTP colon
192.168.1.2 : 4 4 4 4 / bread /
suggester my hub has already told me
where to register the nodes so what you
can do is just copy paste this if you
can't remember just copy paste it okay
and just go here to this window space
and paste e r /
register all right now : 4 4 4 4 you can
see that you have is running on 4 4 4 4
so 4 4 4 4 is the default board for
running your hub alright now there's one
more thing I want you to understand
before I execute this command guys
listen to me carefully now if I take you
back to eclipse
ok let me open any any file let them
opening day one alright only look at
these two lines do you agree that that's
the first thing that we do whenever we
write a script to instantiate a browser
driver until and unless we instantiate a
browser driver we can't work with the
browser and before instantiating our
driver all right
you set the system property when you set
this to system property so if you've
seen my other tutorials if you've gone
through my other tutorials that will
already explain this you need something
so that the instructions are sending
through this script is understood by a
browser otherwise how will your browser
understand that I need to find this
element so for that your driver is
responsible and you're already setting
this through this line so this exe is
nothing but server we don't want to
again go back you know into the details
into the intricacies that what happens
at the back end so there's the entire
protocol okay using this protocol we
start this driver and then your browser
becomes capable enough to take the
instructions which you send through your
script so just understand this much now
if I have to do this
where am I doing it I'm doing it on the
system where I'm writing this script
right that's where your browser will
open up right Chrome or Firefox when
will it open it will open on this system
only but in grid where is your browser
going to open your browser is going to
get opened up on your node which is a
different system now
isn't it your responsibility to do this
setting on the node as well otherwise if
you don't download your drivers on your
note how will your browser understand
the instructions that you send to the
script here on your hub so what I'm
going to do on this node is I'm going to
add something more to it so I'll just go
back okay before - jar so I'm going to
say - D - D is an option to do the
setting so I'll say web driver dot
Chrome dot driver equals so after equals
I need to place where my browser driver
is so go to D Drive account sha selenium
and here's my browser driver okay I'll
just copy this location first of all
then I'll right-click and paste and then
I'll again put a slash and unset
chromedriver
I'll just check the spelling also CHR
immediate driv ER dot exe and space so
by putting in this command you have
actually specified that look I have
already said this property here so my
browser is ready my chrome is ready to
take the instructions and then press
ENTER before I press and third like just
to open up this as well enter look at
both both of them carefully if you can
see here the last line says the node is
registered to the hub and ready to use
and the second last line is registering
the nodes to this hub okay it has
started polling your hub for
instructions now if you see here after
this line selenium grid is up and
running can you see here you've got
another line with C's registered unload
HTTP colon 192.168.1.2 now these IP
addresses are same nice because I am
running hub and node on the same system
but with you when you will do so you
want
get the IP address of your hobby we get
the IP address of your node and code
five five five five is the port that it
has chosen to run your node one now you
can do and run the same command on all
your nodes just make sure that if you
want to use any other browser please
using the same command - D okay set the
other browser settings also system
setting also okay like I've done this
for Chrome you can also do it for - the
webdriver decode driver for your Firefox
and give the location where your Kiko
driver dot exe is present alright now
this is done now if you look at this you
can't combine two systems until and
unless your firewall settings are off
that's a star point ok important point
if you are creating a grid please switch
off your firewall settings otherwise you
will not be able to create grid you will
keep on getting issues so I have already
created my grid just by running a few
simple commands let's go back to the
slideshow look here I didn't even take
you through the slides the reason
because the commands are easy and to
just learn them easily I went there to
the command prompt and then the commands
look here Java - jar this - role hub
ok that's 2 dot X X version but latest
is 3 so use 3 ok and this one Java - jar
selenium server standalone - role note -
hub now you don't need to worry about
remembering 4 4 4 4 / / / register
because automatically when you work with
your hub in the nfl's view that at which
location or which IP you have to
register your nodes - right so you don't
even have to remember this just remember
that hub takes 4 4 4 4 as the default
port all right configuring selenium quit
see if changes already that's the
default configuration
simply specifies - oil hub to the
selenium server this is USB - port
option for changing the port used by the
hub four four four four is the default
port just in case you want to change
alright how do you do that hub - port
and then give the boat also use the
command net stat - e Y to get your boat
alright work on all supported systems
unix linux mac and windows so this
command will work for you that's very
easy configuration okay now running
tests using grid so just go through this
and then we will see what else is left
here in selenium RC which you must all
be knowing that is it's deprecated so i
guess you know in future nobody would be
using this line in fact in present also
nobody nobody would be using this line
selenium selenium is equal to new
default selenium and then this entire
thing so we are not going to work with
this we are going to work with this with
selenium webdriver now this before I
take you through this slide again I'd
like to go back to my Eclipse and make
you understand a few things
here you have to give certain commands
from your hub and the execution will
happen on your node now on which nor do
I want to run my test case isn't it your
responsibility to specify that in your
script so obviously there are a few
requirements here if you want to give
instruction to your nodes you need to
know the IP address of your node right
now you also should specify that the
system okay the system is going to use
which browser and you can also specify
that what is your
operating system
okay that's one thing another important
thing is till now you were instantiate
in your chrome driver
your Firefox driver your internet
explorer driver your safari driver why
because your browsers will available on
your system this time you're sending the
request to a remote system so how will
you invoke the driver on this remote
system this time you won't be using
Chrome or Internet Explorer Internet
Explorer or Firefox as Vario anything
this time he'll be using remote driver
okay
remote web driver so I'll tell you now
we are all set to write the script so
again take you back here so if you look
at the commands we're using this desired
capabilities thing this is a class guys
which will let you set your desired
capabilities just understand the name
also okay which capabilities do desire
of how do you want to set them if you
see here in the first line I'm setting
to desired capability I'm setting my
browser and then I'm sending this
capability here indeed remote web
drivers this time it is no more a chrome
driver or a Firefox driver it's a new
remote web driver can you will see that
it's a new remote web driver and a new
remote web driver I'm passing a URL why
am i passing a URL on which lamode
system do you want to run your or invoke
your web drivers you need to specify
that IP address no so that's the IP
address okay and then the capability
then the capability okay so using taking
help of whatever I have told you we'll
write a few classes so what I want to do
here is like I've always done I'm going
to create another package here and I'll
name it as grid just grid okay
in here I'm 54 right going to write a
small class and sit test grid okay
with a main function and finish I'm
going to write down some piece of gold
pay attention here and have patience
you'll understand what I'm writing so
what did I tell you you need to specify
the address of your node so what do you
think we need first of all we need our
web driver right so let's say web
drivers driver control shift oh okay
control see the next thing we need is
I'll name it as node URL okay I want to
specify a node URL now I'm not going to
create any separate function I'll do the
entire thing within the main function
okay so what do you need now you need to
specify your node URL so you will say
node URL equals now what should be a
node URL whatever you can see here okay
did you see which IP address got
registered again you don't even have to
do netstat - or anything you can just
see it here so I'm going to just copy
this okay I'll go back all right
so control we and it has to be in double
quotes now
a fine old URL okay I'll have to make it
static guys for the reason that I'm
working in a static blog and I can
specify this also static there's no harm
in this particular script because anyway
I have to specify the node URL just once
in this clip and even the driver so it's
absolutely fine to declare these
variables their statics okay now other
than this 192.168.1.2 : 5 5 5 5 which is
support this is the option that just
want to specify that you have to specify
in your script ok that's done I'm almost
done now you saw a line called desired
capabilities there just press control
space when you write desired so that you
see what desired capabilities is and
let's say I'll say capabilities is equal
to now I am working on Chrome so I'll
say desired capabilities control space
that's a class ok dot I'll specify if
you can see here I'll just go back you
have got all the options in droid chrome
edge Firefox htmlunit inch HTML unit
with Jas Internet Explorer blah blah
blah blah blah opera or probe link I
mean all kind of browser capabilities so
I want to choose Chrome here ok that's
done I'm working step by step
whatever I've explained till now now I
said you can also you know kind of firm
do this thing dot
set browser name okay specify the
browser name so your browser name is
chrome so you can specify that here just
write Chrome here okay
all right you can also set your
capabilities press control space dot set
platform okay see a platform is how do
you specify the platform you have to
write this platform just press control
space okay why do i press control space
so that you get this auto detection of
the classes of the interfaces and i will
automatically take that okay if you can
see here we've got this class in or g
dot open to a dot selenium now I want to
choose platform as something that I want
to work with here and working with my
system my system has Windows 7 so I'm
going to choose option that is going to
give me Windows 7 so if you see here
we've got wind 10 8 8 1 and windows now
this actually is Windows 7 okay that's
done I've set my desire desired
capabilities I've said the browser name
I have set the platform the only thing
left is that I have to now invoke the
browser driver but how do I do that
here you will say driver is equal to new
remote ok just write remote control
space ok choose remote web driver
alright now as you can see here it is
clearly saying that you need to send
your desired capabilities okay I took
the wrong one because along with the
desired capabilities you also need to
specify that which is the URL so if you
see here this one this overloaded
function ok remote web driver URL remote
address and capabilities so I will
specify the remote URL and again ticket
ok so you will have to specify a new URL
day and your new URL is your node URL
and of course the capabilities control
space
and close it and put a semicolon okay
and the new URL is load control space
all right now can you think of why am I
getting this error you can see here that
I'm trying to create a new URL
whenever you see such errors try and
understand the airs these kind of errors
probably come from your compiler because
compiler is keeping the check on
whatever you're writing in your code
right if I take you here just look at
what this is saying you I cannot be
resolved to a type so first of all what
you do click on it and import URL you
don't have to get this one you have to
get the one from java.net import it now
you again getting this but on this
entire thing new URL so this is again
coming up from compiler let's see what
this is saying now unhandled exception
type malformed URL exception so here I'm
working with URL and this URL should be
a fully formed URL with HTTP so if
anything is missing it tends to throw an
error that's the reason it wants me to
surround this code with try and catch so
what I'm going to do rather than just
surrounding this line I surround this
entire code with try catch how do you do
that select your code right clicks
around with try catch okay just remove
this auto-generated file and sorry good
block and these extra lines I can't
control save and you can in fact delete
this one out for you control save now do
you think we're missing anything here
that's what you have to do you've
already set your desired capability so
the next thing you'd like to do is call
your I mean anyone Lu start working with
them whatever you want to do so we know
other than you know are invoking your
browser there are a few steps that we
always perform so what are those steps
those steps are driver dot manage dot
delete all cookies
and then driver dot manage dot window
dot maximize I'm just writing those few
lines which are important for every
piece of code I mean every application
every right
ok then drive old dot manage dot timeout
okay dot now I'm mentioning implicit
rate of thirty seconds and this is time
unit class okay control space dot
seconds control space copier done driver
dot manage dot time ouch dot page load
mention things show - let's say 45 okay
this is time unit class control space
dot seconds right ok the script is done
now as and designs are done okay driver
dot get let's say I'm opening Amazon dot
an HTTP colon double slash capital W
that Amazon
dot n and let's just click on today's
deals okay driver dot find element by
dot link text
I'm giving link text because I already
remember that Amazon
today's videos you know the options that
we get in the beginning gear Amazon in
today's deals so let's say I want to
click on today's view so I'm going to
inspect that and since these are links
that's the reason I'm using link text
I'll just take you to today's deals okay
can you see here that you've got this
text here just copy paste it control-c
and double quotes ctrl C dot click OK
done now my script is done if I will run
this script that means I'm running the
script on my hub but the Chrome browser
will open up on my node here in this
class you will see that this is
happening on my system ok but this is
actually happening on node okay so let's
run this right-click and before I run
this let's just make sure that
everything is fine add these two windows
on these two windows so I don't see
anything here or here which is I mean we
check contrast on I mean everything is
fine on these windows see before I
execute that script as this HTTP colon
double slash localhost just I've this
slash grid slash console alright now as
soon as you give this on your browser
all right on your address bar you will
see how many nodes have been registered
to this hub here you can see only this
one because every just add only node
only one node here if you will register
more than one node you will see all the
configurations just by typing in this
command in your address bar of your
browser now another thing you might be
asked that how many instances of
different browsers can I open in one go
you can't say as many as you want this
is telling you how many instances can
you open in one go so you've got five
five five four five
and one Internet Explorer okay remember
this command now let's go to the our
script
all right and I would like to run this
see attempting by dialect session and
this has come up it's opening Amazon and
should click on today's deals also now
again you're looking at this window on
my system as in this screen but this is
actually happening on the node so let's
say your node is another PC this browser
window will actually get opened up on
your node system and not on your hub
system just make sure if this fails by
any chance
check your firewall settings just switch
them off for some time and then test
your grid turn the time your firewall is
on you won't be able to create the grid
and execute the script okay so that's
how your grid works now the question
arises
I'm just moving ahead with something
more I mean better and advanced so I
want to go to the slideshow because that
was the last light all right now I want
you to understand this
this is just one script what if you want
to run multiple test cases in parallel
because that's the sense of having grid
so you can do that just by writing your
selenium webdriver school you need
somebody else's help and how do you run
your test cases parallely by taking help
of test energy right if you don't know
or if you haven't gone through my test
energy tutorial I just request you to
please go through just send your
tutorial as well all right now what I'm
going to do here is we want to create
two classes but test ng classes the
different classes have you create a send
new classes you need to go to other if
you've already installed this plug-in
test ng here then select SN g class and
limit as node 1 and finish it off all
right similarly create node 2 also new
go to other test ng class you won't get
this option until and unless test ng is
installed in your it
and I'll name this as node two and
finish okay
now you've got this node 1 and node 2
I'll just close this and what I'm going
to do here is I've got a config for day
oh all right
I will create another one and I'll name
it as new file and say grid dot XML
that's how I want to name it actually
finish now here I want to do parallel
testing so how do you do parallel
testing first of all your architecture
your basic architectures what I'm going
to do I'm going to take the first line
from any of these existing XML files
ctrl C close this and ctrl V so that's
your DTD
don't worry even if you don't remember
it it automatically comes as a warning
on your console for the first time when
you run your test ng dot XML all right
so we start by soon sweet and you have
to give it a name so let's I'm giving it
tests for it all right and that's the
sweet and then sweet I'd like to create
a test ok and you need to give a test so
test node 1 all right and let's done and
I want to create another test here and
I'll give it a name again
test note - okay in every test you need
to have classes in class okay
so classes and you say class now what I
want to do here is and first of all
expand this control it until shift F why
did I do ctrl a ctrl shift F so that
looks better
all right not messed up and I always
like to see my code properly structured
delete delete and here I'm going to name
this name name equals you need to
specify your class name and just close
it now enter ng you need to specify the
class name along with the package name
so if that's my class node 1 this is the
package grid so here
how will you specify it grid dot node 1
okay so that's done same we are going to
do here classes and class okay name
equals and your name is grid dot node -
all right just do this go to a shift F
alright now you can see mess it's
structured now these are two test cases
but I still not mention that you have to
run these tests badly so how do you do
that by having this
controlspace you're getting all the
options I want tests so I've already
mentioned that parallel is equal to test
I want to run my test cases on node 1
and not do it now remember these are not
two different notes for me what I'm
going to do is I'm going to mention the
same IP address here but I will run the
test cases first on Chrome and then
parallely on one on Chrome and another
one on Firefox so now since I've already
done these settings for Chrome so let me
write the code for Chrome on both the
nodes
okay then I'll change it but remember
I'm doing this on my system however it
does mean you can't do it with multiple
systems okay you just need to change the
IP address mention the IP address of the
correct node so we'll go back to test
grid and I'll just take this piece of
code ctrl C okay go to node 1 here you
can't have a main function you need to
specify everything in your test block
every test on annotation so delete and
then I'll also copy/paste this why not
don't need them to be static so just go
back and save webdriver you can specify
them as static as well there's no harm
just that otherwise you'll have to make
the function also static because you
can't call a static reference and none I
mean static functional variables and non
static reference and vice-versa
okay control shift oh just open it
controls things
okay let's done all right
we nose cone so basically I'm doing the
same kind of things I work on Amazon and
here let's say
stern
string note URL so I'm taking the same
IP address because I don't have choice
control shift oh okay I'll do the same
here as well just format the code
control save now I am working with
Amazon here let's go to node 2 and here
let's work with something else let's say
I want to open a base ebay slow so
that's going to take time so let it be
something else I'll take something in
website so at a conditional sale take
Facebook now or maybe not Facebook on
say an even Gmail when I was going to
take let's say yeah Broadcom I just open
it I'm not going to do anything
or maybe you can fetch the title and
print it
this out
titoo lives
get title okay
Space Patrol save and done alright now
this window is going to remain the same
because anyway I'm running my test cases
on Windows 7 here chrome can be changed
to fire faults but I just want to run
these two classes on the same browser
and then we change the browser for which
we'll have to actually add something to
the current window and I'll show you one
more thing as you run your test cases
see something happens on your node
window so I'll show you this I'll go to
this thing your grid dot XML and I'll
see it run as test in G suite and I'll
open this quickly you see things
happening here can you see here because
that's what I'm doing there and see both
the windows came up almost at the same
time here Amazon is working and here's
that here I'm working with yatra though
yeah tries a bit slow and here we've
almost clicked on today's deals right so
both of them are working on in parallel
that's what you can achieve using grid
now if I go back here alright there's
nothing wrong we've got the result you
go to your test output and you can see
the result here just go to email a
report okay and you can see test on one
sessional - and we've got the result
right now here I mentioned the IP
address of my system remember remember
remember you have to do this by giving
the IP address of your node so let's say
this is node 2 that the address and
that's node one's IP address okay now
I'll show you one last thing then what
if I change this browser from Chrome to
let's say Firefox here in node 2 for
which whatever need to do is I'll go
back here I'll go sure I'll quit this
I'll say control C what did I do control
C or Mac system users just press command
C ok I'll press the upper arrow ok on my
keyboard and I'll get this command which
I typed in last what I want you to
add is I want you to add - D webdriver
dot e co dot driver okay equals wherever
your equal sent so I think my key quiz
also here
control-z right-click paste okay
backslash key code driver dot e eggsy
and space and as soon as I press ENTER
it will again get registered right enter
okay it would just stirred the node and
cleaning up old stale sessions right now
if this works fine everything will work
fine if you see everything is fine on
these two windows everything will then
find here as well now I go to - no -
I'll change this to Firefox this one
also
okay that now understand one thing
though I'm about to run glass cases
parallely on these two nodes so see
every browser has got its old speed
you might see a delay of a few seconds
or a few milliseconds in what the
browser windows to get open up now pay
attention here alright I'll go back
again here to crib dot XML run as just
in your suite Firefox will definitely
get open up but will take some time a
few seconds delay because 5 volts
generally is lower than your chrome ok
it has open up - it's working
actually it has already shown erm okay
dem some objects I mean the screen name
come up which is absolutely fine okay
I'll show you the report here
okay if you see here that's node 1 and
node 2 and pay attention on the start
time for both the test cases why is the
start time same because I started north
1 and node 2 at the same time right so
the execution started at the same time
however this browser window took some
time to come up because every browser
has its own speed
in fact the applications also leave a
map Legation ok that's all about grid
from my size ok
just go back to the presentation and see
if you've got anything
no does that's it from my end
in today's class I hope you enjoyed
creating grid grid is very easy if
you've got any question just put in your
question in the comment section alright
you can also visit Eddie Drake our cool
I'll just quickly show you this go to
add record cool if you want to look for
a selenium course let's say or any other
course here just type in the keyword and
press Enter
alright and you'll see the course coming
up if you want to get in the course just
click on the course and you'll see what
all is included what all is not there
you'll see the curriculum and everything
we've in fact added IBM and UI Automator
viewer here we've also added third-party
tools so just click here ok
so we've added a lot here in the
upcoming classes if you wish to take
online classes you're more than welcome
and you can also go to our home page and
check for these reviews all right ok
