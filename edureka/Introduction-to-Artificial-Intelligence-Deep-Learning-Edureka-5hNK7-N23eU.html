Madeo Rica and today I'll take you
through a very interesting topic that is
none other than deep learning unlike
most of you even are deeply fascinated
with artificial intelligence
think about this instead of you doing
all your work you have a machine to
finish it for you or it can do something
which you thought it was not possible
for instance predicting the future like
predicting earthquakes tsunamis so that
preventive measures can be taken to save
lives chatbots virtual personal
assistants like Siri in iPhones Google
assistant and believe me it is getting
smarter day by day with deep learning
self-driving cars it will be a blessing
for elderly people and disabled people
who find it difficult to drive on their
own and on top of that it can also avoid
a lot of accidents that happen due to
human error
Google ai ai dr. so this is a recent
initiative by Google where Google is
working with an Indian I care chain to
develop an AI software which can examine
retina scans to identify a condition
called diabetic retinopathy which can
cause blindness a I'm is a composer who
thought that we can have an AI music
composer using deep learning and maybe
in the coming years even machines will
start winning Grammys and one of my
favorites a dream reading machine with
so many unrealistic applications of AI
and deep learning that we have seen so
far I was wondering that whether we can
capture dreams in the form of a video or
something and I wasn't surprised to find
out that this was tried in Japan a few
years back on three test subjects and
they were able to achieve close to 60%
accuracy and that is amazing but I'm not
sure that whether people would want to
be a test subject for this or not
because it can reveal all your dreams
great so this sets the base for you and
we are ready to understand what is
artificial intelligence artificial
intelligence is nothing but the
capability of the machine to imitate
intelligent human behavior AI is
achieved by mimicking a human brain by
understanding how it thinks how it
learns
and work while trying to solve a problem
for example a machine playing chess or a
voice-activated software which helps you
with various things in your phone or a
number plate recognition system which
captures the number plate of an over
speeding car and processes it to extract
the registration number and identify the
owner of the car so that he can be
charged and all this was very easy to
implement before deep learning now let's
understand the various subsets of
artificial intelligence so till now
you'd have heard a lot about artificial
intelligence machine learning and deep
learning however do you know the
relationship between all three of them
so deep learning is a subfield of the
subfield of artificial intelligence so
it is a subfield of machine learning
which is a subfield of artificial
intelligence so when we look at
something like alphago it is often
portrayed as a big success for deep
learning but it's actually a combination
of ideas from several different areas of
AI and machine learning like deep
learning reinforcement learning self
plays cetera and the idea behind deep
neural networks is not new but it dates
back to 1950s however it became possible
to practically implement it only when we
have the new high end resource
capability so I hope that you have
understood what is artificial
intelligence so let's explore machine
learning followed by its limitations the
machine learning is a subset of
artificial intelligence which provides
computers with the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed in
machine learning we do not have to
define all the steps of conditions like
any other programming application
however we have to train the machine on
a training data set large enough to
create a model which helps the machine
to take decisions based on its learning
for example if we have to determine the
species of a flower using machine then
first we need to train the Machine using
a flower data set which contains various
characteristics of different flowers
along with the respective species as you
can see here in the image we have got
the sepal length sepal width
teittleman's petal width and the species
of the flower - so using this input data
set the machine was created
which can be used to classify a flower
next we'll pass on a set of
characteristics as input to the model
and it will output the name of the
flower and this process of trading a
machine to create a model and use it for
decision-making is called machine life
however this process has some
limitations machine learning is not
capable of handing high dimensional data
that is where input and output is large
and it is present in multiple dimensions
and handling and processing such a data
becomes very complex and resource
exhausted and this is termed as the
curse of dimensionality so to understand
this in simpler terms let us consider a
line of hundred yards and let us assume
that you drop the coin somewhere in the
line you'll easily find the coin by
simply walking on the line aligned in
single dimension entity now let's
consider that you have got a square of
side hundred yards each and you drop the
coin somewhere inside the square now
definitely you'll take more time to find
the coin within that square a-square is
a two-dimensional entity now let's take
it a step ahead and consider a cube of
500 yards each and you drop the coin
somewhere inside the cube now it is even
more difficult to find the coin so if we
see that the complexity is increasing as
the dimensions are increasing and in
real life the high dimensional data that
we are talking about it has got many
dimensions which makes it very very
complex to handle and process the high
dimensional data can be easily found in
use cases like image processing natural
language processing image translation
etc and machine learning was not capable
of solving the few cases and hence deep
learning came to the rescue the deep
learning is capable of handling the high
dimensional data and is also efficient
in focusing on the right features on its
own and this process is called feature
extraction now let's try and understand
how deep learning works so in an attempt
to re-engineer a human brain deep
learning studies the basic unit of the
brain called a brain cell or anula
and inspired from a new run and artist
neuron or a perceptron was developed so
if you focus on the structure of a
biological neuron it has got dendrites
and these are used to receive inputs and
these inputs are summed up inside the
cell body and using the axon it is
passed on to the next biological neuron
so similarly a perceptron receives
multiple input applies various
transformations and functions and
provides an output as we know that our
brain consists of multiple connected
neurons called neural network we can
also have a network of artificial
neurons called perceptrons to form a
deep neural network let's understand how
deep neural network looks like so any
deep neural network will consist of
three types of layers the input layers
the hidden layer and the output layer so
if you see in the diagram the first
layer is the input layer which receives
all the inputs the last layer is the
output layer which gives the desired
output and all the layers in between
these layers are called hidden layers
and there can be n number of hidden
layers thanks to the high-end resources
available these days and the number of
hidden layers and the number of
perceptrons in each share will be
entirely dependent on the use case that
you're trying to fold and there is meh'
connects to decide the number of hidden
layers however will not get into that in
this session now since you have a
picture of deep neural network let's try
to get a high-level view of how deep
neural network solves a problem for
example we want to perform image
recognition using deep Network so we'll
have to pass this high dimensional data
to the input layer and to mask the
dimensionality of the input data the
input layer will contain multiple sub
layers of perceptron so that it can
consume the entire input and the output
received from the input layer will
contain patterns and will only be able
to identify the edges and images based
on the contrast levels and this output
will be set to hidden layer one where it
will be able to identify various these
features like eyes nose ears etc now
this will be set to hidden layer two
where it will be able to form the entire
faces and sent to the output layer to be
classified
and given a name now think if any of the
Slayers is missing or the neural network
is not deep enough than what will happen
simple will not be able to accurately
identify the images and this is the very
reason why these youth cases did not
have a solution all this years prior to
deep learning so just to take this
further we will try to apply deep
networks on an endless dataset so the
endless dataset consists of 60,000
training samples and 10,000 testing
samples of handwritten digit images and
the task here is to train a model which
can accurately identify the digits
present on the image and to solve this
use case a deep network will be created
with multiple hidden layers to process
all the 50,000 images pixel by pixel and
finally will receive an output so the
output will be an array of index 0 to 9
where each index corresponds to the
respective digits so index 0 contains
the probability of 0 being the digit
present on the input image similarly
index 2 which has a value of 0.1
actually represents the probability of
to being the digits present on the input
image so if we see that the highest
probability in this area is 0.8 which is
present at 7 index of the errors hence
the number present on the image will be
7 so this is how the handwritten image
processing happens let me practical
execute the fuse case for you so this is
my pie charm ide
first of all let me show you the dataset
so this is my mms data set and it has
got 4 G's at file which gets extracted
when my program gets executed now the
program or the deep neural network using
which I was able to create a model to
process all this images and train my
machine is this create model underscore
2 dot py and it fit good lens a program
so I'll not be explaining the entire
program for you but let me tell you the
technology or the framework with which I
was able to implement this so I've been
using tensorflow
which is one of the open source google
libraries for deep learning
and right here I have imported
tensorflow and then I'm using this
m-miss data and finally going ahead and
creating a deep neural network so these
all things are here it is creating a
deep neural network and the hidden layer
that is required to process all this
images and finally I'm creating a model
and I'm saving this model with this name
right here model 2 dot CK PT now if I
run this code it is going to take a very
long time so give it some time
it has extracted all the files and it
has started its training it is at step 0
now so in order to completely train this
model it is going to take 20,000 steps
let me show you in the program flow so
here it is then here I have the steps to
20,000 but you can always configure it
to a number that is thousand two
thousand however you have to run this
code for n number of times so that you
can achieve a particular accuracy so
after executing for twenty thousand
times what happens as a model is created
with an accuracy of 92% so what does it
mean it means that if you follow the
particular image out of one hundred
images of the model 92 predictions will
be correct 92 of times this model will
be able to tell you the exact number
that is present on the image let's not
wait for this program to execute
completely otherwise we have to wait for
ours
so I already executed it once and the
model is already created so what is the
model a model is nothing but a set of
files and these three files along with
the checkpoint files now there is
another code which is predicted
underscore 2 dot py and which I'm
restoring the model and let me show you
the line where I am restoring it
that's right here saver dot restore
model 2 dot CPP
so this is the name of my model so I'm
restoring my entire model that was
created after training of 20,000 steps
on m-miss dataset and I'm passing an
image that is seven underscore o dot PNG
so it is in this folder in the test
folders have got other images that I've
got here seven underscore oh now this is
an image it's the name of the image I'm
not telling the program what is the
number so I'll just stop this training
now and now Alissa cue the prediction
part where I'm restoring the model and
this model will tell me the number the
handwritten number that is there in the
image so this was the image seven
underscore O and the prediction for this
image is seven so my model was
accurately able to identify or predict
the numbers that was there on the
handwritten image so let me change the
image now and let me excute this again
just to show you the image
there's one good question that I would
like to take so I can log that how are
you saving the wait for the neural net
can you show us charcoal so in the
previous file that I executed I showed
you that I'm using an object called
savor and using the savor object I can
save the entire model and wait for also
automatically saved along with this
model in the checkpoint five so using
checkpoint we can actually reach the
final state of the training and then we
can use the prediction model I hope that
is fine all right so if you see this
seven this is a handwritten image this
is somebody who writes seven like this
with a strike in between and now I'm
passing a different image of seven at
seven underscore one so it's different
from the first one and I'll run this
code again
now this time the 7 is different and my
machine learning model should be able to
predict that this is a 7 because people
write 7 in different ways somebody like
7 like there's somebody write 7 and make
it look like a 1 they make the top part
very small so there are different ways
of running seventh
so however a machine learning model
should be capable enough to find out
that as well so let me just close this
and see the prediction
our model was able to predict the seven
as well and predict the value seven as
well so let me execute it again for you
so both the sevens are different but
still the prediction is correct for both
of them so now let us go back to our
presentation so after the M
mystification let me show you a few more
applications of deep learning the very
first is face recognition let me give
you an example so all of you are using
Facebook and you do spend some time on
it so if you remember a few years back
when you used to upload pictures with
your friend it makes a box around the
human face with the box appearing at the
bottom to ask you to type the name of
the person to tag in so it was able to
identify that it was a human face but
now it is able to Auto tag it is not
only able to detect faces but also
identify who it is and how is this
possible it is only possible using deep
learning and Facebook also has a deep
learning library called cafe - using
which they has applied all these things
the next few case that is implemented
using deep learning is Google legs this
is one of those applications that have
been recently launched for smartphones
by Google with this disapp - you just
have to install it open it point your
camera on the particular thing like this
flower over here and in real-time image
processing happens and Google will get
back with the entire details of the
object like the name of flower where it
is found etcetera etc so if you pointed
at a building or any shop it will tell
me what kind of restorative if it's a
restaurant it will show you reviews the
ratings menu etc so what is happening
here is that in real time you are able
to use a deep learning net and get all
the information you want these
applications are really amazing because
it directly brings deep learning to the
end users are the common people so they
can easily use the benefits of deep
learning without worrying about what is
happening at the background the next use
case is the machine translation this is
again a very important use case and
there is also an app in a store and the
scholars translation app so here is an
image that says
or chocolate I don't know what it means
I don't even know which language it is
but with this app what you can do is
that you can capture the picture of the
packet and this app will first detect
the text in the image then extract the
text like this and then translate it for
you so for example it has detected the
text extracted it like this and here it
has translated more which means dark and
then it writes back again on the image
so what is happening in this particular
youth gaze is that first and image is
captured image processing takes place
text is extracted through processing and
once we have the text we translate it to
the desired language which is English in
this case and then again image
processing happened where we are writing
the text on an image again so more cloud
means dark chocolate so this is a really
great use case because this is a
combination of multiple learning
algorithms like CNN and Ahriman so these
were a few more applications of deep
learning I hope that you found them
interesting so let us see what we have
learned in today's session at first we
have understood why artificial
intelligence because of its wide variety
of applications then is understood what
is exactly artificial intelligence and
the various subsets of artificial
intelligence which are machine learning
and deep learning then we went through
machine learning and understood how deep
learning solves all the machine learning
limitations we saw how deep learning
works and in the end we learn some very
interesting applications of deep
learning I hope that you have enjoyed
