the PMP training program in PMP training
program what we are going to learn today
we are going to learn three about what
is project and its importance of the
project management we will also
understand the relationship between
project program and portfolio and
operations management the key components
of project management how to go about
doing Ellering and most importantly some
of the project management business
documentation but before we get on to
the PMP training program let me
introduce myself my name is Bachand
and i have total experience of 17 years
I worked in different domains like FMCG
pharmaceuticals even for that matter the
banking domain and sales and marketing
etc I not only worked in projects but
also I've worked in enterprise level
programs so I'm gonna share with you all
my experience of working on various
project and how I applied the knowledge
skills the experience that I've gained
so far by working through various
projects and programs and how PMP helped
me in applying some of these basic
concepts as well as some of these
specialized concepts in terms of risks
as well as the scheduling etc that we
are going to talk about today I am not
only PMP certified but also AM pmi-acp
certified so that is one of the best
part I have seen here because with the
sixth edition of PMP now the PMI has
also ensured that the agile is embedded
as a part of the pimba sixth edition
which is already introduced so I can
definitely be in a position then to
compare it with the agile way of working
and with the traditional way of working
and also I'll be able to explain with
you very well some of these agile
concepts that are now embedded as a part
of BIM baaack apart from that I have
also done Lean Six Sigma Black Belt
certification and that's really very
very useful I found at the same time
considering that there are a lot of lean
and Six Sigma projects where you can
also apply some of the learning out of
the
that I have had it's been over five
years that I'm PMP certified and I have
realized that attending PMP training
program is how important when we begin
our PMP certification journey and if you
are looking out for such a training
program then you are definitely at the
right place because this training
program will help you prepare well for
the PMP examination and PMP training
program is based on the sixth PMBOK
Edition and we will be talking about
some of the latest additions in terms of
the content that the PMI has insured to
be there as a part of the PMBOK sixth
edition and some of these concepts are
covered with the help of examples in
this training what am I going to do
basically I will be taking you through
various topics that are there as a part
of the PMBOK sixth edition at the same
time we will also be going through what
it takes to get that PMP certification
get that PMP credential why the PMP
credential is important at the same time
where all the PMP credential could help
you in excel in terms of different
industries that we see here
apart from that we will be also actually
going to go through some of the
documentation some of the artifacts of
the actual projects that were delivered
so those artifacts those documents will
definitely give you an idea about how
you can go about writing a project
Charter or how you can go about writing
a project documents like business case
so I welcome you all once again to the
PMP training program and I can see here
John mat-su Devi and soon a few have
joined a straining program and I welcome
you all so if you have any questions I
would like you all to put it in the chat
box and that will help me in taking a
pause reading your question and I'll try
to answer your question then I'm there
itself apart from that also if you have
any question any point in time you can
certainly raise your hand this is an
interactive training program that we are
having
and hence feel free to participate and
try to converse with me through this
virtual mode that we are getting this
training program starting so
with this let's get on to the training
program actually what we will be doing
basically is that as part of this
training program we'll be talking about
the introduction force which talks about
a little bit about PMP certification and
this will kind of help us in getting our
journey started as far as a PMP
certification is concerned and I'm sure
some of you may have multiple questions
on your mind like why I should be going
for PMP I remember a lot of people
asking me question especially in people
from ite as well as non IT now that we
also have pmi-acp and we have a PMP as
well so why we should go for PMP I
strongly believe that for those people
who would like to develop their career
in the area of project management and if
they want to strengthen their foundation
of project management PMP is definitely
the one certification that we should
look forward to apart from that there
are numerous advantages of doing the PMP
certification as you can see here on the
screen some of these advantages we have
highlighted one of the most important
benefit I see of doing PMP is this is
the most recognized certification today
in the industry and not only in a
particular industry but you go to any
industry that you work for this is
definitely one certification that the
companies are looking into people who
are aspiring to become the project
managers this is globally recognized
certification by all the industries as I
said apart from that this particular
certification PMP not only demonstrate
your knowledge but most importantly it
also ensures that you have experience
before you apply for the certification
so it takes care of your experience your
education and the competency so all
these put together makes you the PMP
certified individual and and that's its
strength and that's precisely why many
industries out there today look for
people who are certified into PMP now
this will certainly help you increase
your marketability when you go out
looking out for a job or within your
organization when you look out for
promotions one of the things that I have
seen certainly gives us H over
competition is this credential which is
PMP
and we also found typically people who
are PMP certified people who are PMP
professionals they have got 15 to 20
percent higher salaries over the
non-certified people so PMP
certification will definitely put you on
spot and give you age over many people
out there who are looking out for the
job opportunities into the project
management or if you want to develop
your career in this area then you're
definitely looking for a right
certification I was just talking about
different industries so we have already
listed some of the industries here but
you name the industry and you will find
that PMP certification could certainly
be a big value add but to name a few
industries as you see on the screen
beach from the water supply to
protection to mobile services education
healthcare apart from that even public
transportation so many of these
industries that you see today they
actually look out for professionals who
are PMP certified when they come and
work on any projects with IT non IT
projects across domains and industries
PMP certification is definitely very
well recognized in terms of job
opportunities if you see sometimes
people keep thinking about would they be
in a job opportunities by doing the PMP
certification so obviously you have
gained some experience into project
management on the top of that you have
done a PMP certification that will
certainly strengthen your case when you
go out in the market and look out for
the job as far as the overall
opportunities are concerned to the
project management role by 2020 they are
only going to grow and as you see on the
screen we've got these opportunities as
far as the growth is concerned as you
can see in China and us everywhere today
the project management rules are going
to go up many folds by 2020 that means
there is huge opportunity for you out
there in the market to apply for these
rules that will be created as a part of
the project management and PMP
certification will certainly strengthen
your case when he'll go out and apply
for some of these roles now how to
embark on this journey as I can see here
Matt asking this question how to go
about really to
the PMP certification and this question
is there I am sure on everybody's mind
now when you decide to do PMP first of
all I must appreciate your decision that
yes you have taken the right decision
and we have just now seen why is it so
now when you decide to do PMP and when
you just commit to yourself yes I want
to be a PMP certified person then why
when should you get started your journey
you should embark your journey
approximately one and a half to two
months before you actually take the
examination so as you can see here you
take the examination sometimes here
right so from that particular date one
and a half to two months before you
actually scheduled your examination and
before that itself you undertake or you
undergo a training program so you attain
PMP certification training program and I
would encourage you to attain this
training program which is by Adi Rekha
and this particular training program
will certainly cover everything that it
takes for you to become PMP certified
not only this certification but also
other support you will get here the
first and most important support that
you will get is once you enroll for the
virtual training program by Abdul Rekha
a lot of things will be covered and when
you'll embark this journey for PMP
certification I am sure a lot of
questions must be there on your mind and
you would always need somebody who can
support you who can guide you that means
you're at the right place once you
enroll for this program this program
will cover not only the course outline
defined by PMI for the PMP certification
based on the PMBOK 6th edition but also
a lot of support you will get from for
submitting application I've seen many
people coming to me and asking me
guidance on how to write an application
a successful application because that's
also very important your application
might get rejected if you do not fill
the application properly so their
application how to really go about
writing the application how to put your
experience how to ensure that you write
properly about your project the
experience that you're showing in
whichever the project that you have done
in the past how to ensure that you put
down the experience which is
non-overlapping within the last 80 years
right so
all these things are certainly going to
be looked into and then once the
application formalities are completed
let's say before one to three weeks then
you can schedule your examination and
once the exam is scheduled the advantage
here would be that you would get a
target now that after two to three weeks
my exam is going to be there or maybe
after four weeks I have got my exam
coming up so that means you get a target
target date and this much of time you
would get certainly to prepare yourself
now by the time we have already attended
the training program that means you have
already gone through all the basics and
you had gone through various knowledge
areas process groups as well as
definitely a lot on a lot of questions
which we covered as part of training as
well so all that is already covered so
it be then very easy for you to prepare
for your examination during this period
or four to six weeks after the training
is completed after you schedule your
examination so you will get complete
support from the ado Rekha to fill out
your application even if your
application gets selected for the audit
because approximately 20% application
may get selected for the audit and many
times there could be a confusion in
terms of how to face audit there also
you will get lot of support here and
assistance to face the audit from a
tirikatene personalized guidance will be
provided by the SMEs like us who
actually support delivering the training
program throughout this study and most
important thing is that you will have
access to the course anytime so even if
you want a particular topic to be
repeated you can always go back repeat
that topic attain the topic again you
can sharpen your skills you can revise a
particular question for example or maybe
you want to clarify about understanding
on a particular topic or in a particular
area you can always go back and do that
and that's the biggest advantage with
this training I believe unlike the
classroom training so at times in
classroom training what happens if you
are not paying attention that place you
are gone you can't really go back and
ask to repeat the same topic and after
the trainings over then there is no
opportunity at all but he
the biggest opportunity that you would
get is you can always go back and play
the recording play the session as many
times as you want or an above there are
also thousand more questions and this is
the most important thing once you are
ready for the examination especially in
the last couple of weeks you should be
only focusing on taking up those mock
questions and from where those mock
questions will come you can certainly
refer to the a dodeca course for the
mock questions and thousand is
definitely a good number and I always
recommend before we appear for the final
exam once you complete your study it's
important that you should appear for the
examination by taking full 200 questions
by sitting at once and taking those 200
questions at once at least twice before
you appear for the exam that will give
you confidence not only of facing
questions but most importantly sitting
at a place for four hours because this
exam duration is four hours and all
those questions will come from this mock
questions that are already designed
taking into consideration various
contents and of course the new topics
the new pin box changes that'll happened
so once you clear the examination once
you are PMP certified obviously you have
to relieve your certification every
three years and even for renewal you
need 60 PDUs and those 60 PDUs will come
from the courses that you will attend
through at Eureka
so at Eureka definitely help there as
well you can get assistance in
e-learning for earning different PDUs
there are various courses that you can
undergo and within three years again you
complete 60 PDUs and you can rename your
examination successfully the most
importantly you will get support from
80-acre team 24 by 7 when you will
enroll for this course so I would
strongly encourage you all to look no
further than enrolling for the PMP
certification course from Eureka so
let's continue this session and let's
understand more about the training
approach overall how are we going to
deliver this training program for you
all so we are going to cover here the
PMI philosophy which is basically based
on the contents that are outlined as a
part of the embark so
I don't know how many if you got a
chance to really see the pin Bach but
it's definitely the big book which
covers five process groups there are ten
knowledge areas and there are 49
processes and these 49 processes will
ensure that you understand various
concepts from project management for
example how to take care of
communication with stakeholders how to
go about putting everything in the
Charter and ensured that you are
authorized as a project manager to work
on that project and take decisions for
example how to do continuous monitoring
and controlling of the project
activities so all these concepts are
going to be covered as part of this
training and most importantly for each
of these processes there will be inputs
tools techniques and outputs there are
these four things that we covered as a
part of each and every process so all
these 49 processes will be covered and
we'll be doing deep dive into inputs
tools and techniques and output for each
of these processes and we have taken
lots and lots of examples on the top of
that I have also covered some of the
actual artifacts of the project so which
gives you an idea about how a project
Charter actually looks like or how a
business case actually looks like so
we'll of course cover as part of this
module a business case the benefit
realization plan and I will try and also
give you an idea about how the project
plan typically looks like on the top of
that we have also covered questions at
the end of each of the module so we have
discussed question we have revealed some
of these questions and feel free to
participate if you want to clarify the
answer of any of the questions that
we're going to cover as well today so if
you have any questions from whatever the
topics that we covered so far please
feel free to put your questions in the
question box that have already showed
you where it is and start participating
in the session
to continue with we have so far covered
about a little bit about PMP a little
bit about PMI now we'll talk more about
PMI as an institute
so if you see PMI it's a very old
Institute established in 1969 that means
if you actually see PMI has completed
more than 45 years no and it's a global
organization with headquarters in USA
pen in silvia and it's a project
management institute which is based on
non-profit organization it's a
non-profit association altogether most
importantly this institute is there
worldwide in over 171 countries and over
five lakh members are associated today
with this institute now PMI actually
actively engages lot of professionals
across globe and these professionals are
engaged through conducting research in
the area of project management as well
as providing access to wealth and
information so lots of wealth of
information and resources are available
today with PMI related to project
management now under project management
again various areas so that will have
information you will get to access once
you become the member of PMI PMI also
promotes career and professional
development and lots of other
certifications also it offers and most
importantly it offers the opportunity to
network and form the communities so
you'll find there are local chapters
there are local PMI chapters where
people from the local area they come and
participate and they talk about what's
going on in the project management space
and exchange their knowledge they share
their knowledge so that certainly helps
big time as I mentioned that there are
certifications from PMI like some of you
were asking about what else is there
apart from the PMP so as you can see
here on the screen to begin with people
with they have just started in the
project management or they would like to
start for them certified associate in
project management is one of the
certification for the beginners in the
project management then they can move to
the PMP certification now people who are
working in agile or would like to have
experience again they're working in a
child they have experience in a child
they can go for pmi-acp certification
apart from that if you want to do a deep
dive
then go for scheduling professional so
again you are working in project
management and for quite some time if
you want to strengthen your some of
these areas like scheduling so you can
certainly do the deep dive into
scheduling per se you know and then you
also complete the certification same is
the case with risk management so if you
have been practicing project management
for quite some time if you want to get
into a sort of a specialization into
risk then I would recommend you the risk
management professional otherwise also
you can certainly jump into this because
risk management is definitely one of the
important processes that we talk about
as a part of PMP as well apart from that
if you want to go for a little next
level certifications like you have been
doing project management for quite some
time and now you got promoted into
program management so you can certainly
go for PG MP is another certification
and from there again from program you
can jump on to the portfolio management
professional as well as you go ahead up
in the ladder in your career so as you
see here there are lots of different
certifications that are available and
some of you hazmat ask this question
that what could be done if I don't have
to go for PMP is there any other option
that I can opt for so you can ask for so
many options but the fundamental option
that you have already chosen for
yourself is PMP so even if you complete
your PMP certification and if you want
to continue your journey into the
project management you can certainly go
for the next level which is program
management or for that matter the
portfolio management as well I hope I
answered your question ok thanks for
your confirmation man all right then I'm
moving to the prerequisite now this
certification the PMP certification
requires you and this is one of the
biggest advantage with PMP unlike some
of the other Institute I have seen that
it ensures that you have experience you
have completed enough education at the
same time you have also gained the
actual experience of working in the
project management right so let's take a
look at the prerequisite for appearing
for the PMP I am sure some of you must
have already gone through the PMP
brochure which is available on the PMI
site I would always recommend you to go
to the PMI dot o-r-g and browse the PMP
brochure because there
we'll get the latest information always
but as far as the qualification criteria
is concerned for PMP certification you
are expected to be high school diploma
or associated degree or anything which
is global equivalent which should be
like 60 months plus and the project
experience of 7500 hours is expected and
of course 35 contact hours required now
these experience in the project should
be within last eight years is what we
need to remember contact hours is fine
so you can add contact hours from last
typically you know they ask for 35
contact hours anyways so this particular
training will give you 35 contact hours
that's another benefit of attending this
training program so you will get a
certificate and you can claim 35 contact
hours out of that the another way is if
you are already a Bachelor degree holder
then it's pretty straight forward so in
terms of you already have 36 plus months
of the formal education and if you have
4500 hours of experience now this
experience should be non-overlapping
experience working into project not
necessary as a project manager you could
have worked in whichever the domain
whichever the area within the project
management that should be fine and even
here also the expectation is 35 contact
hours so you don't have to worry about
35 contact hours in this case and that's
the best part because since you all have
already enrolled for this program and
you are going to get the certification
of completion of the training and that
if I have contact hours you can claim
through that now some of the things that
we need to keep in mind that this
particular experience should be
non-overlapping
as I explained so if you worked on two
projects ensure that those two projects
start and end it should not be
overlapping okay so that is one of the
important things then project experience
should be only from last eight years and
not before that 20 percent applications
as I mentioned are picked up for random
audit so don't worry even if your
application is picked for the audit we
will definitely support you there and
apart from that once you clear the
certification if you appear for the
online examination you will definitely
get the soft copy of the certification
and your score you will immediately come
to know if you appear for the online
examination
apart from that from the predict
under view the designation is not an
issue this is another question which
some of you were asking just now that
would there be any specific rule I
should have played so in a project there
are multiple rules right so if you take
an example of a software project you may
be a developer or you may be a tester or
you may be just doing the deployment of
the code that is written or the
deployment of the releases okay or
deployment into other environment etc so
you are contributing your you're
definitely the team member to the
project that is running right so it is
not necessary that you need to be
project manager to have that experience
of 4,500 hours even if you have this
experience of working on any project by
any role still you qualify for the PMP
certification provided that you have
non-overlapping experience of 4500 hours
and of course the other prerequisites as
we discussed so I hope this have
clarified your question about the
qualification criteria to appear for the
PMP examination now let's get onto the
pattern of PMP this is another important
thing for us to understand as I
mentioned PMP examination is for ours so
it's definitely longer and this is where
sometimes I have seen people struggle if
you'd not practice enough so you have to
first of all practice to sit for four
hours right and therefore I mentioned
that you need to at least take two full
two hundred question mock test before
you appear finally for the examination
it's conducted in the Prometric Center
so that means it's properly individual
later at the same time there is an
environment where in the exam is
conducted so it's a examination
environment you will find there is a
camera and everything so this
examination is is conducted in a proper
Prometric center and with proper
individual ation there are 200
multiple-choice questions and you will
get four hours now out of 200 question
what is important to notice is 175
questions are only considered for the
final score and there are 25 questions
which are pretest questions now these 25
questions will not be considered for
your final score but you would not know
which are those 25 questions hence for
you to
question is what unit look for because
you would won't be able to differentiate
between which are those 25 questions for
pretest and which are those 175
questions so for you
you have to attempt all the 200
questions there is no negative marking
definitely and the examination is
developed by individuals or group of
individuals so people who have been
working in the project management area
for quite some time and they have
acquired knowledge and skills and
expertise so these are those individuals
who get to participate in the
examination I remember even p.m. I
approached me for pmi-acp exam nation
but since I delivered training program
hence I didn't get to participate but
otherwise if you don't deliver the
training program and if you want to
contribute actively into as a PMI that
individual or the group of people you
can certainly nominate yourself or
sometimes PMI directly approach you as
well
now after clearing the examination as I
said you will if it is a soft if use
online examination then you can
immediately see the result and you
should be able to then even wave your
soft copy of the certificate
immediately after the examination I
guess there are few hours but that
should be available more or less after
the examination is completed
successfully all right so this is about
the examination pattern now let's come
to the examination fees very quickly
we'll go through the fees that you would
be paying now there are two options one
is computer-based testing and there is a
paper-based
testing also available if you are
appearing for the paper-based testing
then your score will not come
immediately right it will take time but
if it is computer-based then your score
will definitely come immediately now if
you see the PM experience and education
we have already covered this part but
what you need to understand is for
computer-based exam
the charges are 4:05 and if it is read
this as members and non-members all
right so if you are PMI member the
charges for you will be for zero file if
you are not be my members in triple
files if it is paper-based for PMI
members 250 for non PMI members is 400
similarly we can take a look at the
re-examination computer-based and the
paper-based
so it's always wise it's always even if
you do any
you would know that it's always good to
do the PMI membership to take PMI
membership and then appear for the PMP
examination so you first take the
membership of course you first create
your count on the PMI dot o-r-g site you
take the membership and then you go for
the PMP certification this way you will
land up paying more or less the same
amount but the most importantly you will
get membership for one year on the top
of that you'll also get a soft copy of
the PMBOK guide the latest remote guide
so that is the biggest advantage here
right now you can also go for the PMI
local charter membership so these
membership fees you can check locally
how much are they and as I mentioned
earlier when you renew your PMP
certification after three years you will
have to complete sixty PDUs professional
development units and for these 60 PDUs
also you can certainly pick up the
courses of ed Eureka and this courses
will help you gain those 60 videos right
so if you have any questions please feel
free to put it in the chat box so that
we can discuss those as well most
important information I remember I did
mention this earlier as well but again I
would like to emphasize that if you want
to appear for PMP examination and since
you have already taken this decision go
to PMI dot o-r-g and refer to the PMP
Handbook very importantly PMP Handbook
will give you the latest information
about everything that it takes to know
about PMP examination right right from
the prerequisite to the examination fees
to exam retakes everything all the
information all the questions that you
may have about the exam you'll be able
to get those clarified through this PMP
guide ok so that was paid at a high
level about the examination and about
PMI
etc so that was just the basic
information that I provided so far about
the examination I hope you all are with
me so far okay alright thank you for
confirming so we're now on that
okay now let's then continue since you
all are fine with it and I just want you
to then take you through the basics of
the project management so we'll get
started since this is our first class so
we'll get started with the basics of the
management and then we'll gradually get
on to bit of a deep dive into some of
the areas that I have already told you
about so starting with the pin Bock
guide so pin Bock is project management
book of knowledge now this particular
guide which is published by PMI and this
is considered as the steel version of
project management body of knowledge and
now the sixth edition is available which
is already introduced last year and this
particular sixth edition is basically
the source of information now which is
referred across this PMP training course
is based on the sixth edition and hence
this course will cover everything in
terms of your knowledge areas the
process groups as per the sixth edition
of Bimbo guide now pimp a guy it is
structured typically like this so it
will have key concepts trends and
emerging practices tailoring what needs
to be done to tailor a process
considerations for project adapt to
environments etc so each knowledge area
you will find these four sections so the
way this course is designed is exactly
based on the embodied structure will be
also talking about the key concepts from
each of these processes that will be top
covering there are 49 processes that
will have and there are 10 knowledge
areas that we'll be covering so under
each of these knowledge areas and the
processes we will touch upon key
concepts trends and emerging practices
how to tailor a process and if you are
implementing agile or if it is adaptive
environment that you're working in then
how to go about considering some of the
newer concepts from agile and adaptive
environments PIM Bock is typically
structure it will give you the project
environment 10 knowledge areas roll up
the project manager so this is something
that is introduced as a part of the
sixth edition it was not there
previously though it was there but it
was embedded into different knowledge
areas but now role of project manager is
going to be covered explicitly as a part
of the separate structure as a part of
the structure structure of the PMBOK
itself apart from the ten knowledge
areas and of course the project
management foundations is also covered
as a part of this so I would strongly
recommend you after going through the
training program at least one si should
go through the
Gide it's always good to lose different
dimensions of project management and
read at least once even it is Slendy
even if this book bigger book but
reading it once is definitely the target
that he should dick okay let's move on
so fundamental question I'm sure you can
ask yourself is what is a project
now since this particular training PMP
training and this certification is
basically for the project so it's
important for us then to learn about the
definition of a project so what is there
now think from the examination point of
view objective of this training is to
make sure that you prepare for the
examination so as per the PMP guide what
is the definition of a project so
project is a temporary endeavor which is
undertaken to create unique product
service or result so if you take any
project ultimately you'll get some
outcome and that outcome is unique that
outcome could be you will undertake a
project and at the end of the project
what you will get is a product right or
at the end of the project what you will
get may be a service or you will get
some result but that is going to be
unique what you will create at the end
of the project is unique apart from that
project is a temporary endeavor so you
will always find one thing that project
has a start date and the ended so
project will be ended when you achieve
the objectives of the project or
sometimes it may happen that there is no
funding available or the project
objectives are obsolete or sometimes the
project is terminated there could be
various scenarios that you may come
across but definitely another attribute
which is also equally true is project is
unique so you will always find that even
though two buildings that sometimes you
see those are identical but at least you
will find some attribute which is unique
to each building so that means if you
see put together everything here you'll
find that projects are unique they are
temporary and they are undertaken to
create a unique product service or a
result you get an example of an IT
project or a non IT project if you are
developing a product and that particular
product development that you are
undertaken is for a year's period so
within that one year you actually go
through various phases of the project
you could have undertaken a feasibility
phase then you have done the analysis
then you have actually done the
development and then you have
implemented it so you have gone through
various phases in order to build that
product and by the end of the one year
what you'll produce is that product
which will take it to the market and
then you will sell that product so that
means in this example we have seen that
what's unique is basically that product
that you're producing that product could
be any product it could be IT product it
could be non any product that you
produce him and the project that we have
just said has got a start date and the
ended they've got one year in between
and within that one year we're doing all
the project phases activities and it's a
unique product that you're producing at
the end of the day as well right
which you can take it to the market so
of course as we go ahead we will take
multiple examples of the project as well
but from definition point of view we
need to just remember some of these
keywords that from the PIM Bock and from
PMP exam point of view projects are of
course unique they're temporary in
nature and what we produce at the end of
the project is product service or some
result now if you take the examples of
like projects drive change you will come
across project why they are initiated
you must be thinking about why projects
are initiated so sometimes projects are
initiated to drive change I have seen
that organizations undertaking big
transformation projects now those
transformation projects are basically to
drive change within the organization I
was part of such a transformation
project and the transformation project
was about the agile transformation
within organization so it was 18 months
project and that has a start date and
the end date and then lot of activities
have were undertaken as a part of this
project and then with an objective
obviously there was objective that they
want to shift from the traditional
mindset or traditional way of working to
the a child way of working so that was
completely a project to drive change at
the organizational level right the
projects could be also undertaken to
enable business value creation no value
could be tangible or intangible that's
fine
but what is the value how value is going
to be generated in the business it could
be by launching a new product altogether
or new line of business
whatever that line of business that you
would like to enter into and you are
undertaking a project basically to enter
into that new line of business and
that's going to add value and then you
can measure it how can you measure that
value obviously value could be measured
in the form of the benefits that you're
going to realize once the project or
that product is in the market all right
so sometimes that value could be
intangible by launching their product
service or a result you'll be able to
achieve the customer satisfaction
sometimes not everything is measured in
the form of value right so customer
satisfaction can be measured in the form
of value but definitely when you achieve
the customer satisfaction you can
generate more business out of the
satisfied customers and you can even do
the cross selling of the product so
that's the intangible benefits which is
difficult to measure but there is
definitely a benefit that we can show so
sometimes projects are undertaken just
so that we achieve those intangible
benefits there are also projects which
are initiated sometimes to meet the
regulatory requirement I have worked on
many regulatory projects now some of
these projects were initiated so that we
can fulfill the regulatory requirements
of the customers
all right so for example there are
certain like if you work in a banking
industry there are certain reports which
needs to be furnished which needs to be
submitted to the regulators now an IT
project is initiated so that those
reports are produced out of the data
which is gathered from all the IT
systems across banks IT organizations
it's a captive organization typically
and you get data from multiple IT
systems and then that data is ultimately
used to prepare various reports which
are then submitted to the regulators so
that means you initiate a project so
that you can fulfill the regulatory
requirement or legal or social
requirements to satisfy customer
requests or need as I said that
sometimes we initiate a project out of
pure quest that we received from the
customer
so sometimes product is already there
and now you are getting the change
requests just so that we can make
enhancement to the product that we are
using we also initiate the project so
that we implement or change business or
sometimes technology
technology's another change that I have
seen suppose if you want to go for the
ever grinning project so that's where
you actually demise the old
infrastructure and you are upgrading to
the new infrastructure so that's purely
because of the technological
advancements that have happened in the
market and I've seen that companies are
investing a lot of money in changing
their technology stack especially with
the DevOps coming in every company wants
to make themself they ops ready so that
they can establish the continuous
integration continuous delivery pipeline
build pipeline and then deploy more
frequently to the customers so that they
can capitalize on the deployments that
are happening or they could be also
created out of the let's say you want to
improve a product or release some fixes
etc so even those could also be the
reason why the project gets initiated so
projects as you can see here the project
could get initiated due to various
reasons now some of the examples we can
take here which are specific to these
categories that are listed down so first
could be developing a new product
service or a result so let's say you are
working in an automobile industry and
there is a strategic vision that your
owner of the company has to manufacture
a car which is priced least the cheapest
car so that's the strategic vision that
your owner of the company has and with
that vision you then start working on a
product so that means you undertake a
project which will produce a product to
fulfill that vision alright and that
vision is to manufacture a car with what
I would say the cheapest car in the
market so that cheapest car in the
market to manufacture that obviously for
that product to manufacture you will
undertake a project and that project may
run for three years for two years or
even for four years depending upon the
complexity of the project etc but
ultimately what you get at the end of
that project is that product which is
cheapest right you may succeed or you
may fail in the project that's a
different thing but ultimately the
outcome of the project is some product
or it could be some service all right so
if you are launching a customer care
service let's say you want to do you are
into a call center business and then you
are providing
to your customers so there are various
such a services that you could introduce
and just to launch those services you
could undertake various projects or
there could be some result ultimately
that we may get as a result of the
project that we have undertaken it could
be effecting a change in structure
process staffing or style of an
organization I have seen some times that
a projects are undertaken so that the
structure of the organization may
undergo a change or for that matter the
process improvement you must have seen
lot of process improvement projects so I
gave you example of Lean Six Sigma
project which are undertaken so that we
can make the process lean we can enhance
the productivity etc or I have seen even
the projects are undertaken to reduce
the cost associated with stuff so maybe
you undertake a project where in the
solution is to put the robotic process
automation RP is and through RP a you
you are actually cutting down the staff
cost so that's another example of a
project so as to introduce change
projects are also undertaken for
developing or acquiring a Neve or
modified information system so you are
procuring new hardware or software so
sometimes those are like infrastructure
projects which are undertaken just so
that you replace the old hardware which
is no longer supported by the OEMs of
those hardware's whom you bought that
hardware or for example software so lot
of evergreening
as i said sometimes if the software is
not supported you would like to either
upgrade that or you would like to change
the solution one of the biggest reason
for this could be the security issues so
you want to protect yourself from the
security threats that these days we see
coming through the another opportunity
is conducting a research efforts so we
conduct a research efforts and obviously
what we get at the end of that research
effort is some outcome construction I
think this is pretty straightforward
you're constructing a bridge or you're
maybe you're setting up our industry or
it could be a big turkey project that
you are undertaking or for that matter
if you are changing in a business
process so lots of these examples that
you would see here I hope with these set
of examples now it must be very clear to
you that project is a temporary endeavor
with started and
ended and what we get is unique and that
is product result or some service at the
end that we get out of a project so what
is the importance of project management
ultimately so why we are doing whatever
the efforts that we have been talking
about why we are putting in so much of
efforts so project management is all
about applying the knowledge skills
tools and techniques but in order to
apply these knowledge skills tools and
techniques first of all we need to know
which are those knowledge what is that
knowledge what are those tools and
techniques if you don't know how would
you apply and that's what exactly we
train people on so this training
actually talks about knowledge skills
tools and techniques skills of course
you acquire as you go on applying the
knowledge but for that you need to know
what kind of a skill set are required
now it is also required because there is
a cutthroat competition that's there in
the market so if you want to proof
yourself that you are different and that
you are sharp and at the same time you
have got those skills that are required
to be there so as to be effective so
that you can effectively manage the
project and not the poor project manager
for that matter so how would you be able
to distinguish that so there are there
are certain things you know that are
required here actually so effective
managed project which actually helps
individuals groups public or private
organizations for few things for sure so
one is of course meeting the business
objectives what are the business
objectives that you have visualized
yourself for that you have actually
drawn so those business objectives will
be achieved so as I said manufacturing
of the cheapest car if that's the
strategic vision with which you have
started the project you achieve that
business objective by the end of the
project satisfy stakeholder expectations
so you deal with n number of
stakeholders on the project again
depending on the complexity of the
project so how would you satisfy the
needs of those stakeholders the
expectations of the stakeholders the
changes that they are requesting so
you'll be able to do that if you do it
effectively and overall chances of
success will go up most importantly
managing the constraints of project you
will be able to manage project
constraints effectively if you have
those skills and if you have that
knowledge and risks is another important
key area how do you manage risks so you
will be able to learn to manage risks
the difference tools and techniques that
will be covering as a part of this
training delivering product on time is
the key to successful project as we
always say we have project constraints
of course we'll be talking about those
and those project constraints will to
keep on mind and ensure that we are
delivering the project within those
constraints of the project when you
begin working on the project you will
come across multiple changes from the
stakeholders so if you don't know how to
manage change effectively you will
struggle to accommodate that change
within the project that you're working
on and therefore in order to effectively
manage project you need to have the
skills and tools and techniques poorly
managed project would certainly lead to
multiple disadvantage here there could
be a failure in achieving the objectives
missed deadlines cost overruns we come
across the situation's right whatever
the project budget that is given I have
seen sometimes project manager land up
paying more or land up spending more
than how much is the budget given or
there could be a compromise in the
quality of the outcome that that is
being produced or they may land up in
doing a lot of rework and rework is a
waste and that requires lot of money and
all this lead to unsatisfied
stakeholders for that matter
so therefore project management is
definitely very important and hence we
need to learn the associated knowledge
and the skills that are required to
manage project effectively and obviously
we need to also know what are the tools
and techniques that are required and
most importantly we need to be using the
right tool and right technique at right
time so that's what is going to be
covered as a part of this training so
we'll be covering each and every
processes and we'll be covering the each
and every tool and technique that is
required now if you see project manager
meant as a methodology now each
organization have seen they have done
some sort of customization it's not like
they may follow whatever we are going to
talk about as it is so this is going to
be always a customization so templates I
have seen every organization will have
their formats if will have their own
templates there will be policies around
how to manage vendors there will be
policies around how to go about doing
the human resource management etc there
will be certain processes over and above
what we are going to cover which are
specific to the organization as well
and there are lot of guidelines that are
available as well but most important
thing is when we talk about a
methodology we are talking about we
should be able to plan project properly
monitor it properly and control the
project properly within the organization
and to do that what is required is going
to be covered as a part of this training
so PMP training will actually cover the
project methodology as a whole and that
will give you an idea about what kind of
template I should be using when I put or
when I start working on the project
charter or when I create a business case
how I should be going about doing that
or what policies I should be you know PL
minion policies I should be having right
what kind of a guidelines I need to
follow when I am doing a particular
thing so from project management
methodology point of view these are some
of the areas that are needs to be looked
into ok so if you have any questions of
course feel free to put them into the
chat box that is provided so that we can
also answer those questions as we
proceed all right so right now I don't
see any specific question as such coming
in so I hope you are with me on the
training so far okay so I got a
confirmation from John that so far so
good so we are going on fine thank you
for confirming that Savita is fine - all
right thank you so let them just
continue with the same pace
now let's move on to one of the most
important points which is about
constraints of the project so we called
as compensating factors or project
constraints if you ask me how the
project managers performance is revealed
or performance is judged I would say
it's based on how that project manager
is overall managing the constraints of
project because every project will have
these constraints when I'm saying
constraints what does that mean actually
so there are these six constraints that
we talked about scope time cost quality
risk and resources now they are
constraints because even if we change
one at least one other will get affected
if you increase the scope of the project
obviously cost might go up right if you
don't increase the cost and if you're
just increasing the scope risk might go
up and quality might go down right
at the same time if you reduce the time
if you want something to be deployed
early or finished early then obviously
we need to increase number of resources
if you don't increase number of
resources then it's going to cost you is
that you will not be able to complete
all the scope or you will not be able to
achieve the quality that is expected to
be there so you have to play around with
these constraints so effective project
manager would know how to deal with
these constraints and most importantly
if there is change to any of these
constrain it's important to go back and
update the relevant documents that are
being created so it could be a scope
management plan risk management plan or
resource management plan so we need to
go back and update these documents as
well if there is any change to the
constraints right so from that point of
view these constraints are very very
important to manage and this constraint
is to be managed from the point of view
of these stakeholders they should also
be satisfied because if the scope is not
fulfilled your stakeholders might not be
then satisfied so how can you deal with
the scenario wherein you are behind the
schedule that means either you have to
reduce the scoop or you have to delay
your project by maybe couple of weeks so
you are in such a situation then how
would you handle the situation and
that's where the project managers skills
and knowledge will come into picture so
how can you go back to the stakeholders
and understand the importance is it
scoop delivering is important as it is
or is it the schedule that is important
like when I was working on a regulatory
project so from the regulator's point of
view the most important was delivering
it within the time because that timing
is most important otherwise your company
might be fined you will have to pay the
regulatory fines so from the scope point
of view we had to go back and
reprioritize the scope items so they
were certain scope items which were just
good to have so we had to really drop
them off and whatever rest of the scope
items we have then taken them ahead
within the available schedule so what's
important here is to understand how you
can make use of these constraints to the
best of your knowledge and to go back
and negotiate with the stakeholders
all right so I hope now I have made it
clear the most important thing how to
deal with project constraints all right
so I see a question here from Matt that
how do we manage project risk
all right so Matt so basically to manage
a project risk we kind of start working
on the project risk management right
from the beginning of the project itself
so like in our project what we do is
that we have a risk workshops to
identify various risks that we might
face on the project so we first identify
all the possible risks that we might
face on the project we prioritize those
risks then we have to also do the
quantitative and qualitative analysis of
the risks then create a risk response
strategy so that risk response strategy
could be we may like to mitigate few
risks we may like to also accept few
risks if there is no good option that is
available or if the cost of mitigation
is higher than the cost of the risk
overall risk then sometimes we might
have to accept that risk as well or
sometimes we might have we'll transfer
the risk so risk response strategy needs
to be agreed upon and then we assign the
risk owners those respective risk owners
will then ensure that before the risk
occurs the risk response needs to be
implemented all right and all this
execution happens as per the risk
management plan that is created at the
beginning of the project itself so all
these things that I've just now covered
is going to be covered as part of this
training where I'm going to actually
show you the risk management plan I'll
be actually taking you through the
examples of how do we identify risk how
do we do qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the risks at the same time
what are those different risk response
strategies that we come up with so don't
worry hold on but for now just to answer
your question I have just given you this
high level idea and then we are going to
do deep dive into each of these
processes as we go ahead I hope this
answers your question Matt okay so he's
saying that he's happy huh to get this
input so far okay thank you Matt all
right so let's get started then from
here so we will continue and we'll talk
about now the project program portfolio
and then OPM as well
so talking about projects and strategic
planning so let's get started with the
project and strategic planning first so
typically what happens if you talk about
a program it's always made up of
multiple projects and a portfolio would
have projects and programs put together
and then that's how ultimately
everything is aligned with the
organizational goals objectives or
whatever the strategic plan that is
created so I gave you this example of if
you want to manufacture a cheapest car
if that is the vision high-level
strategic plan that is created then
probably you might need to run multiple
such a programs and the projects because
it's a complex project altogether right
you will have to learn run multiple
projects and this program would include
lot of components in it okay so
component would be there could be a
vendor management activities that needs
to be separately handled there could be
activities where in establishing a plan
where this assembly line for example
where this car would be manufactured or
for that matter there could be another
component all together in order to
source the material that is required in
the cost that we're looking out for
that's another component altogether so
based on these components then you would
form various projects within these
itself so setting up the assembly line
could be a project in itself
all right so procuring the material
right or sourcing the vendors to procure
the material just-in-time could be
another project in itself so that sorta
pikal e happens you have some strategic
guideline you have a some strategic
vision or a plan for that matter that
triggers various projects and programs
and then all those becomes a part of the
ultimate portfolio at that level the
overall governance is managed so program
and the project management will ensure
that the programs and the projects are
managed in a right way so that is very
very important the most important thing
is you need to categorize these programs
so for example you have the programs
which are similar kind of a project
should be part of that program opposed
will take example as we go ahead but
portfolio management alliance with
portfolios so
what we can do is that probably we can
take an example and then it would be in
a position and then we can come back and
also see what exactly we mean to say so
this particular example is to understand
the difference between project programs
and a portfolio so at a portfolio level
what you're basically deciding is so
that's your maybe strategic plan you're
planning to put up a new line of
business in the organization so
strategically that's what you have
decided so you could run a market
research project for that okay
so would it be really feasible to go
ahead and set up a new line of business
altogether so you're doing a market
research activity which is a separate
project in itself now if you see the
kind of programs that I might need to
create under this portfolio would be
marketing okay so here I'm setting up a
Neve line of business I need to think
about how am I going to market that then
I would also need to think about the
application development has a separate
component altogether then wanted
development would be there so I would
run there's three different programs and
under these three different programs
there could be multiple projects running
like under marketing I would have a
product launch as a separate project
altogether so all the activities that
are pertaining to product launch would
then be carried out under this project
or new market development would be
another project in itself so these
couple of projects which are related
projects which are in a link project
would then be clubbed with this
component which is marketing as a
program similarly for the application
development I would look into various
things as well like for example I would
think about a web application Android
and the iOS based application as well so
then I would Club these related projects
under this program which is application
development so this will actually ensure
when I complete all these three projects
I will be able to complete the
application development program as a
whole
similarly in case of content development
so I would need to look for the content
now my project could be classified based
on maybe a class 1 class 2 class 3 class
4 contents ok so this is just one
example one representation you could do
it multiple ways as well
there are multiple ways to do that but
this is one way which will give me a
better visibility better opportunity to
establish proper governance at a
portfolio level and thereby control
what's going on in each of these
projects and programs now if we talk
about operations so operations will
focus more on the ongoing activities and
operations will come into picture once
we launch so for example once the
application is built and it is launched
then the operations will come into
picture until then you are actually
working within the project itself or a
program so projecting operations may
intersect this is very important to
understand actually so we have seen a
project now we have seen operations as
well operation will come into picture
once you launch the product or service
into market and then you start
supporting that then you start making
enhancements or then you start
supporting the customers etc so what is
important here is that the operations
team will take the full control once the
product is in the market but that
intersection happens at multiple points
and which are those points where the
intersection happens when is a post when
developing a new service or product you
need to involve the operations team as
well so that they would know that
something like let's say the web
application is coming on their way for
support you can also do that
when you improve the operation so
sometimes what happens when there is an
existing application and then you are
enhancing so again you engage the
operations team as well most importantly
at the end of the product life cycle
there would be a proper handover between
the project team and the operations team
so that handover has to happen properly
and we need to pass on all the relevant
documents to them and at the end of each
phase closure we need to also invite the
operations team so that there is a
proper hand ship happening and they are
not engaged only towards late in the
project so some of these things is to be
taken into consideration so I hope this
example must have given you a fear idea
about program project and how a typical
a strategic plan initiate the launch of
a program and a project
so project program and portfolio is
clarified so portfolio which is
typically at a strategic level so this
is where the collection of projects or
programs happen we have just taken one
example here and they are basically
grouped together so that we can
facilitate them effectively from overall
governance and management point of view
which will ultimately help in achieving
the strategic objective so in earlier
example the strategic objective was to
launch a new line of business so that's
how it is program is where we collect
projects together and they are
definitely interrelated or sometimes
they are interdependent as well but most
importantly the octane benefits which
are not available from individual
components so if you see only the web
application will not give you as much
benefit as even when you add the Android
app or iOS so when they put together
then application development as a
program will deliver much more benefits
multiple interrelated projects needs to
be run parallel so sometimes they are
drawn perrolli sometimes they are also
dependent right so they could be run in
cease or they could also be run in
parallel now projects they are generally
dependent on each other and serve a
common outcome so if you see typically
is that let us say class 1 and class 2
there could be a bit of a dependency as
well in terms of content ok a baselining
or all delivery for that matter or there
could be a bit of a dependency between
what you are developing as a web
application and then Android and iOS
so generally that's what is observed
within the project so we need to
ascertain what's that dependency level
and we need to manage that dependency
level effectively as well when you are
working on project and programs all
right so moving from there all together
so we just covered up what is a project
program and portfolio and we have taken
one good example to classify this to
differentiate this and as we progress we
are going to take more examples as well
so organizational project management so
if you see the Opium so this is specific
to the organization now we are talking
about now this is a framework where we
talk about project program and portfolio
management all this is integrated so
that we can achieve the organizational
objectives ultimately and for that
reason it's basically integrate
how does this work if you think from the
application point of view now so you
have project program portfolio
management knowledge and now you're
applying it and that's where the
organizational objectives will come into
picture so you have a strategy right so
we have taken example here that we have
some strategy which is launch a new line
of business alright and then you decide
the portfolio value decisions okay then
we have the business impact analysis is
done program and project results are
delivered operations will start here
okay the value performance analysis is
carried out right from identifying the
strategy because value will start coming
in only once you launch that line of
business so programs and projects will
be a part of this section and then
there's a portfolio here ok so what we
need to understand is that same example
you can apply here as well so in order
to achieve the strategic objectives of
launching a new line of business then
obviously you are aligning with the
portfolio which or the portfolio that
you're working in there are multiple
projects and programs that you are
running here ok and once you complete
those programs you will be able to then
deploy that to the production team or to
the operations and support team and once
they are out in the market then only the
value will start coming in then you
start measuring that value so in the
beginning itself you create a sort of
the business realization plan or the
business benefit management plan and you
try to measure the business benefit
against that business benefit
measurement plan so this is more or less
the same thing as what we covered
earlier here we are just trying to put
it in the form of o-p-s all right so
let's just move on to pin BOC now since
we are just talking about PMP training
here so we need to also know a bit more
about the book and how the pin BOC is
structured so we did cover the high
level structure but there are few more
things that we need to know about with
maque especially at the component level
and at the same time how these process
groups the knowledge areas the processes
how they are aligned how they are
interlinked so let's talk a bit more on
these quickly
so I'm just going to take you through
each and every component very quickly so
project life and phase so what is
project lifecycle ultimately project
lifecycle is nothing but contains series
of phases you must have seen for example
SDLC so a project lifecycle which is
software development lifecycle alright
so when the software development life so
when the software is built we go through
various phases alright so those phases
they happens in series so we've got a
phase called maybe the initial
assessment that is done feasibility we
call task so initiation we can call them
as so then we have requirement and then
we have pose you analyze them to create
design right so you build you taste you
deploy so all these are nothing but your
lifecycle phases then the project phase
so project phases collection up logical
related project activities so you could
differentiate between the project
lifecycle and the project phase as well
so project lifecycle is a very generic
at a high level so for example
feasibility is one thing or analysis is
another phase or implementation is
another phase so from the project
lifecycle point of view the project
phase could be requirements gathering so
you have gathered requirements which is
you know logically based on the
activities that you're performing or or
design which is again activity of
designing that you're performing so we
just we can differentiate here inline
difference that we see then these are
specific to project these are very
generic then we have a phase kid so
which is a Raviv that happens typically
at the end of the phase so once the
requirement gathering is completed as a
phase then we produce a document called
as requirement specification document
and that is reviewed so that is my sort
of a milestone that I can say that I
achieved by the end of the requirements
phase and that needs to be relieved then
which of course may get modified later
if required that's fine
project management process so this is
now if it is a process there obviously
typically process has series of
activities which are you know
interdependent and then which would
perform to achieve a specific objectives
so here also for example if we take
example of let's say a communication
management plan so when we work on the
communication management plan ultimately
our objective is to create an approach
how are we going to communicate to all
my stakeholders
in the project that I'm working on so
that's our typical it happens the
project management process group so
again when logically the grouping of
project management inputs tools
techniques and output happens you know
so that particular group you can define
it as a project management process group
so in PMP here we have these five groups
initiating planning executing monitoring
and controlling and closing so these are
the five process groups that we have all
right so of course they cut across all
the phases of the project and they are
going to be a quite a bit there actually
so when you are starting right from the
feasibility of the project you would
again you you would have to initiate the
feasibility you would have to do
planning for the feasibility you would
have to execute the tasks within
feasibility so that means these are not
phases what I mean to communicate here
is that initiating planning executing
are not the phases of the project but
these are the process groups and this
process groups would fall in each and
every phases now what are the knowledge
areas now these are the basically ones
that are identified areas of project
management and these are the areas of
project management where we basically
learn about the different processes
right we understand the different inputs
outputs tools techniques from each of
these knowledge areas so if you talk
about any knowledge area if you pick up
okay so you would need to then
understand what are some of the tools
techniques and the inputs and outputs so
let's take example here so I am also
going to give you the idea about some of
these examples wherever possible so I
use this as a supporting material okay
so that we can you know take some
examples alright so starting with let's
say the plan scope management is one of
the processes that we talk about here
it's a plan scope management is
basically one of the knowledge areas
that we talked about and under that
there are inputs to its techniques and
output as you can see on the screen so
this could be the inputs for planning
right project charter then various plans
like quality management plan project
lifecycle description development
approach etc so these are my inputs to
the scope management plan what
tools and techniques guy used when I do
the scoop management one is of course I
use expert judgment as well as I will do
alternative analysis so as a part of
this training we actually cover we take
a deep dive and actually come up with
examples in terms of how to do the
alternative analysis so we try and cover
some of these examples we actually cover
the scope management plan and I will be
telling you guys you know how the scope
management plan looks like and what it
should be what are the competence of the
plan and what needs to be added into the
plan as well similarly what do we expect
out of this process so I'll end up this
particular process we should get the
scope management plan in itself and we
should also get requirements management
plan right so this is just one example
of the project management knowledge area
so scope management is one of the
knowledge areas so this entire training
PMP training is based out of these
knowledge areas so we're going to cover
all these ten knowledge areas and under
each and every knowledge area we'll be
talking about tools and techniques and
inputs and outputs right one example I
just now gave you okay so this covers
all the components we're talking about
life cycle now as you can see here
project life cycle it would have like
you start the project you do a bit of a
planning they'll actually execute the
activities and then you end the project
now this process group as I said earlier
will be a part of all these phases of
the project okay because for planning
will have to again initiate the planning
activity will have to actually do the
planning then we have to execute that
plan etc right so that means this is
going to be definitely a part of this
there are ten knowledge areas right so
for example communications management
stakeholder management scope management
right the risk management etc there are
ten of these and these ten knowledge
areas we will cover each and every of
this knowledge area with many examples
and actual artifacts as I said okay then
there will be a phase gate like we took
one example here project phase etc
timeline okay so this covers everything
that I supposed to be covering as a part
of embark I
let's quickly get on to a project
lifecycle so if there are no more
questions so far then we can talk about
project lifecycle
okay so here now I have a question here
coming up as I can see the question is
from John and then he is asking about
how the training is organized so John as
I mentioned here that this training is
based on knowledge areas so you'll find
each and every module is going to be
covering the knowledge areas let me just
give you a brief about how this training
is going to be conducted as you can see
on the screen we have the different
process groups so we have got initiating
planning executing monitoring and
controlling and closing and under each
of this process group there are various
processes so total there are 49
processes that we'll be talking about
right and there are 10 knowledge areas
so these knowledge areas are mentioned
here horizontally right so project
integration management is biggest ones
we'll start with integration management
then we have scope management then we
have stakeholder management right then
cost management quality management
resource management communications
management risk management procurement
and stakeholder management so these are
those 10 knowledge areas which we will
cover now each of these knowledge areas
will have multiple processes within them
which actually cut across multiple
process groups so for example project
integration management will have
processes from each of these process
groups ok
but if you see scope management we'll
have mainly the planning because it's
all about most of these things that we
do as a part of planning and some bit of
the monitoring and controlling
activities will happen so this training
is basically organized based on these
knowledge areas so there will be a
modules on these knowledge areas we'll
be covering a module integration
management scope management schedule
management these are the modules that
we'll be covering
as part of this particular training and
we'll of course monitor the progress
through this sheet that I'm showing we
just now ok so I hope you I have
answered this question to you John ok so
John is happy with the answer overall
and I'm sure you can look forward to
more in terms of gaining the in-depth
knowledge on each of these knowledge
areas as we proceed with the training
thank you ok
so let's proceed for now so we have
project lifecycle and the product
lifecycle we'll just quickly take a look
at this so project lifecycle will have
these phases as we already spoke about
so they have a feasibility analysis
design implementation etc this phases
you could name them based on the
industry that you're working on and this
phase is the whole idea of working in
this phase this is basically that I can
certainly look forward to some milestone
at the end of the phase so when I
complete feasibility I would know that
whether it is possible to continue
working on this project or not for
example the product that I will be
working on whether there would be market
available or not know as a matter of a
feasibility study whether the solution
that I will be building would it
feasible to build the solution or not so
all this feasibility study I would do
from the point of view of whether it is
at all possible to make that product or
not okay so all that I would do again
technical feasibility business
feasibility so all these aspects will be
covered as part of that as I said that
project lifecycle is based on the
industry that you're working in if it is
just an example if it is IT software
industry then typically your project
life circle would be like requirements
gathering phase analysis design
development testing implementation these
are the phases that we go through okay
similarly in pharmaceuticals it will be
different in construction will be
different in industry that you are
working on it could be different
but ultimately at a high level these
phases will give us some framework to
work through and we go on achieving the
milestones and most importantly these
phases will help us in establishing the
project governance as well now these
phases could be done sequentially or
they could be overlapping so it depends
on the phase that you're working on so
face to face relationship could vary as
you can see and if we are doing the
overlapping then it's also called as
fast-tracking so there are concepts like
fast tracking and crashing so we'll be
covering this concept as part of the
training and stay tuned I am sure it
would be happy to know that there are
two different ways through which we can
actually you know move the project a
little bit faster so by doing the fast
tracking or crashing so
what is fast-tracking and what is
crashing the project is what we'll be
covering as we proceed now stay tuned
for that right okay so we just covered
about the project now let's also quickly
talk about the product lifecycle and try
to understand what is project and the
product lifecycle very quickly now
understand one thing the project
lifecycle could be a multiple project
lifecycle within the product lifecycle
so once you have a product right this is
a product lifecycle you can undertake
multiple projects but when you create a
product for the first time so you have
one such project that you have
undertaken right to launch that product
right so the same example if we have to
continue right so let's say you have
launched or you have kick-started that
project to come up with a cheapest car
in the market so that was your idea
right and then you start to your project
you had gone through different phases of
the project and then you introduced that
car here so you have taken of one
project here and then your outcome is of
course the product that you're launching
and then the product lifecycle starts
here
so products type cycle typically goes
through this various phases right so you
have an introduction phase so car is
there in the market and then this is
cheapest car so of course he's got a
sales then you are in a growth phase and
then after few years you realize that
because there is a competition lot of
other cars are also coming up and
because even others have started
realizing this market so then the
maturity level is what slowly the
product starts achieving this is where
you are selling at peak and then because
of the competition etcetera your sales
start declining right and then gradually
you stop enhancement on that product and
then you just sell whatever is selling
and then that's how that product ends
but during this entire product life
cycle you might do multiple projects so
for example you are enhancing the car by
doing the multiple project so you are
doing the face lifting of the car
right or you're doing complete makeover
you know where and you are actually
doing changes you are doing in the
engines when you're at the growth phase
you are actually undertaking a project
wherein you would like that car to maybe
do some sort of a changes so that it
will appeal to young crowd
depending on your marketing strategy
depending upon what's driving this
growth you would undertake multiple
projects so you have taken a project and
the outcome is cheapest car that you
launched in the market and now your
product life cycle started and within
that product life cycle there are number
of phases that you have going through
and then you are undertaking multiple
projects within the product life cycle
in order to ensure that you keep up the
sale of the product as much as possible
so that's typically the difference
between the product and the project
lifecycle so thank you so much everybody
