lambda our picture miss key is nothing
but is a combination of both the speed
layer and the batch label so all the
data entering into the system is
dispatched to both the batch layer as
well as the speed layer that's for both
the layers the data has to go
redundantly for getting processed
because both are meant for different
things right the one is one is doing
I mean periodically one is processing
the data and match layer and in real
time one system is processing the data
so combination of both of this can be
considered as lambda architecture folks
so first you have the data I mean coming
into the data center so then it can go
to both second it will go to the batch
infrastructure and we had the data can
be persisted into HDFS then you will run
some workflows over that persistent data
set at periodic intervals so then you do
come up with batch view of the actual
data and then the speed layer also you
pass the data into speed layer as well
where you this is the data in rebuilding
because data I will go through all this
functions in the real time and we will
get the real-time data out of your speed
layer also so then your query might get
executed over both the batch layer MP
computer view or else.you speed layer
computer you so both the places you can
actually your query can be triggered to
I get the actual results books so that's
the final step so that's what pretty
much is called as lambda architecture
lambda architecture is nothing but
combination of both the batch layer
which is running on top of Hadoop and
storm which is running as mean under
this speed layer combination of these
two things can form the lambda
architecture that's what I mean we call
just lock alarm now so servicing layer
is nothing but you know you actually
store the data in some form right in
some location either in no sequel's okay
our else
some hdfs you copy the data right once
you process the data in your Hadoop
platform you either keep the data in
HDFS our else you keep the data in some
no signal flares flavors so which
actually serve your queries it could be
the query could use some those noisy
cool players or else it could use some
hairs higher kind of things to actually
run the query over the dataset so that's
what's our missing ear mean meant here
which actually serves your queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
