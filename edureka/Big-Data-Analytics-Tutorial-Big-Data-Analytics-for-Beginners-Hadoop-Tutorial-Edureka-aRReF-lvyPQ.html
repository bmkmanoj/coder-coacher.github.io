session on big data analytics from
editor before I start can I get a quick
confirmation if I am loud in here to all
of you
hello Ashish hello babe can I get a
quick confirmation great thank you thank
you very much
so let's so we are going to discuss
about what is this big data analytics it
is going to be really interesting topic
because trees this you must be hearing a
lot that there are a lot of jobs
pitching up in the data and editing your
micro getting your own job opening
salesmen we are looking for candidates
who are good and big data analytics so
what is this keyword what they are
looking for my exact becomes we were
focusing on this particular keyword so
we are going to understand that so let's
move and see what is big data in a day
but before that what is all for you in
this session so first we're going to
start with Big Data introduction this is
mainly for work women do not solve
anything about the data so before then
let me not worry about it he will be
taking care of that part what is big
data analytics like that so major
question if you want to answer then we
will be talking about why big data
analytics Midas is important why
companies are looking forward to with it
what are the figures which are part of
big data analytics then big data and it
is domain what all the domains what we
have in this area and what are the use
cases saying when we are going to see a
small product on this patch to give you
a good idea how this analytics product
looks like what kind of problems operate
expect from YouTube short so this
portion we are going to see now but
let's start talking about Big Data what
is Big Data what do you understand by
this some Big Data
let's first explosion so now data is
exploding if we talk about data in last
five years data have grown exponentially
in fact every two years data is getting
doubled if you want to be
you just burn all the data under this
you will be able to D smooth toil that
much amount of data being up in current
source so you can imagine when today we
have this much amount of data and that
data is still here Kalinda is very
difficult to manage right now imagine
what is going to happen till 2020 we are
talking about almost three to four years
ahead of the time what is going to
happen the data will be like four times
to 10 times larger what we currently
have and that is going to be a very
tricky car and that is where the big
data tool will be very very important in
fact right now the situation is that
very lift companies have identified the
potential of this big data lot of
constants are everything to us with our
big data tools I would take only five
percent of the companies how realize the
potential of the data and I am only
considering the companies who are like
into data domain for leading the fifth
set of domain but now among those would
be five four things have understood the
importance of big data and the reason is
that it is very simple they're kind of
worried like if you move from our
traditional system sort of this a
created or hadoop system then we get
people are the people available we will
solve the problem but we make the Impe
condition for us so all this because of
all the things they are hesitant to make
but in future who are going to notice
that it is going to be solved so this is
pretty sure that this problem will be
solved in coming time it will not be
here for a longer fee yet so this will
be all salt but by 2020 analysts have
convicted that this 5% will get to what
heat for strength and when this 40% will
explode you can imagine not only theta
SS coding what also joggled is living in
this romantic currently in today's body
cells we have so many jobs available
in the possession and 2013 title way
very very interesting to look at so
let's move further
now if talk more about the data I just
answer this like now if you people
starting it I told you you can be sued
and the move
since sorry they mention about the LP
tower as well right it is too huge later
to talk about which we currently have
right now moving further now if we see
this example you can notice like it'll
print over the data is very huge that
you can keep showing the data and it can
bleed till the height of your LP cover
that's very interesting
now let's see what you understand by
this word is big enough so we have the
songs about you fun facts about it that
what is this but what is Big Data
what do you understand by this keyboard
big thinker now lots of people generally
say that when I have large volume of
data I will be calling it as big data
but that are wrong notation this volume
is just one property of big data you
cannot do that if it is huge volume then
only if they saw big data otherwise it's
not a big dater no volume is one
characteristic of big data there are
other characteristics as well for
example now the velocity because if you
see this Facebook it is just 20 year old
company it is not how very old company
but currently the situation is that
baked in 20 years they have generated a
massive amount of data you must back
there was a fun fact of what was posted
by mass for the CEO of Facebook he
posted that predation number of users
who are using Facebook is equivalent to
number of people living in this earth
hundred years ago that's a big statement
from the CEO of Facebook that means he
is not just
is about one country is talking about
the whole globe now what does this mean
that Facebook is dealing basic volume of
number of users now this is with we're
just talking about number of moon effect
of there are three talks about what kind
of activities or what kind of data these
users children now if I talk about kind
of data what these users embrace we see
that what we do the video Facebook they
either put some post the post video we
post audio mic so we do all this box now
when you post videos or when you post
for you is that the data which can be
handled by our argument no because I
don't have any packing for this kind of
data it is a very different kind of data
and this category be called attack and
structured data now this unstructured
data is a different variety and this is
growing exponentially it is going with a
very huge stage now not only this one
social data it was structured data also
going at a very to fit but this if I
compare both unstructured is growing
more in the book in fact in current
scenario we have HP percent of
unstructured data and twenty percent of
structured data when you can make up the
importance of unstructured data universe
analytics as well now the challenge here
is that how to deal with that data can
my arguments be discredited forget about
volume part for sometimes even if it's a
small data can my a DBMS deal with it no
answer will come again I know here and
to solve this we require specialized
tools like Hadoop to fix this problem
now so God brings me to an another
property velocity which means the pace
with which the data is growing
also it brings me to another set for
next bear ID like you have cleaned a
specter daga we have one structure data
you're also generating data from
different different totals for examples
of medical domain is debating that of
this Facebook social media Twitter all
these companies are generating big data
sent from variety of data what we are
getting value from the data now it's
very important the data what we are
getting is that meaningful data
can I make up some insight from the data
this property is called value property
and the last property which is really
important property is called there are
settings in basically what we do it
let's say if you are getting data there
can be talk data which can be corrected
or maybe the 9 digit of it is missing it
a bit now that sort of a dot there your
missing data or where we have kind of
data how we can be this surface this is
for their aesthetics so these are the
five important components of big data so
we can never take just a volume is
denoted as big data that is just one of
the correct effects there are other
characteristics which are equally
important moving further now data big
data of growth Drive and as we have just
discussed that in items what would be
the scenario in 2020 in 2020 we will be
dealing this almost 50 billion of the
devices right that will be very huge
number we talk about any domain we will
be having such huge amount of data so we
will be dealing with so much amount of
data you might have heard about internet
of devices that this is going to be the
next big thing but that internet of
devices is now creating so much of huge
big aspect because here you talk about
that you can also make your home now
there are all the devices for generating
sensors lots of events can happen with
IOT that will be all requiring big data
so with IOT becoming more
more popular requirement of the data
tools become more important absent by
2020 you can see that there will be a
huge requirement of these tools to solve
the problems now every minute I'm not
talking about every day I'm not talking
about every month what happens and just
talking about every minute every minute
on Facebook there are so many of like
happening like every minute we are
getting almost like around 42 laps like
we can talk about Twitter almost 3.5
slash tweets happens per minute you can
keep on talking about others like
YouTube reddit Instagram like YouTube on
YouTube almost 300 art of data is
getting generated and that is again a
big thing right because so much of data
we are generating per minute why is big
data analytics why it is important now
when we talk about big data analytics we
have just talked about the volume which
we are facing right now but can we make
some insight from that data right that
is big data analytics but why why this
is important for us very important but
when we analyze something important from
our data
maybe we can gain some business insight
that is going to make your system
cost-effective so we are going to reduce
the cost by analyzing it
maybe we can analyze something we
implement something in a way that it is
going to save us a good amount of course
you can also automate it all right so
let's take it off about Google they have
the self automatic customer how would
they did all that you might have thought
that they are using artificial
intelligence and machine learning a lot
now these all are part of the analytics
now big they're generating huge amount
of data and they're performing all sort
of analytics so this Google self-driving
car is the best example for this big
data analytics answers similarly in
healthcare the keep on dividing all this
instrument because they have particular
amount of data they make some analysis
on top of that and try to get some
insight from it similarly you will be
able to make the wave fast decisions and
will this even be be very much helpful
for you you can also improve your
services for your products by analyzing
the data let's say your users are giving
you lot of reviews now from that reviews
itself you should be able to make out
some insight that ok looks like there's
a trend in my negative reviews if I fit
that actually I can make all those
negative reviews to positive reviews
so all those analysis can be done by big
data analytics so this is the very kind
of important part and that is the reason
being disquieted
and that is the reason you are hearing
from god of companies about this god
what is big data analytics in big data
analytics let's say you will be having a
big data you will be performing your
analytics on top of that and in the end
you will be making some decisions out of
it so this will be your big data
analytics similarly what are the stages
in your big data analytics when we talk
about big data analytics first thing
would be definitely we want to identify
what is the problem we are trying to
show what is my data requirement that
would be masked against it because first
of all I need to identify the problem
then I will be identifying the data
requirement then we will be talking
about we need to do some courses and
maybe we want to clean up our data we
want to do some sort of focusing on the
data so that whole pre-processing data
fit after that you will be performing
some analytics on top of that when you
finish our analytics you will be pushing
this to visualize the later that this
lecture can happen with tableau angular
gives or any sort of foods which are
available but you will be virtualized
think all your data in the end what are
above big data domains which are data we
have left and eat ailing for example
ecommerce Flipkart eBay all these
companies they are analyzing their
product in order to increase their fifth
telecommunication companies compensated
AT&amp;amp;T Vodafone all these companies are
using in order to perform some analytics
and see that okay what are the customers
for at high risk of leaving a turn rate
they want to reduce that now all this
they do it with the help of the data
what they have available
similarly government in if you are in
India you might have heard about
attackers that's a very big part of what
Indian government has started and now
the talent but there are four municipal
level even in death an archive for this
is using Hadoop if you just google about
it you will get an idea they are using
Hadoop systems in order to process them
health care finance sign things all
these domains also use big data
analytics so to the advocacy these are
the few list workers in front of us
there are many more fields or domains
where this big data analytics is getting
used now what are the use cases what we
do have so let's understand it everybody
was to have heard about Donald Trump
right along this pure selection he is a
president of us now
this guy used big data analytics and
that tells him to win the elections what
they did was he collected all the
personal data from various resources
whatever was possible like club card
newspaper subscription social media
etcetera he built an algorithm means he
did not bet he added an MC will build on
the bottom that generated top cities to
reach the highest concentration of
waters
now what did it he kind of kept on
sending some
of advertisement or lot of things we
kept on doing so he first identify what
are the possible voters in the domain
and then based on that he kind of keep
on publishing your nothing and then the
message were targeted based on the voter
profile using doctor all the social
media platforms like Twitter Facebook
snapchat so what we get they learn that
algorithm learned from the user profiles
what kind of things he liked and based
on that could lead or personalized
advertisement was set up so it's like
maybe for you if you are opening the
system you may be getting a different
advertisement and for someone else it
will defense may be getting some
different advertisement so that was the
thing and this actually helped Ordonez
on to win the u.s. election so this this
all really like of people not only now
companies are using it but even
politicians start using it face so you
can realize the importance of big data
when the most powerful country when they
could win the election of back country
when they are using big data you can
understand the power of that not only
dip in this 2012 which are not won in
2012 or the FIFA World Cup if you just
google it you will get unused Germany
bone because they had cut tools man and
who was the equipment big data analytics
what Germany did they used big data
analytics in order to analyze the
strategy of order team that is what they
have done and using that they were
preparing their own strategy and that
held them in bending the broad scope so
you can see even the small one method
where you cannot even imagine this big
data analytics is getting used right so
this are the places where this is
getting loose a nice example Thanks
so now these are the places where like
every Phoenix resident is spinning or
due to this our team is spinning you to
this site so you can make out the power
of this big data analytics not techno
poser
similarly there are multiple other use
cases Walmart uses it or maybe Amazon
uses it when they want to predict some
users in order to sell shootings now
even in case of any earthquake or maybe
any sort of tsunami this kind of event
also big data analytics place unless the
role
what it do is it will predict earlier
pays itself that is there any issue
which is any possible issue and then
accordingly
immediately send out alerts messages all
these things can be done with the help
of analytics big data analytics
similarly now this healthcare is a very
important domain space because we want
to definitely doctors want to make sure
that all that treatments are done
properly so what they do all the big
data what they have generated earlier
that is very huge in volume now this
back any new patients comes up they try
to apply the algorithm and see that if
that the prediction can help them to
kill their patients or near next steps
so all these domains are also using this
big data another take
so let's talk about the tools which are
available in this domain if they talk
about two we have multiple analytical
tools like I do
hi think apache spark x v hadoop we
already know and i do we work on the
distributed fashion so we can create two
mass produced our and negative hi is the
sequel to where's your sequel query
anyway get converted to MapReduce
programming but you can perform as a
user you need not worry about the
MapReduce program you will be writing
the query in your cycle program
is mostly for people who love to do
scripting now those people are choosing
this platform and this is very simple
software analytics practice but the most
hot topics currently in the market you
might be hearing this name a lot that
about this part is keeping of the whole
hog market why because of the analytics
power
what our focus is definitely few other
things like the processing is really
quick in this but yes mainly due to the
analytics analytical power what fast
have similarly uplift is not equally
deep here also you can perform your take
data analytics
now what are the courses available with
us so we have a few courses not like
then definitely discussion between your
mind what is for me if I want to learn
this area more highly motivated now I am
really happy I understood this fact but
now I want to learn it what are the
things I need to look at a question from
Ashish which one is most trending tool
nowadays with respect to carrier about
this one if you want to ask this a path
this passes the truth business booming
right now now there are still like five
and on are also named it's pretty
popular but with a pathways for
providing the best performance companies
started adopting this so that is one
thing which will happening but it
doesn't mean that type are not getting
you I was still getting used as like
many other places I'm talking about
hybrid fit but yes in terms if I compare
with the job market Colet Cleopatra
smarter than the top now what other
courses which are available business
pure water listed in front of this
inside there are much more so let me
give you an idea about where exactly we
have this analytics so the major course
is spark and a dukedom defer this is the
hood where we feet high pain
we also talked about possible system to
give you an idea about how it works
so this have all the analytical software
MapReduce programming your HBase
everything which is a part of analytics
is a part of this code now there are
other courses event about this process
missing from this list but about this
part is also one of the course which we
have this is helping you to do lot of
analytics now we have other courses like
data scientist which is a little bit
related to art with arrows you can
perform analytics and big data
environment with lately with the like
introduction of pop art in the market
now if you'll notice learning of father
will be more easier for you so your data
and of course data engineering course
data analyst put we have so many courses
available posit so main ok so all this
will help you but if you want to kind of
know the major process for big data if
you want to talk about specially fast
and Hadoop developer these two forces
are the important force where we talk
about another text question dramatic is
it possible for a working guy like me to
go with these courses why not
impact 80 to 90% - Ashish who enrolled
for our course who are working people
and that works best for them because the
way we have designed up all of what
timings ah like we this morning 7:00 to
9:00 a.m. for the people who just want
to do this course and immediately read
for their office there are people who
love to come back from office and want
to do the course for them we have
questions like 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.
is see they are all good after coming
back to office we have be concessions
learning as web because not people say
that I am NOT going to dig this I want
something in beacon so envision we have
8 to 11 a.m. is P sessions they will
only do have sessions in the evening as
well on weekends regarding 8:30 to 11:30
p.m. so all the times we are we just ask
the time we have expect so payment from
working people we have made the time in
specific that it should suit all the
work in
as well so that's not a problem and you
will be getting a good sufficient and
ample time to complete everything up
question from Wade I'm a pressure what
what would be best for me my suggestion
would be go for big data Hadoop
developer first followed by a
participant these two courses are must
if you want to excel in big data
analytics feed now other could I still
like important for example this data
scientist put the reason it is important
is because we might have or this
language arts which is majorly used by
analysts this is like a hot study taking
the market right because a lot of
companies started using this language
they want to now start doing analytics
with that so that is the reason it is
one of the hot shopping in the market
and lot of companies are looking
products so definitely just loves are
important but to start with you should
look forward towards Big Data Hadoop
developer followed by a bunch of stuff
and that would be resolution this even
for us but whoever are experienced
people in volition will go no let's see
interesting case study yeah this talks
about this Hadoop and all that I
narrated part but let's hear interesting
cases
let's get maybe what I got into this for
not going to bore deep into the socket
just to give you an overview walk that
when you do all these forces what kind
of projects you will be solving so this
is just to give you a glimpse of the
Fertile part so there was a company
named as orbits that used to are like
book the hotel booking flights along
that now they were facing some issues
the issue what they were facing but they
have concurrent this but data what they
were eating it was cute there were so
many users coming and to their website
now they were using their houses or
their problem for your processing this
database systems enough but with so many
users almost 1.5 million slides 1
million supporters searching they both
almost impossible and that's the reason
they were generating
and thingamajiggy of log data project
now with their house growing like this
it was almost impossibility processes
but this was the biggest challenge for
them and to solve this they started
using effective so they were looking for
all these problems that okay I want
something efficient and long-term
storage system that can store any kind
of data now I'm not only worried about
structure data even my unstructured data
should get sold can I have some
analytical tools that can help me to
analyze my data and it should also be
cost effective not to get that answer
Hadoop answered it setting that yes I
have all your answers open source
framework it is so it is clean of course
you will not have to apply any of the
cost in fact earlier it's very easily
scalable and it has a lot of analytical
tools that help in to solve the problem
so what is it they are accomplished
their solution with the help of Hadoop
fine they have kind of used norm of
Hadoop tools to solve the problem then
use MapReduce their views height for
these tools they were using to solve the
problem now let's see that how the
analysis is happening of the title
effect object so what they had worked
they have two kinds of data
now the first data was impressionist
where they have a session ID photo ID
the position the position was important
now what was happening let's say it when
you search something it takes it shows
your page and it shows your page of mr.
Porter's now how it should decide that
they should be my first page may conduct
a job vectors that could be my first
link this photo should be tailed that
first link just so Jota should be at the
third position there what should be the
position of in total they should push
definitely to think from a business
perspective it makes sense for with your
motor is getting most it or whatever
hotel is getting most books definitely I
should show that portal as my first
focus right that should be my best
position more types of gifts now one
year that was
not happening with them they want to fix
that problem and second issue was can
you notice this high fashion they also
want to remove all this action because
this welcome bad data remember I talked
about veracity this is the problem this
is veracity now similarly to have one
more date of Krypton where they are
specializing visited IEP portal ID
booking date number of guests booking
sign all these people are there and
careful so they have the problem of that
data so they have to first fix it so
what they did as a first step was they
have written a MapReduce book I'm not
going to walk you through that Matthews
book because that's when you will not be
able to get it as we have not already
done this process but they have written
such effective MapReduce foot and using
that they were able to clean this data
okay so using that they were able to
clean the data now further down the line
now once they have done all that mess
now the major problem is how they can
analyze everything and see that this
chamber what should be the focus
position of importance that is not my
important fact and that depends on the
first but against the frequency which
water is getting both the maximum of
those bushes
now what they did they put full of the
data they put it in the local right they
after that is brought into the hadoo /
so they clean the data then after
cleaning they put it into a pot a nice
because height is of people kind of -
here you can apply a lot of analytics
all that analytics will be done from
here the queries will be given by
analysts and a parking highs will be
given the wizard so this is the case
what they were doing for back and to
achieve that what they did they have a
large amount of of unstructured log data
this store any kind of data like the
customer software they finally executed
all the poor business of mass feeding
site whatever output came on as a
substitute is spreaded to the hive which
uses SQL in size pudding language then
whatever output
the thing based on that they got the
position then they did reading the
analytical report let me just quickly go
and show you this part in the machine to
give you a glimpse of how the output
looks like in fact let me walk you
through a document where we have all
these things mentioned look at this look
if you look at this document what is
happening here we have our MapReduce
foot so we already have the math abuse
course we have first of all we are
keeping all of us input files what are
the source about tech we have distance
and impressions then we have created our
MapReduce program after that we
generated our judgment once we have done
that we are going to execute that gap
and in the output we are going to have a
senior data this is going to happen for
my impression excellence with once that
happens I am going to get my structured
data now I am going to go to my height I
am going to create a stable reference
there I am going to create the stable
Webster and having session ID visit RIT
and I am going to show this in my DMS
so this table will be created after that
the impression table has to also create
I am going to note that clean data into
this table service
once this is done when we create a new
table called a position table where we
are again going to use our join with all
these soak tables and load our data and
after that once it is done we will
create a booking frequency table which
is going prints I insert the state of
position to it I will be able to do the
analysis by doing this count how many
number of times the total is getting
research what is the average position it
is making us and this is how I will be
able to tell that this is nice there
should be my expectation so let me show
you quickly is this booking frequency
that's how this looks like in order to
do that let me just quickly get
connected let me just quickly get
connected to my hive once I am there
we can also list all the tables select
- or tables you can see this table right
we have this impression we have this
position we have so many tables
available with us
now these tables other we want to look
at the output of 50 booking frequency
for what they are in select leader let
FX on booking underscore frequency look
