and welcome to the session on our
programming now let's not waste any time
and let's move forward and look at
today's agenda and get a good
understanding as to what we'll be
learning in today's session now we will
start off by a simple understanding of
what a variable is and the various data
types that are supported in our from
there forward we'll be looking at the
various data operators the conditional
statements the loops and then we will be
slightly deep diving into strings and
functions now this is a completely
practical session but we will be looking
at some of the theoretical part as well
so I hope you guys are definitely
looking forward to today's session can
you give me a quick confirmation in the
chat box
okay so I've got a confirmation from
Jude as is with Charlie Terry
the pure Benjamin that's great to see
guys okay Benjamin is asking me what do
I do in case if you have a dot okay this
is something that I want to clear out at
the start of the session itself at any
point if you're not clear with respect
to any concepts that we discussed as far
as this session or there's some place
that you're getting stuck it then please
let me know just put across your problem
in the chat box and I will be able to
assist you right away so make sure at
any point if there's something that you
want me to repeat as well that you let
in does that answer your question
Benjamin okay that's great to see so
let's move forward and first begin by
installing our on our system now to do
that you just need to go to the crown
website and download ah let me just show
you how to do that so you can open
Google and search for download are
so you can go onto the first link and
you will get the direct link to download
our four window space so Graham
basically stands for Palm Pre until our
archive network so they extensively work
on development with respect to our so
you can either go download it from the
first link or let's say if you're using
a different version that is the line X
or Mac as your operating system then you
can go onto the website cran dot our -
project
oog and then you can download the
corresponding version as well now for
Windows in case if you are on this page
make sure you're downloading the base
version and not any other version so we
have four different versions here so
just download the base version here ok
so just click on the link go ahead and
download it onto your system and the
installation is quite easy you just need
to click on next and once you've
completed your installations please let
me know so that we can move ahead ok so
now that all of you have successfully
downloaded and installed our on your
system there is another tool that I want
you to download and install that is the
R studio now the purpose of installing
our studio onto a system is to help you
have an IDE that will make it easier for
you to program and work with us so to
download our studio just go back to your
browser let's go to a trusted friend
Google and search for a studio
so just click on the first thing here
again
and you will be redirected to the spit
so there are basically four versions of
our studio I would recommend that you go
ahead and download the desktop version
of our studio which is free just click
on download here and you get the
complete list of our studio versions and
you can choose the version that suits
your operating system and then go ahead
and download and install it so again
this is a quite straightforward
installation you just need to keep
clicking on next so please go ahead and
install our studio as well on your
system so that we can move ahead while
you guys are simultaneously trying out
the code when I'm explaining it so
please go ahead and download and install
our studio ok so this is how your our
studio looks like but let's keep it
aside for now and we'll come back to a
presentation where we will start off
with some basic knowledge with respect
to our before we actually deep dive into
it now the first concept that we'll be
talking about is what exactly is a
variable now before we actually move
into the slides I just want to have a
simple understanding of how many of you
are familiar with the term of variables
or how many of you are actually aware of
what exactly is a variable from your
understanding of different programming
languages
of going variety of answers here from
most of you some of you are saying it's
a value that you're using some of you
are telling value stored in a memory
location okay there seems to be some
lack of clarity here let's so let's move
forward and actually understand what
exactly is a wave now we would basically
is nothing more than a result memory
location to store your value basically
what it means this every time you need a
variable in your program then what
happens is you want to create the
variable at the times execution it
identifies that this variable is of this
datatype and correspondingly a memory
location is allocated for each variable
according so again it is a value that is
being stored in a specific location is
that clear okay so let's look at the
image below here now basically you're
taking three different kinds of
variables one is actually a numerical
value the second is a string and the
third is actually a boolean kind of bag
now don't worry about what exactly these
datatypes up here it's just to help you
understand how when you're using a
variable correspondingly a block of
memory is allocated to it based on the
data type because size of the block
slightly weighs but again each variable
get its own memory location allocated
for so now comes the most obvious
question as to what exactly is a data
type in our now talking about the data
type data type basically helps you
classify the value stored in a variable
now why do we need to classify this is
basically to help you perform different
kinds of operations now let's say it's a
numerical value then you can go ahead
and perform various arithmetic
operations you can perform with these
logical operations relational operations
but you cannot do the same when it's a
character value that time there is no
correct sequence or a correct way to
perform arithmetic operations between
two characters now this is the exact
reason why we need to classify the
variables based on their different data
types now if you take a look at the
image below here you can see although
we're creating three different variables
they each have a different data type
that they belong now
let's say X is equal to 50 now this can
be considered to be an integer type but
when you say Y is equal to 3.14
to eight five seven this is considered
to be a numeric buy and finally when you
say B is equal to true then this is
again being classified as a boolean
value now how many different data types
are present in R and how are they
different let's move forward and try to
understand them as well now there are
basically five different data types
present in R you have vectors you have
matrices arrays lists and data frames so
let's move forward and discuss each one
of them one by one
now we will start off with understanding
vectors as passed now a vector is
basically a collection of different data
elements that belong to an atomic that
again what is an atomic type you have
five basic atomic types present or as
they better known the five classes of
vectors the first is logical
now logical datatype can either take a
value of true or false and then you have
integers now integer takes a whole
number value whereas numerical datatypes
take both whole number as well as
decimal partner apart from that you have
complex variable and you have a
character variable as well wherein you
can store a single character or a
sequences of words as well so are you
clear with respect to these five atomic
types okay now when we talk about a
vector as a whole either you can have a
single element belonging to one of these
data types or it could be a sequence of
elements as well both of them are a
vector so let me go to the ass video and
show you these five data types as well
as how you can work with vectors so we
have our asked to do here now just to
give you a simple introduction this is
basically you're a scripting area so the
scripting workspace is something that
you can use when you need to write
multiple lines of code and let's see if
you want to execute a single line of
code then you can use the console area
as well now every time you declare and
work with available it gets
automatically updated into the
environment area and let's say if you
want to install various packages work
with different packages or you're not
clear with something then you can use
this workspace to get a better
understanding and have a clearer image
now again even if you plot a graph this
is the workspace where you can see it
for now let's try to understand the
different atomic classes of vector so to
command anything in R you can use the
hash symbol so first we are talking
about vectors
let's begin by looking at logical data
types now again to create a vector you
just need to specify the name of the
vector so I'm going to call it VTR 1
then you can use equal to and then you
see and inside quotes
now inside quotes you can pass any value
that you want now a logical value can
always be true or it can be false now
always remember true and false need to
be capital always now if you want to
just execute it let's select this
statement and you can go to run or if
you have multiple statements that you
want to execute at once then you can go
to click on source this will directly
completely execute the whole code
written in the script page now I just
need to execute the single line so I'll
just click on run and a new variable has
been created so if you see here a new
variable has been created of logical
data type and it stores two values its
true and false but how do you know which
class it belongs to to always know to
which data type a vector actually
belongs to you have a simple command
that is class and then you just need to
pass the variables name so in this case
let's say VTR 1 as you select the
statement again and let this run at
intuitive so here you can see the output
in the console area it says the class
which vector 1 or the data type 2 which
vector 1 belongs to is logical so here
again you can see there are two values
that I am passing to vector 1 now let's
say I am going to create vector 2 as
well ok here I just pass a simple
numerical value
let me say fee of 15 a five point six
seven four nine five four and then I'm
gonna even pass nine nine nine nine nine
nine
okay so I'll just select this and run it
so a new vector has been created you can
see that in my environment workspace now
if you want to see the value stored
inside a specific variable all you need
to do is specify the name of that
variable now you can do that in your
script workspace so if you write it
directly into your console then you can
see the corresponding value as well now
if you look at the format shop the value
for each of these having changed this is
mainly because the range of numerical
value that it can store a numerical
value that is greater than seven digits
can will always be converted to the
exponential form
now since a specific value in that
vector that is nine nine nine nine nine
is greater than the range of numerical
value all the values present in that
vector are being converted to the
exponential value so this is something
that you can always remember but let's
say I'm going to reduce this value here
now if I just update and run this
then you can see the value present here
15 was the whole number which did not
have a decimal pointed value but since
85 had a decimal pointed value
everything gets shaped so always all the
values are checked in the vector and
only then are they stood so are you
clear with respect to logical and
numerical data type
okay so Judas asked me how is integer
type different from numerical type
that's a very good question Jude
now again this comes back to the same
point that I had discussed earlier
integers cannot store a value that has a
decimal point associated with it so to
store decimal point value you have the
numerical data so let me show you
integer as well
but 2/3 is equal to C of let's say you
want to store 35 now if you stressed
part 35 then what happens is this gets
treated as a numerical value but with
this value if I just pass a capital L
then it will treat it as an integer
value 35 54:58 and 146 so always when I
am passing L along with the numerical
value it treats it to be an integer so
let's say I want to print out a
numerical value of vector3 so you have
all the values and I will say class off
vector 3 then it's telling me the value
is integer now coming back to your
question let me just create a new vector
vector 4 2 which I'll assign C of 58.4 6
5 and I will put an L along with this as
I had mentioned earlier if you pass L
along with a numerical value it treats
it as an integer but what happens if you
pass L along with a decimal pointed well
as you show you that so here you can see
when the compiler is trying to execute
this code you can see a warning message
has been passed saying that the integer
literal 58.4 6 5 L contains a decimal
point and it's suggesting me to use a
numerical value rather than an integer
so are you clear dude ok that's great to
see
there's another question from Charlie
Charlie's ask me what happens if I try
to store different data types in a
vector okay that's a very good question
Charlie let me show you what happens
let's say I'm going to create vector
five okay equal to see here I'm going to
pass true which is a logical value then
I will pass an integer value let's say
35
I even pass a decimal pointed value
let's say 3.14 so who can tell me what
will happen if I to execute this okay
let's see what happens it gets created
but let's see what value is actually
being stored in vector five
- you can see here is considering the
value true to be won and dis converting
everything to decimal pointed back now
I'm going to create a new vector let let
me call it vector six where I even
include a character string along with it
so see now again any character string
can be put into a single quote or a
double put it treats both to be the same
and it's store using a double quote in R
so let's say hello then I'll pass
logical value false I'll say 65l so
basically this is a combination of
character
it has logical value and it has an
integer value let's run this
and it gets created still there is no
error that gets generated but what
happens when you try to print vector six
so here if you can notice everything is
being stored but they are in double
quotes that means what happens is that
every value that is being passed along
with the character value is being
considered to be a character so hello is
a character false is a character and 65l
is a character to get a better
understanding let's use the class
function where I am passing the vector
five now if you remember vector five had
logical value it had integer value and
it had a numerical value if you execute
this you can see it considers everything
to be a numerical value and in case if I
check with respect class of vector six
then it's treating everything to be
character even though there is a logical
value and an integer value it is
considering all of it to be character so
again in case if you are creating a
vector that has different datatypes then
it actually converts all the variables
having different datatypes to a common
data type so are you clear charlie okay
that's quick so this is another we have
talked about the five different classes
of atomic vectors and we've seen vectors
as well let's move forward to the next
data type that is matrix now basically
your matrix in R is quite similar to
your arrays in other programming
language now here you have arrays as a
different data type itself but you'll
understand it better if you are able to
relate it to those of you who are not
familiar with what exactly an array is
with respect to programming language an
array or a matrix in this case is a
two-dimensional rectangle layer
basically it's similar to an actual
matrix that you are using in mathematics
where you storing different values in a
orderly manner
now the syntax for declaring a matrix is
quite straightforward you specify the
data type that is matrix followed by
that you specify the data the number of
rows number of columns now by room
basically is a logical cue that you say
so you actually use by row to order the
input vectors in a specific manner and
it div names basically I use to assign
names for your rows and columns so let's
go back to our studio let me clear all
this
and let me show you how to create a
matrix now first again let's try to name
our matrix I'm going to call it MTR and
then empty are equal to now again as I
had mentioned you need to specify the
data type so it's of a matrix type now
here you need to specify the data that
needs to be stored inside a matrix now I
can store a random value that is there
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a new vector and this vector
basically is going to have a sequences
number starting from 5 and going on till
30 so there are basically 25 elements ok
now when you say 5 : 30 that means I
need to store a sequence of numbers
starting from 5 with a constant
increment of 1 going up to 30 that is 25
elements now my number of rows are 5 my
number of columns are 5 now I do not
need to arrange them in certain way nor
do I need to specify the names of the
rows and call so this is it you can just
go ahead and run it so here you can see
the problem this phase in a matrix of 5
cross 5
I cannot store 26 elements that means
it's greater than 5 so one thing would
be is you can either reduce the value
here to 29 or you can update the value
here as well so let me just reduce this
and let me try rerunning this
you can see successfully it has been
executed so let me show you how the
value looks like
so again MTR and I just ran it so you
can see below how a matrix is being
stored here so five six seven eight nine
ten and correspondingly the sequence of
being filled in a column manner and this
is quite similar to the matrix that you
have seen in mathematics so any doubts
on how to work with matrix on how to
create one you can go ahead and try
creating a matrix and if you have any
problems or any doubts do let me know in
the chat box okay so I've got a
confirmation from Benjamin Terry's the
PRF swetha charlie that's great to see
that you guys are following and trying
it out simultaneous understood what a
matrix is it will be easier for you to
understand what exactly is array in R
now your array is quite similar to your
matrix now it can store the data in more
than two dimensions what do I mean by
that is so if you look at the example
here it will be easier for you to
understand not only are you creating a 4
cross 4 matrix but you're also storing
it in or 2 cross 2 matrix so basically
you're storing 64 elements but they are
again in turn being stored in four
different 4 cross 4 matrix so your array
in R is something that can store your
data in more than two dimensions here so
I hope this example was something that I
had given you a simple idea on how an
array is different from matrix and how
it is in R okay so let's go back to our
a studio and let's try it
so let me go ahead and create an array
called arr
then you need to specify the data type
that is array then comes the value that
needs to be stored in the array so I'm
going to create a new vector starting
from one to store to nine then comes the
dimension of the array now to specify
the dimensions you need to use time
keyword then you need to use a vector
now in your vector the first two columns
are going to specify the standard size
of each matrix that is going to be
stored in an I so I'm going to each
store it in a 3 cross 3 matrix then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to store it
in a foo cross to a ring so I have a 3
cross 3 matrix that is again in turn
going to be stored in a 4 cross 2 array
okay so let me just run this and if you
try to print array
as enlarged this for your understanding
so here you can see the values so this
is my first matrix this is my second
matrix this is my third matrix now all
these three belong in the first row so
you have the corresponding column number
and we go
similarly the fourth column of the first
row also stores the same then you come
down to the second row and you have four
similar divisions so I you clear with
respect to how we work with an array and
how to declare and view an array any
doubts with respect to array okay so
Agatha has a good question here Aditya
has asked me what happens in case the
number of values is less than the size
of five that's a very good question idea
so here what I lose let me just change
it to six
so if you look at our first matrix it's
storing all the values 1 2 9 in the
column fashion now I have only a range
of starting from 1 going up to 6 now
with the same condition let me disagree
run this and I'll try to print array
so what you can see here Aditya is that
if your array or matrix does not have
enough values to fill the matrix or
array completely then what happens is it
takes the same input vector and start
inserting elements from the star now I
needed to store nine elements in my
vector but I had only six values so I
have inserted the first six values
column wise then I have again started
inserting the values from the start of
the vector so the first three values are
stored in my first matrix which is
stored again in the first row and first
column of the array then the
corresponding next values have been
stored the next matrix which stored in
the second column of the first row have
you gotten an idea about this Agia is a
question clear a detail that's great so
any other questions
all right so let's move forward and talk
about the next data types that are lists
you lists are quite similar to your
vectors itself but the only key
difference between your list and your
vectors is that you can store elements
that belong to different data types in
lists without actually changing their
data types now we had seen this problem
with vector where you is trying to store
character value logical value and a
numerical value and in turn they're
getting change to a character value and
in our first example if you remember we
had tried to store logical value and
integer value and a numerical value
which in turn got converted to numerical
value olara so with respect to lists you
can store the elements which belong to
different data types and their data
originality is - now let me go ahead and
show you how to do that so let me clear
this as well now let me begin by
creating two vectors so let's say we do
7 equal to C off
say I have numerical value
let's hit five point six seven eight
then I have 32 95 31.6 and I have
another vector V tr-8
which has character values so hey how
are you
buying cue okay so I have these two
vectors that are need to be created so
this run this and they get created now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a list say call it my list which
is going to be a data type list
so again list and here what I'm going to
do is I'm going to pass vector seven and
vector eight if you want I can even pass
vector one which has logical value
vector one and then let me just execute
this command and they get outdated now
let's check what my list looks like
now if you look at this all the
numerical values are being stored
together you have the character values
and you have your logical values also
being stored none of these values are
being converted to a common format and
all of them are actually retaining their
original data type now in case if you
want to store different data types and
retain their original data types then
you can go ahead and use lists so I
clear with respect to lists any doubts
okay now the last data type that we'll
be talking about is a data frame
so basically your data frames is a table
or a two-dimensional array like
structure that can actually store your
data in an ordered manner now again
let's say you're working with a table
that is stored in an excel file or you
are loading a table from a database then
you would be directly loading it into a
data frame and then working around with
now let's go back to our our studio and
let's first try creating a new data
frame and then I'll also show you how
you can work around with the data frames
that are present in our so let me just
clear all this
I can also go ahead and clear the
variables in my memory so we'll begin by
first creating three vectors from stock
so my video one is going to have let's
say value starting from one and all the
way up to five so six value is there
then vector two is going to have names
let's say I start off with mind
I'll put in dude
let me bring an item as well
dear
Shwetha
okay let's keep it just five names here
okay and along with this let me create a
nother vector
that's vector3 and here what I'm gonna
store is
let me just do a new random numerical
values so let's say teen comma 25 comma
65 comma 1 45 and 74 okay so basically I
have three vectors here so let me run
this and you can see three vectors have
been created now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a data frame to
create a data frame you can use the
syntax data dot frame and then pass the
values that you want to be in your data
frame so I want my vector 1 vector 2 and
vector 3 so just from the statement
again
you can see your data frame present here
from my vector 1 1 2 5 has been stored
correspondingly to that the first
element from my vector to that is meal
has been added and the corresponding
first value is being taken from the
third vector and it is also being added
so each of the first element from three
vectors have combined together to form
the first row of my data frame so is
this clear on how a data frame works
okay so let me show you how you can use
a data frame of an in-built
table so this call for data frame now
let's say I want air quality now I
equality basically is a table that is
already present in my a studio so if you
just run this you can see the complete
table being stored as a data frame so
here again you have the ozone you have
solar ratio you have the wind
temperature a month so this is basically
the quality of air measured over
different time frames in a span of one
day so every day you're measuring these
four quantities and then you're putting
it as part of your table so this is
something that will give you a good
understanding as to how to work with the
data similarly you can import a table
you can import an excel file and then
directly store it into your data frame
as well so we'll be seeing about that in
our next class where we'll be working
with the analytical section of that but
I hope you get a clear with respect to
what is a data frame and how you can
work around with it can you give me a
quick confirmation in the chat box ok so
I've got a confirmation from our the PRF
terraces here so does youth Rita that's
great to see guys so now let's move
forward to the next concept of today's
session there are operators in are now
talking about operators there are many
four different operators but what
exactly is an operator operators are
basically construct which help you
manipulate the actual value of each of
the variables so using an operator you
can perform various operations and
change the value stored in each of the
variables now again as I mentioned there
are mainly for different types of
operators you have automatic operator
your relational operator logical
operator and
time and orbit so let's move forward and
look at each one of them one by one now
talking about arithmetic operators
you have addition subtraction
multiplication division these are some
of the common operations now I am quite
sure that all of you would be familiar
with this I guess we come back here to
make clear all this let's say print six
plus nine point eight
let us run this so basically you're
getting it output similarly if you want
you can change it to any other you can
say division so it's giving a
corresponding value and so far now apart
from normal arithmetic operations of
addition subtraction and division we
have three new operators here the first
is modulo operator now in a normal
division when we perform division we get
the result to be the quotient of that
type but in case of a module division
what happens is you get the reminder now
to specify that it is a modular division
you just need to use to personate
symbols and it gets converted to a
module addition if I run this you can
see the difference earlier it had given
me a division here it has given me the
reminder now let me give you a better
example here 22 divided by 7 gives me
the value of pi' now I'm quite sure all
of you are aware effect now same thing
let me just change to modulo division
and I will rerun this now when I rerun
this you can see the output to be what
although a division is being performed
here but instead of the quotient like
you normally get you're getting V
reminder you clear with respect to what
modulo division is oh that's great now
apart from modulo division you have your
exponent operator basically if you want
to raise any variable to a power then if
you use the exponent operator let me say
I want to power 7 then you can use the
exponent operator and you can run and
get the corresponding value now finally
you have your flow division now flow
division is something that is quite
interesting what happens in flow
division is that you divide a number and
if the quotient that you're getting as a
result turns out to be a decimal number
then it is actually rounded off to the
previous whole number now to explain
this to you what I do is I just modify
this I will make it again 22
Flo / 7 okay now we know that when 0/7
actually gives us the value of 3.14 - 8
5 7 and 22 modular division 7 gives us
the output of 1 but what happens in case
of a flow division you get the output to
be 3 so what happens here is the value
that you actually get is 3 point 1 4 2 8
5 7 but since it is a flow division it
gets rounded off to the previous whole
number that is 3 so I guys clear with
respect to how a flow division works -
with us asked me what if the decimal
point value is greater than 5 ok that's
a very good question so let's try
something out let's say 3 point 9 okay
flow divided by 2 what is the answer for
this yeah it's one point nine five so if
I run this you can see the value to be 1
even if it is point nine nine nine nine
nine it still gets converted to the
previous whole number so does that
answer your question swetha all right so
apart from arithmetic operations you
have relational operators now relational
operators are usually used to compare
the actual values of two variables and
then the output that you get is actually
a boolean value let's say you have two
variables a and B now if you want to
know which is greater of the two then
you need to use the relational operator
greater and you need you can check if a
is greater than B if a is greater than B
then it returns an output to be true if
it is not it returns an output to be
false similarly you can have less than
now apart from your greater than and
less than you also can check if a
corresponding value of a variable is
equal to or greater than or less than
that is if you look at the operator here
if let's say you want to check if a is
either greater than or equal to B then
you can use the greater than symbol
followed by an equal to and let's say if
you want to compare the value of two
variables then you need to use double
equal to and only then will it compare
if you use a single equal to it becomes
assignment and for checking if it is not
equal to you can use not equal
let's come back let's say we're equal to
25 and y1 equal to 60
now let me print
greater than where one
run this we
put is false no the value of your
variable where is not greater than
variable var1 but let's say if I am
checking if they are equal to as well so
again double equal to and if you run
this it says false
are they not equal to each other so for
that an exclamation mark followed by
equal to gives you the output to be true
that means the value of variable is not
equal to variable 1 ok with respect to
the relational operators
okay so others ask me where do we
normally use relational operators so
that's really good question RJ you will
be using relational operators and
logical operators that we'll be seeing
next as part of your conditional
statements now what a condition of
statements I request you to be a bit
patient because we will be discussing
that in the upcoming slides and if you
are not clear at that point then we can
come back and answer your question all
over again is that okay Jay okay that's
great so going forward from relational
operators you have assignment operators
now again assignment operators are of
two types so till here you have seen how
I have created variables and assigned
them using the equal two apart from that
you can always use the lesser than
symbol followed by a hyphen now this
also means that you are assigning a
value to a variable and this can also be
done as per left assignment and right
effect so what this basically means is
that you can either write the name of
the variable to the left the assignment
operator and then the value to the right
or you can also write the value to the
left following the assignment operator
and the name of the wave so both of this
is accepted and you can use an equal to
or the lesser than followed by - symbol
to assign the value to a variable are
you guys clear okay so after the
assignment operator comes your logical
operator now there are basically three
logical operators that we'll be
discussing
you have your logical and logical or and
not operator
what does your logical ion do is that it
actually checks the value of both the
variables and then it gives you a
corresponding output now you get the
output to be true only and only if both
values are true in case one of them is
false then the output is considered to
be false in case of your logical act but
in case of your logical or at least if
one value is to be true then the
corresponding output would be true now I
am quite sure that most of you would be
confused so what I'll do is let's go
back to our studio clear all this I
create two values value one
which is again a vector having true
and false
true
and false
I'll also create another vector value
too
that will have value false
true-true again and finally false
what we're going to do is let's see the
output for this print value 1 and value
2
so let's execute this code now so here
you can see when I am trying to check
the only case the output is coming to be
true is when both the values are being
true so each value is being checked with
the corresponding value from the second
vector and it is decided if both values
are true only in that case is it
printing out a value to be true but
let's say in case of an or operator
there is this one this entry
so in that case only where you are
dealing with two false statements is the
output consider to be for all other
cases are coming out to be true apart
from this you also have your logical or
wherein if I execute this and fee then
only the first values present between
both vectors are checked and the
corresponding value is decided so if I
am using a single and or a single or it
is an element wise and or an element
twice or but if I am using double or or
double and then it is a logical and
operation or a logical or operation so
here you can see where I am using a
logical and operation then it is second
we first two values and since both
values are not equal to true it is
giving me the output of false so any
doubts with respect to the logical
operators oh yes we missed out on one
operator that is the not operator now
not operators quite straightforward
let's say not of value one
that all the values have been reversed
where I had to as the first value in my
value one it is getting replaced to
false where it was false it is getting
changed to true so any doubts with
respect to the logical operators
so this is the element wise and element
wise are we have seen the logical and
logical or and finally we've also seen
not operator okay so I've got a
confirmation from Charlie AJ the theory
that's great to see guys that you're
following so please make sure you're
simultaneously trying out these quotes
as well so that you will have a complete
understanding so moving forward let's
look at the conditional statement and
this should answer your question as to
where we're using relational operators
and logical operators now talking about
the conditional statements there are
mainly three types of conditional
statements that we'll be dealing with
and an extension of a conditional
statement so basically there are four
different conditional statements that we
will be using now the first conditional
statement that we'll be looking at is
the if statement now what if statement
basically does is that it checks a
specific condition and if the condition
is found to be true then it goes on to
execute a set of statements but if it is
not if you ignore these complete set of
statements and move for now how does
this work let's go back to our our
studio let me clear all this
let's say we're 1 equal to 25 well 2
equal to 35 now I'm going to use the if
statement if
we're one plus we're too
is greater than
50 so you can figure I'm using a
relational operator along with the
condition statement as well so coming
back to your question this is where we
completely use relational operators as
well as you'll also be seen logical
operators in the upcoming slides now in
case if they are greater then I am going
to say print now if you want to print a
string put it in quotes value is greater
than 50 and select all this and if you
click on run
it says value is greater than 50 but
let's say I make it 100
now if I just run this segment of the
code then it does not print anything
that basically means that the statement
written inside the if condition gets
ignored
I guess clear with respect to how the if
statement works okay so I've got a
confirmation from everyone that's good
to see but let's say you have more than
one condition that needs to be checked
what do you do in that case in that case
you can actually use an else--if
statement
now else' statement basically can be
used for helping you to check multiple
statements and check their corresponding
validity let me just show you how to use
the elsif statement as well now first if
condition is checked then let's say else
if
r1 plus r2 is greater than now it's
checked the first condition whether it
is greater than 100 or not if it is not
found to be true only then will it come
to else if condition let's say 75 in
this case then I just copy the statement
value is greater than 75 let's say you
want to add even one more condition to
this then just copy this else if let's
say 65 in this case
so again you can see here we are putting
multiple statements here and there order
of checking or the order of evaluation
is in a sequential manner first it will
check if it is greater than 100 if it is
found to be false it will go into the
next condition it will check if is
greater than 75 if it is false then we
come down to the third condition and see
if it is greater than 65 I'll select all
this and let's run it
so none of these three statements have
been executed so it's not it's checked
all these three statements and it's
found to be false finally let me just
write one more condition
elseís and copy this completely
and here I'll just change it back to 50
now we know this value is greater than
50
and I'll update it inside as well now
let's execute this infi again
finally it is evaluating all these
preconditions before it and finally it's
found a match and that's why we are
getting the output so I guys clear with
respect to how the elsif condition'
works
yeshuaa that's a very good question so
Schwitters asked me is there any
limitations on number of cells if I can
write multiple you can write any number
of conditions but rather than writing
multiple conditions that you want to
check what you can do is you can make
use of logical operators and then
valuate these expressions
okay so that's great to see that all of
you understood the if and the else is
part but let's say if none of your
condition meet then what you do and in
such cases you can always go ahead and
use the L state now your L statement is
a conditional statement that definitely
gets executed if no other condition is
met now if you go back to our studio let
me just remove this condition the final
condition and let me just put in an else
statement here else I will say print
number is less than 65
okay let's try executing this so here
you can see all these conditions were
checked and since none of them were
found to be true then you go into the
else part and the statement return
inside else gets executed so this is
same that has been diagnosed a presented
here the penis give a simple explanation
here so if you see always we start the
first thing that you do is check the if
condition if it is found then you
execute the if part it is false then you
go to the else if conditions each of the
else's conditions is validated and
whichever condition is found to be true
then the corresponding else's code gets
executed if none of the else's
conditions are also found to be true
then you go to the else part and execute
the else code and finally come out from
the selection sex so I you guys clear
with respect to the if the else's and
the else statement now please make sure
you're quite clear with this because
this is a very strong fundamental
concept and is one of the very important
concepts that you need to be aware of
with respect to any programming language
not just our okay so I've got a
confirmation from everyone now the
fourth condition statement that we'll be
talking about is this switch case
statement now in case of the switch case
statement basically what you're doing is
you're already aware of you value that
the expression is going to take now once
you know that then in such cases you can
go ahead and write a specific statement
now how does it vary from a first
statement now the major thing there is
the knowledge of the value that the
expression takes now you cannot use an
uncertain value or a range like you have
done with the if-else statements here
you need to specify the actual value
that the expression can take and then
you can specify the corresponding state
now what I'll do is let's go back to our
our studio you means clear all this
let's take a simple example let's say
switch with respect to expression I'm
just going to give you a value of 4 and
then let's say in case the value is
equal to 1 then print
Monday so I hope you guys get what I'm
trying to do for the number value that
it could take I am specifying which day
it is going to be equal to print Tuesday
wetness tea
Thursday
v is equal to Friday
six Saturday
finally 7 is equal to Sunday
okay so before I go ahead and execute it
let me just still make certain small
modifications respect to this I'll put
the values in quotes basically it makes
it easier for the evaluation to take
place
now I'll just execute it and you can see
the value is being printed as Thursday
so what has it done it has first checked
the value of expression then go on to
check on the various value that the case
can take once it's found the match then
it is gone ahead and executed the
statement associated to that case and
always make sure you put comma after
you've completed the statement for each
case because this is how it
differentiates that the next cases about
the star now in cases there is no match
then we can use a default statement that
case what I lose I just write print
invalid input so now that I have
specified the default value let me go
ahead and change this value let's say
it's going to take percentage as a
special character so it does not mean
any of the cases if you try and redirect
this then what happens is you get the
output us invalid it that is again as
you remember we had done with else case
if no other condition meet then the else
code is written here if no other case
matches then you beast the default state
so any doubts with respect to the switch
case statement or the e first statement
any of the control statements that we
have discussed till here
from Jude swetha AJ Adithya that's great
to see
so going forward let's talk about the
next statement that our loop statements
talking about the purpose of loops in
our it basically is quite similar to any
other programming language the main
objective is to help you execute a group
of statements multiple number of times
rather than rewriting them multiple
times so this in turn goes on to reduce
the code redundancy and also make the
performance of the program better now
talking about the different kinds of
loops in our you have mainly three tens
of loops the first is repeat loop the
second is why and the third is for now
although these three perform the same
operation that they help you execute the
statement multiple number of times but
how they do that is slightly different
with respect to each of them so let's go
forward and try to understand each one
of them one by one starting from the
repeat loop now the repeat loop
basically helps you execute a group of
statements any number of times until the
condition that you have specified inside
it turns false and this condition is
always checked after the statement is
executed now talking about the flow of a
repeat loop statement you always start
with the execution then you go on to
execute the code block and then you
check the condition if the condition is
found to be true then you exit from that
loop and if it is false you go on to
execute the loop n number of types until
the condition is found to be true okay
so let's go back to our studio and try
this up let me clear all this
so let's begin by first creating a new
variable let's say variable var1 okay
which is equal to 5 then what I'll do is
I'll use the repeat you
now here let's say I want to print every
odd number starting from 5 to 21 so in
that case what I'll need to do first is
print the variable 1 to know the current
value so we are 1 then I need to update
the value of variable 1 so we're 1 I
need to make sure it achieved odd
numbers only so wire 1 is equal to where
1 plus 2 now I need to define the
condition which will help me leave from
the slope so in that case let's say if
my wire 1 is greater than 21
then you need to break from here so
break so I get killed this as to the
logic of the repeat loop as I explained
at once again so we have started by
declaring a variable equal to five then
we have printed the current value of the
variable we have appended it and if it
crosses 21 then it needs to break
so let's go ahead and execute this and
here you can see it's printing 5 7 9 11
13 15 17 19 and 21 so once it has
reached the value of 21 it is leaving
from the loop now let's say if you had
to write this manually then you just
need to think so just think about these
steps now this loop is running for 10
times now if you had to write these
steps manually you need to write these
two statements at least 10 times to get
the corresponding updated values and
just think about it 10 times you're
writing the same set of statements that
increases the code redundancy and apart
from that also it tends to take up more
time for execution of that code so
definitely the main purpose of having
loops is to help you reduce your career
agency and as well as increase the
execution time of hair code
so I guess care with repeat loop okay so
I've got a confirmation from everyone
now let's move forward to the next loop
that is the while loop now while loop is
quite similar to your repeat loop it
says you need to specify the conditions
and it will run till the condition is
fulfilled but the major difference
between your while loop and your repeat
loop is that the condition which
determines whether the loop has to run
or not is Rutten first in case of a
while loop so always before you begin
execution of that code what happens is
that it checks whether the condition is
true or not and only then does it go
forward and enter the loop condition so
if you look at the flow for the while
loop you start off with the execution
you check the condition if at first it
says the condition is found to be false
then you exit from that loop but if it
is found to be true you go on to execute
the code block and then keep on
repeating until the condition is found
to be false okay so let's go back and
here what I'll do is I'll write the same
code let's say while then the condition
so here I need to mention pad 3 has to
be less than 21 so here we'll check
where 1 has to be less than 21 now in
our earlier statement what we had done
was we were checking when the value of
one increases beyond 21 and then we're
breaking but here we're going to enter
the loop only and only if the value of
wire one is less than 21 if that is true
then go down and I'll just copy this so
this logic is going to remain same and
that's it
so I'll just update the value of r1
equal to let's say five select this and
let's rock now here you can see the
difference earlier what was happening
was even though we had achieved the
value of 21 it was getting printed and
then it was breaking from that rule but
in this case what is happening is that
before it achieves the value of 21 it is
exiting from that loop the condition was
same in both places but it was just that
how the loop statement differs now to
give you an even better example what
I'll do is I'll just update this value
let's say 22 here and I'll run this now
in this case you can feed 22 is getting
printed that means it has entered the
loop and then it is going forward and
executing this logic present inside but
only after it is executed the good is it
checking the condition so therefore with
the repeat loop it executes at-least
once but same thing let's say if I
modify with respect to my while loop I
just run this section here you can see
nothing is getting printed that means
it's not even entering that you so this
is how majorly your repeat and while
loop refer your while loop is actually
an entry control loop and your repeat is
an exit control loop because your while
loop defines when you enter into the
loop statement and you repeat defines as
to when you leave from that loop
statement ie clear with respect to the
while loop and how it's different from
the repeat loop okay so I've got a
confirmation from AJ charlie dude Rita
Aditya it's great to see that you guys
are following now comes the final loop
that is the for you and how the for loop
differs from pure repeat and while loop
majorly
is its purpose of usage now in a
scenario where you're not sure as to how
many times you need to execute the same
code you can go on to use the repeat or
the way you but let's say you know how
many times the statement written inside
the loop has to get executed in that
case you can use the for loop for loop
is a loop that you use when you know the
number of times the statement has to be
executed now if you look at the flow
what happens is you start with an
initialization that is you
the initial-value go on to check if the
condition is true or not if it is false
you exit but if it is true then you go
on to execute the code block once that's
done you update your value and then you
want to repeatedly check the condition
let's go back to our our studio and try
out the for loop as well now let's take
a simple example let's say I want to
print the first 25 numbers in that case
what I can do is I can say for my X that
is a variable in the range 1 to 25 that
means starting from 1 till 25 just print
the value of x ok so I just select this
I can go ahead and run it and you can
see starting from 1 all the first 25
numbers have been printed so since I
know I need to print the first 25
numbers I'm going with before you so any
doubts with respect to the 3 loops that
we have discussed they repeat the while
and the for loop any doubts with respect
to them ok since all of you seem to be
clear with respect to the loop
statements as well let's go on to talk
about the next concept that are strings
now strings are basically your
characters itself but here
any value that you write between a
single or a double quote in R is
actually treated as a string so let me
show you how to declare a string let me
take STR 1
and I put it in chemicals let's say hey
RS fun print str1 as well
similarly it is copy this
and McGrath er - and I will put this
inside double quotes
now I'll select all this and I will run
this so here you can see even though
they are returned in single quotes and
double quotes they are not they're all
treated the same now while you are
working with shrinks there are certain
things that you need to remember now one
major thing that you need to remember
while you're working with string is that
you cannot insert a double quote within
any string that is actually declared
using double quotes that is let's say
you're defining a string inside double
quotes then in between that you cannot
use double quotes similarly if you are
working with a single quote then you
cannot put a single quote between double
quotes but at the same time let's say
you want to put a single quote between
your string then make sure it is
enclosed within a double quote
similarly vice versa if you want to
include a double quote then make sure
your string enclosed in a single quote
okay remember that
okay so moving forward let's to look at
some of the operations that you can
perform using strings now let's say you
want to join two strings or better known
as concatenation then you can use the
paste function now let me come here and
since I have str1 and str2 already
defined I'm going to create an STR three
which is going to use the paste function
and here I'll pass Str one
and str2
then let me just print str3
now if you select this and let you run
this then you can see both drinks have
been concatenated and added to the new
string so this is basically how you
concatenate two strings as part of our
now apart from this if you want to find
the count of an STR you have the N
character function now n character
function is quite interesting function
let's say n care of STR 3
this will give me the total number of
characters present in HTR three so three
letters for hey one for comma one for
space that is five six four are seven is
another space after that you have to for
kiss that makes it nine
space is again ten following that you
have fun which is 30 now the first
string has 13 characters the second
string will also have 13 characters and
the space between both is 1 so that
means I have total 27 characters now
let's say you want to convert the
characters present in that string to
upper case and lower case so in that
case what I use this I'll use new string
string 4 which is equal to 4 converting
two of the case you have to upper where
I will pass my STR 1
and I'll create another string that is
STR 5 which is going to have the
lowercase so for that again you have to
lower so in which I will pass my STR to
finally come sprint
therefore and STR five
so let's execute the section
so here you can see the first string
that is getting printed is completely in
uppercase the second one is completely
in lowercase in your original string you
had your head capital and our capital
rest everything was small but when you
see everything is converted into small
or everything is converted into capital
but let's say you want to separate or
you want to take a certain part of a
string so for that we actually have this
substring option now let me create STR
six which is going to use this substring
method so substring where I am going to
pass my STR 3 as the parameter or the
string from which I want to extract now
you need to specify the position from
which you want to extract this substrate
so what I'll do is I'll say 5 comma 16
okay and then I'll print STR 6
let's execute this and you can see here
from the fifth character till the 16th
character it has been extracted and
stored into a different story so any
doubts with respect to strings
okay I've got a confirmation from Jude
I'm PR a gyrator charlie
that's great to see so now I'm going on
let's talk about the last topic of
today's session that is functions now
functions are basically a block of code
which can be used with respect to
different purposes but again they help
you to achieve code redundancy and they
in turn also help you to achieve
different performances now again if you
look at the examples here let's say I
want to add different values first I
want to add three and five then I want
to add six and nine then I want to add
one and five so what happens is I need
to write B statement zip it now when I'm
writing in a loop I need to identify a
certain parameter based on which the
change is going to happen but what
happens if they are discrete values and
I need to perform the same operation in
such cases you can definitely go ahead
and make use of a function now here what
happens is I am passing three and five
in the first turn that gets computed
from my function and it returns me a
value of it similarly next time I'm
passing six and nine which returns me
the value of 50 finally I am calling one
and five which again goes on to return
me the value of six now with respect to
the different types of function in our
there are mainly two types the first is
predefined function which are already
present in our and we have been using
them so good example of that would be
your print statement your substring
method that we have just seen your paste
method so all these methods are already
defined in our apartment that a user can
also go ahead and define a function so
let me show you how it is done let's go
back to our studio
a clear everything
for every function one the most
important part is for the function to
have a name so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to write a function that's
going to compute the Fibonacci series
based on a value that I specified now my
function doesn't know how many times it
has to compute it so I'm going to call
the function so the first thing you want
to start off with by naming a function
so I'll call it Freebo
then function
and here comes your parameters so I'm
going to say in a then open your
parentheses and then you can go on to
write the logic for that function
now here let me begin by declaring two
variables where one which is equal to
zero
I have wire two which is again equal to
one
then I'll print
we are one I print fire too as well
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to write a for loop
where it starts where my ex actually
belongs in the range one took a that I
am getting as input and then I am going
to create a new variable where 3 which
is going to be equal to where 1 plus
where to once I have computed this I
need to print 3
and then append the value of where one
and where - so where one becomes equal
to the current value of wire - and where
two accepts the new value of r3 so any
dot with respect to this logic of
Fibonacci series
okay so swetha has pointed out a very
good thing here so you don't need this
pass with datatype with respect to that
function and this is because R actually
decides what kind of data it is taking
as input and functions accordingly so
we've defined the logic for the
Fibonacci series now all we need to do
is we need to call this method so for
that just specify the name of the method
that is Peabo you need to pass the value
let's say I want to compute the first
five Fibonacci elements then I have to
just select this and let's execute it so
you can see the first five elements of
the Fibonacci series has been caught now
let's say I need to call Fibonacci
series for different values so let's say
Freebo
or flex 8:10 then ma I'm going to call
for 15 so I am calling the function
three times but each time I am passing a
different value here so what I have done
is that I have generalized the same set
of operations that I want for any number
of values that I am passing as the
request you just run this you can see
for five it is printing the first fire
element then for 10 it is going on for
the first 10 and for 13 it's going on
for the first 13 elements so I hope you
guys have got a simple understanding as
to how you can write a user-defined
function in R now again it is all left
to you to explore it now you can go
ahead and write functions for different
purposes and as to how you write that is
completely left you because everyone has
their own personal style so any doubts
with respect to how to work with
functions in R
okay so I've got
from everyone so let's move forward to
summarize what we learned today
we started off by understanding how to
install our we saw the different data
types the different data operators then
from there we moved on to understand the
different conditional statements the
various loops and finally we talked
about these functions in R so any dots
with respect to this since you're
concluding session you're free to put
across your questions if not I hope you
guys have a happy weekend thank you I
