management and the first step is to have
the plan the scope and for planning the
scope what we did is I was the inputs
our project management plan the Charter
the AEF and o-p-s and the tools and
techniques our expert judgment and
meetings and the output is this scope
management plan if the requirements
management plan we saw some PMI space
resources in terms of the templates for
scope management and requirements
management the next step is to collect
the requirements
so scope management plan requirements
management plans stakeholder management
plan project charter and stakeholder
register are your inputs many we need to
collect the requirements we need to
clearly understand from whom it needs to
be collected and hence the need for
stakeholder management demand
stakeholder register the tools and
techniques specified here then
interviews focus groups facilitated
workshops group creativity techniques
group decision-making techniques
questionnaires and surveys observations
prototypes benchmarking context diagram
document analysis we said that question
is and surveys are used when you have to
get information from a large number of
people I also say explain the term
benchmarking what it means and outputs
we
Riccar comment and the requirements
traceability matrix within group
creativity technique we saw
brainstorming nominal group del 3 idea I
our mind mapping affinity diagram
so nominal group was basically
brainstorming plus then after that to
put the score to each of those or waited
and then clarity's group decision-making
techniques unanimity majority plurality
and dictatorship true reality we
explained us that it is the largest
group present in that decision-making
process if whatever they agree Nara that
is being taken up
examples of this mind map
you
we saw context diagram wearing me in the
middle we have the process and left-hand
side we have all the inputs and
right-hand side all the outputs a
finicky diagram is where the PO strips
are used and all the points are being
requirements are being mentioned there
and then they are grouped under certain
headings
for better
and for greater discussion more
structured discussion
we saw the acquirements
when plan requires Urban electrics the
requirements traceability matrix gives a
single document to ensure that all the
points that has been agreed or approved
as requirements are being considered and
taken care of across the lifecycle of
the project
then we saw define scope
in defiance school we have scope
management plan project charter
requirements document in OBS expert
judgment product analysis alternative
generation and facilitated workshops are
the tools and techniques project scope
statement and project document updates
are the outputs and here what we saw is
and there is a project scope and there
is a product scope which needs to be
addressed by a project manager so the
product scope are the features or the
functionality that characterize the
product service of a site completion is
measured against the requirements
whereas project scope is the work that
must be performed to deliver a product
that is how you execute the project so
on the product scope we have the
functional requirement non-functional
requirement like speedy ease of use etc
user interface implicit requirements
project scope is more to do with how to
execute the project like the project
budget meeting status report user
training defect management project
artifacts project schedule
I miss
dr. molasses
analyzing the product that project will
create and can be accomplished through
progress sound of dubious value of value
chain analysis etc an alternative
innovation exploring possibilities of
generating different approach to execute
and perform the project
we have other contents of the project
scope statement
you
these are the difference between the
project charter and the project scope
so we're project charter
about the purpose of the project the
objectives of the project high-level
requirements I never project description
level high level risks summary
milestones how many budget stakeholder
lists project approval requirements
assigned by the project assigned project
manager responsibility and authority
name and authority of the sponsor on the
other hand project scope statement
defines the project scope description
acceptance criteria deliverables
exclusions constraints and assumptions
next step is to create the a blue BS the
work breakdown structure the work
breakdown structure actually provides
the details of the complete project
requirement and it is broken down or
decomposed to the lowest level which is
our package not as the inputs scope
management project scope requirements
document EF and o-p-s the tools and
techniques is the composition and expert
judgment this breaking down into the
lower levels
it's called decomposition the output is
the scope baseline in the project
document object so work
is the lowest level there is some we
understood some of the terms like Code
of accounts which is a numbering system
used to identify unique components of
the Mobius control accounts which are
management control points or scope
bucket actual costume schedules are
integrated compared to current value for
performance measurement planning package
when I'm looking is component the load
of control account with known web
content might without details they do
that to T's rolling wave planning we
explained with rolling wave planning
which is in the form of progressive
elaboration so that in this case the
planning takes place from the immediate
activities in much more details than the
one so as we grow go into the project
and start understanding more about the
project above about what to be done we
start planning the details of the
activities gradually work breakdown work
packages are used as one of the method
for the decomposition so here you have
work packages like components analysis
requirements charges identification
alternative analysis so you come down to
that your X level starting from need
assessment standard so this is basically
based on the work packages that what is
the work to be done so project
management will have its own work
packages system engineering will have
its own what is it standards development
will have its own work packages and need
assessment their own ve other one is by
phase we are not used to by phases like
project management requirements design
construction integration and test or it
can be on the basis of major
deliverables this is also something
which we use for our BB s purpose
you
types of or three ways of decomposing a
WBS every WBS has to be accompanied by a
WBS dictionary the dictionary gives that
texture details of explanations of each
of the elements in that of Logie aspect
in that uh baloobius this will help
anybody to look at it and will be able
to understand what is the meaning and
what is there in it
you
okay the next process is verifying
school to formalize acceptance of the
completed project deliverables you have
to verify school the customer does the
verification so in post project
management plan requirements document
requirements traceability matrix
validated deliverables and work work
performance data tools and techniques
our inspection and group decision-making
techniques outputs accepted deliverables
change request work performance
information and project document updates
the next stages control scope here to
monitor the status of the project and
products for and managing changes to the
scope baseline so project management
plan requirements document requirements
traceability matrix what performance
data Opie's are your inputs variance
analysis is the tooling technique and
output is here work performance
information change request project
management plan update project document
update and opie updates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
