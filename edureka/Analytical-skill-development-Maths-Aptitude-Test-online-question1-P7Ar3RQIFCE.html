very interesting question we have this
square ABCD of site seven centimeter let
us join the points B and D to get
diagonal BD also join the midpoints e
and f of sides BC and CD respectively
now my question is what is the ratio of
the shaded area to the total area of the
square I am repeating the question again
what is the ratio of the shaded area
which is this trapezium b e FD to the
total area of the square your options
are a three by eight B 18.3 six by forty
eight point five seven C 1 by 4 D 2 by 3
and E indeterminate take fifteen seconds
to think upon that how we can solve it
then we will see how to solve it
now let us have a look at how to solve
this question some of you without giving
much thought about the best method of
doing must have started thinking about
finding the area of the trapezium BEF D
using the formula 1/2 into some of the
parallel sides into the distance between
them those people I would say will be
wasting a lot of their precious time Y
so finding the area of trapezium in
present case is long and tedious look
first we will have to find the length of
the diagonal then the length of side EF
and then the perpendicular distance
between them the perpendicular distance
between them is not DF as some of you
might have taken but this the length F n
finding F n is again a tedious and
time-consuming task though not tough I
would say now since aptitude means best
optimization of time so don't you think
it would be better to find the area of
this right triangle DBC and from that
subtract the area of the triangle Fe C
to get the area of the shaded region
now area of triangle DBC is simply half
into seven into seven now let us find
area of triangle FEC so EC here is three
point five is it
no EC is 7 by 2 of course I know that 7
by 2 is 3 point 5 my point is we are
most comfortable with integers then with
fractions then with decimals so as far
as possible
try to remain in the domain of integers
not possible then go to fractions else
we have no option but to work with
decimals those who are taking 3 point 5
here will go into decimals and
unnecessarily increase their
calculations so taking ef-s 7 by 2 we
get the area of the triangle as half
into 7 by 2 into 7 by 2 that is 49 by 8
so shaded region is 49 by 2 - 49 by 8
that is 3 into 49 by 8 now total area of
the square is 49 so the ratio comes out
to be 3 by 8 now when it comes to
geometry there are lots of questions
which we do by symmetry let's have a
look at this one if we join these two
midpoints and these two midpoints what
we get here are 4 squares of equal area
now in this particular square these 2
triangles would be equal in area
similarly these two would be equal in
area and therefore all these 4 are equal
in area extending the same logic all
these 6 are equal in area now if we draw
this small diagonal then all these eight
triangles are equal in area so total
square is equal to these eight triangles
out of which 3 are shaded as the answer
is 3 by 8 so as you can see things
become pretty simple now but to apply
this you need lots of practice and of
course guidance to condition your mind
to think in this fashion
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
