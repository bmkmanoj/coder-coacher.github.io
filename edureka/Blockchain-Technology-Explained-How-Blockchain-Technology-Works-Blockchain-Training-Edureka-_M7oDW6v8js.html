welcome to this block chain technology
session now without wasting any time
let's move forward and look at today's
agenda now we start off this session by
first having a fundamental understanding
of what blockchain this and what Bitcoin
is because this is essentially important
for you to understand what exactly are
we dealing with in today's session after
that we talk about the various
technologies web blockchain is being
used as well as the various key features
that make blockchain popular now these
are the peer-to-peer networks as well as
cryptographic technologies involved the
proof-of-work as well as the blockchain
program in itself now moving on from
there we'll talk about a theorem as well
as we'll work on a demo involving smart
contracts we'll try to understand how
the smart contracts works with athelia
which is an application of the
blockchain technologies itself finally
we go on to understand the various
blockchain applications as well as its
use case how it's being used across the
different industries and how effective
it has been in Revelation arising these
technologies as well so I hope you guys
are clear with respect to today's agenda
now moving forward let's talk about the
first topic of today's session that is
what exactly is blockchain and pit
corner now blockchain is being used
across various technologies and trends
for different purposes which we'll be
talking up as part of the session as
well although blockchain is a trending
technology it was originally introduced
as an implementation medium for the most
popular cryptocurrency today that is the
Bitcoin system now blockchain was
introduced in 2008 as part of a white
paper which described the revolutionary
technology of Bitcoin blockchain became
the medium through which the transaction
as well as the management of Bitcoin was
introduced now blocking basically is a
continuously growing list of Records or
a public distributed ledger system where
each block has multiple transaction
details associated with it so every
block has multiple transaction details
as part of it and new block gets created
on regular intervals all these blocks
are interlinked and they form a chain
thereby giving the name blockchain now
currently there are about 2,000 50
transactions that have added to every
block so every transaction that you use
through bitcoins gets added to a
transaction pool from which people
verify this transaction and add it to a
block so presently each block has close
to 2,000 50 transactions
now given the present scenario a new
block gets created every 10 minutes
so this basically means there's three
blocks created every hour and in a day
we have about 72 blocks this means there
are about 400 locks every week so this
number is presently fixed that is every
10 minutes one block gets created this
varies with respect to the complexity as
well as the effort put in to create a
new block so this is something that is a
standard at the present moment now for
creating the new block the Creator gets
an incentive of 12.5 bitcoins as Aragua
now this is something that gets
allocated by the system and this is the
only way new bitcoins are created now
talking about the four features about
bitcoins the first comes the
peer-to-peer network then we have the
hashing encryption proof of work as well
as the blockchain program on itself
let's start by talking about the
peer-to-peer network now the blockchain
runs on a distributed peer-to-peer
network what do I mean by a distributed
peer-to-peer network is that the ledger
which holds all the details with respect
to the transaction is completely
distributed across to the peer-to-peer
network here everyone who's part of the
network has the complete copy of the
transactions so all the transactions
that take place as part of the
blockchain system is completely
available in this ledger and this is
highly useful because what happens is
even if one person tries to man you
played this ledger and try to make out
some profit from this it's not possible
because everyone else apart from that
user in the system has a complete copy
there by neglecting this correction that
he has me and finally maintaining a
consistency throughout the system now if
you look at the image here this
basically is a sample of what the ledger
would look like now you have a reference
ID for every transaction that takes
place that is the transaction number but
this transaction is very unique it's
something that is obtained after a lot
of encryption as well as various hashing
algorithms involved into this apart from
the transaction number you also have the
amount which is being sent in that
transaction now this in turn gives you a
better idea of how many bitcoins are
being used in the system and how
transparent it is thereby increasing the
trust of the people involved in the
system itself neglecting the need for a
third party like a bank or a financial
organization now as I had mentioned
everyone who's part of the system that
is the blockchain system gets a complete
copy of this length
they were ensuring that the ledger is
completely consistent and no one person
can manipulate it or make changes to the
ledger
now the next key feature of blockchain
is the hash encryption now the
blockchain system uses a sha 256
encryption methodology whereby even a
small change can make a huge difference
with respect to the hash work now let's
look at an example here now let's
consider the example of hello world here
ok so what I'm going to do is that I'm
going to pass Hal over to my hash
function and let's see what the output
is going to be so this is the output
that I'm getting from the harsh
encryption now let's say I'm just going
to add an exclamation to the hello world
input let's see how the hash function
changes so if you look here this a
complete change with respect to the hash
values that is generated from this now
there are two major factors that this
ensures firstly any change with respect
to the input completely changes the hash
value
thereby if you're trying to man plate
the input then the hash output value
will definitely change apart from this
the hash encryption is unidirectional
that means that from this hash value you
can never predict what the input is now
to help you understand that better let's
take the same example I have hello world
with an exclamation mark here what I'll
do is I just changed the hedge to small
letter and W to smaller that is
everything is going to be in small case
then my output also completely changes
although the first place seems similar
but the remaining values are completely
different this ensures that there is
complete uniqueness with respect to the
hash value that is generated even with
the smallest change on the okay the next
key feature of the block chain is the
proof of for now proof of work basically
is a mathematical proof where you have
to solve a mathematical puzzle to create
a new block now this basically is done
by people who are known as - they
basically validate all the transactions
that are initiated in the blockchain
system as well as solve this
mathematical puzzle so once you've got
the solution to this mathematical
problem known as nonce then you have
successfully mined this block so this
nons or the mathematical solution that
you get basically ensures two things
firstly it ensures that all the
transactions that are part of this block
are verified and valid transactions
apart from this this also ensures that
you have
created a valid law because every block
has a unique value of nots so once you
identified the value for the nonce then
it means that you have successfully
created the new block as well now the
final key feature of the block train is
the blockchain program in itself
now the blockchain program in itself can
be used to perform multiple operations
okay one such example as given here is
to store the ID cards of all the
citizens that you can authenticate
during elections apart from this one of
the most popular application of
blockchain is the Bitcoin system itself
where you are validating all the
transactions now it's not necessary that
the blockchain system should just have
one program you can also have multiple
programs that are part of your
blockchain system now in a previous
session on blockchain tutorial we saw
how you can create a private autonomous
blockchain and be used it for a banking
use case as well now let's take an
example here let's say I want to add a
condition to my blockchain where an on
1st of every month the school field
should be transferred from my account so
I'm going to put a fixed amount in my
Bitcoin wallet or my blocking wallet and
from there every month first some amount
has to be transferred to the account of
the school so this can be a standard
process and I can specify this condition
as part of my blockchain program itself
now moving forward let's talk about a
theorem which is one of the most popular
technologies that was built on similar
lines of blockchain now helium is also
an open-source public blockchain but how
it's different from the blockchain is
that it uses ethers instead of bitcoins
as a means of cryptocurrency now
although there's a huge difference with
respect to their currency values a
theorem is also something that is
growing in today's market and is also
one of the most widely used
cryptocurrency after bitcoins now
talking about the major features of a
theorem the first feature would be the
currency issuance now this basically
deals with the conversion of your
currency into a theorem as well as
governance as to how many Eaters are
created and how the transaction through
ether is made tea now as I had mentioned
ether is the crypto currency that you're
going to be using in ethelia apart from
that one of the most popular ideas built
on a theorem was the decentralized
autonomous organization this basically
became a platform for various
organizations to work with respect to
their requirements and needs although
this was delisted in 2016
this still seems one of the most
possible ideas that can be implemented
with correcting a lot of flaws apart
from that you have smart contracts which
basically is a contract now this is
similar to the condition that we had
discussed earlier so let's say every
month on the first some amount has to be
transferred to the account of the school
so this condition can be implemented
into a contract where both the user that
is I can set a contract with the school
mentioning that every first this amount
is going to be transacted so every first
this contract is going to get executed
apart from that the concept of smart
property is something that is gaining a
lot of popularity these days what
basically it does is it basically helps
you transact your property through the
etherium blockchain system now how it
does that we'll be talking about in our
next session but I hope you guys have
got a simple overview of a theory so
great so moving forward let's talk about
smart contracts which are built on a
theory now smart contracts are basically
one of the major factors that led to the
increase in interest for ethelia now as
I had mentioned earlier a smart contract
can be any contract that is specified
between two or multiple users based on a
common agreement so let's say John is
purchasing a property from Ken now what
he can do is that both of them can come
to an understanding and create a smart
contract for this transaction once he's
created this smart contract anyone in
future can actually view this contract
and get a better understanding of what
exactly where the conditions between
both of them so let's say tomorrow Ken
is selling this property to someone else
so he can actually see the contract that
he had bought this property from John
and what were the conditions earlier so
this will give a better insight as well
as give a clearer picture to the users
now smart contracts are basically used
to create rules as part of the
blockchain program now as I had
mentioned these rules can be anything as
per the user's requirement and these
smart contracts are actually written in
a language known as solid now solidarity
is quite similar to your JavaScript
programming language and is something
that is gaining a lot of attention these
days because of how popular aetherium is
becoming now if you look at an example
here this is a simple example of a smart
contract now what you're basically doing
is that you're taking unsigned integer a
and unsigned integer B and then you
perform some action with respect to both
sorta this is as per your requirement
you can write
okay so without wasting any time let's
move forward and look at today's them so
what we'll be doing as part of today's
session is that we'll be looking at an
auction program when you can place your
bid as well as identify which was the
highest bid and even end the bidding
okay so let me show you that example now
for today's session will mainly be using
three things the first is the remix
which is a solid DT ID available online
and this is the product of etherium
itself mainly used for creating smart
contracts as well as writing codes using
solid it apart from that we'll also be
using a theorem block Explorer now this
basically will help us check all our
transactions associated to our ethereal
block now a theory block Explorer is
running on my local machine so what
we'll be doing is that will be
performing transactions internally and
we will be checking it up apart from
that I'm also going to be using test RPC
which basically is an RPC tool use maybe
for testing and development in my test
RPC I only defined the various accounts
their private key and the corresponding
ethers that each account holds so let me
just show you how what the code looks
like so this is a simple program for a
simple option okay so here you have the
beneficiaries that is the account ID the
time which the option starts as well as
the bidding path okay finally you're
going to store the highest bidder as
well as the highest bid Emma
he thought wasting any time Lea we just
create a simple smart contract and show
you how it works this change this now
I'm going to be using a web 3 provider
because all the account details are
present on my local machine and I don't
want it to conflict with the existing
ATM account ok so once I click on OK
it's going to be reload now I'll be
sharing this code with all of you so you
can simultaneously try this
now here if I change to w3 provider you
can see all the list of accounts getting
updated here just give it a moment and
you can see it now here you can see all
the list of accounts that are being
provided by my test RPC so let me show
you my desktop PC once again now here if
you see the first account starts with 0
x9 f2 and it's the same present here
similarly there is CB 4 and if you see
your test RPC that's the next account so
all the accounts that are present in my
test RPC is getting reflected into my ID
now I'm just going to insert a
transaction from this acha okay wherein
I am NOT bidding any amount at the
moment so if I just click on create what
happens is a transaction is going to get
created so here if you see this is the
cost of the transaction now gasp
basically is the resource that is going
to be used for completing every
transaction and if you come down here
you can see the highest bid value at
present is 0 the bid time was also 0
auction started as a specific time and
the highest bidder is from the same
system now let me should give you a
better understanding of this by going to
the etherium block explorer now here let
me just refresh this page and you can
see here now a new block has been
created now in this block there is just
one transaction which is coming from my
specific account ok so this basically is
the number of block the difficulty for
the block and the nonce have been set to
0 because this is on my local machine ok
now if you come down you can see it is
coming from the account that I had
specified earlier to verify this you can
go to your test RPC and you can check so
both of them are from the same account
that means that I have put a bid for the
auction from this occur at present I
have not specified any value so the
value is set as here ok similarly let me
take another account and let me bid from
that account as well
so here again the transaction cost is
even specified and if you go into your
aetherium block Explorer now instead of
one block there are two blocks mentioned
here so a second bid has also come into
the auction now if we see here it is
from the new account that we have sell
it now if you go back to the remix
validity you can see the details of the
account has been also updated earlier
these both accounts hired thousand
ethers present in them right now there's
a slight marginal difference it's not
perfectly thousand ethers so this
basically is the amount used for the
transaction as well so since I have not
specified any value it is not reduced
this is just the standard transaction
cost for the bidding that is getting
implemented here okay now to see more
about this transaction you can actually
go back to your test RPC and let me show
you the details of every transaction
that we have initiated so here you can
see the first transaction being
initiated a contract ID also being
created the gas used for the contract as
well as in which block is this contract
being present so what happens is if you
come down if you start bidding from
different accounts you can see the
corresponding bid values increasing to
the highest bit as well as the timeframe
when the bidding is going on finally
let's say if you want to close an option
you can click on option and or if you
want to add a specific bit you can do
that as well if you want to withdraw any
specific bit then that is also possible
so here what we've basically done is
that using a smart contract we have
basically included our bid as part of an
auction okay so I hope this example has
given you a simple idea of how a smart
contract can be implemented for
different purposes as for different
requirements as well seems interesting
right okay so moving back to our
presentation now move forward let's talk
about the various blockchain
applications that are built on the
blockchain technology now bitcoins store
is one of the most popular online
marketplace where you can purchase a lot
of electronic goods using bitcoins
itself so your transaction medium
becomes bit card and all the
transactions that you perform here are
part of the blockchain system apart from
that coin dig is another very popular
online marketplace where you can
purchase Alaura of goods using bitcoins
alone so coin gig deals only with
bitcoins so anything that you wish to
purchase from corn geek
I spit cuts Swiss pharmacy is another
popular online medical store which helps
you purchase high-quality medicine and
this ship everywhere here all the
transactions again are using bid cuts
now because is slowly growing to become
the global currency where almost
everyone is accepting payments in form
of bitcoins now all things luxury is
another popular jewelry store which
helps you purchase different rings
necklaces bracelets using bit cuts so
the next time that you have some
bitcoins and you want to buy something
for your partner this is definitely the
good place to buy a few diamonds
now Virgin Galactic is another very
popular venture I'm quite sure all of
you heard of this was Richard Barse ins
idea of a suborbital spaceflight so they
themselves access fundings in form of
bitcoins so you should get an idea of
how popular bitcoin is now cheaper is a
very popular website that helps you
identify the different flights between
two destinations it shows you the
different available flights based on
their pricing and they are also planning
to introduce payment using bitcoin
application one for one let's look at
the five industries which blockchain
will disrupt now the first industry
we'll be talking about is the financial
service industry now Barclays was the
first financial organization that
carried out a transaction using the
blockchain technologies now today
although all transactions are not on the
blockchain system from Barclays but
still they are hoping to migrate to the
blockchain system now pretty soon you
might find blockchain being implemented
or Nasdaq to ensure that all the stock
trades are completely valid as well as
secure the next industry that will be
disrupted by the blockchain is the
voting domain
now what in using blockchain is one of
the most popular ideas that is gaining a
lot of attention these days let's look
at a real-life use of this let's say you
have the convenience of voting for your
favorite candidate sitting at home
wouldn't you love to do that I would
definitely love to do that and that's
exactly what this technology will help
you to everyone will have a unique
account number and every word can be
considered to be a smart contract this
thereby ensures that no duplicate ports
are cast as well as new voting frauds in
itself are possible Estonia was the
first country to implement a blockchain
based a voting system and has been
successful to a good
follow my word is another popular
organization that is working on the
world's first open-source voting system
which can be used across different
countries based on the blockchain
technology the next industry we'll be
talking about is the real estate
industry now imagine all the contracts
and the deeds that you're signing would
be present on the blockchain system
firstly it would reduce all the hassle
required with the paperwork as well as
all the agent based fees that you need
to perform because today unless and
until you go through an agent not
everything goes right but let's say on a
blockchain system you completely
establish all the infrastructure that is
needed you know what has to be done when
who is signing the document where is the
property verified is a document verified
you have a real-time update on your
transaction wouldn't that make it quite
easy also putting out all the contracts
with respect to real estate on the
blockchain system is highly useful
because as I had mentioned earlier the
blockchain ledger system cannot get
corrupted or manipulate so let's say a
property is being handed down through
different people every given instant you
can actually see who is the previous
owner what was the contract between them
what was the purchasing rate what is the
current pocket weight and gives you a
better idea now this is something that
is definitely revolutionizing the
real-estate world and ubiquity is
someone who's trying to manage this
ubiquity is trying to provide an online
blockchain system which you can use to
manage track as well as transfer the
land titles and property leads to
another client as well this in turn
makes the whole process hassle-free the
fourth industry that we'll be talking
about is the music streaming industry
now close to 90% of the artists
proceedings go because of illegal
downloads from the internet wouldn't you
like to have complete access to an
artist music at the same time ensure
that they do get paid forever this
exactly is being implemented by mycelium
my silliest online blockchain based
system which helps artists sell their
work directly to the customer without
having any third party involvement here
now this in turn can also avoid the need
for a record company which takes certain
amount of the profit from the artist as
well so it directly increases the profit
made by the artist and thereby ensuring
that illegal downloads of these musics
are completely limited now the final
industry that we'll be talking about is
planchet market now the supply-chain
market has been the same since the two
hundred years that it was introduced in
there are a lot of paperwork's that are
involved a lot of third party fees that
you need to provide we these agents need
to be paid various officers need to be
paid all that can be avoided if you
migrate your supply chain management
onto the blockchain system this in turn
gives a complete transparency with
respect to your good ensures that
there's a real-time update with respect
to your goods as well as ensures there
is no additional cost to the transaction
provides is a very popular organization
working in the supply chain market
wherein it's trying to provide a
transparent and a traceable platform for
all the supply chain management
organizations on the blockchain
technology apart from this iBM has
another growing organization in the
supply chain market because it is
providing a blockchain based solution to
various popular organization if you want
more information on this you can check
out the video of IBM and marks where you
can understand how a blockchain is being
used extensively in the supply chain
market now with this we come to a
conclusion of today's session so to
summarize what we have learned as part
of the session we started off by a
fundamental understanding of what
bitcoin is and what is a block then we
talked about the various blockchain
technologies we talked about the various
blockchain features blockchain
peer-to-peer network the cryptographic
technologies used the proof of work that
was involved in creation and validation
as well as the blockchain program in
itself then moving on we talked about a
clear IAM as well as we spoke about
smart contracts and I showed you a demo
on how to work with smart contracts
finally we talked about blockchain
applications how it is being used across
different technologies as well as the
five major industries that the
blockchain technology is going to
destroy I hope you guys are clear if you
have any questions please pull it across
if not I hope you had a great session
thank you and goodbye I hope you enjoyed
listening to this video please be kind
enough to like it and you can comment
any of your doubts and queries and we
will reply to them at the earliest do
look out for more videos now playlist
