that is how do we read this as 7b dat
files so this was one of the objectives
so this how do we read SAS 7b data files
so did you guys download to the SAS
bee7bea data files because for me I took
some time to understand from where the
files were there so how many of you were
able to download the SAS 7b data files
if you could please answer with SAS yes
that would be nice
so I'll see if you could okay
let's do this once more and then we
cleared it up as if that if you have not
been able to download so so we'll do
step by step about this so what is
important is that before before we do it
is that we should have this sass seven
Baudette files there the sass p7 b rant
files you can get you can first have to
install the package so you go ahead and
install the package if you have not
already installed the package please go
ahead and install it so most of you guys
must have got it installed I presume if
you are not got it installed please go
ahead and install the sass 7b dad cross
package this is important because
without that you cannot proceed to do
this so what you do is after that once
you get the thing is that you do a data
of sass 7b dad dot sources so as to get
those sources from where you can get it
because otherwise you have to search
from various places and do it it is
there already so why not utilize that so
I just do that once I do that I can just
so these are the places where you can
have this this URL actually this is the
URL this is a URL where you can get the
file so I use notepad many so this is
say URL so I copied this URL also here
so if you are not ok fantastic as if you
haven't caught it so once you have got
that thing please put it into your
working directory I have got it in my
working directory - here
so whatever file that you choose from
there instead you have to put it in your
working directory and once you put it
into your working directory their
history is very easy let's clear this
screen the rest is very easy it's the
same as reading any other thing
Shri Ganesh is saying thats a speeded
data sources not found now one thing
that you have to do is that you have to
load these liabilities as 7b debt and
once you have installed this package
then you need to get the data as to get
the URL so instead of searching in the
internet for different places where this
has 7b dead files and I found you can go
to this place and get the URL from here
I got this URL now what it will do is
that if you place it in your browser
that thing hopefully it's a small file I
will try it again
so it should download into my working
directory I'm having trouble accessing
this thing but what what you should do
is that it should it should put it into
your working directory so I had put it
into my working directory in any case I
don't know this is giving me a problem
but this is how I got it actually let me
try it once more
it might be with my okay so this is a
place so it got it installed here but it
is in my download directory so once it
is in my download directory I copied
from my download directory and put it in
my working directory so if you have not
done it then you will say if I not found
and all these other things yes it is
available in lmses that's correct I
uploaded that in LMS also but the key
thing what I want to stress here is
whether it is in the LMS or not or it is
in the LMS actually because I had loaded
it last last week instead you should
keep it in a working directory once it
is in the working directory that list is
very easy rest is like reading in a sass
7b data file
so this is the same so if you do this
so depressed data is there and then you
have class into class depressed it it's
a data frame so nothing to do can get
the names from here then you can do the
head which is the top six rows so that's
about it so this is how we can get the
so this part so we have covered this
part very well I guess SAS 7b dat as
well as the SPSS files so before we go
on to other things what I will do is
that I'll also show you some examples of
how to use our commander in which you
can read various files so first what we
have to do is to load the library so did
you guys install the our commander
okay before I proceed I have two
questions can you use any other sass
file instead of de precios you can use
any other file actually so what you are
going to do is that you can go to this
place this
so there you have these files the drug
crop dot says 7b that you can take this
file and you can try to yourself and
Chile download that file and you can try
it yourself
the jihadis can use any other SAS file
instead of de precios you can use this
you you can download this file from this
URL put it into your working directory
and the same thing happens ok so Parker
has asked one question are we going to
learn how to create our own class and
data frame in future sessions but the
answer is that data frame will surely be
doing a lot of things but glasses yes we
can try to do those things but it is not
much in vogue in our as in the thing but
data frames will use it extensively in
our programming ok
Suraj has asked a question library sass
7b data command hits errors saying no
package found yes that would give an
error because you see that you have put
an extra a in front of it
it's B that no he is here please you
first have to accept our load that pack
installed that package and then you can
try doing this so coming back to data
frames will do a lot of things with data
frames data frames are like tables in
DBMS and we will be meaning exploiting
data frames like anything so let's just
give you an example of our commander of
how we are going to use our commander
library our Cmdr that's how you do it so
this is how the RCMP R is being info
and then what happens instead you can
import data from here you can import a
text file so here it is enter name for
the data set what we will do is that let
me I've got one file here
life expectancy which I will upload it
there it's a very simple file it has a
life expense expectancies of of
countries and the average life
expectancy so this is a simple file
that's and we will use the R commander
to read it what we will do is that here
enter name for the data set you can
leave it as data set variables name in
the file will just see the file again
are there variable names no there are no
variable names so what we will do is
that this goes away missing data
indicator in a not really here but let's
put it as any location of the data file
is in the local file system field
separator is white space commas tabs
others specified here please note that a
field is being separated by a comma or a
tab or others so we'll go to the file
and see here it's a space
so wide space so I press okay okay I had
something SUNY's this one so it has read
the table using the read dirty will
command the read or table command is a
much more generic version of read dot
CSV it has got all these things here
header fall saves you know any strings
in a decimal point white one strip white
is equal to true all these things are
there so once it has read the data set
what we will do is that view view the
dataset it has come here I will I don't
know whether you are a being able to see
it or not here is a data set
so here's a dataset you can edit the
dataset also here
so this is about our commander which
eats without writing code you can get
all these things in the our commander
not say the file so we are done with SAS
