business and this is analytics this why
it is happening to your business and
what can it do in the future
so bi basically relates to - boring
visualizations
whereas analytics reports - how you can
enable your business to do something
different and bi is what analytics is
why and printer magnetics is what you
win so this is one phone call
prescriptive analytics which is how can
we achieve what you want to achieve so
let's see how it can help in our current
scenario so types of analytics or is
hybrid consists of structure and the
content diagnostic descriptive
corrective and prescriptive so so
descriptive this is what happened we're
sending 70% of effort code then
diagnostic is study person now you
suppose what you say what is the study
pantsing necessarily person it's like
the amount of a lot of you know change
or the growth that it is saying so 60%
goes to print evangelist that means
every year the predictive analytics
market is going up you know amazingly
high so diagnostic again if I
descriptive us again what happened so
basic correlations I'm sorry oh sorry
sex descriptive statistics diagnostic is
when you look for a reason so we find
spurious or fundamentally challenging
relationships correlations what are the
key relationships an infinitive you say
what will happen what if in Harris case
it's basically spacing you try to
prepare mystically figure out what is
the possibility of each yet again that
given that can we figure out why should
I believe this and how can i optimize as
what is called as prescriptive analytics
let's see what's next okay what I'll
constitute this term called creative
analytics consumer behavior machine
learning patterns scoring new
visualization letter behavior a
decision-making communication and stance
the model what do you think is the most
important component here can you type in
your answer on the chat anyone I disco
for it what a thing is the most
important what is the most important
aspect here consumer behavior okay what
else
machine learning mm-hmm so I think okay
so the two most important moments are
when in such skill model the other one
is machine learning and third one is
visualization now honestly machine
learning and celscan model are the
backbone and everything of predictive
analytics but how can you understand it
if I understand it I'm gonna let it make
sense and make sense only when you use
it in a visualization from making show
how accurately how logically are able to
interpret the results oops oh I'm sorry
so then I'm the lifecycle identifying
company problem did have operations in
exploration transformation then whether
they deploy evaluate all Colin said
things when the factors it's pretty much
similar to a software lifecycle share
the differences is it could be a traitor
and the model might just each with
itself based on what the output is think
of an IT program ID model where you've
got a project you do the requirement you
know the the analysis you do the
implement the the basic documentation
then you do well you know some actual
code develop and then you go for the
testing debugging blah blah blah blah
blah in the end of the deployment of the
product here it goes into a different
way all together you create the model
you validate it using some basic test
and saying send it back to the client
however the catcher is declined might
just say okay the results are okay but I
am still not satisfied and then you have
to retrain the entire process which
makes a life difficult I hope you all
can hear me next why predictive
analytics okay it's like if you can
figure out what's gonna happen next you
didn't take the decisions correctly I
mean no one's need to know why exactly
is effective analytics but but how is it
a game-changer gotta see so what does
folk say it's the ability to develop
develop the ability to model and predict
behaviors to the point where individual
decisions can be made in real time this
is on the analysis and held that means I
can I can back up my intuition using
data rather than just by basic intuition
so employee attrition prevention only if
you think imply attrition is a problem
the one who don't think can can put in a
chart so it seems only one guy feels
like that right that's this question I
manage money shall take that question in
the last just remember if in case I miss
it out it's a big problem yes though
there's a certain level of attrition
that you would want to be there so what
is the biggest problem in employee
attrition it's the ability to figure out
whether you want to do it in this way or
not whether you want a particular person
to even armed you mind invest in a
particular employee but then he leaves
and that's where you lose all the amount
of investment that you've made on that
guy so how how do we figure that out how
we figure out that that a particular
person would lean in certain amount of
time and there's something called as the
employee age it is not refer to the age
of the employer to refers to the to the
to the total time spent by the employee
in the company okay what is churn
attrition when a customers reduce the
usage you completely stop using your
products
they're leaving a brand and might be
shopping with your computer
Jean friction is nothing but it's
application the number of chance is
typically small compared to the number
of customers that stay ok
now why would you want to go 10
predictions of course you want to reach
one prediction because your customers
are the way you earn right so let's see
let's see why don't figure it so the
quick sorry
so the question is how do you figure out
that these but customers are going to
leave when there is a reason for it and
the reason is simple on the question
they're coming and right now can you
please keep it for the after the end of
the session so that we can take it after
that a little first finish to finish the
entire session so many customers reduce
their use usage or completely stop using
the products that is where you start
losing out in business but what if you
can figure that out and you can serve
your customers better especially ones
that you think I want to leave or you
don't invest your time much in the
customers really think it's pretty
pretty much obvious that they going to
leave right that make it like simple so
first of all why HR need analytics
anyone who thinks HR does not mean
analytics either in that case I don't
need to cause light for any examples of
HR analytics that you guys think any any
any specific thing that HR could solve
using analytics you can do that yeah so
why do you think HR need analytics
anyone okay
well they sure need analytics because
because HR is not just related to hiring
and firing of employees it's much more
you know it's quite beyond that so H I
can figure out Rachel and licks and
figure out whether your employees are
happy or not H I can since and really
figure out is the salary that we're
giving to the employees is it a good
number a number that solution of course
any salary would not be so
but is it competitive enough how fast we
need to grow house known we need to grow
how much of an height that we need to
give to our employee so that they are
satisfied blah blah blah blah blah all
that could be based on intuition or data
choice is yours right one of the biggest
HR analytics company will be and
PeopleSoft they are focusing heavily on
analytics just because they feel that HR
intakes is the way to go okay so so
predict attrition especially amongst the
high performers focus the right fitment
of aspiring employee so it how
compensation values will pan out and
establish linkage between employee
engagement score and CSAT score which is
a work in progress so how do you think
we can figure out that the employees are
happy well that can be related to their
engagement within the company and that's
where HR analytics can be very helpful
impact of employee turnover now new hire
onboarding training new assignment and
that's where your employee starts
leaving now
now once the employee starts starts you
know start saying that this is where
where where he is not utilized where in
the company or when he starts thinking
that his role could be bigger in a
better inner some other normal issues
that is where HR can come in before he
makes a decision to leave in fact there
are certain companies like belong but Co
this company called would be analytics
that that claims to figure out the fact
that that dreams figure out that that
that it can it can find whether the
employees thinking of a job change even
before employee starts think about it so
they know through data that employees
probably got to leave the company
even though empires are in thought of it
but eventually them to I leaves and
that's where they are capitalizing that
they can do it better and that's where
again a child addicts become so very
important okay let's go ahead
oops it's a cost of employee turnover I
need other numbers you said we can look
at look at these numbers and figure out
they make sense or not
the idea is predicting or investing
money in a mix which can serve the
purpose of employee attrition at clean
some certain analysis can be really can
really really heavy it's a real cost of
in fluting employee what do you think
what do you think is the most important
impact almost significance persistent
boilers are pertinent impact of employee
was doing well and he leaves what I
think is the biggest biggest outcome
please type in your answers I want to
see what do you guys think guys I let's
make it a more interactive webinar so if
you guys if you guys could put down but
put that down on the chat that would be
really helpful but the question is what
do you think is one of the most
important important impact one most
let's say you know which which point
among the ones are giving here even here
impacts an organization be most then
employees especially when someone leaves
who was good someone who was good enough
was getting probably was this problem
was the star in the company and then he
leaves what do you think is is is it is
not just the cause but the impact of
that guy leaving the company so what I'm
trying to say is how effective your
organization can be if they can figure
out a person is going to leave probably
give them the hi called the kind of kind
of you know visibility that they need
and probability in the employee so what
do you think is the most important the
most
you know impacting impacting reason I
think it's culturally important because
when someone who's doing good leaves
others do others question why why are
you leaving
make sense why employ look for change I
was concerned about the lack of
opportunities for advancement
I wanted more changing work I wasn't
satisfied
bla bla bla bla bla what do you think is
the most important part I think this one
here is the most important part until
unless you are mature enough to
understand that small compensation hike
does not really impact a career so so
the idea is that we should be able to
figure out what are you so for example
as for this charge it says I was
concerned about the lack of
opportunities for advancement however
the idea is that the how can figure out
if the employee is happy with kind of
opportunities caught but that can be
done through analytics
yeah so I think I'm getting some
reasonably good inputs thank you for
that
what can we do about it
analyse the following trades identify
which type of employers are charring
what is the Chung rate what is the
financial nose
how is it trending then sigmund them
segments that means you group them
together and see what was the behavior
okay recess we can always figure out
that's one of them that's not gain
equation however there could be any
question could be what the set of people
are leaving are the top employees
leading ah that's a big big problem for
me I shouldn't let that happen so I
remember long back mr. Narayan Murthi he
said I don't mind if people leave and
after near he didn't apologize for that
because it was the best employees were
living as I said the best just a
different prices were living and then
only they got fish on second and you
know emphasis got into a better shape I
don't know if it's a thematic shame but
it certainly seems to be doing better
how reliable is the NTV reason as me
people don't care real losses brings
yeah so money to solve any question
let's let's take it up at the last in
the last section of this session so
printer modelling can help us figure out
who are most most likely churn and which
implies the most profitable of course
that's not plate of analytics rather
it's more about it's more about more
about destructor relates so conduct
regular surveys user insights ringing it
or employees but that's that's the next
set of you know steps that could take
you have to have good relationship with
your employees but the fact is how we
can figure out who at once can only be
done through through through the eeprom
analytics oops sorry
okay
so build an attrition model bring a
profitability model and bring a cost
model with above tomorrow's so basically
you can figure out the impact in the
likelihood as it is if how do we figure
out that what is more likely and what is
the impact so if we can figure out the
risk involved in terms of lineal
employee leaving is pretty low then it
was okay but if it's high then there is
definite reason to worry about and
that's why this one could really hear
further so let's look at this on the
right hand side so you lose you lose
your business risk by medicating
employer and that's obvious so HR and
business we can figure out these two
areas differently and we can predict
that one of the clusters at risk of
living people who are at risk on really
prepped in time now five drivers of
meaning of course they are variable that
could you know they are way so we can
create a model that can have output as
as as possible attrition imply or not so
if the apply is at a risk of getting a
risk of of linen company then you can
figure out what are the top drivers that
are making him get away from the current
organization then of course we can use
pretty relatives for all the printer
business business analytics and our wine
our analytics so that's a different
story so smart H ionics can force you
the charm for sure we can find the
correlations
causations and relation why visit part
so basically visit part is nothing but
it's the it's the it's a data set which
can help you understand your employees
so with the descriptive analytics of
course all the HR having Survey
scorecards benchmarks of metrics but
they're not doing anything on the car
in prediction side so how can we how can
we improve that right that's a question
what is normally measured by the HR so
employee engagement of one's reading
retention Hippos applying whatever plus
an employee with their plans
bla bla bla bla but but one of the most
important factors that can decide
whether the company is government
whether employees go to be retained by
the company or not or if the person but
then the person would leave or not
I think level expertise and greatness of
the job are the most important
contributing factors what can imagine by
effective analytics recruitment
retention so you ever heard of a company
called Milan Garcia I used to work at
her company and what they've done is
that with the resume II just to the
resume if they can figure out when the
person is selected not algorithmically
so even without interviewing the the the
candidate he could figure out whether he
that the risk of leaving the car so he's
the one you want for this post or not
then organization effectiveness
performance in Korea management training
of the benefits and workforce it's a
critical area for predictive analysis
turnover Wadley that's really quite big
future turnover in business units in
specific functions geographies by
looking cocktails which is come a time
times its last will change and
performance target resolution
find out a high-risk offshore in the
future and focus attention activities on
very very few surface which I think are
critical the risk profile of candidates
with high risk of leaving premature
early or they're performing below and
try to figure out a pattern that can
give you some that can give some some
understanding on it
oops sorry I'm telling focussing so what
could be the new set of employees what
what what they were doing so basically
can figure out what would be our new a
set of skills in the company based on
the talent so that's that we don't hire
that's that's amazing if we can do that
keeping a matrix life even when it has
no clear business reason for being is
one of the common HR mistakes that we
want to avoid so so that the business is
very dynamic it changes quite strongly
and and and it it basically needs a lot
of understanding of what is changing
around in your business and that's where
you need to keep a metric static or
dynamic based on let's usability within
the organization all relying on just few
metrics that's again a problem insisting
on 100 person a creditor before an
analyst is accepted which is never
possible what so your data whatever you
have is what you have so important is
that we use make use of the data to care
to a better level
assessing implies only on simple
measures such as grades and test scores
which is again mistake and using
analytics to higher level people but not
when assessing seeing imagine so this
company in in in in in the Bay Area my
father they figured out the attrition
based on the on the lunch timing of an
employee and what time does he go for
lunch and they could figure that out
that people in this particular timeframe
normally leave the company earlier well
analyzing achai efficiency metrics only
is another problem so creating analytics
is a game-changer well and of course the
value of a value increase of point one
increase in employee
and can relate to a good drop in the
attrition for example let's see this one
at Best Buy for example the value is
more than hundred thousand the stores
and an operating income that's that's
huge if we can increase employees
engagement by 0.1 percent at $100,000
that's that's pretty huge right what's
next okay print amenities as a game
cleaner is the same thing we can figure
out why because mica means for your job
candidates with Stella came across from
this Cisco sparked a TMP in Google have
established wanted - is that he wants to
the ability to take initiative is a far
better predictor of high performance on
the job so basically they don't really
really look for the candidates with
stellar cards rather delicate Kansas
rates whom they fit are whom the fit is
better better better candidate for the
for the for the you know for the the
charm based on the discussions we've had
Oracle has done a lot of HR analytics
implementation at their side and they
are driving the Google global policies
by asking their customers and by looking
at the surveys there within the
organization so a sprint
they've also be able to tell that who I
would leave the company you know in the
relatively short time so all your
nominees have got from a statement I'd
want so information million percent
revenue growth and personal headcount
their revenue and income details for
past areas so he should identify the
correlation coefficient which is novel
data and proneness calcloud simple given
the remaining growth is estimated it
takes person of the year we can predict
the headcount growth absolutely now
imagine a defense 20 min versus his
education purification blah blah blah
blah he won't survive mutually exclusive
variables which affect hiring
effectively so he is in fact versus you
can easily do that which makes this
factors can be identified so that means
college and gender does not have
a combined effect on the hiring so
another problem can design team is
interested in how variables such as
entrance test scored the company and
preceding the institution in fact
selection when you can figure out what
is the final output and and and you can
put up a lawsuit period kind of a model
you see that again assessing the problem
so so first thing is the key to success
will be developer culture of data-driven
decision making which would make your
make you take more informed decisions
there's transparency of business and
workforce information that's pretty much
what we know and power line leaders not
just HR and led that's pre that's pretty
large granny because and this honest
action right from pilot we did that we
did a certain organization and analysis
journey has to keep on using analytics
that's it so we're done with the slides
now it's time for you to ask the
questions so for the one who are they
questions and I could not answer please
put your questions again and we have to
answer those questions okay it seems
wise consumer we have not key here isn't
that the basis of all analytics yes of
course that's that's true but in terms
of I honor to focus on HR Alex ok
consumer Vemma does not really impact my
HRM etics I am working in Java from six
years can I start with yes of course you
can suddenly it is is it a good
initiative what is it yeah of course you
can travel in a science position
certainly so basically we covered a lot
of lot of domains recover stock market
we cover H I and X recover cement you
know the concrete strength prediction we
also do a lot of theft
analytics risk analytics so because
rough surface lot of going up sorry
yes our invitin can be used for
correction the questions was Andy Pandy
and and it was on the command room I
answered before sleep questions let me
read from the list and a half the book
that you need is elements of statistical
learning my shredder and Rob nice
question guys question I'm waiting for
the questions no this this analytics are
not is not possible because many times
you will have to deal with unstructured
data which can't be process in Excel
plus if you want to build up model which
is a bit complex for not just a linear
model Excel doesn't help right
any more questions I mentioned the book
named elements of status code loving by
Rob - sure honey
ok can cost of hibernation - compared to
of prediction Rises - well we know the
cost of fire and we can find out the
retention we can find out who are more
probable to leave and then we can come
with a metric that could be helpful but
not this ratio itself because we know
the ratio how rabble is the higher level
is the exit interview reason as many
people well well well to be honest
there's there's no such idea which gives
you a clear indication but what if
there's a common pattern in an exit
interview where people use the similar
pretty much unknown known measure right
I mean people talk about okay the
composition is low so that's one
analytics but that's not pretty one
rings just that it's just that it's such
a simple descriptive analytics which
software are you using for a design
schools are using R and Python
mount and Hadoop for them but mounted oh
they're only for one session patent is
for one session I get 4x analytics rest
is pure pure our new equations right so
that is that is so now we can I can
relate to the person who has left his
background is his demographics to the
conversation and while you hide up some
person is similar background you can
pretty much figure out that this guy is
not very happy with the salary itself
that's where it becomes different so
different focusing prediction pretty
good question simple in focusing we use
the values of for last month to predict
the next month in prediction we don't do
that what I mean say is for example you
want to figure out figure out the stock
prices so you can use the value of the
last day on this talk and even even for
the last seven days to put the value for
for the coming day that's forecasting
but in printing you don't use one of the
previous values of the output variable
as input to get the final output how did
you read it we haven't fit the model
values cross this cross validation we do
a lot of cross validation okay not
really necessarily programming knowledge
of is not required okay we can we get
the exercises it's part of the course
know so we don't have course for a
chance specifically this was of ever not
for richer analytics so if someone wants
f7 from the HR side wants from the
standard he needs to go through your she
needs to go through the the generated a
science course Janet sense for all the
domains and then applied effectively for
their own domain okay thank you so much
for joining in I hope there are no
questions
so thanks so much for joining in I'll
see you from next time with a different
thank you so much bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
