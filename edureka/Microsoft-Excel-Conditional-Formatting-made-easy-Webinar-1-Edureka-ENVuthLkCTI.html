question now if I have to you know
extend this calculation to the next few
columns I will have to you know like you
know I cannot work them awake now so I
mean it's not very easy for me to do it
however if I do it the way I did earlier
I will simply just drag it towards my
right and once this is done I will
simply perform a simple Mouse double
click that's it okay so Siddhartha you
okay with this did you get the point
if I drag downwards first it's not
really easy for me to do the other
calculations but if I drag it towards my
right first I can enjoy that this
feature called double click all I need
to do is make sure that the first
complete row is selected and then just
double click OK thank you sit down for
the acknowledgement and all right French
that's it so that was about referencing
I think we can now move to conditional
formatting so let's move to the next
sheet in this training file
Prakash Mori says the voice is not clear
below Beechworth OS says the wash is not
clear
I'm sorry friends I'm not sure what the
what is exactly the problem but I am
sitting in the office there is nice
connectivity here and others friends can
you just tell me are you guys able to
hear me properly oh my gosh ok if you
are saying it is reputation of voice or
if you are saying there is an echo then
I think there is a problem with the
internet at your site and I've gone
getting some responses from people
saying that I'm here Monica go up with
your Kumar dipti they are all saying
they are all saying I'm horrible very
clearly okay so the people from Olivier
and the other person I just mentioned
you will have to check something
somebody's saying awesome voice ok thank
you all right well I should pricing game
then rather than online training right
ok all right ok conference let's go to
the next worksheet let's just make sure
that we I mean you
this file we just have a couple of
worksheets okay so I can simply use the
mouse and I can click on the name of the
next chap however if I want to use a
keyboard shortcut then I can always use
ctrl page down okay in Excel if you want
to navigate from one sheet to another
its control page tab okay
and similarly its control page up if you
would like to come back to the earlier
sheet
remember friends control page term will
always take you to the next immediate
portion on the right side of your
existing sheet and control pitcher will
take left okay
yes Prakash there will be all these
sessions from my side so and then you
record team office team records all
these sessions so you can reach out to
the edu Rica a mail address and they
will send you the link for the recording
yes these sessions are recorded all
right okay all right so control base
jump in control paste I'm alright now
okay okay
somebody's talking about control D and
control well I just wanted to say here
that let's take an example I write down
something your leticia okay since you
release that point if I now place if I
now press control D definitely it does
coffee towards down however if i do a
control you
it does not copy towards upside that's
why i don't really prefer telling these
two shortcuts yes there is control and
similarly okay if I now okay I have the
fish I have the fish mentioned here
index check in this cell like you can
see myself clicking if I go on the right
side which is just the next cell and if
I press control yes it copies towards
the right side of ever if I now go to
the left hand side okay and if I press
control with only then see it comes up
with Oviedo like which is create table
Prakash
I can hear your question I can see your
question you are asking can I leave this
session because of the voice quality and
yes Prakash if it is problem for you if
you are not able to grasp then yes you
can leave the session I will not feel
offended no problem if it's a problem
there's a technical problem you can
leave the session no problem
okay coming back so the fish come are
you getting my point here I think
somebody's given an idea
Prakash you want to relocate I'm sorry
there is no questions coming up from
your side and more of chats happening
here so I might miss out your names
friends please don't feel bad about it
okay so point back to the vicious thing
it is well the dish this is saying that
driving towards left of dragging towards
up is not possible the dish I'm not sure
what you're going to say but if I have
some number or if I have some value or
whatever and if I drag it towards my
left hand side with my mouse it is
definitely possible in extent I'm not
sure what you're trying to say
similarly if I if I just drag it towards
my upside like using the mouse the way
we drag it downwards if I just use the
most fun drag it upwards I can do that
in Excel dragging towards left the only
challenge is you only challenges control
are you copy your value chose your next
right self-control evil threw it
downwards but control L will not copy
left words and control you will not do
it upwards until you stands for
underlining something and control L
stands for making a table and table is
another feature of Excel which we can
look at if you have okay okay there's a
message sister has come from a new
record tech support saying if you have
any issues pertaining one you are
according to your lingo instructor voice
try running the webinar again with the
same link okay okay all right the dish
thank you for the acknowledgement and
glad that I was able to share that with
you
great all right now friends let's come
to ctrl page down and let's
personal formatting okay now the very
first thing for features like
conditional formatting or validation you
need to select the data where you would
like to apply the formatting okay
in some features like Excel like sorting
filtering pivot reports on all these
features you don't really really it's
not mandatory for us to select the
editor okay for some of you it might be
a surprise but for things like charge
making charge
pivot reports sorting filtering you
don't really have to select the but for
conditional formatting you have to make
sure that you select the data in
question all right so right now friends
let's just come to the salary column you
all there on that sheet which is
conditional formatting and can you see
that there is a beta in that sheet okay
Prakash Maura has joined again and he
can hear now properly so that's
fantastic
thank you for the person who gave the
idea of alright which contains nine
columns and I want to apply conditional
formatting in the Sentry column the
first thing is a lot of times where when
I talk about selecting a lot of people
take the mouse directly they will just
scroll the mouse to follow and that's
the elixir selection is done well it is
absolutely correct but a slightly
smarter way of selecting the entire
column is you come to the very first
cell so in this case you know I'm coming
to the cell which is I four okay I have
four cell and I think forty seven
thousand five zero seven okay let's just
press three keys together which is ctrl
shift arrow down okay one more time you
select the first cell in your data and
your column
okay and ctrl shift around it frees Keys
together and you will be able to select
the whole column
control shift and arrow down big theme
okay it's ctrl shift and arrow so much
reason of communicating with shortcut is
it's a very handy shortcut whenever I
talk about selecting the row in my
online training sessions out of my
classroom sessions corporate college
whenever I say select the data people
have quickly take the mouse in their
hand and they simply select the given
data by rolling the mouse over your you
might have a very small rate of just 50
rolls 60 100 rows but in real life data
in official data wherever you guys are
working you may have good details like
maybe four thousand rules to those rules
so in such a case it is not feasible to
select it using the mouse that's why I
said let's use control shift John okay
control shift and arrow down it's not
the page time Shalaka I think you are
doing page down it's ctrl shift and down
arrow all right now after the selection
is done I will go to the Home tab in my
Excel ribbon okay I'm sure you can see
where my circles are blinking and right
now I am using the Excel 13 version but
it's the same thing for seven excels
excel 2007 and alright so I go to this
command here which is conditional
formatting which is inside of the Styles
group in the Home tab in the conditional
formatting here I have a very very first
feature is highlight cells rules can you
all see that yeah so when you see
highlight cells rules there are some
more options that come in front of us
like greater than less than between
equal to right let's just go let's just
go with one of them right now
so I will go with greater than alright I
go with greater then and small dialog
box comes up in front of me now let's
take an example I want to color to all
the cells which are above 30,000 just an
example okay so I will put the value
40,000 3-0 see you know 0 0 all right
and then right next to the right next to
this window there is an option
it says light red fill with dark red
text I hope you can see my circles
linking if I am ok with this color I can
simply press ok all right which I will
do right now ok I
okay all right and check it out guys
look at the eye column of my data and
now you will see that all the values in
that column which are above 30,000 have
got that light red fill with dark red
text can you all see this okay I'm sure
this was a very basic thing so you guys
have understood but if somebody has not
please feel free to write down that in
the question box down there all right
now if I want to remove the formatting
which is applied in one particular
column I will go to the perspective
column again so I will again select the
entire column I go to conditional
formatting again and in the Home tab and
your second last option is clear rules
okay then further I have two more
options
it says clear rules from the selected
cells and clear rules from the entire
sheet well if I select the second option
any other conditional formatting if it
is applied in other columns in the same
sheet right now I know that I have
selected that I call them and I only
want to remove formatting from that so I
will be there so I say clear rules from
the selected cells as soon as I do that
I get back to my normal enough without
the color all right now friends I will
do it one more time so there is time I
want to do something different I will
again select the data which is control
shift around okay I go to highlight
cells rules okay under conditional
formatting and then again now okay last
time I choose the option of greater then
similarly I can also go with less than
that's pretty simple look at the third
option there okay the third serve option
under the highlight cells rules window
is between okay so I choose between
right then a dialog box that says
between comes up okay let's take an
example that I want to highlight all the
values between 50,000 to 75,000 just an
example okay so I'd like 50,000 here I'm
inside 75,000 EUR and this time let's
not go with the default color that
Microsoft Excel is suggesting us let's
just go down to the prop
and I will choose the thing that says
okay let's go to custom format your
French can you see this in the drop-down
have got various colors to choose from
okay so I go here and I choose custom
format alright I go with custom format
and a window by the name format cells'
opens up I'm sure you all have seen this
will do when we perform well right-click
on any Excel cell right click on format
cells okay it's the cells in the format
cells will do I will choose the tab
number four which is filled okay and
within the film opens up like an Asian
Paints marketing thing I can just choose
any one color of night let's go blue
okay and then I say okay from your room
down I say okay from that small dialog
box of so and that's it so now I can see
that the values between 50,000 and
75,000 are you guys with me so far on
this okay Rajat Sethi has asked a
question but before I answer that
question I will just just people okay
great thank you so much pens okay slice
through purge the locker room is Prabhu
Siddharth
alright thank you so much great okay
now friends let's look at okay please
don't type anymore friends just wait for
a minute because if you type more of
course if you have questions please type
okay right now okay how do I apply
greater then less then between all the
three things in the same data this is
the question and asked by us by somebody
right now but yes we alumina and silica
please hold on to your questions I will
just answer the question asked by my
results okay so let's again come back
here
so now friends last okay so let's let's
just remove this formatting okay last
time I selected the entire column
and then I went to conditional
formatting and clear rules and I chose
clear rules from the selected columns
okay now okay
Shalaka and Rajveer Singh list just made
known to your questions please okay let
me answer ratchets question first
all right ratchets question is how do I
apply more than less than between the
same column okay so first of all let's
just come down now this time friends I
am coming to an external senses okay can
you see I am in the K column which is
not really a part of my data I selected
any one cell of my choice in the K
column I go to conditional formatting I
go to clear rules and this time I will
go to clear rules from the entire
worksheet okay as soon as I do that I
will see that the formatting is gone
okay so that was just another way of
showing it how do they move okay now
project let's take an example here all
the salary values between 0 to 25,000 I
want to put them in let us take an
example yellow color okay
or maybe red color because they are very
okay okay then
25,000 the one to 50,000 I want to make
it as yellow and anything above 15,000 I
want to make it great something like
this okay so let's just select the whole
data again alright control shift down is
the shortcut shortcut for selecting I go
with Home tab conditional formatting I
will go with highlight cells rules and
these three options Rajan's these three
options I will have to use one by one
okay
in fact I can use so let's say I will go
with greater then okay I will say
greater than 10,000 okay so my mind my
requirement was my requirement was 0 new
25,000 so I will say between okay and I
could see low here
I put 25,000 here 25,000 okay and the
color I said I would like to go with red
color so I say red here okay it's not
good to use the red color in an email
but here it is okay
okay so I say okay okay I come out
Dana will do conditional formatting
keeping the column selected again I go
with between this standard say 25,000 1
to 15,000 I want to make it as let's go
with yellow okay so yellow and yellow
okay I say okay and then I say okay
again alright and again keeping the
column selected I will say conditional
formatting highlight cell students again
I go with this time I will not move it
between I will go with the option that
says greater than because any value
greater than 15,000 and one I want to
make it green correct so now I will not
bother about between I will go to
greater than and I say green from here
in the format cells window so whatever
this have chosen three different colors
for three different categories so I hope
that so I hope result that question is
answered okay yes obviously yes the
conditional formatting is a feature
which is kind of dynamic in nature for
example can you see this lady here 89
network or they seem doing okay the 89
my code okay let's just see that you
heard Celebi right now is about 15,000
if I am now because 86,000 244 okay so
it is green in color if I reduce that to
45,000 please look at the screen fence
another question asked by reg of this if
I change the values with the covers
automatically change the answer is yes
and for that please look at the screen I
am changing the salary value of AZ muin
enter and I can see that it comes down
to yellow it comes down to yellow so yes
it just change dynamically because you
have already now let's come to Rajveer
Singh this question okay
Kumar was telling about multiple
conditions but we've just taken that
okay before Rushfield I will go with
Shailaja a smalls question which was
asked at 9:29 shall acosta is anything
for text data of course yes
Shalaka let's go to the location column
right now
the G column in my data okay I will
select control shift down I will select
the whole column I go to conditional
formatting
I go to highlight cells rules again and
here I have an option just at number 4
and number 5 I have two wonderful
options and they are equal to and text
that contains so let's go with equal to
okay I go with equal to I will like
Columbo quilombos the capital of Sweden
Rock wonderful place nice Holly latest
destination and okay I go with custom
format I will go with green for example
okay so all Columbo I want to clean and
I say okay and I say okay and that's it
now check it out French the entire
location column you can see wherever
there is code um boo I can see that they
are in green color yeah okay that is
both : boy your hat employ code number
73 there's another Columbo at 79 Stephen
Fleming and there is here not D'Cruz at
Colombo gate so can you see that they
are all green so yes it's applicable for
text also okay alright okay let me just
say a share just a minute okay friends
just I'm just going to read all the
questions okay there was a question
asked by Raj being saying pissed saying
can we do this for the entire sheet
which means highlighting the entire row
the entire row yes not V we can do that
but we will keep it at the last right
now I am only talking about columns so
much me please ask me this question at
the end of the session in some time from
now okay all right okay okay
Saddam's Grover wants to know on the
first and last value between option
considered in the condition when sit
down if you are saying that you would
like to get yellow color for 25,000 and
above then you have to make sure that
you go to the between between between
the window and then you will take 25,000
one 250
so yes both these numbers are computers
account ok vishwaroop a pool on is also
asking the same question that was asked
by somebody else so I'm adding you
something which we will do a bit later
ok all right ok thank you for the
acknowledgement ok great
ok now friends other Kumar wants to know
ok just like somebody had asked me about
date
sorry text now a victim Kumar wants to
know about dates of course yes we can do
it for dates also so I will I can come
here control shift down I will select
the entire date column I go with
conditional formatting and I have this
highlight cells rules again and here
there is an option that says date
occurring yeah if you click on date
occurring you will see that there are
options like yesterday today tomorrow
like next week last week yeah now these
features I will not talk in details
right now because these are different
for different versions some of you might
be using the Excel 2007 version and you
might not have all the things here so
the dates I think we will stop here only
because foreign dates this the they've
changed a lot okay all right yes Victor
come on we can do the independent
greater-than less-than comparison but I
think for that we will have to discuss
that with a later session I have another
request here from some pretty
krishnakumar the other saying request
can we do the questionnaire in the last
ok Krishna that's fine okay that's fine
I am okay now friends that's all so just
look at something else here so again you
know I will come back over this I will
because I have multiple formattings in
multiple columns right now so I will go
to formatting before that before that
let's just select this enemy column
right now okay and I will go to
conditional formatting again I will go
to the last option here inside
formatting which is manners rules okay
so let me go to the manage rules option
now and then you will notice that what
rule has been applied yeah if you can
see on my screen right now it says I
mean this window opened up right now it
says conditional formatting rules
manager then I can clearly see that
above 50,000 is being given green color
also it tells me that this applies to
what data in my sheet okay and from here
I can also delete the rule if I want to
clear rules method I can also edit the
rule if I if somebody comes up to me and
says those values should be changed
right so I can see in the manage rules
section I can see that you know what
rule has been applied okay so even if I
apply some formatting and if I forget
after a couple of days I can still come
back to manage rules and I can figure
out myself
alright now friends let's disclose this
formatting the rules will go the
managers will go I will go out I will
save conditional formatting I will say
clear rule so that is a clear rules from
the worksheet
okay now I will just select this now
let's take an example here my boss comes
up to me and says breach you've got this
data here 100 the people's data hundred
employees 100 different Sandra values I
would like to highlight only the top 50
in the sandra values the top 50 in
salary values i would like to highlight
okay so I will come over I will select
the entire data okay
control shift down I will also go to now
formatting your I have the option that
says top/bottom rules okay just below
highlight cells rules I have this second
option that says top/bottom rules okay
now if you go further into the
top/bottom rules you will see options
like top 10 bottom 10 above average
below average and stuff like that okay
my requirement was top 17 or top 15
correct the option that I can see is 4
then only now here's a problem my boss
wants to highlight only the top ten so
what we can do is I can still select the
option that's available to me so the
option of top 10 items is available at
my disposal I will go then and when that
small dialog box opens up with says top
10 items your your when I see it is
mentioned as 10 I can quickly change it
to 17 and of course I can choose the
color of my choice
and I can say ok and you will notice at
top 17 sell any values in my data so
it's not the rule that you have to
always go with drop 10 you can always go
with top 17 whatever same goes for same
goes for bottom okay above average
if you select above average option which
is available at that window you will
Excel will automatically calculate the
average of all these hundred values and
whatever values are above 100 average
will be okay now come let's come to that
question caused by somebody else and to
three times I have seen that question
being asked is it possible to perform
conditional formatting row wise yeah
yes definitely right now okay friends so
far what we have done this formatting
within the same column now what I want
to do is depending on my requirement the
entire row in that data should be
highlighted that's what my requirement
is right now did you guys get my point
here yeah so for example I want to know
okay do you see in my sheet in my excel
sheet there is this L tube cell number L
to which I have already colored yellow
can you see that okay
I knew that lot of people will ask the
question about your entire data
formatting like row wise for nothing
okay so I have already made myself so
you see there's a yellow cell which I
have ready now what I want to do is if I
type any city name here or any location
name here let's go to Euston okay and I
press Enter what I would like to happen
is anywhere in their data if there is
Houston in the location column that is G
column
I want the entire row of that employee
to be highlighted so for example if I
that Ustinov the yellow box this entire
first row first row in the data should
be highlighted that's what I want to do
next if I come back to that yellow box
again and in place of Houston if I make
Mumbai okay just come here if I make
Mumbai whatever any other location then
I want the entire row of Mumbai to be
highlighted and the highlight from
Houston should be taken off I know is
getting my point friends did you guys
get my requirement that was the question
asked by people but the others did you
get the question mister OOP did you get
the question because is that what you're
looking for perfect
okay others did you get my question okay
okay yeah Costner and Prakash Marie okay
I will repeat the question my
requirement here is and that's the
question was that some of the people
here might wanna take your is if if I
type anything and let's take an example
any location name any city name in this
yellow box the L do LLL know box for
example right now I have time to Mumbai
there if I type any location name there
what I would like to happen in the data
is the entire row which contains the
location s Mumbai should be highlighted
then then I come here and then I change
it from Mumbai to for example Perth's
okay another beautiful custody then I
want the entire row of this birth to be
in yellow color or green color or
whatever color I want to put so
depending on the value which I am typing
in the L to sell the entire row should
get highlighted okay let's do it all
right first of all friends because we
are applying this formatting in the
entire data
let's make sure that we select the
entire editor okay so I will come here
okay and I will do let's just let's take
an example I come to my cell number
a4 where I have the first employee cool
okay so I go with my cell number a4 and
I will perform the control age okay
controlling a is the shortcut for
selecting the entire data so you guys
can also do along with me come to over
to the employ go to cell sorry the first
cell I mean my code number one which is
a four and do a control a a for Apple
control a it selects all the data for
you
all right now let's go to conditional
formatting right within the conditional
formatting let's go to the option here
which is number three from bottom it
says new rule yeah
again I repeat select the entire data by
pressing ctrl K okay in my case what
I've done is I've kept my cursor in cell
number a4 and then I did control gain I
chose the whole date I went to
formatting I've got the new rule and
then within the new now there's a new so
when I click on new rule
a dialog box opens up and you window
opens up that says new formatting rule
okay now within this new formatting rule
window okay do you see in the extreme
bottom at the extreme what a blast there
is an option that says use of formula to
determine which cells to format right so
I will go to that option right below
that I get an option here which says
format values where this formula is true
okay can you see the place where my
circle is blinking yeah that's the point
which I would like to highlight right so
I will say use the formula to determine
which cells to format and then down
below I will let make sure that my
cursor blinker now I will go to that
yellow cell and I will click on that
yellow cell select that yellow cell
quickly in that formula bar in the new
formatting rule window I see that the L
2 comes up L 2 is nothing but the left
of that yellow cell then I will say
equal to now our requirement was we are
doing this with respect to the location
correct the yellow cell is meant for
typing the location so I will go to the
location column okay and I will select
the first cell which is Houston
Houston is not really important for us
it's the jiwa the g4 cell that's
important for us because when I selected
my whole data by doing control a you
guys must must be remembering that I had
kept my cursor on the a4 cell right so
because I had kept my cursor in the a4
cell now it is important for me to
correspondingly select the location of
that a four cell so it's Houston that's
why I'm coming to g4 okay if I would
have kept my cursor in maybe my code
number three while doing the control a
thing then right now I would have gone
to the cell which contains first which
is g6 yeah so it's the corresponding
location that you will select of the of
the cell which was chosen before we
control a alright now when I select the
g4 cell you will notice that there is a
dollar for G and there's another force
or now we will need to do something
about this just like the way we did in
the referencing sheet I will have to
make sure that I have removed the dollar
which is meant for the phone number Rho
and I will make sure that the dollar
remains only for G because in this case
we are we are interested in keeping the
column G constant column G is the place
where all the locations have been
delivered to be so anything that is
typed in the yellow cell has to be
compared with the value in the G column
that's why I want to make the G column
constant not the rule number four and
that's why like we have done earlier I
will now press function four
function for choice and I make sure that
the dollar is only kept with G and up
with for now I will go down here in the
format thing there's a small option the
small rectangular bottom at the bottom
this is format okay I will go to format
I click on format with the mouse and the
format cells window opens up in the
format cells window I have the last step
which is film and with them Phil I will
go with let's take an example yellow
color just an example any color can be
taken I go with yellow and I say okay
and I say okay from here also in that
new formatting rule window alright and
now i come here i type in that yellow
box
can you guys notice and all the rows
which contain birds are now highlighted
check it out i will just scroll down the
sheet for you and you can notice that
there are various employees imports like
employ code number three then there is
my code number of 22 the chen there is
50160 all the employees at work are now
highlighted now i go back to that yellow
cell i will delete that first value I
will type Mumbai your mu mvj I enter now
if I go down at the bottom here you will
notice that the my code number
21:43 61
all of them are now highlighted because
mumbai is their location sir of 97
number there 91 number there so now
whisper hoop hula is asking the question
it is is it case sensitive did they also
has a question but before I go to the
police question I will answer mr. Luke's
question whisper rube Excel is not case
sensitive so for example now look at the
screen especially for whisper loop I am
typing London now but look at the way of
typing it purposely
I am typing small and L uppercase o
small n haha uppercase D small o and
and so I'm not changing the spelling I
am just altering the case now when I
press ENTER do you see this group that
all the employees in London are now
highlighted Lucy seed number four my
core number eight my core then number 19
yeah so whisper Rubik's L is not
case-sensitive but yes Excel is very
much spelling sensitive okay guys I will
give it me so for you to get this point
yeah the day I am coming to you but
close are you okay with me so far the
entire row think okay Krishna Kumar says
yes the three says yes
good going the Shalako says good going
Praveen Marathi okay thank you okay
alright okay great
okay now let's just look at the other
question okay okay okay okay
so before I go to this question and
friends please one minute there was a
question asked by the fee just a minute
the okay I think she wanted to ask about
okay multiple selections here and I
think the same question was then asked
by a Raj feel safe list saying how do we
do this for multiple selections like the
way we do it for n to sell yes Raj mean
I will come the theater will you have
the same question I understand one
minute one minute okay Prabhu Prabhu
step two the one says can you show the
formula will do one more time oh right
before I go to the tea and other person
let's go with the caboose question okay
friends there are three more than 300
people are ending this session so I am
getting it's like a radio jockey I am
getting requests from many people who
play all the songs but I
all right okay all right so I will
select the whole date that I will go to
conditional formatting I go to manage
rules and okay the one in the yellow the
one in yellow is the one which is my
formula I go to edit rule now and that
is my formula window sir was the
question one
sorry yeah okay okay I'm sorry I'm
really bad with names Friendster okay
all right great
okay now let's come to the T and the
other other gentleman's question how do
we do this so first of all let me just
delete this okay I don't want any
confusion in my in the rule which I'm
applying now so I just remove the rule
okay
now friends I will do it for multiple
locations so let's take an example here
okay before that have you guys okay with
this
so for whatever you guys will give it
this is at least I am pronouncing
pronouncing the names correctly so
multiple conditions basically okay let's
take an example that the k2 say okay in
the k2 cell let's let's make that yellow
okay and let's make this cell whatever
oh I think I do placate the okay one is
yellow one is blue now okay this case L
the k2 cell is meant to type the name of
the department okay so I will just write
down department here just an example and
the blue cell which is l2 is meant to
type the designation right what I want
to do is
along with so right now I have sales
okay what I want to happen is okay then
yeah so in the I was interested in the
location and is also at managerial
designation I'm not okay if my ex is
highlighting any other resolution and
say it's okay that's my that's my
okay let's just do it the moment so I
select the entire data again French
please observe this I am doing the
selection on the cell number
a5 right now which is the my code to
write so control a yeah let me repeat
last time I had chosen the one number my
port which is K 4 and then ahead corner
and with control a this time it's
control a and after doing the f5
selection know the please there is no
specific reason for that I mean there is
a reason for that there is a reason for
that that I will come to in the next one
minute so purposely I am actually you
can select actually you can select any
cell of your choice in the data okay but
last time I had chosen one no I'm going
with you and then control a now I go
with conditional formatting I go with
new rule okay
within the new rule I will again go with
the last option that says use the
formula to determine which has to format
I come down in that window which says
format values so I am tapping my formula
there now this time friends remember
this is a condition of and
those of you from the engineering
background or really technical
background will quickly realize what I'm
saying this is a case for and it's not a
case of oh okay
yeah I want to fulfill that the person
is from the sales department and the
designation is manager okay so that's
why I will start off with and the
formula here equal to and okay I hope
you guys can see my video where I'm
typing the formula in the new formatting
rule will do I say equal to and okay now
last time I had taken the reference of
those cells so I will go with K 2 K 2
should be equal to what K 2 cell is
meant for Department that is why I will
come in the department column and I will
select the cell that says of the search
now now some of you will ask me a
question saying a breach you are
interested in the sales department and
sales so why are you selecting something
else
it's not about selecting the something
else the reason I am selecting the e5
cell right now is because when I
performed the control a I had selected
the cell a5 so the cell in the employer
column was a 5 and that's why I'm now I
am selecting the corresponding cell in
the department color so that's why the P
now I think you must have realized why
did I purposely selector my code number
2 this time before doing that only okay
so because I'm taking to my bought
number 2 I am selecting that person's
department ok also friends please take
kept a keep a tab on the formula we do
the other is there with E as well as
with 4 so I will press f4 f4 tries to
make sure that the a column remains
constant freezing them equal um not the
rule number 5 comma comma I will now
take the reference of this manager cell
okay then equal to again I will come to
the corresponding designation of the
employed work number two which is
officer now although I am looking for
the designation manager in my actual
requirement like it now to create the
formula I am choosing of the cell
because that's the corresponding
designation of the employ code number
truth did you guys get my point okay
okay Roger you see yes removing of the
dollar can be done anyhow you can either
press f2 and then remove dollar sign by
pressing backspace or delete or you can
keep pressing the function f for that's
your choice
I think f4 is more easy all right
okay that's it so I close the bracket
now okay
so I've given that formula there it says
k2 should be equal to e files and lq
should be equal to f5 I have given the
formula there again I will go at the
bottom where I have that format
rectangle I will choose the color let's
go with let's go with the green all
right all right I say green ok and then
ok again and ok so I think I think I
have made some mistake here and that is
why the sales and manager is not getting
highlighted in spite of writing
department as sales and designation I am
NOT getting the oops oops oops oops ayah
I forgot to do the f4 thing friends yes
thank you Roger
thank you so much yeah I forgot to do
yesterday ah yes I got your wine for
instance then yes for thing yeah so no
problem I'll read one more time so just
clear the un's ok one more time I go
with my code number three this time
control a
mr. formatting I will go with new rule I
will go with you score formula okay
equal to and I will say yellow cell that
is k2 should be equivalence to this time
it is going to be Department admin and
f4 f4 to make the key column constant
yes Siddarth last time I had forgotten
to make the designation : constant that
is pressing of the f4 twice I had missed
out so manager that is l2 I will select
equal to I will take the reference of
the designation of the number three
which is supervisor in this case f6 f4
f4 I will do it twice before I forget
yeah so what I'm doing is I'm making the
F column constant and then I go with
just a minute
one okay great yeah thank you sir
yes thank you so now guys can you see
shall lock us down with all of you can
you see now that the e column is made
constant the F is also made constant
now it's done I will now format let's go
with green though the room does not know
and that's it the road doesn't have to
be constant here is the column that
needs to be picked on that's it I got it
you see sales is mentioned in the yellow
cell and manager is mentioned in the
designation cell and I can see that my
pod number one which is George Bailey
Australian relegated by the way number
nine Nathan Lyon again Australian
cricketer so these guys were sales
managers are now highlighted thank you
the three for the acknowledgement French
I okay with me
so when I okay with me especially those
people who are interested in knowing
about the multiple conditions
I hope given behind I guess with me oh
this Roger you saying thank you okay
all right so that's how you can apply
formatting in Excel conditional
formatting in this session we have just
completed some of the topics it's
already five minutes past 10:00 but let
me tell you that right now we have done
and we can also do all okay
we are used and what we can use or
example would be I want to highlight any
employee who is either in management
designation or officer designation could
be manager or officer I want him to be
highlighted this is gonna be a case of
or okay somebody is now asking me about
okay there are two questions coming up
Roger said he wants to know how do we
use icon sets okay I will I will change
Excel about that and the P wants to know
can I get recordings of the previous
sessions yes the theme for recordings
I'm not sure about the previous sessions
I'm not sure if you registered so that
is something you will have to check out
with the ED you rig a support team okay
okay so Roger let's look at the use of
icon sets so I come here okay let's go
with salary alright I'll show you an
example I select the entire salary
column conditional formatting within
formatting at number five I have this
wonderful feature called icon sets now
this is only the purpose of doing icon
sets is only for highlighting purpose
just in case you want to know the
difference between the given data like
you know illustration purpose so I go to
icon sets like Richard has asked for and
I will choose okay with trends should I
choose should I go with the signal one
let's go with this option here like a
Wi-Fi network bar or a mobile phone
signal bar yeah the icon that says like
a mobile phone signal so I choose that
okay I select that and that's it check
it out
look at my selfie Gollum friends okay if
you guys want I will do a sort thing
your weekly just give me one quick
minute here okay great do you see the
person on top which who has got the
lowest selfie has got absolutely no
network bars correct if you go down down
down down down you will see that the
network bars are increasing depending on
the value contained in the cell so what
Excel does is it divides the entire
range into into five categories and it
gives the icon sets because we chose the
icon sets with five different icons yes
you are right
lowest salary has got no network
absolutely and the highest salary has
got a lot of network bar see if you come
down at the bottom and employee with and
by with code number 34 Evelyn young team
leader from methylene she's got a salary
of 95,000 so she's got the maximum
amount network bars and similarly the
others in that range so Excel just uses
the icons depending on the figure
Prabhu you cannot apply a formula in the
icon sets but you can customize the icon
sets as per your requirement so you
might want to do something like anybody
with a salary of zero to twenty five
thousand has to have no network bars
then 25 to 35 s has to have one network
bar and then further to so you can
customize as per your requirement and
that can be done again let's select the
entire column let's go to the Home tab
and let's go to conditional formatting
and in the manage rules you can go to
option that says edit rule and then from
here you can make the changes it's right
here see you can always make the changes
here you can decide yeah
just change the type to number from your
and great okay thank you Prabhu that was
going to be your next question so yes I
have answered that all right I just
delete these rules now alright friends
do you see in my Excel ribbon again if
you look at my Excel ribbon that what
one home share here I've got just next
to my home tab do you see there's a tab
that says ambarish can you all see this
friends yeah obviously if you go to your
own excel sheets you will not have that
tab correct okay so anybody who wants to
know more about that next session so I
will cover the customizing of the ribbon
and customizing of the quick access
toolbar and some of the some of the
really useful stuff some of the really
useful stuff in that session so you can
customize your ribbon according to your
requirement okay krishna kumari although
