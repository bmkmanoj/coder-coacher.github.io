welcome to the series of introductory
reviews on ServiceNow from Ed Eureka in
this video we are going to cover basics
of ServiceNow in the perspective of
service now as a ticketing tool or and
help this platform now before we start I
want to start by saying that ServiceNow
is not anymore used as a tool or a mere
tool but it's rather an enhanced a
full-fledged
application platform that actually
started its journey being a simple
ticketing tool now when we say ticketing
the usage of this word ticketing tool is
something of the past and henceforth
when I start this I would not be
referring to the word ticketing anymore
in this but I would be rather using the
more appropriate term which is incident
management in this case as incidents are
what technically it means when you use
the word ticket so rather than using the
word ticket we would from now onward use
the word incidents as incident is
something that technically takes care of
the process and the function of helpdesk
as the first year for customer support
now if you go into the agenda of
ServiceNow an incident management let's
go through what we are going to go
through in this detailed video so as
always we gonna talk about ServiceNow
and the platform which we have already
discussed about but touch about what
ServiceNow is what IT Service Management
RIT is amiss and how incident management
comes into the picture of ITSM and the
ITIL process what are the major steps in
incident management the various
participants are the roles in an
incident management process after which
we would be going through the
out-of-the-box incident management
application in ServiceNow which will
help us to understand in a general sense
through a demo how incident would be
going through various steps so as to
reach its finish so let's get started
as we all know ServiceNow is a platform
which has supported IT Service
Management for
many years and has built its horizon
into many other processes and in the
context of this video we would be going
into detail of the business process
namely the incident management and
ServiceNow was founded by Fred Lunney in
fact one of the interesting facts about
ServiceNow is that once at first this
platform was built by Fred Lodi the
simple use case he had used in
ServiceNow to showcase the power of the
platform was something that looked like
the incident management application
because incident management is something
that requires a workflow or a process in
order to move from one stage to another
stage and take it to the end or the
finish so there are many other systems
like ServiceNow which are currently
available market one of them being
remedy BMC remedy it's also one of the
biggest competitors of ServiceNow so
that being said about ServiceNow we are
just gonna touch about again something
that we talked about that is ServiceNow
as a path and what really differentiates
ServiceNow from other platforms so the
pass offering of ServiceNow has as part
of their cloud platform various aspects
such as analytics the incredible user
experience and the developer platform
which makes it a pass very easy to
deliver any kind of functionality or
customization across to the customer and
this is all on top built with the
mindset of security first so as you can
see security is something that is taught
in the initial stages of building the
platform itself not something that was
taken care as a later add-on so in
simple sense ServiceNow is a cloud
platform and it resides on the Internet
and not on your local computer now how
does ServiceNow fit into the IT Service
Management world IT Service Management
is a set of activity or process that an
organization follows as part of their
operations now some of the processes
that you would get aware of now and in
subsequent part of learning ServiceNow
our processes named as incident
management problem management change
management and release management now
what are these for
for as we know from the word service
management it's all about managing the
services so to manage the services as
part of the operations there are certain
processes that touch upon ensuring the
smooth operations of the services
now when I say service it could as well
be simple as ensuring that the very
laptop that the customer is using is
being supported through a particular
process which helps em to troubleshoot
or have a smooth usage so let me just
take you through on a high level of how
all the pieces of different process in
IT Service Management come into picture
and after that we will deep dive into
incident management as the process so if
you can imagine a particular
organization where in somebody who is
working on your laptop is facing an
issue know what would be the first
process of going ahead and resolving
such a issue now the person in context
who is facing the issue would be calling
up the help desk and would be telling
about the very issue that he is facing
it might be as simple as not being able
to start the computer or probably once
you open up the operating system has a
particular issue now all these kind of
issues can have two ways of getting it
resolved one is by ensuring that the
desktop gets functional at the very
easiest way by doing a temporary
workaround which although may not fix
the issue for a long term that might be
something that would help the customer
resolve the issue and get started with
his work now there might be another kind
of way that you can solve it that would
be more of a root cause fix that is by
finding the real reason why this
happened having an investigation and a
deep dive into it and then fixing the
root cause issue with it and that's
where the problem management comes into
picture now problem management as a case
would have the root cause which requires
to be fixed having a lot of different
changes that needs to be done on the
system that is currently running live
like for example let's imagine an IRC TZ
application are
a railway ticketing application a
railway ticketing application has an
issue that a customer reports to the
customer support the customer support
would be getting the issue reported by
the customer and the customer support
would log the incident as so and so it
could be the fact let's say for an
example the user in context is not able
to key in the dates of his travel which
is a big issue now the investigation
team would look into it and understand
there is a small fix that they can do
while on the run and for the longer run
they would need to do another fix which
would fix this problem once and for all
so that is where and you can understand
the immediate fix that the user is given
is something that happens through
incident management and the root cause
fix is something that happens to the
problem management and in simpler terms
change management and release management
are processes that comes along with
problem management normally in the best
practice world these are processes that
are again best practices there is no one
single way of doing these processes but
there is always a better practice of
following a simpler processes and
activities followed for this particular
module so in simple terms incident
management is defined as an event or any
kind of interruption which is unplanned
and that necessarily involves in the
reduction of the quality of a service
being delivered or in some weight being
deteriorated in terms of the quality so
incident management is the processes
that comes and handles any kind of
incident so it's basic and primary
motive is to restore the normal service
operation as soon as possible with a
workaround so if you're looking in the
world of incident management you would
be hearing the word workaround most
often the reason being workaround is
something that is done as a temporary
fix and that will help in Kuechly
restoring the services to its full or in
its capacity that the user can go ahead
and do what he was stuck at so it
basically minimizes the adverse effects
on the business going forward we would
now understand incident management as a
process in
detail where and we would know what are
the various steps involved in incident
management incident management as a
process if we are breaking it down has
very number of steps which will help to
understand how an incident comes and and
what part of the process does what
particular activity so that it comes to
an end as we all understand ServiceNow
is mostly a workflow based platform and
incident management is one of the
primary use cases that ServiceNow as a
platform started with and was able to
showcase a very effective usage of the
platform so let's try understanding
incident management and this incident
management is something that is
generically followed as a best practice
methodology this is not something that
every organization would handle or be
used in the consistent fashion it can be
tweaked in according to an
organizational need but an organization
would have an incident management
process in place which would mostly
follow a similar strategy that is a best
practice which is provided by the ITIL
process so the first part of incident
management is as you can see is detect
and record which we already talked about
that is a user faces a particular issue
and it is being recorded so the detect
and record would be the part of the
process where in a particular customer
calling up the customer support saying
he or she has a particular issue an
example of an issue could be as simple
as maybe the browser not connecting to
the Internet or it could be something
like the test of node opening up or in
many advanced cases there could be
Network issues inside organization which
would be reported against the
appropriate team so that is the first
part of the process this process detect
and rec incident management would have
the part of detect and record which
would necessarily take care of detecting
which is done by the customer or it
could as well be an automated detection
of a particular issue and that being
recorded into the application namely
incident management application once the
particular issue has been detected and
recorded the next step is to classify
and
prioritize know what does classify and
prioritize mean in general classify
means to more of categorize the kind of
incident that are the issue that comes
into the picture
now when particular customer talks about
a particular issue it would be related
to a particular entity it could be the
hardware system it could be the software
part and if you drill down more into
those aspects you can classify them more
appropriately so that it can very well
be taken and to the right team across
who would be handling it so in simple
cases if we're talking about somebody
saying there is a problem with Microsoft
Office
now when you classify such an issue you
would see the top tier of the
classification shown as software and in
the second tier there could be if in
simple terms you can talk about you can
see Microsoft Office but there could be
even more better prioritization done so
that it actually gets handled better in
bigger organizations so there could be
even a second tier of classification
called productivity because Microsoft
Office and many such tools could be
something that comes under the hub of
productivity so there could be different
ways an organization can decide to
classify a product so that could be one
part that incident management would take
care of in the part of classification
now it depends upon the urgency and the
impact of an issue that the incident
gets prioritized on the basis of now in
a huge organization there could be
issues that can vary from very urgent to
not so urgent issues now it is very
important for incident management
process to prioritize in such a way that
the organizational needs are taken care
up to the maximum so that the operations
do not feel the challenge of difficult
issues being taken care at a latter part
rather than being taken care at the
initial stage so prioritization helps in
ensuring the issues are prioritized in
the right way and for that we would be
going through in detail about something
called the priority metrics which is
going to come subsequently in this video
but
in simple terms prioritization is what
helps the incident management take
appropriate actions at the right time
now comes the next step in incident
management which is to investigate and
die agonize so from the very words
incident management as a process itself
is self-evident as an the investigation
part is to have the team who was looking
into the issue investigating and
understanding what is the issue and
diagnosing the particular part of the
issue so to diagnose so the part where
the issue is being recorded should have
enough details so that the team who's
working or investigating on the issue
has necessary detail so from this itself
you can understand the detect and record
part and the classify would really play
an important role in investigation
because investigation really relies upon
the information that is being created or
recorded or stored so that the team in
context can investigate it once it is
investigated and diagnosed it is the
next step of the team who is handling
the issue to resolve and restore the
service now the term resolution as I
mentioned before in incident management
is not necessarily something that is
done as a root cause fix it can be even
a cuke temporary workaround or a fix
done so that the user in context can go
ahead and do whatever the activity is
that is hindering him in going forward
in helping the business or the
organization so you need to understand
resolution and restoration is the part
we're in there's a cuke fix or a step
done by the investigating team to ensure
the user in context can go ahead with
his business as usual our BAU
so once the resolution is provided by
the team who's handling the issue the
incident closure is a part which can
even be reviewed by the customer in
context in many cases what happens is
although the issue is being resolved
customer would have some more
clarifications or sometimes even not
enough resolution being given for him to
be able to go for
so this is where the customer
acknowledgment comes into picture so
incident closure is something that would
wait until the customer acknowledges in
most cases this particular part of the
process is mostly automated and that
means when the ticket status moves to
something called as result the system
waits for a period of five to six days
and if it doesn't see any response or
any update from anybody on that it would
be automatically moved to closure so now
that we understand on a high level the
various steps and incident management
let's see a particular way in which are
the steps involved in step of incident
management the way the steps in incident
management involves as I said the
detection and recording of the incident
service request is that part of a
process which helps in ensuring there is
a smooth request system that will help
the user procure or fulfill a particular
activity or a thing it could be as
simple as a new employee joining a
company and the various initial aspects
that the user will have to take care of
now that we have understood on a high
level what are the different steps in
incident management let's go in a bit
more detail of what happens on every
different step involved in this process
so the initial step as we understood is
nothingbut detection or registering the
particular issue in hand in the terms of
an incident so the incident that comes
into the picture can as well be logged
by a person at the customer support end
who would be listening to the user who
is having the issue in context so the
helpdesk person would listen to the user
and log the incident according to the
details being mentioned by the user it
can very well be communicated across an
email and there are email inbound
systems which is a particular
functionality involved in ServiceNow
that helps in converting an email and
its details to an incident or it could
be as simple as a particular user
opening up the ServiceNow interface and
locking the ticket so once the
particular
incident is identified and registered we
would go into the next step which is
nothing but to classify our prioritize
the incident the classification of
incident can be in terms of the hardware
or the software are the underlying small
piece of network that is also
necessarily nothing but a hardware now
the way that organization decides to
categorize or classify a particular
incident is totally and this sole
discretion of the organization these are
all various simple best practices that
is being recommended across and every
organization would fine tune it to their
according needs and build it in such a
way that the process becomes smoother
and all the parties involved in the
process finds it easy to use so
categorizing or classifying the incident
is one part of the second step and
another major part of this step is what
we call the priority we discussed about
something called the impact and urgency
which decides upon the priority we would
be learning in detail on how a priority
matrix is built now the priority can be
something called critical high medium or
low depending upon the impact and
urgency so priority metrics basically is
something that is driven by the impact
and urgency a priority metrics is
dependent on the values that are
provided by the user or the customer
support end on understanding what is the
impact of the issue and what is the
urgency of the issue when we say impact
impact involves necessarily the amount
of users being affected it could be one
particular issue or it could be one
particular user in the context that is
having an impact in that case the impact
is not much high because it's just
particular user and it doesn't mean that
it doesn't have to be taken care of but
when there are incidents which are of
large number of users being affected the
impact of that particular issue becomes
higher and the urgency depends upon how
much business-critical that particular
issue has led to means so how much
urgent the incident requires to be
resolved depends upon how much of
business impact the particular issue has
now it's the combination of both these
things that decides the priority you can
see here that a priority metrics is
something that depends upon impact as we
mentioned about impact is nothing but
the number of users being affected and
the number of affected services and its
reputation urgency is the extent to
which the incident the solution can bear
delay that means how much of impact it
has on the business so now that we
understand about urgency and impact we
can understand that it's a combination
of urgency and impact that the priority
is which helps the service desk to
address the incident how much of a quick
they can it is to identify the required
times of actions sometimes that means to
be taken Ashville so a priority metrics
is something that would look something
that we show here this is something that
can be improvised for the company's own
needs right now there are only three
different levels being mentioned here
depending on the organization you can
have any number of impacts and urgency
being measured and this is something
that you can directly see on the service
now when we go through as a demo so in
the demo we would be seeing various
values of impact and urgency that comes
out of the box and we would be able to
see how the priority is basically being
driven so priority is basically a
combination of impact and urgency that
we already talked about so you can see
here that when the urgency is p1 are
critical and the impact is high the
priority is p1 so the P represents the
priority the subsequent part represents
the urgency so critical means urgency
and high means the impact so if the
impact is high the urgency is critical
then the priority is p1 that is of
priority 1 or traing of priority is 1
now when the urgency is normal which is
important and the impact is high it
would take lesser precedence when it
comes to and
urgency so you can see here there are
four different levels of priority P 1 P
2 P 3 and P 4 now the important origin C
and of medium impact has a priority of P
2 now this is something that you can see
on the ServiceNow tool as well being
followed which we would go through when
we go in the demo site the next step as
we understood and we already discussed
about is investigate and die agonize so
in the part of diagnosis of a particular
incident it can very well be escalated
across to multiple organizations within
the organization
so it means basically inside a company
there could be multiple different lines
of businesses working across and it
could depend on the working of multiple
lines of businesses together to ensure
the investigation or the diagnosis is
done in the right way so in
investigation diagnosis basically there
is the first level of diagnosis which is
done at the level of the tier 1 or the
tier true
so the tier 1 or tier 2 may not be much
necessarily technical people who
probably would need more details to
resolve a particular incident in that
case that is being escalated across to
the next tier or the level to which you
can see would also be doing the
investigation and diagnosis but they are
more of subject matter experts and they
would be knowing a bit more details on
the issue because the the complication
of the issue would basically determine
the level at which that particular
incident could Co and finally reach for
the resolution or recovery so the
investigation and diagnosis basically is
the part where the team in context who
are really looking into the issue would
understand the various causes of the
issue and basically give a quick
recovery which leads to the resolution
so investigation and diagnosis in simple
terms is nothing but understanding and
getting to know the issue recovery and
resolution is nothing but getting a cook
or a temporary fix or a workaround to
get the incident resolved so the closure
basically is some
thing that happens as I mentioned it
could be as simple as something that an
organization that decides the process or
the activity should be so incident
closure can be something like a
particular customer acknowledging the
incident that he or she is no more
facing the issue or it could be
something that is automated that means
it is brought to closure after the
certain number of days or a certain
number of time has passed by so now that
we have understood about the process
let's understand about the key roles are
the people involved in incident
management the different roles in
incident management would start when a
customer contacts or the end user
contacts the Service Desk the first line
of people who would be opening up at the
ticket on the basis or the basis of the
customer so the roles involved would
start with the end user connecting with
the first person or the first line of
service desk personnel and their
responsibility is basically help the
customer raise the incident it could as
well be instructing the user on how to
raise the ticket so that from now
onwards they can do it by themselves or
it could be something as really trying
to understand the issue from the user if
it has to do something with a mistake
that the user in itself is doing so
basically the first line or the initial
contacts role is to open the ticket or
probably gather some important
information from the user that would
help resolve the ticket or in the case
which is most of the case that the
ticket is being escalated to the area
which needs to be looked upon which is
basically investigating and
understanding the issue so the next role
would be the assignee assignee is a
person to whom the particular issue is
being assigned to so you can connect
assignee to the assigned to field on the
incident management application which we
would be seeing very soon now the person
who is assigned to his responsibility is
basically to work on the incident which
is where our investigate and die agonize
part comes into picture so the diagnosis
the
incident the person who's involved in
the particular group of the entity that
is in the entity that is involved in
resolving an incident is a group or a
set of members who takes care of a
particular area in the organization now
we can talk about network teams as one
of the groups
so inside network there could be
different specialized people working on
different parts of the network so it
could be person a who is looking into a
certain set of routers when it comes to
an issue when it comes to switches or
some other type of devices it could be
another kind of a person normally it
will not be as simple as I put across
but that's the general sense of
understanding when we say a group a
group is something that means
specialized on a particular area it
could be a group that is specialized on
two Hardware it could be a group that is
specialized on two software or it could
be a group that is specialized in to
some other entity an assignee is nothing
but a person who works on the incident
and would necessarily do the correct
communication across to the user in case
if we require more details on the
incident and then he would be the person
who would finally be involved in
resolving the incident once he diagnoses
and tests the incident now there is
always a manager who would handle the
the group of members who are looking
into the incidents so the managers
responsibility here is the timely
assignment are the acceptance of the way
in which the incident has been resolved
so the queue manager would basically
look into all the incidents that are
assigned to the group and how much of
workaround and implementation is left on
the ones that are yet to be resolved or
restored so now that we have understood
various roles and the various activities
involved in incident management let's
deep dive into some of the incident
management application functionalities
in ServiceNow now that we have gone
through the incident management module
and the process
let's go into the incident management
application in service now let's run
through what comes out of the box along
with ServiceNow as an incident
management application so when you type
on the Left application navigator
incident you can see the module are the
application incident and the various
modules related to incident listed under
them so let's go through the incident
management process that we talked about
let's see how the process runs inside
this out-of-the-box how it comes and we
will just discuss on a high level what
are the possibilities of changes that we
can do on incident management
application so in the first step of
incident management we understood that
it's about recording or registering the
incident so this is done through the
process or the module called create new
and in inside create new in incident
what you can see is when you click on it
you can see the incident number
automatically generated and various
other information or details which are
recorded so as to ensure that
appropriate amount of details are being
captured now the power of the ServiceNow
platform is to have cube changes being
made on to this module that really suits
to the requirement of an organization
ServiceNow has already built a robust
incident management process through
their incident management application so
let's go through that and understand how
we can run that simple best practice
model that we discussed about before so
at the time a particular incident being
logged would have a particular user
talking about the issue now the caller
field which is mandatory being asked
about is nothing but as you can see is a
person who reported or is affected by
this incident so here in this case you
would be giving the users name let's for
example give the name as Apple's tutor
as and when you give this the platform
automatically shows more details about
the user here and all this information
that you see here for example location
and all those kind of things are
something that can be leveraged for
further enhancing the incident
management application to show more
details we
talk about that as a small feature it's
a cool thing that is their service now
they use the location to actually show
where the incident is on the map so that
is something called the critical
incidents map so now that we give the
caller information we know that the
classification of information is
something that is very important so this
is the category where that we would be
giving in order to classify the incident
as you can see out of the box in
ServiceNow it gives us certain values
like inquire your help
software hardware network database and
so on so let's imagine right now we are
racing an issue for a particular piece
of software now once you give the
software this subcategory is pretty much
driven by the value given on category
this is something that is available out
of the box in ServiceNow and you can
have this being changed to know more
details on how we can change category
subcategory and more details the
ServiceNow administration course will
definitely help you do such
customizations the hardware as you see
when I give this will give you different
options on subcategory like CPU test
keyboard memory monitor and mouse so
let's go ahead with software and in this
case email let's assume that we have an
issue with email so this is the
configuration item the configuration
item is the item that is really affected
now in most cases a simple user may not
be been able to pinpoint what the real
item is so this is something that when a
customer service the support person is
logging would use so let's assume we
have an issue with Outlook so in our
case I'm gonna give outlook as the
software you can see details of that
particular configuration item stored in
ServiceNow no service now as you saw in
the past platform slide we talked about
configuration management or CMDB now
CMDB is what holds this information so
you would have a different altogether
discussion completely on configuration
management on CMDB which is a whole
different aspect in ServiceNow short
description let's give a sample short
description as you can see as and when I
type my short description it gives me a
related search result so these are
what we call the knowledge articles so
knowledge articles are knowledge
information or articles written probably
on the basis of information that already
used to happen before so here in this
case you can see our copyrighted files
illegal to have on computer now an
organization can have their own number
of policies and knowledge article
created across and that is something
that will help in cute resolution of
incidents so mind you the whole idea
behind incident is to give a quick
resolution or a quick workaround for the
user so ServiceNow platform through its
functionality has given a very cool
feature which is related search result
which dynamically updates on the basis
of the short description that you give
like for example if you type email the
related search results will type and
look for keywords through its search
engine and provide you articles which
more relate to that particular short
description or the keyword so let's
assume in our case we do not have the
knowledge article or enough information
to resolve this so my email client is
not working is what I'm going to put
here and we mentioned about very many
other details like how this particular
incident was registered let's assume
this was an incident which was
registered by a bail tutor through a
phone call to the customer service desk
so the customer service desk person
would mention yeah he called through the
phone and the state of the incident
right now is new because this is the
first step of the process so state is
something that drives the flow of the
incident management process you can see
here the various three levels of impact
and urgency that we talked about in the
prioritization metrics so you can see
priority fie already being showing up
this is something that is done out of
the box so depending upon the value that
you give on impact and urgency the
priority value you can see has changed
when I moved from low to medium it has
moved from planning to low now this is
something that again that can be
customized according to a customer
requirement and these are some of the
fine details of simple customizations
that a ServiceNow administrator or a
developer would
start fit to understand and this and
more details of such administrative
related or development related concepts
would be discussed in our ServiceNow
administration course now we know right
now this is not a mandatory detail and
the fields that are required to be made
mandatory is something that can also be
decided by the organization and its
process managers or the process owners
so let's assume we can give a particular
software assignment group here and you
can see as and when I fill assigned to
when I click on the lookup list here it
would only show me the users are the
assignees so we talked about a roll
named assignee in the discussion before
of incident management roles so the
assigned to value will relate to the
assignee role so you can see let's
assume that Beth Anglin is the person
who is going to work on this particular
incident
so Beth Anglin is the one who's gonna go
into the assigned to field so certain
fields and information are something
that is generic in ServiceNow as a
platform capability so you can save as
and when I fill the user and types of
field which contains user it gives more
details about the user this actually
enhances the user experience and
usability of ServiceNow and this is one
of the big selling points of ServiceNow
the usability so there are more details
that you can capture as well on
incidents and you can see that
subsequently here in the various tabs
such as notes related records and
closure information which would normally
be used while closing the incident so
let's assume we have given enough
details about the issue and mind you
most of the details of the fields are
something that can be shown as user
friendly in case the user doesn't
understand let's say for example user
doesn't understand what the priority is
so it already says that it's the
sequence in which an incident or a
problem needs to be resolved based on
impact or urgency so all this slight
tooltips and help can also be customized
and to show the right information for
the users that is also something that
comes in the purview of a system
administration course let's go ahead and
submit the incident so in the first part
where
we understood registering the incident
we have the incident being created now
this view of incident is what we see
normally under the open incidents so you
can see all the active incidents active
equal to true incidents are shown here
so to see more details of the different
fields that you require to see this is
something that can be customized or
personalized for your own view through
the personalized list you can click on
personalized list and decide to show
many details now you can already
understand that I created a ticket here
and we are not able to see that ticket
on top of the list so it is something
that you can easily find on the basis of
probably if something that is updated
most recently so as and when I clicked
on updated it helped me sort the list of
active or open incidents on the basis of
the recent incident so you can see the
incident that we created already showing
up here these are some details that
again can be modified from the very view
here what is called the list view of
incidents so you can even double click
on the very field and as will decide on
changing the information so now that we
know on how to register the incidents
let's try generalizing and understanding
a way on which how normally the Service
Desk personnel or the person who's
working on the incident would be looking
at the incident so a normal person who
has incident assigned to him would
basically go and click the assigned to
me
link on the left or the module called
assigned to me so this will basically
give the corresponding person who's
currently logged in as the assigned to
let's assume we have the person right
now who is assigned to as Beth Anglin
the person so for that let's do another
way of looking at it let me impersonate
as Beth
Anglet so when I search for Beth Anglin
it would go into the view of how Beth
Anglin will be seeing the ServiceNow
application so as and when with angling
types incident he or she would be able
to go into the module under incident and
click on assigned to me to see all the
various incidents assigned to that
person so you can see here the incident
that we created has already got assigned
to Beth Anglin now Beth Anglin can see
oh this was an incident that was created
13 minutes before so let's assume that
that Anglin has already died agonized
the incident and has found that this
particular incident has a particular
resolution so the fulfillment user or
what we called it assigned to person as
in this case Beth Anglin would go about
clicking on from putting the state to
resolved or he or she can go and click
on the resolve button to basically
resolve this incident so in order to
resolve the incident let's try clicking
on the button so you can see already
that the person who is resolving the
incident needs to give the notes of
closure that will help to understand how
this incident was resolved so this
automatically highlights with a star the
details that require to close this
incident so let's assume this incident
was solved as a workaround let's assume
that the client was reinstalled
so you give as many information like
this and click on resolve the incident
results now it goes into resolved state
as you can see so ServiceNow
functionality normally helps
out-of-the-box that the incidents that
are resolved will automatically move to
closed in a period of 6 days now how to
configure it and more details on
administration of various modules like
incident problem is something that comes
in the purview of a system
administration course but what we can
understand right now here is the
incident management process and how it
is easily driven inside ServiceNow and
how easily any kind of a role or any
kind of a personnel involved in the
process can get involved and look at
very required details that helps in
closing the issue let's go through some
of the other modules which are shown in
and the open link helps in showing the
active incidents so all active you can
understand all open incidents means
having the value active equal to true so
let's try and see value which could be
active is called false so these are
incidents that are closed so the value
of active and incident management is
something that is driven automatically
through the basis of the state closed
this is again involved with some
server-side objects that drives the
value automatically and is something
that you can learn in system
administration of ServiceNow so the open
and unassigned link that comes out of
the box and incident management module
are lists of incidents that doesn't have
the assigned to value as you can see the
assign to value is shown as empty now
these are lists that you can customize
again and that is one of the biggest
features of ServiceNow in terms of user
experience being able to change the
filters for example if I add another
condition to ensure that I want to see
only incidents which were opened today
so you can change the date accordingly
or you can change in terms of the
timeline that they have given so let's
assume we have our incidents which are
created or open today which is assigned
to none there is no incident assign to
none so now let's say you want to remove
one of the filter conditions out of this
it's as well very simple as just
clicking on the greater than sign so you
can see today we created this incident
and it shows up as one of the active
incidents which obviously is in result
which means there is no action that
needs to be taken care by the assignee
personnel and as a service desk manager
he or she would be more interested in
looking at the open unassigned list of
incident or open incidents so now there
is an overview sort of dashboard which
helps the incident management understand
what is the current state of affairs on
incidents so you can see here that the
critical open incident there are
numbered 15 there are six unassigned
incident there is 12 over do incident
and there are open incidents that this
older
and thirty days and all of this helps in
driving the incident management process
better by the involvement of roles like
incident manager so reporting dashboards
and graphs are something that is very
easily available and customized in
accordance to the need of the user so
another functionality that I just
touched upon but didn't show was a
critical incident map so you can see as
and when I open the critical incident
map that the module shows a map with
where the various critical incidents
exist for example if I keep my mouse on
top where it shows the exclamation mark
you can see that particular incident
exists in that particular location which
you can obviously drill down to the
detail of where the location information
has been given now this location
information is picked from the user's
location information which I showed you
right so this you can see is an incident
that comes reported by the user named
Taylor Vreeland and Taylor Vreeland is
situated in the location of camino del
plaza san you see there in california so
that's about the incident management
module and the various modules are parts
of the incident management I hope you
