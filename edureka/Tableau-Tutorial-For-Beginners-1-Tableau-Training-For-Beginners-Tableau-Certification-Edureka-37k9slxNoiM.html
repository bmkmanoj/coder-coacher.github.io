Rekha and today we will be learning
about tableau thank you all the
attendees for joining today's session
but before I begin I want to get
confirmation from you as you can all
hear me properly
okay so David is saying yes he can hear
me properly
Anisha is saying yes and I've got a few
other confirmations from the rest of you
also so we're ready to get started so
what to expect from today's tutorial
first we'll be learning about data
visualization why do we need data
visualization and why to tableau for
that then we'll take a look at what is
tableau and how to install tableau in
our system we'll take a deeper look at
tableau and understand how to work with
it and how to create different
visualizations with tableau we learn
about the functions in tableau and in
the end we'll take a look at the success
stories of different companies how they
have benefited using tableau so any
doubts on the agenda things quite
interesting doesn't it
okay so let us get started then so let
us first understand what is data
visualization well data visualization
means representing your data in a
pictorial form it may be in the form of
graphs or bar diagrams or a different
kind of charts and visualization allows
us to visual access to huge amounts of
data in easily digestible visuals
because let's say you might have got all
the data in excel sheets you have got
all that with you you have got the text
you've got the numbers and everything
but if you just view only numbers and
text you might not get a whole picture
out of it so you need to represent in a
manner so that you can understand it
better and visualization enables you to
have a well-defined overview of your
entire data and the simpler your
visualization is the more insights and
inferences you can make from it the
simple representations are the most
powerful ones so that is why we need
data visualization to understand our
data in a better way and this can be
used for analysis of data to make future
predictions and this is highly used in
solving business problems and the tool
that we are going to learn today which
is tableau this is highly used in bi so
this is data visualization now let's
take an example so here we have got the
x and y coordinates of different point
and these represent a line so the
example that is before you this
represents the data points in four
quadrants we have got the x and y
coordinates so if you see this data
you'll see that there is not much
differences in the numbers and you might
think that when you plot this data point
this might look the same but now let us
take a look so when you picturise in
you'll see how different they are from
each other they are not similar at all
even though the numbers look similar so
that is why you need to visualize it to
understand it you will not get the whole
picture when you are seeing just numbers
but when you plot it you can see how
different they are
so that is why data visualization is
important and that is why it is highly
used because picture izing your data
and analyzing will be so much easier
when you plot it and you see the
behavior of your data and that is how
you can make future predictions and that
is why data visualization is so popular
and people have been using it all around
the world
so I hope you have understood the
importance of data visualization from
this example so let us move forward to
our next topic and let us see the scope
of visual analytics so visual analytics
is used widely it can be used for
information analytics for geospatial
analysis scientific analytics knowledge
discovery data management and knowledge
representation for presentation
production and dissemination this use
for cognitive and perceptual science for
interaction and there are many more
usage of it and why do we use visual
analytics because it helps us to make
better decisions because when you can
study the behavior of it you can make
better analysis of the data and you can
take decisions which will be beneficial
for your company and you can make future
predictions accordingly and plan
everything and you can also get a better
sense of risk because when it can make
future predictions correctly obviously
the risk factor will go down and this is
very much beneficial for your company
and you can also build better customer
relationships better key strategy
initiative and better financial
performance because the risk factor will
be low you can save a lot of money by
studying the data by representing it and
it will give you a brief idea of
everything so this is the entire scope
of visual analytics now let us
understand how does data visualization
actually work so the first thing you
need to visualize the data is a data set
now your data set can be in form of text
files it can be any kind of flat file
excel sheet you can also connect to any
server or any database so and not just
one you can integrate and connect
different data sets together and then
you analyze that data according to the
parameters and then you carry out the
visualization of how you want to
represent what you have analyzed this is
a brief overview of how data
visualization actually works
they're analyzing you use different
formulas use different algorithms to
analyze it and for visualization you can
choose different charts or maps graphs
or anything that you want whichever fits
for your dataset and now let us
understand why tableau if you want to
visualize your data why go for tableau
let us understand it by looking at the
features of tableau
so the first feature is that it is very
flexible you can connect it to any kind
of data it consists of amount of
optimized data connectors for databases
you can connect it to an excel file you
can connect it to a text file even
collect it to a JSON file or any kind of
server you can connect it to a tableau
server a Microsoft SQL Server Oracle
Amazon redshift and many more and it
provides you with a very intuitive
platform now according to Gartner
tableau is actually considered the gold
standard for intuitive interactive
visual analytics and an established
enterprise platform and you can
represent your data in any way that you
want the visuals that tableau gives you
are very interactive you can tweak them
around you can play around those graphs
and the different charts that you make
in tableau and you can visualize your
data in many ways and also it has very
quick production them it takes only a
few seconds for tableau to create the
visualization that you want for your
data and that is the reason why tableau
has been among the top charts when it
comes to a visual analytics and a
presentation tool and let me tell you
that an tableau has managed to be in the
Gartner's Magic Quadrant from years from
now and now it is treated as the top
interactive tool that is used in bi
standing above big view and other tools
and that is why we should all start
using tableau and it is very fun to play
around with tableau let me tell you I'll
show you that in a while how we can make
different analysis of data by
representing it visually so now let us
move on to our next topic and let us see
in detail what is tableau so tableau is
a software company which produces
interactive data visualization products
focused on business intelligence and a
lot of companies and almost all the big
giants are using tableau for business
intelligence and for data analysis
purpose
so with tableau you can create and
distribute interactive and shareable
dashboards which depict the trends
variations and density of data in forms
of graphs and charts and these software
also enables you data blending real-time
collapse which is what makes tableau
stand out from all its competitors and
it is very unique you can use it for
business purpose for academic purpose or
for any purpose whichever you want to it
will help you to do all the visual
analytics that you want and with tableau
you don't have to spend much time
tableau will do all the work for you so
you don't have to wrangle around the
data that much you don't have to scratch
your head trying to figure out how you
should represent your data tableau has
got lots of options available you can
choose how you want to depict it and it
will do the rest for you so this is why
tableau is popular and this is what
tableau enables you to do
so now let us understand more about
tableau by looking at the architecture
of tableau so in the left hand side you
can see the data sources that you can
connect tableau to and to connect with
tableau it uses data connectors and
tableau consists of an amount of
optimized data connectors for databases
there are also common ODBC connector is
designed for any systems without a
native connector and it offers two modes
in support of interacting with data
first you can have a live connection or
in-memory connection and clients can
switch among allies and a in memory
connection whatever the desire so this
is the analyzing part so what happens in
a live connection is that the data
connectors of tableau control your
available data infrastructure but
transferring dynamic SQL or MDX
statements straight into the source
database except importing every data if
you have provided in a quick and
analytics optimized database such as
verticals
then you can get the advantages of that
investing by connecting live on to your
data and this leaves the detailed data
in the source system and sends the
aggregate outcomes of query to the
tableau and in addition this means that
tableau can effectively utilize
unlimited amounts of data
well in fact tableau is the front end
Analytics client to several of the large
databases in the world and it has
optimized every connector to receive the
advantage of unique characteristics of
every data source and this is the
visualization that you can produce using
tableau you can make a workbook for
tableau readers you can also make static
readers now you cannot work more in this
static readers this will just represent
the visualization that you produced and
you can also produce visualizations for
web and mobile users by using tableau
server now let me tell you how you can
use in-memory connection so in memory
connection is a very fast data engine to
optimize your analytics you can connect
your data and after that with one click
you can extract your data to get in
memory in tableau and fabless data
engine fully consumes your entire system
to attain fast queries answers and
millions of rows of data on commodity
hardware
and since the data engine can use disk
storage as well and as well as RAM and
cache memory let me tell you that it is
not confined with the quantity of memory
on a system and it is not essential that
an entire data set can be loaded into
memory to attain its performance
objectives so what happens when a user
opens a view in a client device so when
a user open to view the user begins a
session on the tableau server and then
the application servers thread begins
and then verifies the permissions there
are security protocols defined for a
particular user and then the user can
have an access to the view created by
tableau and this is how the tableau
architecture works in order to connect
to your data source in order to analyze
it and finally providing you with a
visual data or graphs or any kind of
visualization that you chose to be for
any questions on W architecture
so no questions so let us move on and
let me tell you how to install tableau
now installing tableau is very easy you
can go to the tableau website and
download the exe file just run that file
click on install it takes minutes to
install tableau or sometimes it can also
get installed in a few seconds after you
have installed tableau desktop the
latest version of tableau desktop is
10.2 so you can install that and after
installing it will ask you to register
to activate your version so you'll get a
license key you can purchase the license
key and if you were a student
and you wanted for academy purpose you
can get it for free for a year so you
just have to go through the registration
process and there you have tableau ready
to use now let us go ahead and
understand tableau a little bit more now
let us understand how to connect to
different data sources in tableau so
when you open tableau the first thing
you will see is the connect option now
you can connect to any files these are
the sources that I told you about you
can connect it to excel file to text
files JSON files or any kind of server
as well so if you already have a data
set in your system you can just go
browse onto the file location and you
can open that same tableau you will have
sample data set which is the super store
and you can rename it if you want to and
when you load that data set you will see
a preview of all the different fields
and attributes of the data set that you
have so you can see that these are the
attributes the order ID or the date ship
date ship mode customer names segment
and this can all be viewed even before
you open your worksheet now tableau has
also got different data types these are
the data types that we'll deal with
there are boolean which contains true or
false
there are date values there are date and
timestamp values the date values just
have the date the month and the year and
in date in time there is also the
timestamp in this format this is the
hours minutes
seconds and a.m. and p.m. you can also
represent geographical values so there
are geospatial data when you have feels
like city or state that is related to a
geography tableau will detect it and if
you can represent it in geographical
values you can create a view with map
which is very interactive and which is
also very popular in tableau tableau
also uses whole numbers and decimal
numbers and also text and strings and
all the stated eyes are represented by
symbols you can see over here that text
and string values are represented by ABC
the date values are represented with the
calendar icon the date and time values
are represented with a calendar icon but
with a clock the numerical values are
represented with a hash symbol the
boolean values are peace-pipe s which is
true or false and geographical values
are represented with a globe with
latitudes and longitudes
and the best part about tableau is that
it auto detects all the data types you
don't have to specify which data type is
what but if you want to you can do that
as well you can explicitly define if
it's a number or a string you can do
that in tableau and now let us see the
tableau desktop UI so when you open your
worksheet this is what it looks like so
you can see there are dimensions and
measures the dimensions are usually the
text data you can see it's ABC which
means it's a text or it can be a date
the measures are usually numbers we'll
know more about dimensions and measures
later on this tutorial and over here
with this toolbar you can decide how you
want to represent your data you can
label your data you can use tool tips
which will help you to hover over your
data and see the details you can include
what details you want to represent by
just dragging and dropping the
dimensions in detail section you can
play around with colors about how you
want to represent your data and this is
the rows and columns section so you can
just drag and drop items over here and
here you can see the pictorial
representation of data and this is
called a canvas and this is your
workspace this is for creating new
workbooks or dashboards
we'll explore more about tableau UI when
I show you the demo so now let us move
on and let us understand about
dimensions and measures so dimension is
the field that is an independent
variable and the data types could be the
strings
it could be geographic locations numbers
date/time anything and tableau guess is
the data type according to dimension
names so when you specify region it
might take it as a text or it might also
take it as a geographic location you can
define that explicitly as well so now it
is representing it as text but if you
want to represent it as a geographic
location you can specify and change the
data type of this field or this
dimensions and dimensions are actually
used for detailing your data I'll tell
you how but first let me tell you what
our measures
and it measures all the data types are
numbers and these are the inbuilt data
dyes the latitude and longitude this can
be used for representing geographic
locations but mostly they're all numbers
as you can see over here and to
represent a measure you always need a
dimension and dimension like I was
telling you it helps to detail your data
now when you see just measures let's
consider sales so you just see a number
the sales is let's say 10,000 but that
doesn't give you a whole picture of
anything but when you say it like the
sales by region or sales by a unique
Product ID and this helps you to add
detail in your representation of data
that is how you can get a clear picture
of your data when you represent it by
different dimensions and this is what is
used for analyzing your data so this is
what dimensions and measures are now
this is the show-me data so this pane
over here shows you how you want to
represent your data so there are a
number of options available you can show
your data by representing it in a pie
chart by heatmaps by bar diagrams there
are different sides of representing in
bar graphs or you can also represent it
in the geographical map when you choose
a data set it will automatically
highlight the data that you can use to
represent it if you see over here some
are blurred and some are not so if it is
blurred you can understand that your
data set is not compatible to use these
kind of line graphs you can use a bar
graph or you can use a pie chart for
that but not line charts may be because
your data that you're using is not
compatible to it so now let us move on
and understand more about this
visualizations so the first ones are
gross you can represent your data in bar
graphs or line graphs and you can also
represent both of them together you can
choose to have a horizontal bar graph or
a vertical graphs that you want you can
play around with colors if you want to
show different sales by different months
let's say and you want to represent it
with line graphs you can use different
colors for different lines for different
months
and if you want to see two different
fields if you want to compare two
different fields together you can use a
dual access graph also so over here you
can see that we have represented this
profit and the shipping cost together
now when I visualize it this way
this was the graph for shipping cost and
this was the graph for profit now when
he represented together you can see that
whenever the shipping cost was increased
the profit also has increased so this
gives you a clearer picture right and
there is a perfect correlation with
shipping cost and profit so this is how
you can make analysis of your data and
now you can make future predictions if I
increase my shipping costs I will earn
more profit definitely
so that is why visualizations are
important and you need to understand
also that how you should visualize your
data and the next is the geographical
graph now if you're viewing the sales by
regions you can see it in a geographical
graph like that you can pinpoint the
areas where you're getting the maximum
amount of sales and you can also have an
area graph with dual accesses now this
are the sales and profit dual access
graph that you can see over here and
there are many more ways of visualizing
your data let us see some more now this
is one of the most popular
visualizations in tableau the which is
called the heat map now colors are very
important in heat map in heat maps the
denser is the color the more value it
represents you can see the profit if
it's red
say the colors get darker over here it
means that it is a negative aspect so
you can see over here that the tables
category the sales is very bad or the
profit is very bad because it has the
darkest color of it and when you see in
case of phones which is the lightest
colors it means the profit and sales are
very high in case of phones the next one
is the tree map in tree maps you can
represent it in rectangular form and
also you can play around with colors
over here so the darker the green the
more is the profit and you can see in
case of copiers it is the highest and in
tables it is not much and you can
separate your data using rectangles when
you're using a tree map now let us
understand which visualization to apply
with what kind of datasets so in the
left hand side this is the visualization
that you should choose and this
represents the kind of data set that you
are using so let's say that if you're
using a data set that contains
discontinuous values you can use a bar
graph for that and for continuous
dimensions you should use a line graph
and if you want to represent two
measures together that we just saw and
if you want it for comparison it is
preferable that you use a dual access
growth and if you want to plot measures
on geographical map if you want to see
the sales by region or anything or
profit by region or if there is a
geographical field involved it is better
that you use a geographical graph in
that case and again if you want to
compare data between different regions
or compare different two measures
according to different regions then you
can use an area graph with dual accesses
or basically when you have got a feel
like there is a count and there is a
measure or the amount of density then
you can use a tree map for that because
with tree map you can represent the
quantity as well as the density of
particular measure so you'll get the
idea when you are using tableau for
awhile you'll understand which one will
be better you can also hit and try
methods and you can analyze yourself
with
visualization was a better for your data
set but this is just to give you a brief
idea because your data set will
definitely contain at least one or two
different kinds of data among these and
now let us understand functions in
tableau now you can use different
functions to join different data sets if
you want to combine columns you can use
joins and it uses all the SQL joints
that you might have studied about you
can use an inner join a full outer join
less joint right joint and this will
combine different columns together you
can also have a union to combine rows
but the constraint or the condition is
that the data fields or the attributes
should be same when you are combining
different rows together and this is how
you can combine different data sources
together by either join or Union you can
also sort your data accord with the
tableau sort function let's say that you
wanted in an increasing or decreasing
order you want to maybe see that which
one has the maximum amount of sales and
you want it on the top so you can use
the increasing order for that also and
it has different sorting techniques you
can choose any sort function that you
want to represent your data and set is a
type of filter which we can set a
condition for displaying values let's
say that we just want to display just
one kind of value for example over here
let's say that if you want to represent
this count which is greater than 10% so
we can use set for that and this is
actually a collection of dimension
members and you can also use tableau UI
for forecasting so this is used for
prediction when you have a set of
different trends going on you can
represent it by a line graph to
represent a trend and you can derive a
future prediction or a future line graph
according to the graph that is
represented for different years or
different months and you can use the
line graph to predict the future as well
and this highly depends on the values of
graphs and the different points and
graphs that you're using to represent
the earlier values this is highly used
in the business intelligence to make
predictions for investments
or different purposes and if you want to
highlight something let's say that you
want to highlight a particular trend or
you want to highlight the ones that has
the maximum amount of sales so this is
what you can use it you can highlight it
with a particular color blur out the
other line graph or blur out the other
diagrams or visualizations that he
created so this is one way also how we
can visualize your data you can also
design visuals for a particular device
if you want it in your mobile you can
select it the device type tablet or it
is a mobile phone you can do that also
because the resolutions of different
screens are different and you know that
mobile phones are small the screen is
smaller than this computer or the tablet
that you're using so all the
visualizations that are created together
in the dashboards might not fit into
because it might be too small and you
won't get a proper visualization so you
can design it and you can tweak the
visualizations
according to devices as well so this is
how you can make different
visualizations in tableau and now let us
view some of these so we are going to
have a practical demo for tableau now
and this is what we are going to do now
we are going to determine what makes a
good movie now you might have explored
IMDB that rape movie most of the people
go to IMDB and check the IMDB score if
they want to decide which movie to watch
so let us decide that if the IMDB
ratings actually determine a good movie
or a successful movie so what we're
going to do is we're going to have a
data set which contains the IMDB rating
for different movies and we're going to
input that data set into our tableau and
the first thing we are going to do is
we're going to compare the growth and
the IMDB rating it means that the money
that the movie has earned according to
the IMDB ratings the next insight that
we'll have is will find a correlation
between the IMDB score and the movie
budget we're also going to predict the
movie success based on actors or is it
the genre which makes the movie
successful or is it because of a
director and we'll also try
to identify or understand is a facebook
campaign affects the movie sales and
will create visualizations for all of
this insight and will match our
predictions with the actual box office
numbers so let me just show you how to
do that
so this is the screen that you'll get
when you open tableau 10.2 so the first
thing that you need to do is connect to
your data and my data set is an excel
file so I'm just going to click over
here so you can browse to the file
location where your data set is
contained and this is my data set which
is a movie data set that contains all
the different movies here's like movie
title IMDB score and many more so we'll
see this data set now click on open
so this is a preview of the data set
that we are dealing with today so you
can see it defines that whether it's a
colored movie or black and white
the director named numb critic the
duration the Facebook director Facebook
Likes actor Facebook Likes and many more
fields it also contains the budget the
IMDB score
so we're going to make all the insights
that I just talked about and we're going
to use this data set and visualize this
data set by comparing different fields
together
so now you can go to the worksheet so
this is what the worksheet looks like it
has got all the dimensions these are
usually text and there is one geospatial
which is country and there are measures
these are the numbers the gross amount
the face number in poster the duration
face book like the budget the aspect
ratio the actor likes so these are all
numbers so we're going to compare all
this one by one and we'll make the
insights that we talked about okay so I
have a question from Akshay he's asking
that how to decide which is dimension
and which is measured so we just talked
about it a while ago so you can see over
here the dimensions are mentioned over
here and measures are mentioned over
here and you don't have to worry because
tableau auto-detects everything so when
there is a text when the field contains
any kind of text it is automatically
moved on to dimensions and when it
contains numbers it is automatically
moved on to measures but if sometimes
there you want a number in the dimension
as well so you can specify it like for
example over here this is a number over
here the title year but this is not
something that you can operate on it can
be treated as a dimension if you want to
see that for a particular year which was
the most successful movie so that can be
thought of as a dimension because this
adds detail to your visualizations and
that's what dimensions are for and so
have you got your answer at rest
okay so he says yes great so we'll move
on and we'll create some visualizations
of our own so let us first compare the
growth and the budget of a movie so you
just have to drag-and-drop dimensions
and measures over here how you want to
plot your graph or your visualization so
first I'm going to drag the movie title
over here put it to columns because we
need this right because we're deciding
on what which movie earned what so
definitely we need a dimension movie
title over here now we're going to
compare budget and gross so these could
be found in measures so this is the
budget so we'll put it on rows
there it is and also to gross
so these are the two graphs that you can
see over here now you can also sort this
graph accordingly if you want to see
that which one has the highest gross
amount so you can just click this over
here if you want it in a descending
order or ascending order now we want to
see the best one at the top or best one
at the first so I'm going to set it in
descending order and when you take this
so this is according to the budget so
you can see the budget has been in
ascending order and you can see the
growth over here now let's say that you
don't want to represent the sum value of
the budget because there might be some
movies that have got an older version
and a newer version of the same name so
that will just add up the budget of
those two movies with the same movie
name so that's why we're just going to
go ahead and the measure as an absolute
attribute and we'll do the same with
gross
and there it is so you can compare this
you can see over here this will have
multiple the host and you might also
find out the movies like the host when
it says when you hover over this movie
and you can see that the budget and
growth our star market means that they
have multiple values so maybe you don't
want to include such movies in your data
set so you can just go ahead and right
click and exclude this now you can also
go ahead and change the color to
differentiate between the two bar graphs
so if you want to go change the color
just click on colors and let us give it
the color orange so this is the budget
graph and this is the gross income of
the movie now if you want to add more
detail into it let's say that you want
to also see the IMDB score of all these
particular movies so just go to the
measure that contains the IMDB score
which is this and drag it to detail over
here and you can see when you hover over
this one this will also show you the
IMDB score now let's represent this bar
diagraph or our visualization in a
better way so that we can compare these
two measures together so let's just say
that I won the budget and a line graph
so click over here and select line graph
so this is still not giving us a more
clear picture so let me just represent
it in a different way and I'll copy it
into a new sheet so what I'll do over
here is I'm going to make a dual axis so
now you can see that you can represent
this tool in the same X and y axis
because before that because in sheet 1
if you can see that the budget and gross
they have got different ranges the
growth is measured in millions whereas
budget is measured in billions well it's
fine when you hover over this you can
see it you can see the actual budget and
the actual gross but visually it still
doesn't give us a clear picture so
that's why we're going to make it a dual
axis so let me just go to the gross
income movie and represent it as a bar
graph so now you can see this diagram
and you can make this falling inside
that it is
not necessary that the movie that has
spent the most money or that had the
most budget that wasn't a successful
movie or that movie doesn't earn that
much always so because if you see this
movie over here ladies vengeance
the budget was so high the ante be score
was quite good but the money they earned
or the gross isn't that good but if you
see in case of Avengers you can see they
earn more money than the budget they
actually had and the IMDB score is also
good so we can make this falling inside
that budget doesn't really matter much
when it comes to earning growth IMDB
score can matter so we'll make some more
comparisons to understand if IMDB score
does matter so this was one insight that
we made now let us also check that
whether the director and the actors do
they matter so we'll make another
worksheet over here okay so now let us
compare the IMDB score and a particular
movie so that we're going to see that
which movie has the most or the highest
IMDB score so for that I need the
dimension movie titles
you can select add all members and then
I'm going to select the IMDB score
so let us sort it and be highest first
so this will show you the IMDB scores
you hover over this one so you can see
some of these movies they have got IMDB
score more than 10 whereas you know that
IMDB rates movie from 0 to 10 it is
because the measure is mentioned in sum
so we won the absolute measure so we'll
convert it into attribute and now you
can see it has been rated
from 0 to 10 now let us sort it again so
these are the kind of movies that I was
talking about these have got more than
one IMDB scores because maybe these are
the same name but they were released in
different years so let us exclude this
kind of data from here just because we
don't want to create any confusion
okay so there it is so you can see that
towering inferno this has the highest
IMDB rating with nine point five and the
second one with nine point three is the
Shawshank Redemption which is one of my
favorite movies let me tell you it's a
really great movie if you haven't
watched it it is one classic movie to
watch you should watch it and now we can
also compare the growth income so I'm
going to select growth here as well and
again I'm going to select attribute
let us represent it in a dual axis okay
so when you plot it in a dual axis if
you can see the IMDB score plotted and
the gross also plotted so this is I'm to
be score over here in pink and in orange
you can see the growth income of the
movie now still it doesn't give you a
clear picture because the comparison
range for IMDB score starts from zero to
ten but the attribute grows they have
earned in millions so the skin is
mismatched so this is not a very good
idea to compare and B scores and the
growth together so we'll try to figure
out to represent it in a better way so
what we'll do is that will remove the
grows from over here so now you can only
see the bar graph with the highest IMDB
scores like this so now let's just put
the growth income of the movie in detail
so just drag and drop to detail and
include this in the tooltip as well so
it is also included in the tooltip so
make it to attribute so now we have
sorted all the movie titles according to
their IMDB score so that with the
highest IMDB score we have got the
Shawshank Redemption which is a really
good movie let me tell you and you can
also see the growth income of that movie
here so if you just go and hover over
all the growth income you can see that
I'm Denise core does matter a little but
if you compare Godfather and Shawshank
Redemption so they don't have much
difference in score but the gross income
is quite huge the difference in gross
income is quite huge you can see that so
let us compare with lesser IMDB score
movies so let us compare this so even
though you can see that the IMDB four is
quite less but the growth income which
is almost four million it is not that
much difference with the Shawshank
Redemption and if you see the movies
over here which is the baby geniuses it
has almost earned the same money
Shawshank Redemption even though the
IMDB score is quite less so it means
that my score doesn't matter that much
or doesn't matter completely when it
decides to earning money
so what then decides more so let us now
compare the Facebook Likes because when
you make a facebook campaign for a
particular movie maybe it becomes more
popular and more people go to watch it
so we'll try to analyze that too so let
us create a one more new sheet so now
let us pick movie title in columns
because that will be always common since
we are trying to find which movie is
better we're comparing the different
measures of a particular movie so we
always want the dimension movie title in
our analysis or in our visualization so
now let us take the actor 1 Facebook
life actor one is the main protagonist
from the movie so we'll click on Chris
over here and since the ultimate result
of making a movie successful as money it
incomes or the total earning of the
movie which is specified and growth so
we'll also pick that excel and we're
going to change it to attribute the same
thing I'm going to do with this one now
this is the Facebook like of the
particular actor it's not a movie page
and we have specified the actors picture
or something it's not that so this is
the official Facebook page of a
particular actor like Christian Bale Tom
Hanks are the movies that we're talking
about here so now let us just sort this
according to a descending order we'll
add some more growth and details you can
add some more parameters over here
okay so we'll try to make this
visualization a little better let me
just sort this by growth and let me sort
it in descending order this is the movie
that has earned the most money which is
the avatar so there's a blue Alien movie
I'm very sure that you all have forced
it because they were locked off there
were like huge loads of Facebook and
media promotion for this movie so this
was the movie that was tweeted by James
Cameron after 25 years of research or
something so it was promoted like that
so that's why maybe a lot of people went
to watch this movie and it earned that
huge amount of money so we'll try to
make this visualization a little bit
better so let me just represent it and
dual axis so that gives us a better
picture and now we change it to a line
graph and four-cross will change it to a
bar graph okay so the blue line is
hidden behind the bar so what you have
to do is just switch the positions and
there it is even though you can see that
avatar has the highest income but after
one Facebook light is quite less and in
case of Titanic the actor Facebook like
is quite high so if you want to find
peak points for which is this seems as
the highest point which is 14,000 okay
but if you look at both of these graphs
together you can see there is a
correlation between them even though
avatar is an exception maybe because of
the director of this movie that people
want to watch it but if you see it over
here that actor Facebook Likes also that
reminds the income that the movie has
earned maybe because people go to watch
a movie because of the of a particular
actor right so that's why we can make
this insight that an actor's popularity
definitely affects the earning of a
particular movie so if you just continue
to see this graph you can see that there
is a correlation maybe it's not a direct
correlation but an actor Facebook like
or the popularity of the actor
it definitely does matter okay so now
let us represent this comparisons with
different colors so let me now remove
this one we don't need this so now I
have again the bar graph according to
the highest gross income of a particular
movie now what we'll do is let us take
an account the cost or to Facebook Likes
maybe it's not just for the protagonist
because some movies also cost like there
are multi star movies so we'll just take
this and drag and drop on to the colors
option so if the color is dark you can
understand that it has the highest or
more Facebook Likes of the total cast
members so since Avengers which is also
a multi star movie you know that there
is most of the popular actors are casted
in this movie so that's why it is darker
because it has the highest Facebook
actor likes and the same thing we can do
it for the director also so there is one
more measure which is the director
Facebook Likes so we'll drag and drop
that to the colors as well and you can
see dark night so yeah as you know that
Nolan is everyone awaits for a Nolan
movie so that's why the director like is
very much and you can see the color
indicates the director Facebook Likes as
well so similarly they go and check this
so you can see that there are not much
very popular directors so Nolan is one
of the most popular directors
it says the color is quite dark over
here and if you see the gross income of
the movie it is also quite high so you
can say that a director Facebook Likes
or the popular idea of director also
that reminds the gross income because
people have heard of the director and
they believe on that director that this
is going to rip good movie if this
person has directed it so you can make
them inside that a director also
determines the gross income of a movie
so for avatar the director Facebook
Likes is zero maybe because James
Cameron doesn't have our Facebook page
so you also have to rely on the data set
as well
maybe cuz if you would have had and
Facebook page he would have got a few
likes as well so there can be exceptions
if you have to consider that also so
these are the insights that you can make
so this is what we did we compared the
growth and the IMDB rating so we found
out that the IMDB rating does not have a
direct correlation with the gross income
that they earned and movie budget also
has nothing to do regarding the IMDB
score it doesn't mean that if a movie
budget is high it is not necessary that
IMDB rating will be high as well but
when you see according to the cost or
the popularity of the cast members you
can see that the gross income is quite
high which is also similar when you
compare it with the popularity of a
director so that is how we can make
insight because and this was only
possible because we created
visualizations about this data now
looking at the numbers doesn't give you
that picture only because we were able
to represent our data in pictorial form
or in good visualized form that's why
we're able to make this insight and we
matched it according to the box office
numbers which is the growth and the IMDB
score and we found out this results so
that is how you can use tableau to make
insights to compare different parameters
together and we are able to do all these
calculations and make all of this
insights because we had good
visualizations which we made in in
tableau so I hope you have understood
how we can make insights on how we can
use tableau for that now let me tell you
that it is not necessary that you always
use bar graphs and line graphs to
compare like I did it completely depends
upon the data set that you have the
fields that you are dealing with that is
in your data set so any questions
alright so there are no questions so
we'll move on and we'll take a look at
the success stories of tableau so almost
every company uses tablets the business
intelligence tool and all of this
company that you can see in front of you
in the screen they all use tablets
starting from US Air Force to Burger
King
Citibank you can see these are all
different companies but they all used
help these are a few of the comments
made by the most influential people from
a particular company you can see Ryan
greener from Deloitte says that tableau
is changing the game for us it's reduced
the time that they have to spend on
lower value add activities similarly
Jerrod and ipsec from One Kings Lane
says that it increases our sales it
decreases our cost there is a direct
impact it just gets you inside faster
and you can read for the other two as
well so there are many success stories
people are absolutely loving tableau and
once you use it I hope that you love it
too because you can do and you can play
around with data and different kind of
raised with tableau so this is all that
we learn in today's tutorial now let me
just give you a brief summary of what we
learned today at first wave understood
what data visualization is and the
importance of data visualization after
that we explored a data visualization
tool which is tableau and we understood
features of tableau we understood what
is tableau how to install tableau and we
understood tableau in a little more
deeper way you know how to make tableau
connections you know how to make
visualizations with tableau how to use
different tableau functions we have also
seen the tableau customers and have the
success stories so this is what we learn
today any questions I can still answer
it before this tutorial ends
