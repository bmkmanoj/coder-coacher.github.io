looking into what is data mining what is
business analytics what are the way your
stages in a data analytics or data
mining projects what is our overview of
machine learning and then we are going
to look into the association rules what
does this association rule mean how to
go about that we are going to discuss
that in a while from now so until then
let us move forward all right why
business analytics has suddenly became
the sexiest job of the 21st century not
sure whether you guys have heard about
that or not hey guys are you not able to
see my screen are you not able to see my
screen guys I'm displaying a slide which
says business analytics can see able to
see few feet few of y'all are able to
see if you are unable to see if you're
seeing that my audio and video is not
clear is my wise clear to majority of
you guys or is
there are any disturbance wisest here so
guys you need to check your internet
connectivity at the RN C of y'all are
saying that my wife is very clear few of
y'all are saying that no it's not good
so please check the internet
connectivity at you are in please I'm
using 10 Mbps high-speed broadband so I
believe there should not be any lag from
Mayan so please check your connectivity
at yarn all right Kashyap thank you for
saying that my voice is very clear
Charlie thank you for that so not sure
whether you guys have heard about this
particular statement or not from Harvard
Business Review which says data
scientist as a profession would be the
sexiest profession of the 21st century
if you guys haven't heard about that let
me quickly show you that so here we go
harvard business review one of the most
premium v schools right the bisbee
school probably sisters the data
scientist would be the sexiest job of
the 21st century and they also make
another alarming statement which phase
there would be death for serious data
scientists the shortage of data
scientist is becoming a serious
constrain in some sectors here is where
you have an opportunity to grab with
both your hands right so undoubtably the
world is speaking about business
analytics data analytics why now was it
not there earlier why only now what
could the possible reasons be the cost
the data has come down significantly let
me ask you this question guys do you
know what was the cost of one gigabyte
way back in nineteen eighty can someone
get on that sorry what was the cost of
one gigabyte way back in nineteen eighty
just give a random guests if you'd not
known that what do you think would have
been the cost of one gigabyte of storage
way back in nineteen eighty anyone any
one of you let me see there are some
answers pouring in greater than 50,000
is what shanta sees furnaces 5,000
rupees among says hundred thousand
dollars kashyap six twenty thousand you
now if you always close to the actual
figure four hundred and thirty seven
thousand dollars for thirty seven
thousand dollars what a number that is
can you imagine people spending four
hundred and thirty seven thousand
dollars I'm not kidding you can do a
google search and to be been precise
this was a price of one gigabyte way
back in nineteen eighty wow if this was
a cost of one gigabyte even as of now as
of today no one would have even thought
about business analytics or data
analytics no one would have even thought
about big data right so I get it why do
I spend so many dollars distort the data
and make some analysis out of that can
someone guess what is the cost of one
gigabyte in 2013 or as of now what do
you think is the cost of one gigabyte in
dollars if someone can see in dollars
5,000 rupees cash if no one's much less
than that one gigabyte
five dollars is what nah races we JC's
five to six thousand rupees no four five
to six thousand rupees probably you'll
get a terabyte ten dollars the cost is
only 0.05 cents naughty 10.1 dollar
printing it is 0.05 dollars as of today
the cost of one gigabyte that is a
reason why people have started storing
the data left right and center few years
back they weren't even looking into
storing that amount of data because of
the cost now cost is not something which
people worry about since the cost of
storing the data has come not
significantly and the space right or the
size of the harddrive has come down
significantly nowadays people are
thinking about storing all the data that
they can lay their answer using which
they can come up with some kind of
information some inferences which is
going to help them increase your
business right and cost of processing
data this has increased tremendously
right I mean processing speed has
increased tremendously and the cost of
processing has come down significantly
let me ask you about this question right
iphone 5 right today is how many times
more powerful in processing than the
nineteen eighty-five super computers
super
computers I'm not speaking about the
normal computers right in 1985 there
were super computers being used can
someone see me how many times is iphone
5 processing power more than nineteen
eighty-five super computers if you guys
do not know let me tell you guys that it
was 2.7 times right iphone 5 is 2.57 2.7
times faster when it comes to the
processing power in comparison to the
supercomputers which were used right I'm
speaking about the processing speed
there and you all know about the
processing or the CPU costs as well
right when did you last hear about
Pentium one computer or 20 m 20 or 20
and 3 when did you last hear about that
and how much would how much did it cost
way back in two thousand five or so to
get a PC home in 1999 right marriage
what was the cost of you know purchasing
a computer of such low processing speed
probably 25,000 or 30,000 right for a
decent enough computer there right are
50 40 to 50,000 rupees also yeah
nowadays you get i 7 processing speed
for generation for the same cost and
think about 20 and 1 what you will you
were doing during your Pentium one days
you would switch on your cpu go have a
cup of coffee come back open your
internet browser go play cricket and
come back by the time you're back you
would see that the necessary page is
open there right such a slow processing
speed for so much cause for the same
cause you are getting super super fast
computers with these two things changing
drastically in the world
we see that there is a lot of data
getting generated and also stood was
data not getting generated earlier it
was getting not at this piece though but
people were not storing that nowadays
people are storing that since you are
storing such use data people have
started me doing a lot of analysis on
top of that and that is where Kane this
new profession to light which is
business analytics right your data
scientists do what business analytics
data science data scientists right
business analytics think about these are
the same names given to the same person
right people call me Bernie few people
call me Kumar Africa people call me with
a different name it all means the scene
all right let us move on and discuss
about what are the way Leah stages of
analytics right if you're doing an
analytics project how would you go about
doing that or if you're doing a
data-mining concept if you're looking
into that how would you go about doing
that the first step in your data mining
lifecycle ease you Fliss understand what
is the business understanding right what
is the business logic hey I see that
someone has raised the hand when who is
this yeah Kumar you have a question
Mandar which was when a do you guys have
any questions no have you raised your
hand by accident or do you have any
questions I believe you raise your hand
my accident ooh that's a key so the
first step is you need to understand
what is a business problem with the
client is facing and here is where you
need to bring in your domain expertise
this is where you need to bring in your
industry exposure this is where you need
to bring in your sector exposure to
understand what is on the line business
problem once you understand the problem
you need to collect the relevant data in
order to address that with
understanding or business problem once
you collect the data now the owners
shifts from your business understanding
to the data understanding what is the
data looking like right you need to
understand the data what are the various
variables there then you start preparing
the data what do you mean by preparing
the data when I say preparing the data I
mean cleansing the data for example let
me quickly show you one oh sorry let me
quickly show you one example there ah
give me a minute folks while I show you
what exactly I'm meaning by you know
cleansing the data to let me open one of
the xml file 0 so here we go all right
look at this here is a typical you know
xml file of a clinical trial which was
performed earlier so you have the
various columns like the agency name
source you have the detail description
right about what the disease is all
about right what kind of medicine are
you taking what raga you're taking right
all these things here is the drug name
intervention type and things like that
intervention name right yeah really
stings available here so the question
here is how are you going to bring it
into a structured format when it's a
structured format can you place all
these things in a tabular format right
when I speak about right data
understanding I mean this you read
everything you make sense out of that
you understand what are the various
variables here what are the waste
problem
XML tags here what even my doxorubicin
right what do you mean by Rubik's so you
need to understand the data flows once
you understand the data on the next
thing is data preparation wedding you're
going to arrange all these XML files in
probably a CSV format or a table format
can someone gets in semi how many
clinical trial data do we have on this
website which says clinical trials geo
we in 2004 US government has come up
with this law which says any clinical
trial conducted anywhere across the
globe has to be recorded in clinical
trials or goe if the rug has passed
through your food and drug
administration look at that one 93,000
one like 93,000 or 190 3,000 645
approximately 200,000 clinical trials
now how are you going to read each and
every file XML file right 200,000 XML
files bring it to a structured format
that is a challenge you right look at
this unstructured data here you have
four or five lines of data you're a lot
of information here 50mg per hour right
400 mb per level 100 mb per hour what
does that mean how do you bring it to
the column format that is where your
tool called r is going to come in handy
so when I
mining is a concept of business
analogies this is one part of your
business analytics that is just one part
of your business analytics right and
once you prepare the data you do some
kind of a modeling there what in the
model for example in the clinical trials
example if I provide or if I provide you
the drug mean and the disease name which
I want to cure by using that particular
drug and if I say hey I'm in us right if
you could these three details it's going
to successfully predict and tell you
with the doctor that you need to
approach to ensure that this clinical
trial using this combination this drug
does disease in us go approach this
doctor for you to successfully complete
the clinical trial that is a prediction
there right you can predict multiple
things there now where is there a lot of
dating websites right you give your age
that is your first variable you give
your gender you that's a second variable
you give your vocation third variable
right it will help you predict who is
the most suitable person for you for
dating right there are a lot of dating
websites available by the way I'm not
kidding on that you can predict all that
right given your number of miles a car
has been driven the make of the car and
the variant of the car weyant meaning is
it a patrol vehicle or is it a diesel
vehicle if you provide these to an input
probably I can come to know what would
be the cause of that second hand car
what will be the cost of the used car
were these two inputs is free inputs
that is your modeling that is prediction
all about all right predicting whether
someone will be infected by a disease
even before they come to know about that
you're not sure whether you guys are
aware of this example how many of you
are a bit of Angelina Jolie yeah most of
you over max's to me Mac system is money
you know removal of organ your organ
from your body right statistics us
statisticians have predicted that right
Angelina Jolie would be you know getting
cancer at a certain age from now based
on the prediction she got her double
breast max this to me done with all of
the organ that is the power of
statistics that is a power of prediction
people are relying on statistics such a
great extent that you know nowadays even
before you the cancer people can predict
whether you can get a cancer or not at a
certain age based on that you can change
your lifestyle to ensure that you do not
you're not affected by cancer things
like that are happening nowadays all
right oh my bad what happens not once
again folks okay that's the problem
there all right once you build a model
you're going to evaluate the model is
the model even better for me is it
accurate right what is accuracy if I'm
predicting that hey this person is going
to default on the loan please do not
give him a loan all right but
my nowise accuracy of that can even rely
on that for that reason you have
evaluation waiting you're going to
evaluate the prediction model which are
built previously and it has to be
accurate right for me to even look into
the outputs of that and use it from a
business development right if you feel
that the accuracy is good then you go
ahead and deploy it you go ahead and
deploy it in the real world right so
this is a typical life cycle of a
business analytics project or data
mining project data mining is a concept
in business analytics widely used by the
way here comes our if any one of you all
is thinking about why are why not sass
why not IBM SPSS why not start out why
not matter why not any other statistical
tool why only are right so for those who
have these questions popping let me
clarify that so let me open google
trends yep and let me show you the
comparison between our another start
still tools and by our is so widely
search form that's our let us compare it
against sass head on head and see how
the train is going to look like yeah
Jenny I'll come to your question you in
a minute from now so here is our and
there is sense right look at the lot of
difference between these two if you see
SAS is slightly dipping there if you see
it in isolation right now you will see
that it brings significantly from two
11 2013 14 15 and all that let us see
the forecast forecasts also say that
it's further going to dip their want to
compare with IBM SPSS well do that IBM
SPSS is far more below your sass and now
if I bring in our r is going to blow
away these two competitors absolutely
nothing no link action I tonya python is
fast picking up but it cannot pick are
in the near future see so there is
python python is picking up but you have
two million users working on our two
million users it is an open-source all 2
million users are contributing to the
development of our all 2 million folks
are contributing to the development of
far and how many people might be working
on the development of the various
products such as SAS and spss maybe
10,000 folks in the research in
development trying to enhance the
product versus two million people who is
going to win the race yep you know now
much better right I'm not cooking up
this data this is from the google trends
look at the kind of demand which are has
none of the other tools have or are even
close to are not even fifty percent
closed or are as forty six percent of
the market share as of today SAS has
only live in person share that is the
pace at which are is progressing that is
a reason why you can choose our it's
such a simple tool to use right here is
a simple tool oh no I was just working
on many other things there on pulling
the data from Twitter and you know
trying to do some trend analysis on feel
the latest happenings there so you know
let me open are you can use all the way
these things there
it's a simple tool two plus two is four
right if you want to assign the numbers
1 to 10 I can do so if I want to print
those numbers to the console like induce
right it's extremely simple language
very simple if you know English it's as
good as this yep so I'm going to take
your questions at the end because you
know they're there are a lot of concepts
which I need to cover as part of this
one on a seminar uh which was has a
question and Jenny had a question right
I'm just making a note of that journey
i'm going to explain about what model
means right and our studio is free money
there hey wish was all right yeah
question I can take right up we write
our is as simple as writing English
statement there it is as simple as
writing English statement so the part
about our is that you have a lot of
inbuilt functions right say I'm working
on our i'm working on extracting data
from twitter i feel that hey i'm doing a
lot of research right i'm doing a lot of
research to write a code right once they
do a lot of research what I'm going to
do I'm going to store all these things
and send it to our community the core
community which is going to evaluate my
code and see if it can be reused if they
feel it can be reused they're going to
publish it as a package package is
nothing but collection of functions code
which have already written there so most
of your job is taken care of trust me
it's all about using the packages and
getting your job down there hey we
good question it's a wider discussion
right so I'll take the question later
which was has another question and also
i'm an engineering graduate so i wanted
to know the extent of statistics that
need to be known so any program that you
generate any codes any any training for
that case they are going to start right
from basics of the statistics what do
you mean by mean average what do you
mean by median or mode or variance
standard deviation they start right from
the basics right and there are they take
the section forward so yes I would say
that you need to know the statistics but
any good program is going to start right
from basics they assume that you know
you are your knife to you statistics we
J has a question i'm going to write that
down how to analyze the categorized data
I'll take the question later Vijay so in
the interest of time let us move on what
are the way you sectors where we can use
our R can be used in telecom industry
Roy for example if we want to predict up
friend on who is a customer who might
most likely shift from one service
provided to another service provider
probably from eight till two were the
phone right so who is the customer who
is most likely to move from one sub is
provided to another that's a channel
right I'm losing business there can
someone predict and tell me that hey
here is person a is most likely to
switch there so even before these
switches I'll go to him given special
offers so that he continues with assess
and things in that far pharmaceuticals
can you help me predict
on whether a particular drug is going to
have and that was impact or not say I'm
going to take medicine with bistro
molecules a and B right to cure my
headache if we take that and then
suddenly if I get fever then that is a
adverse impact right our side effect of
taking this medicine I took this
medicine to cure my headache however the
side effect was that nine now have fever
and body body aches so can you help me
predict even before I release this
product in the market even before I you
know prescribe this medicine to the
patient can you predict and tell me that
hey these are the side effects which
would come along with the medicine that
you're going to tea and do that
financial services what should the
pricing of my premium be right if it's
insurance firm right watch it the
pricing be think about this example
right nowadays people are wearing all
the smart devices available devices how
many of y'all are aware of the variable
devices how many of you are aware of be
able devices there let me show this
example it's the time magazine da Crown
Royal Crest Oh still coming up just bear
with me so this is available device job
on right now people are predicting on
how many calories are you burning how
many hours are you sleeping there how
many I was where you sound sleep how
many I was were you half asleep right
and how many steps have you taken there
by how many calories did you burn based
on all these things data gets generated
and this data
also goes do your insurance companies
there and if you're a person who lives
an unhealthy lifestyle right you do not
sleep for eight hours you sleep for only
four hours right you consume calories
say 2000 calories per day but you only
burn thousand calories you are the
person who would most likely come to me
with an insurance clean saying that hey
I got admitted to the hospital because I
have a Hartford why shouldn't I charge
you more premium why shouldn't I do that
because you are an unhealthy cut person
right does not mean i'm going to you
know do a social service for you i will
rather charge you more right and that is
how the world is progressing nowadays
life sciences health care the same
example which have been given right so
if you had disease one in disease too
and is history and your visited the
hospital five times right this is three
and you have visited the hospital five
times number of is it and you're a male
or a female gender which location are
you from what is your earning power if I
have all these variables i can predict
on whether you'll get admitted to the
hospital or not right your Obamacare
Affordable Care Act says that if a
patient comes to you to get his problem
resolved you give him some drug he goes
back if the same patient gets readmitted
right because of the same reason then
the company will be to the hospital
would be sealed their the very
light sources that hate be predictive do
not you know give superficial treatments
so you can predict all that based on
your past history if you can bring me
your past history right and how many
times you have visited the hospital how
many did kind of diseases you are
carrying and things like that what
people can predict on whether you'll get
admitted to the hospital or not in the
next two years of three years yes I mean
you have that question I'll take that
question one and then education sector
also so I'll stop there a lot get into
the theory match because there are few
questions going in I'll take a question
in a minute from now so there are types
of learning supervised learning and
unsupervised learning right supervised
learning is called as machine learning
that means for example Google Gmail
everyone must be having your gmail
accounts with you all right few of the
emails automatically go to spam do you
do not put it as a spam it goes to spam
why is that so right the system has
learnt on its own maybe when i received
a promotional email for the first time
i've tagged it as fan from then on
system learns that hey whenever there's
a new spam email or new email with the
word promotion in that this particular
user does not like that so let me spam
it what other emails should expand when
initially this feature was launched it
was very naive right and then later on
when people have started spamming few of
the emails probably related to you know
obscene images containing the email or
your promotions or your travel related
emails or your frequent flyer emails and
all that right once you spam it it's
going to go
sit in the spam folder of gmail and that
system is learning on its own and if the
system learns on its own improves over a
period of time that is called a
supervised learning what is unsupervised
learning unsupervised learning is all
about clustering what do you mean by
clustering right that is what we are
here to discuss in this session so one
concept of your unsupervised learning is
associational rule mining there people
who have purchased Barbie dolls are 60
person likely to purchase a candy bar
people who purchase this have also
purchased an right people who purchase
toothbrush purchased toothpaste people
who purchase bread also pushes cheese
people who purchase diaper also put his
beer now that was a crazy example but
yeah diaper and beer is an excellent
example right people in target manages
in target have done this good analysis
and they found an interesting insight
what was an insight people who purchase
diapers have also purchased beer right
and this was done by few of the
statisticians in thar Ansari in the
space of teradata teradata company those
people have done that for ausco
dragsters that in between five to seven
the people who purchase I Peraza
purchase beer so here those are the you
know crazy examples which people have
come up with and then we have this
association rules people who purchase
this also purchase that what what is the
business decision that you think
probably you are going to place diaper
and beer close to
each other in our acts which are close
to each other so that people can quickly
pick that right where do i pasted my
toothbrush and toothpaste in the same
rack so that people pick that together
and people are most likely to pick it
right so these are the way these
examples in association rules think
about your recommendation engines
whenever you go to Amazon right when you
search for say iphone 6 there when you
search for iphone 6 based on the past
history purchase history or the search
history people have searched for iphone
6 have also search for samsung galaxy
for example or they have and they have
also search for see windows mobile
they're based on this ice cream if
someone is going to search iphone 6
immediately I'm going to pop up these
two NCAA people have searched this have
also searched that recommendation engine
amazon has the world's best
recommendation engine model right so let
me take your questions now and then I'll
move forward because we had one question
from jenny jenny was asking on what is a
model all about model is nothing but a
prediction right about your future are
forecasting your future for example
remember this equation y is equal to f
of X this is the most important equation
when it comes to business analytics
please write say you want to predict the
weight gain and you have the input
variable as calories consumed so from
now on if someone says hey I've consumed
2000 final calories or I'm consuming
2400 calories per d I will be able to
effectively predict and see if you go on
the same died consuming 2500 final
calories per day
you'll you're going to put on another 5k
ease or five or ten pounds of weight
that is called as predict you predict
something that is your model there I did
not mean that I didn't see that deep all
right when I am going to show you some
coding path there even before that I'll
take this next question which we J had
oj what is categorical data I'll come to
you the have nots okay deep first let me
answer your question you said that
supervised learning is machine learning
you mean unsupervised learning is not
machine learning no I didn't see that I
didn't see that what are machine
learning only but the only thing is the
word machine learning is closely
associated with supervised learning in
unsupervised learning you know you do
not close the associate that word
machine learning with on to poison right
okay now there are few more questions
pouring in before that let me answer
widgets question which says categorical
data what is categorical data and what
is your continuous data absolutely
you're right on that so let me read out
which is complete question how do you
analyze categorically say hey
categorical data means data which you
cannot divide continuously for example i
can say that i have one laptop with me
or i can say i have two laptops with me
can I ever say I 1.5 laptops with me no
I cannot do so right so what kind of
analysis can you do on top of that all
sorts of analysis are possible my dear
friend you can take the mean of that on
an average these many laptops is what
people have first order business
decision there you can take the median
you can look into the more you
can look into the measures of central
tendency measures of dispersion right
and I can build a prediction model on
top of that using logistic regression
whenever you have categorical data right
you tend to use something called as
logistic regression there that's a good
part right so you can do all sorts of
analysis widget for that keys but it is
not ask us using continuous data you can
do far more advanced than a analysis but
using categorical data also you can do
most of them let me take the next
question from which was which was says
not wish yeah which was--yes wanted to
know the difficulty of our programming
when compared to SAS or SPSS and there
is another question or expectation on
what are the advantages and
disadvantages of our over other
statistical products and someone wants
to see the coding to some extent there
all right let me let me take that
question now on first various
statistical packages and then I'll come
my girl a lot of questions coming in so
our vs SPSS vs SAS what is the advantage
and what is what are the disadvantages
right in SPSS you know it's gui-based
graphical user interface mostly right
less of good and then you can get your
job down there but can you do all the
statistical at one statistical things
using SPSS know is it extremely flexible
can you change the code and do or tweak
and tailor it to your needs no sass
has a language called base SAS piece
programming language which language is
more easy beasts as resources are our
why is that so because most of the code
in our can be reused in terms of
packages right you install something
called as package and then you get the
job done there such extremely simple
extremely easy binary right and our eyes
open tues it comes for free of cost SPSS
and SAS is extremely cost your sass
e-minor which is you I based one license
will cause your proximately one crore 1
crore indian rupees it's extremely
costly all right and at any given point
of time right there are two million uses
in using our I mean two million users
are using our in that community so it's
a wider community it's a size of you
know probably maybe 100 such sass
company's employees it's that biggest
size there so when you pause that you
have an error you are unable to get a
solution there will be thousands of
people who'll be interested in answering
your questions are has forty six percent
of the market share if you're looking to
switch your jobs if you're looking out
for new opportunities in an attic space
rather than think about that 11th person
was as far as expressed in which which
one would you take right which or click
where you want to take and also
Microsoft has acquired revolution
analytics revolution analytics is a firm
which majorly works on our for
enterprises and Microsoft has acquired
revolution analytics you know our will
be widely used in most of the companies
moving forward so these are the bunch of
advantages of our over
their statistical tools and there is a
question around data scientist is a huge
term how much of business knowledge
programming knowledge and statistics it
comes as I would say it's a mixture
mandar it's a mixture you need to have
the business acumen you need to know
that domain knowledge you need to know
the programming knowledge to some extent
right and then you also need to have
started six I would say it's an equal
mixture of these three which is going to
make a successful near scientist it's
not statistics alone no that's a myth
right do you need to know strong
programming no that's a myth do I need
to have a very strong domain knowledge
that's a myth once again all right
combination of these three is going to
make you a successful data scientist you
analyze data but you do not know in what
context you know the business
problem that but you do not have the
domain knowledge to you know actually go
ahead with the programming things like
that for designing a new machine
learning algorithm what kind of steps I
should follow you think that's a big ass
up there right it's a two hour session
which we conduct in you know so I'll
take that offline maybe can are we used
for sentiment analysis absolutely are
can be used for sentiment analysis
tanmoy any small example given the tight
timeline okay let me see whether I can
pull out something for you there a key
alright so there is something called as
positive word cloud and the negative
work you are right this is sentiment
analysis how many's people are speaking
positive things about you how many
people are speaking negative things
about you effectiveness important
improvement significant improving
compliments remission someone is healthy
something is affecting positive these
are all the positive words so reading
16,000 or XML files right these kind of
files reading entire thing there it's
still going it's still going it's still
going it's not done one xml file is so
huge right and it has a lot of
unstructured data in between right look
at that how can you read so much of text
from sixteen thousand files or 200,000
finds if i want to take all the clinical
trials so what I do is in our we can
quickly do all those as inputs there and
it's going to read all the files and
quickly tell you that what is what are
the positive words there right and that
is called as positive analysis right
sentimental
and then you can also look into your
negative cloud which is all the negative
things right negative word cloud and you
can do a quick comparison between
positive and negative words there by the
way you look of this I know that there
are a lot of negative things going on in
the market I too that's about one more n
who can go for with analytics i would
say sundeep if you have good development
knowledge you are a good fit if you have
a good business knowledge then also
you're a good fit there will be
different people coming in no one would
be blessing all the areas right there
will be people who have strong technical
skills are strong development skills
they have to groom the skills around the
business part of that domain knowledge
that is where you need to focus more on
there would be business people coming in
like your project managers right they
already have a lot of domain knowledge
all they have to do is probably spend
some time learning statistics in the
cooling pad team leader is also Kashyap
as a question is how open are related
with each other Hadoop is a different
thing right you bring in data from uh
and data is getting generated in what
forms text right social media people are
writing reviews there are videos getting
uploaded on YouTube that is also data
there are images getting uploaded on
pinterest that is also generating data
there are a lot of audio files in terms
of music right there are a lot of music
stores that is generating data you have
a lot of Wi-Fi logs you have satellite
locks you have gps locks everything is
generating data right if i have data
coming from those many white where ideas
ptosis hadoop will actually help you
bring everything to a common structure
are also does that but if you have
extremely high data right how do put me
the right place for you to cleanse the
data
all the data cleanse the data and give
it a structure from there your
statistical tool has to take on either
are or SAS or SPSS Hadoop is basically
used to manage your big data if the data
is extremely large that is when you
pitching all right which was has this
question whether the fresher want what
may be the expectations of me to be
cancer for an interview by looking at my
resume and and are trained candidate
what may be the expectations of me to be
how we shall see business analytics with
our is a relatively new subject right
new concept what is the shot is that the
world is looking at what is the shortage
making see shortage of the scientists
right let me show you that otherwise
make things easier for you don't worry
my dear friend this is not a profession
which will ditch you right look at that
there are huge huge seminars going on
across the globe NASSCOM has recently
conducted in Hyderabad here in India and
they say that by 2018 world is going to
see you a drastic death in the you know
skill call as data scientist 140
thousand to one ninety thousand skills
is what we are looking at the shortage
1.5 million managers would I mean this
is the kind of talent shortage that we
are looking at right so let me take
another question I've completed few
online courses on our d cheese like
Derrick camp you demean what all our
weakness standard so what you seduced me
to do me a decent hour program and tell
me this step yeah that is what you're at
Eureka people have already answered to
you the organizer has already answered
right so this course of a Eureka right
as all advanced concepts by the way in
our
Alejandro has a question that's answered
there which was as a question seems like
that is also answered their money she
has a question it's answered there
alright folks most of the questions most
of the questions are answered as a data
science which part of our ecosystem we
need to learn no there is nothing like
that you need to know end-to-end
basically right which part of our
ecosystem are is just one ecosystem
there it doesn't have many body call
flee was like your Hadoop has hive pig
right flume scoop and things like that
for our you do not have such things it's
not an ecosystem and i'm working on
microsoft technologies so how it will
help me work with are so if you know dot
net c sharp and all those languages
right it will be extremely easy for you
to write the code our studios open
source but statisticians would also draw
inferences based upon models and given
prediction prescription before data
science scheming right yeah they were
doing but why did they become relevant
in today's world because of the advent
of the data earlier they were doing that
no doubt about that but how many
organizations were having these kind of
data sources not many few years back how
many people had facebook account not me
what kind of companies are working on
our so Jenny I have told you about the
model right probably you have not heard
about that this recording will be shared
with you she can go through that model
is
addiction model prediction model if I
want to predict what my sales will be in
the future I build a prediction model
model is nothing but a name that's it
what will that do it is going to help
you predict what will be your sales who
is going to default on my loan whom
should I give the credit card right and
easy going to default on the credit card
right who is going to have what kind of
disease given the different diseases
that he has or the lifestyle he is
living in what about algorithms
algorithm is nothing but a code that you
write in our someone was saying hey show
me the code how do you write right so
let me show you that so let me quickly
show you that sociation rules right
there are these kind of packages which
are using are for example a rules
Association rules let me run that so
when you install a package right like a
rules and things like that let me show
you it has bunch of functions predefined
functions are code which is already
written in that if you see the thread
symbol that sees that yeah I'm
installing the package hold on if you do
not want to install the package you
click on the red symbol what is
happening now a package is getting
downloaded which contains the core which
people have already written which has
been approved by the core community of
our and do I need to write the code once
again know why can just reuse this I'll
show that while this is downloaded let
me take your questions where can I find
the details and commonly use our
packages please recommend the book to
follow Sean
rather than book right our has a lot of
information available there so I will
request you to look into our packages
only there are a lot of packages
available look at that just click on the
packages there on your are there will be
a lot of predefined or pre installed
packages these are the way these
packages if you want to read each and
every package click on that there's a
big description there right you can
click on packages once again let me take
example of correlogram wait it has
another bunch of examples right there
are a lot so a lot of such thing ggplot
you have another thing right oh you can
click on description file there there's
a lot of description about the ggplot
there there will be a lot of examples
available so it's an ocean entire ocean
is available for you here mapreduce no
map reduces hadoop system there you need
not even know about how to be eco system
right just the basic understanding would
do you need not even know about the map
and reduce because data scientist job is
different you do not get involved in
getting the data from the radius uses
and cleansing that to a great extent
your job is in building or your skills
line building the prediction models help
the business grew right is there a
professional certification know which
was if we compare her to panera which is
having better trained and scoop for job
how do piss different in your are is
different how to piss into your data
storage processing the data are is into
building your prediction models yep our
do we have package already exist for
function you're trying to write a mean
is there standard in commission for
packages right
you know when you install this RR is
free for install when you install there
are predefined you know packages which
people tend to frequently use which get
downloaded automatically you can start
accessing those yes but her loop is also
having different ecosystem for analyzing
the big data and article how do you
cannot build a prediction model for you
cos you cannot build a prediction model
for you Hadoop cannot do clustering for
you right it cannot run a linear
regression model for you so what are the
basic classes in are related to objects
right there are various things such as
vector list you have matrix you have a
data frame and things like that it's a
different topic altogether so I'll let
me load this track is there you know
once you install a package all you need
to do is load the package there once you
install this package here is a command
you load this someone was asking me to
show how easy is it to you know use are
so are also has a lot of in tville data
sources right if you just do that
command data the brackets you'll see a
lot of data files data sources right
which are there in our in tville for
your practice all you need to do is load
that particular data set by using this
command I'm loading the groceries data
set right once you load that you can
look into the some
three of that right it's going to give
you summary of the data how many
transactions right how many people have
purchased you know for example let me
show you here even before we so here is
a good example right he people have
purchased oj that is orange juice have
also purchased sudah people have
purchased milk and orange juice have
also purchased window cleaner people
have purchase orange juice have also
purchased detergent people have
purchased orange juice and detergent
have also purchase or out there so these
are the radius combinations right based
on those you can you know come up with
some kind of rules which says hey do you
know what stack orange juice and soda
together because people are purchasing
orange juice are most likely to purchase
or out there because in most places
they're doing soon so you come up with
those kind of association rules
basically right and look at that when
you draw that right you come up with
these kind of patterns are inducing
Torah or most likely purchase together
than any other two items in the list
right you come up with the skin rules
and then you have these kind of
statistics which is I will be getting
thousands of such transactions which
transactions do I need to really look
into so based on your support confidence
and lift values you you know pick up the
top most things for example this I'm
looking into the lift ratio the top
mostly freixa or the topmost conference
level and support and then that rule
will become significant from probably
the first room might say hey people are
purchasing orange juice and milk are
purchasing you're probably detergent for
example so you could come up with all
those kind of association rules
clustering is grouping of similar things
together like our it's already answered
there so r is limited in terms of your
big data right when you have humongous
data then R tends to crash that's the
limitation however what you can do is
you can increase the memory it's limited
r is my limited based on the memory that
you have if you have ram which is of
save 6400 gb and things like that then
it's going to make sense to process huge
gigabytes of data otherwise it might
tend to crash right and the solution is
given there try to execute using Hadoop
framework and then try to input that
another question is around all right
shanta your question is answered there
can we set up the are on commodity
hardware of course all the hardware is a
commodity nowadays right Kashyap the
cost of the hardware has decreased
significantly so yeah now what is it is
a commodity yes it can be installed you
can set up and use it on any of the
hardware's you can use it on Linux you
can use it on Macintosh you can use down
windows operating systems also any more
questions friends
so are you seeing me are you asking me
that you know can we install our in
different machine simultaneously start
using that I don't think so you can do
in that way but yes you can install in
multiple machine to use that you can do
get installing the cluster of machines
over here you need not have any
experience in our business analytics to
do this program right this business
analytics in our session provided by
eureka assumes that you do not know
anything and the concepts are taught
right from the basics you start off
right from what is business what is
analytics things like that bessemer book
ah if you can recommend any other
sources machine learning with our we can
try that the machine learning guitar any
guidance is for hardware requirement no
usually how much time it takes to master
our wits and it will take one enough
month or so but again it depends on the
amount of time that you're investing
right but to be at a normal piece you
know to come up to a certain stage right
you need to spend one enough two months
there but cannot develop rossi no you
cannot do pilar processing like a hadoop
right you cannot do that e stato are are
good for economic modeling it's are you
can do economic modeling here also you
in our can do that submit
I don't know are in stance is it a good
idea to become Anita scientist it's a
relatively new concept here in the world
it's in the relatively new concept no
one new data scientist as a professional
Sophie just two years back it has just
picked up so everyone is new to our own
stats most of them looking at the kind
of you know shortage we are going to see
it's the most happening profession and
yes you can push you that what are the
statistical announces when you cover in
business analytics in our so
bhuvaneshwari will look into using our
will look into the elementary statistics
right from there descriptive statistics
your data visualization using are
looking into your box broad histogram
rug blood in all that and then we will
look into data mining concepts
unsupervised learning wearing you look
into association rules you look into
k-means clustering then we move on to
linear regression logistic regression
and then you get into you know data
mining supervised learning there we can
do paddle processing using Domino and
h2o when I am not sure whether you're
speaking about lotus domino sir was
there IBM lotus domino service or not
sure what you're speaking about there we
need which was approximately eration of
preparation required right for
opportunism it all depends on your
foreign average user a student right I
would say two months data scientist
obviously is in huge demand rajan
some good sites where lon so Shantha you
know what you can do is the lot of
websites basically you can look into our
stack stack overflow also has a lot of
information right yes we did this
particular cross business analytics with
our focuses majorly on our right to give
you that additional edge janish where
you can just search business analytics
with our statistics with order a bunch
of books right and every book is
superior in its own respect so I cannot
suggest any one book or few books there
but there are 20 of that duration and
the course fee probably business
analytics with our includes your
statistics also all the domains have
equal importance yeah financial domain
would be good you know energy sector
life sciences health care retail wearing
likes of amazon flip your ebay things
like that you know prefer a lot of data
scientist
oh there are a lot of opportunities we
gain health care sector I've shown you
one example from health care sector only
right so there are a lot of
opportunities in healthcare sector so we
do you need to know one of the
statistical tools were and i would
suggest are and you need to know
statistics and data mining all these
three are included in this program
looking into the market demand they have
composed this program which a eureka
provides online training yes money
session is our plus for one hour it's
one of 20 minutes now alright folks
thank you so much for attending the
session hope it has given you some
insights on what business analytics is
and how it's going to help you in the
long run thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
