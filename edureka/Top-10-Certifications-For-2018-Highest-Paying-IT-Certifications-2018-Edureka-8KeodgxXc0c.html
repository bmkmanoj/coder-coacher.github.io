My name is SAURABH, and today I will be talking
about TOP 10 CERTIFICATIONS.
In my previous video, I discussed about various
career paths.
But the question is, &quot;How to make a career in
that technology&quot;?
We notice people have a lot of doubts regarding
how should they begin their career.
Or are there any Certifications?
So, this is the motivation behind making this
video.
So, let's begin with our list.
We will start with Programming Certifications.
A programming language is the soul of any
Technology that has ever taken change.
Wikipedia defines Programming language as
a formal language that specifies a set of
instructions that can be used to produce various
kinds of outputs.
They are used to create programmes that implement
specific algorithms.
So it is but obvious that Programming Language
which will never go out of demand.
So, I have listed down a few popular programming
languages, that you need to get certified
into to boost your career.
We have PYTHON, JAVA, C#, SWIFT, SCALA,
R, SAS, JAVA SCRIPT and TYPE SCRIPT, which
are the most hottest languages to upscale yourself.
All the above certifications cost somewhere
around $100-$250 per exam.
So, stop thinking so much, up skill and go
ahead.
Next, we are going to talk about DEVOPS.
DEVOPS is not about one single tool, it is
not owned by one single Organization.
Since it is a practice and involves multiple
tools, there are Certifications for each and
every tool separately.
The popular tools whose certifications are
valued the most are those of JENKINS, DOCKER,
PUPPET, CHEF, and KUBERNETES.
&quot;Certified Jenkins engineer certification&quot;
offered by Cloudbees costs somewhere around
$200.
DOCKER certified associate level certification
is $195.
Meanwhile, &quot;System Administration using Puppet&quot;
is the certification for Puppet and the
cost somewhere around $200.
The Certification cost for the &quot;Certified
Chef Developer&quot; is $175.
Finally, the Certification cost for &quot;Kubernetes
certified administrator exam&quot; is $300.
Remember, before going for any certification,
you should have 1-3 years of experience working
with that tool, while also having strong IT
administration skills.
Let's see, what we have next in our list?
So, now I am going to talk about BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE and EXTRACT TRANSFORM LOAD (ETL)
tools.
With the amount of data stored by companies
growing exponentially, it is no surprise that
finding the right data Management solution
continuously show up on the priority list
of CIOs.
Companies need to translate Data into information
to plan for future business strategies.
A BI solution helps in producing accurate
reports by extracting data directly from your
data source.
It reduces the scope of error by providing
Managers with accurate data to make better
decisions on what is happening now and a forecast
for the future.
Getting all that Data into one central place
is a great challenge.
Using the extract, out of the extract-transform-load
will solve that problem.
This would help get you Data, different Data
sources into one homogenous format.
There are many BI and ETL tools in the market,
but the prominent ones are POWER BI, PENTAHO
BI, SAS, TABLEAU, INFORMATICA, IBM cognos,
QLIKVIEW, Microsoft BI, TERADATA.
They have their individual certifications
but clear those certifications you need a
structure training.
Next we are going to talk about BIG- DATA
certifications.
So, according to folks, Big data and Hadoop
Market is expected to reach 99.31 billion
by 2022.
And Mckenzie predicts that by 2018, there
will be a shortage of 1.5 million big data
experts.
If you pursue a big data Hadoop certification,
you are recognized in the industry as a capable,
Qualified Big data expert.
There are 2 major Hadoop certifications namely,
CLOUDERA and HORTONWORKS.
Along with these two, EDUREKA provides Hadoop
certification training that covers up the
similar curriculum, updated as per the industry
de-facto and helps you clearing the Cloudera
and Hortonworks hadoop certifications quite
easily.
CCA, Cloudera certified associate Exams, test
your basic foundations skills, and sets forth
the ground work for a candidate to certified
in CCP, which is; Cloudera certified professional
programme.
Cloudera has three certifications namely:
CCA spark and Hadoop developers, CCA data
analyst and CCA administrator.
There are five Hadoop certification providers
by HORTONWORKS - HDB certified developer,
HDB certified apache spark developer, HDB
certified java developer, HDB certified Administrator,
and HORTONWORK certified associate.
Let's see what we have next in our list.
And now we are going to talk about &quot;WEB DEVELOPMENT&quot;.
As you know there always has been a high demand
for good web developers.
Many of you would have learnt the fundamental
web development on your own.
But, one should not stop at this stage.
The next best thing for you is to get certified.
This will really boost your career and will
eventually leave you to earn more money.
The most popular web developing certification
are - Adobe certified Expert certification,
Microsoft developer certification namely Microsoft
technology associate and Microsoft certified
solution developer, Google Developer certification
for Web Development, and Zend Certified PHP
Engineer.
All these certifications cost around $100
to $200 per exam, the requisite for these
certifications varies.
But all of them requires good knowledge of
fundamentals that is HTML and Java script.
Work experience 1 to 3 years will surely be
a big help.
You would already be familiar with best code
practices.
After clearing this certification exam you
can, for sure, expect hike of 20% to 30%.
Let's talk about PROJECT MANAGEMENT.
So, behind every successful IT project, there
will be a highly skilled project manager working
from behind the scenes.
PMI (Project management Institute) avails
wide range of certifications in the field
of Project management of which, the most popular
ones are PMP [Professional management professional
certification], ACP [Agile certified practitioner],
CAMP [Certified associate in Project Management],
and so on.
The fees or cost of each of these certification
varies from certification to certification.
But common range is somewhere around $200-
$1400.
In order to apply for these certifications,
all you need is to have proper Education and
Experience in domain of the applied certification.
Let's talk about DATA SCIENCE.
So, DATA SCIENCE is too vast to make one skill
evaluated by one or two Data Science certifications.
However, a Data Scientist certificate gives
you that extra edge over the talented pool,
assuring the Big Data Recruiters that you
have real time competence to do Data Science
in a Smarter, Faster and Optimized way.
There are no standard Industry recognizable
Data Scientist certification Programmes.
However, I had picked to you the best Data
science and Data analytics certifications
that one can choose from after a taking Comprehensive
Data Science Training Course.
First one is Cloudera Certified Professional
Data Scientist [CCP: DS], other certifications
are Cloudera Johns Hopkins Data Sciences Certification,
EMC Data Science Associate, INFORMS Certified
Analytics Professional [CAP].
You need to be an expert in all the skills
that I have mentioned in this slide.
For that, you can go ahead, and look for structured
training on Data Science with EDUREKA.
The Course is highly aligned with the Official
certifications.
You need to have good Knowledge in Statistics,
Programming, Machine Learning algorithms,
Data Visualization, Big Data, Data Ingestion,
Munging, and Tool Box, and data driven problem
solving approach is very- very important for
a Data Scientist.
Let's see what we are talking about next.
Now it's the time to talk about NETWORKING
certifications.
One of the largest Categories of IT certifications
and thus, IT careers have to be networking.
There are different certifications available
for different levels of expertise in Networking,
that is, whether your are someone who is looking
to make a career in Networking or you are
already in the Networking domain, and looking
to upgrade your skills, there is certification
available for each of your requirements.
Some of the most popular certifications in
networking are Cisco certified internet work
expert (CCIE), Cisco certified network Profession
(CCNP), Network+ Wireshark certified Network
analyst (WCNA).
These Certifications would be in the range
of somewhere around $300 to $400, and will
require you to have good knowledge in topics
such as Routing and switching Network security
to pass the certification exam.
So now, we are going to talk about SECURITY
certifications.
SECURITY certifications are more popularly
known as Information security certifications.
So, few of the most sought-after security
certifications are CISSP (Certified Information
System security Professional), CISM (Certified
Information Security Manager), CISA (Certified
Information Systems Auditor) and CEH (Certified
Ethical Hacker).
The cost of these certifications may vary,
but most of the certifications lie in the
range of $600 to $800.
Salary hike may be based on skill-set and
experience, but on an average, the employee
should expect a hike of 30%-50% on their salaries.
It is Mandatory that you have at least 5 years
of experience to get these certifications.
And at least 1-2 years of experience that
is Domain specific to the certification one
opts for.
Some certification also requires you to have
Domain Specific Bachelor degree as well.
This is all about Security certifications.
Finally, we are going to talk about, CLOUD
Certification.
As we know that most of the companies are
moving their Infrastructure on CLOUD, there
is a high requirement in the industry for
CLOUD computing experts.
As we know that most of the companies are
moving there Infrastructure on CLOUD, and
there are a lot of certifications out there
in the market provided by various Vendors.

certified sub-specialist implementing, Microsoft
AZURE Infrastructure solution.
So let's talk about the certifications provided
by Google Cloud platform, there are Cloud
Architect, Data Engineer, G-Suite Admin, and
G-Suite Certification.
All these Certifications will range some were
around $100-$250, and the kind of skill-sets
you require, depends on the kind of certification
