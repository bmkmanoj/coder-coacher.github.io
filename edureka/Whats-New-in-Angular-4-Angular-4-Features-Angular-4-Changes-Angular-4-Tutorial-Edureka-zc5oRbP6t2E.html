Eddie Rica today's session is all about
verse new and angular for this session
is going to very interesting guy so
without any further delay let's move on
and look at the agenda for today's
session we'll first go through the
angular release and know about the
release plan then we'll discuss about
why is it not angular 3 and why is it
angular 4 then moving on we'll
understand what are the new features in
angular fo and at last we'll go through
a demo in which we learn how to upgrade
an angular 2 out to angular for so are
we clear in this agenda right so
everyone seems pretty much clear let's
move forward so let us understand how
angular 4 came into picture but I would
first like to tell you a story back in
September when angular 2 was trying to
release the angular team also announced
they will be switching to semantic
versioning as the name already suggests
semantic versioning is all about adding
meaning to the version numbers a
semantic versioning consists of
basically numbers the left-hand side
number this is for past upgradation
so in patch update is basically for bug
fixes and this is not a breaking change
a breaking change happens whenever you
as a developer or as a consumer of
collaterally have to step in and adjust
your code after a version upgrade then
we have this middle number for minor of
predation so if a new feature is added
you increase the second number and
whenever you release a breaking change
you have to increase this first number
so this first number is basically for
breaking change and the second and third
number is not for the breaking came the
second is for minor upgradation and the
third is for pass upgradation
now let me take an example for a clear
understanding for an example even just
upgrading angular type script
dependencies from version one point
eight to version 2.2 and combining its
angular would technically cause and
breaking change so this time another
community is taking this semantic
versioning pretty much seriously guys so
now let us move forward so now this is a
tentative release red use for angular
the fact that breaking change will
arrive does not mean that they will
arrive every other week the angular team
committed to a time-based kind of
release that offers increase AI kills
the first is patch releases that is for
every week then we have three months
minor release after every major
and then we have a major release which
will be done in every six month so as
you can see here guys angular four is
releasing March : 70 in the last week I
think then we have angle of fines which
we'll be releasing in September 2010
then we have angular 6 for March 18 and
angular 7 for october 80 so this is a
tentatively scheduled which angular
community has given us then let us move
forward and look why is it not Angela 3
and why is it angular 4 so what happened
due to this misalignment of router
package versioning the team decided to
go straight to Angela for so as you can
see here we have a dependency that we
have the module or you can see the basic
angular modules which have version 2 as
you can see that we have version 2 point
3 point zero and this all angular
modules but except in the south we have
angular three point three point zero so
due to this they thought that in this
way again all the core packages are
aligned which will be easier to maintain
and help avoid this missed confusion in
the future so are we clear with this
angular 3 but why is it not angular 3
and why is a triangular pole but before
moving on guys I like to hear something
on Google applications use angular
version equal to the current github
master branch now you can save the
angular repository in github whenever
new commit lines in master it will be
integrated with Google single giant mono
repository because they have a mono
repository for this angular where also
other products such as Maps and Adsense
etcetera are there as a consequence all
of the project using angular internally
at Google will run this extensive test
shoots against new versions this team
basically make sure that they are
confident about the new angular
application and they can easily
incorporate those changes into Google so
thus they have a live version totally
make sense and it is easier to maintain
them over time which turns help the team
to be more productive and releasing new
updates so the first feature of angular
4 is smaller and faster so before
talking about smaller and faster I would
like to talk about JIT compiler which is
just in time compiler so in JIT compiler
we use take longer to render because of
the in BA
compliation steps the application is
bigger because it includes the angular
compiler and a lot of library code that
the application won't actually need so
what happens the bigger your application
is longer it takes to transmit and our
store to load so this is why JIT
compilation incurs a runtime performance
penalty so on the second part
compilation can uncover many components
template binding errors JIT compilation
discovers them at runtime which is
pretty much late in the process on the
other hand we have IOT compilers that is
ahead of time compiler it could catch
the errors or you can see the template
errors earlier and improve the
performance by compiling at Build time
there is actually one angular compiler
the difference between a OT and JIT is
the matter of timing and tooling with
aut the compiler runs once ad built I am
using one set of libraries but in case
of JIT it runs every time for every user
using a different set of library so the
benefit it is faster rendering fewer
synchronous requests you have smaller
bundle size or you get the smaller
angular framework download size then you
can detect your template errors earlier
and at last you have better security by
using this IOT compiler then the VOD
compilation sets the stage for further
optimization also guys and this is
called tree shaking so what happens in
this tree shaking condition guys a tree
shaker box the dependency graph top to
bottom and sheikhs out the unused codes
like dead leaves in the tree tree
shaking can greatly reduce the download
size of the application by removing the
unused portions of both your source as
well as your library codes in fact most
of the reduction in small halves comes
from the removing unreferenced angular
features for an example in your demo
application you are not using angular
forms library so there is no reason to
download forms related angular code and
tree shaking ensures that you don't
so basically tree shaking and hero
decompilation of separate steps tree
shaking can only target javascript code
and a ot compilation converts more of
the application to JavaScript which in
turns makes a lot of application
procedure so coming back to the slide
guide
the community have made some changes in
this kod code which is generated these
changes basically reduces the size of
generated code of your competence by
around 60% in the most cases the most
complex your template are the higher are
your savings during the release
candidate period they found that a
developers that are migrating from
angular 2 to angular 4 reduce their
production bundles by hundred of
kilobytes so let us take a look at
practically how they do that we'll go to
our node.js CMD I'll navigate to my
directory
now in create a
using angular spoke so the command is ng
new and the project name is Ed Eureka
and I'll use - hyphen G for to make sure
that this is angular for application so
now the application is created I will
navigate to my application directory
that is Rebecca and now we'll install
the dependencies using NPM install
command meanwhile I will take you to my
project
which I just created I would like to
show you this packet or JSON file so in
this packet or Jason size you can see
that all the modules the based on
angular code or you can see the version
is full so this is the basically change
guys in package modulation that your
dependencies has upgraded to angular 4
and other dependencies are based on
angular 4 so the version is full so let
us go back to our node J CMD
so now that dependencies have been
installed let us host this application
okay let us go to a browser now
we will go at localhost 4200
and this is the demo application
the sample application so will you close
this application so now using ng build
command I will build this application
- action will be to use you decompiler
so now let us go back to a folder where
we created this project we'll go inside
in the project and this is the folder
which is created that is distributable
folder we look at the properties and now
you can see here that it has a size of
2.8 6 MB so now what we'll do we'll go
back we will delete this distributable
folder
now let's open the project I will change
all the dependencies to 2
I receive this file I will go back to
the node.js CMD now I will uninstall it
dependencies using NPM install command
now here the cash
nbm cash a clean command
now we'll again install the dependencies
using NPM install command
you
so now that I have installer
dependencies let us quickly go and host
our application using NPM start command
you
so let us go back to our browser again
again you reload this page and yes this
is working so now I will just close this
application
I will build using engine build command
and I specify the compiler as a would be
you
okay so that we have to build our
application we'll go back to our folder
and this is the distributable folder
that is being created so let us look at
the properties of this folder and now
over here you can see the size of the
folder is 3.25 so as earlier you can
remember using angular for the build was
approximately around 2.8 6 MB and by
using angular 2 the grid lists around
3.2 4 MB so you can look at the
difference guide this is the difference
as you can see that that the butter size
has been decreased but as this is a
small project or you can see the demo
project so you can't see that much
effect or - much difference so I'll be
clear this smaller and faster part guys
ok so everyone is pretty much clear let
us move to our next topic which is a
deviation package so now what has
happened that angular community pulled
this animation package out of the
angular core package and placed it into
its own package or you can say this
animation package is a new package this
means that if you don't use animation
this extra code will not end up in your
production bundles you can add animation
sources to your old energy module by
importing browser animation module from
angular class from browser slash
animations and you can see in this road
guide that we are importing this
animates States style transition
trailers from this animation package
which has been moved out of this angle
whole package so that if we can use this
animation inside our code I'll also take
you through one of my project I'll open
a new project
so now inside this project I will take
you through my DS file
so in this component or TS file you can
see that we are importing the animation
package from this angular code so this
has been deprecated so we are doing this
but now we should move this thing out so
I will get all this packages from here
and now I will place it into animation
package
and I will import it from animation
module that is
angular class animations
you
now let's save this file and I will go
back to my package or Jason
so as you can see we have imported this
animation you can use NPM install and
you're a droid language / animations
command and using - app and save you can
save it in your package or JSON file
also so I will go back to my app
component or PS file
you
our triggers states that animate and
transition from our angular flash
animations and over here as you can see
we are including this animation
decorator over here and inside this
layer specifying the triggers we are
specifying the stage which is inactive
here and the background we have given
the hash code and again we are making a
new state that is active and again we
have given the background color and
transformation for that they have also
given the transition that is while it is
inactive it will go to active and while
it is active it will go again back to
inactive so are we clear guides with
this animation package so now let us
move forward to our next feature that is
enhanced ng-if and ng form so now what
is happening in this earlier we are
having this ng kiss command using which
you can check any statement but you
don't have an else command so you have
to use the opposite in ng if again but
now angular community has incorporated
this else command also so in this code
as you can see we are using an NG here
and we are checking towards this user
list and EarthLink as user and if this
statement is false we'll go back to the
else statement which is loading and this
loading is basically attacked which will
load this ng template as buspar safai
and this loading block over here so we
have one more feature that is assigned
open variables such as well and runing
and observe it so you can create a loop
and variables as you can be in this ng
for statement you are creating a user as
a local variable or file you are using
an observables you can also use a local
variable to specify your of the
variables so let us go back to our fold
so I would like to show you this ng if
now in this template you can see that we
are using this ng if and this is 2nd
valid identity title exists it will
print the title with the interpolation
and s if this condition or if this title
does not exist until load this building
block and hit will print loading dot or
dot so I'll save this thing first we go
back to our node.js CMD and let us
execute or was this application so I
will first navigate to the application
that is angular project
the artist application using NPM start
so now let's go back to our browser
so tighten this hello angular and this
is printing hello angular again let us
go back to our project
so now after change this title title
button which does not exist so what it
will do it will load the else part
I'll save this file I'll go back to my
browser and as you can see guys over
here that the title is printed hello
angular and then the second part is
printing loading and this is because you
do not have title 1 so it is printing
the else part which is loading so are we
clear in this else part guys how this
else part works ok everyone looks pretty
much clear so let us move back to our
slide again so now moving forward we
have form features so now in this form
feature guys what is happening we have
the reactive forms that are code based
counterparts of declarative template
driven forms so you can easily create
forms inside your templates using this
ng form now let us take a look at this
example so that you can clearly
understand here we are creating a form
we are giving the name of this honest
email form and we are binding it depends
upon the type of bit or you can say the
input type is email and we are binding
is using ng model this input type we are
giving the field as required so you
cannot leave this email input type empty
then we are binding this name this email
at last we are giving an input button
that is somewhere to validate this email
now what is happening here we have an
email validator in this form which will
automatically validate this emails so
earlier what they are using we were
using regular expressions to value those
emails but now it is pretty much easier
with email dilator to validate those
emails so this has been easier and this
email valuator has been introduced in
our form features now before moving on I
would like to tell you one more change
that has been done in angular for other
documentation samples have been realized
with a default folder structure of the
angular CLI so now all the samples have
been moved to source folder as the
project route the former app folder is
now moved inside your source folder
basically your
main door ts5 has moved insider source
main door TS file then your our
directory has moved inside your source
folder which is a source / app directory
and you are facing all your ports or you
are building all your ports inside this
our directory inside your source folder
you have your index dot HTML file you
have your style or CSS you have two TS
third conflict or JSON file you also
have a system J s dot conflict or GS
file which now impose main J's instead
of app and at last we have also added a
light server configuration file that is
ps1 Pig or JSON file to serve our source
folder so are we clear with this new
alignment of the structure guys okay
Thomas is clear Michael says all clear
okay guys let us move to our next
feature which is style trip
compatibility so now in this side trip
compatibility touch it has been moved to
two point one and two point two so in
two point two we have some changes like
Dom API is in the standard library then
in two point one we have extended
building functions like error at a Maps
no longer working the generated code or
you can they say the generated
constructor could substitute the return
value of super cause at test so they're
pretty much changes in typescript to one
and two point two or you can say they
are pretty much up gradation so you and
II use it easily so earlier your angular
2 was built on typescript 1.8 so now to
use typescript 2.1 or 2.2 compatibility
you have to build your angular fold with
2.1 2.2
so this is what the angular community
did they compile angular fourth with
typescript 2.1 and two points to so that
you can use disaster 2 1 1 and 2.2
features inside your angular four
projects now doing this they have
improved the speed of NDC and you will
get a better type checking throughout
your application basically ng c is a
drop-in replacement for TS c which is a
types of compiler and is configured much
in the same way and this requires its
own TS conflict or json file which is
nice trip configuration file and you can
also
ts conflicted Asian file with your äôt
oriented settings so javi clear decisive
compatibility
okay everyone looks pretty much clear
nah let us move forward to our next
topic that is source Maps so first I
would like you to know what is source
map a source map is a file that maps
from the transform source to a original
source enabling the browser to
reconstruct the original source and
present the reconstructed original in
the debugger now when there is an error
caused by something inside your
templates we generate a source map or
you can say the angular generate a
source map that gives a meaningful
context in term of original templates so
what is happening actually over here if
you are changing something in template
and I generate the source map so while
you're changing something and it is
generating an error your source map is
generate a meaningful context in terms
of your error so that you can understand
your error pretty much easily and it
will just point out to your original
template where the error has been
occurring so we'll look at this example
we'll go back to our code so now let us
go to a half component or TS file and
I'll open my node J CMD
now as you can see what I will do I will
just remove this component and I will
save this file okay so now that the
school with NPM start come out
you
so we got an error as we were expecting
so the error is that in the line nine
and the second world that is component
cannot find this component so this is
the adder and as you can see this is
exactly reflecting from your typescript
files
so let us go back to our file and you
can see this component this is in red
what it is saying that your component
has not been referred or you haven't
imported or confident from the code so
if you will import your component from
your code you will remove this error
okay so as you can see that the error
are pretty much giving a meaningful
context so this is the change that has
been done with the source maps so before
moving on I would like to say that that
time we the community is doing a pretty
good work because they have been showing
us the error or you can say that they
have been showing us the exact error
that we are going through so now let us
move forward to our next topic which is
packaging changes so first we have slide
es modules or you can also call it as a
CSM so they now chip plot and version of
our modules this format should help tree
shaking and it helps in reducing the
size of your generated Versalles and
speed up your build transpilation and
loading in the browser in certain
scenarios so as we just talked about
tree shaking part so this is basically
for helping your tree shaking part so
that you don't have to create a large
project or you don't have to create this
large size of bundles then you can
create a smaller size of bundles so that
you can easily speed ever build a
process transformation process and it
would be easier for your client to load
it inside the browser then we have this
experimental es2015 build so what they
are doing here they are shipping a
package in the 2015 flat gsm format this
option is experimental and often so
basically they are just testing this
package that will it work fine or not so
developers have reported up to 7% bundle
size saving when combined this packages
with roll-up to try out this new
packages consider your build tool chain
to resolve es2015 property in your
package or Jason over the regular module
property then you also have experimental
closure compatibility the closure
compiler can use data type information
about JavaScript variable to provide
enhanced optimization and boardings
JavaScript however has no way to declare
types because javascript has no syntax
for declaring the types of variable you
must use comment in the code to specify
the data type so the closure compiler
type language derives from the
annotations you
the GS Docs document generation tools
all our code now has closer annotations
making it possible to take advantage of
advanced cloaking optimization resulting
in smaller bundle sizes and better tree
shaking so are they clear in this
packaging guys how this experimental
es2015 build is working and how is the
slide ESM or you can say heavy item
module is working with our annual folk
so now let let us move to our next topic
which is pretty much interesting that is
of relation to angular 4 as we just
discussed in this session you don't have
to rewrite your application to move from
angular 2 bland Euler code you just have
to install your dependencies based on
Hangul Defoe so these are the steps that
you installing your dependencies that is
angular common address latest which will
give you the latest and the common
modules and image will give you the
latest angular compiler module similarly
you are updating all of your modules to
your latest versions that is for so
we'll do this in a way right so let us
move forward to the next slide which is
creating an another for application so
we have go to this command guys ng new
Angela for demo and - LNG food so
earlier we use ng new command to create
a new project using angular CLI that
only changes you are using - - ng food
to create an alert or application
otherwise you can do one thing also guys
that you can upgrade your angular CLI
using NPM install added angular slash
rely and the read latest so that you
will globally install your angular CLI -
version 4 and then if you're creating a
project it was created on angular 4 so
are we clear with this guys how to
create a project using angular for or
how to create a project is in angular
CLI
can you guys give me a quick
confirmation so that we can move forward
ok so everyone is pretty much clear
thank you for acknowledging guys let us
move forward and this is the pretty much
interesting part of our session that is
upgrading an angular 2 application to an
angular for application so now let us go
to our project which I create
I'll open the project
okay so this is our project I will go to
a package or JSON file as you can see
here that we have all the dependencies
that is on angular 2 so we'll go to our
node J CMD so we will first hold this
application and look at it using NPM
start command
you
now let's go back to our browser
so as you can see this is our project
this is a basic directive project so
here we are using directive if you are
changing the color the highlighting
color is changed so let us get back to
our angular zeolite
we'll stop hosting this project
now we'll upgrade all this dependencies
to angular for so
I use NPM install command to install for
the dependencies first
you
now I will clean the cashier using NPM -
a clean command
you
now let's move other dependencies to
angular 4 so I will use npm install'
first one is angular common
and I will use at the rate latest so
that it could get angular for
dependencies
then we have an Euler compiler
you
similarly we'll update all the angular
modules that are present here and at
last I will use - - save
to save it inside our package or decent
file
you
so now let's go back to our package or
distant file
and as you can see over here all the
dependencies are upgraded to angle of
four you can do it manually inside this
package rotation file but I would
suggest you to do it using your node GS
CMD so that you can get the latest
packet that has been used
so again we'll go to back to our no DSC
empty we have installed all the new
packages so now if you're going to host
this application using NPM start
you
and yes it has been successfully hosted
we'll go back to our browser
okay so we'll reload this address again
and yes we have successfully migrated
our angular 2 app to angular 4 and this
thing is working completely fine as we
can see so it is pretty much easier to
upgrade from angular 2 to angular 4 and
you can also compare it with angular 1
to angular 2 that is from angular JS to
angular 2 it was a complete rewrite and
in this situation you just have to
complete all your dependencies yes there
are some duplications
but that abrogation don't matter for now
you can upgrade those instances in a
while you don't have to update it
immediately but yes you can do it in
future so are we clear with this uh
predation part how to upgrade an
application to amulet oh ok so everyone
is pretty much clear let us move back to
our slide so I hope you must be clear
with this angular for and what are the
new features in angular 4 so are there
any questions eyes so everyone seems
pretty much clear guys but if you have
any queries you can reach area later
supporting 2407 the email address is
support and written Eureka Turku they
are available 24/7 so thank you everyone
have a nice day
