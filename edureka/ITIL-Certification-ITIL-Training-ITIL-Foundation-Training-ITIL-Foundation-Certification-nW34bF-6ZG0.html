ITIL an IT Service Management we're
going to talk about ITIL v3 foundation
and what are the certifications that can
take you to the expert we're going to
talk about what are the carrier
opportunities and IT Service Management
landscape we will talk about the raker
training program and schedule and how is
it different and what can you expect and
we will then go with Q&amp;amp;A so we are in
the service management so people we get
on I want to talk about ITIL now IPIN
stands for IT infrastructure library so
primarily item was a best practice
framework that was developed for
infrastructure management aspects so
let's talk about what you mean by
infrastructure management mean if you
look at any IT services that we are
providing or any services that we are
providing there is a whole lot of
infrastructure that is required so if
you look at there is a server for
example the email service that you are
having has got an exchange server and
that is connected through your network
in terms of land man that is local area
network or wide area network you also
have virtual environments VMs we have
security aspects that means opening the
firewall ports making sure that required
access is being given you all have
different servers like Windows servers
unique servers and boxes that are where
your applications or services are being
hosted storage we are talking about Big
Data we are talking about large storage
in terms of your mailboxes all elements
that you are able to store in databases
and various file systems we are also
talking about monitoring alerting and
notifications that means if you have
your own mission critical systems that
are delivering these services then we
need to know whether your services are
up and running is that something which
is a down that means can I raise a
ticket to resolve it so you look at look
at it
broadly these are some of the areas what
I meant to see as far as infrastructure
management now the infrastructure
management idle is going to talk about
best practice processes in which these
infrastructure components can be
addressed so for example if a server
goes down how quickly are able to revert
or get back the server up and running
what are the issues that we face in
terms of resolving it within the agreed
time lines so that these best practice
processes helps to manage the IT
infrastructure better now if you look at
from an organizational need and that's
the context that we are coming here as
to why we need to be ITIL certified or
what is the need for you as professional
to get yourself qualified as an IT IL
foundation level or intermediate or
expert if you look at any organization
that you work for an employer they want
to look at building highly effective
workforce now the highly effective
workforce cannot be developed until you
have the option of getting the right
staff the right roles with the required
capability skills and competencies to
deliver so so the organization's are
continuously evaluating what do we have
today
what do we need tomorrow and how do we
improve so they are looking out for
professionals who are certified who have
the required knowledge to deliver
services seamlessly and build more
customer satisfaction so that is the
order of the day in which we are
understanding the context of the
organization and there is a need field
to get ourselves trained and certified
in some of these elements so that you
can deliver your work much efficiently
to the satisfaction of your seniors so
what is idle or ITIL iclear stands for
IT infrastructure like
so it's a best practice framework so
there are different versions it started
from version 1 and now we are into
version 3 and the latest is the 2011
version the primary objective of having
this best practice framework is focused
on delivering superior customer service
using streamline processes now if I give
a simple example if you are calling some
support beams and you want the immediate
response and you want them to follow up
and say ok this is was your issue that
you reported this is a ticket number and
we will get this resolved within within
for us and then they call you back and
say this ticket is resolved can you
please check can confirm so how does it
make that you get a consistent way of
addressing your issues giving a proper
feedback mechanism and close looping it
so that you are able to enjoy the
services that you get so it is not only
with ID this framework or best practice
framework can be adopted and has been
adopted widely across all industries
that we talked about healthcare
construction telecom ID and so on and so
forth so if you look at what is ITIL
version 3 contains it was developed by
OGC which is the office of government
commerce which is based out of UK London
so it's a nonprofit organization that
that was primarily doing this and then
now it's been the owners of itíll now
is axel Oz now axel oz own the
intellectual property for the ITIL core
volumes now there are five core volumes
so on the right-hand side you are able
to see some big boxes so it starts with
service strategy then you have service
design which is the red book red arrow
then we have service transition then
service operation and encompassing that
is the continual service improvement so
these are five core volumes or core
books that I tell v3 comprises and every
section has got underneath processes
okay so we will go into that detail if
you will enter an exam perspective
it starts with ITIL v3 foundation that
is the course that you are going to get
enrolled so you get a basic idea of all
the code volumes that we talked about
strategy design transition operation
then you can go about making yourself to
an intermediate expert and then a master
now these are exams that are that are
taken to get yourself qualified they are
typically multiple-choice questions that
you can go and up yourself so these are
starting as a total strategy design
transition operations and continual
service improvement so underneath every
service there are processes so for
example just to give you one example
service operation that means you are
reporting an issue for example you are
subscribed to a broadband service now in
your system that broadband is not
working so you call up the telecom
operator and ask them my broadband
service or I am NOT able to access
internet so you call the telecom
provider the telecom provider says ok
this is an incident so I agree
syndicated and says this is a priority
ticket this is the time window that you
get resolved so the entire process from
racing a ticket to getting it resolved
will be done as part of incident
management like that we have several
processes that will address from the
starting point to the end objective so
what is we talked about ITIL which is a
best practice framework there is also
something called as IT Service
Management now IT Service Management per
se he is talking about the
implementation aspect using these best
practice framework you cannot implement
I did but you can use those best
practice processes and then go there and
implement in your organization so when I
say
in your organization you are going to
implement the best practice process that
means you use the citta scored policies
you have structured processes you use
people process technology to deliver
outcomes right so IT Service Management
is the practical aspect of leveraging
the best practice framework which is
ITIL into your workplace to deliver
appropriate business outcomes now if you
look at the IT Service Management and if
you look at doing business with some of
the service providers or vendors how do
you ensure that they are able to deliver
consistent quality of service with
streamline processes and stuff so
iso/iec which is the international
standard organization International
electronic Committee which is talking
about a twenty thousand standard which
will certify your organization's on best
practice processes so all the there are
14 processes that will get certified
saying that they are compliant with the
ITIL based practice processes and so
your organization gets a certificate
called iso/iec 20000 now there's iso/iec
20000 is for an organization for a
service that you provide okay so that
could be done for an internal IT or it
could be delivered for your external
customers now the essential element of
looking at service management is looking
at four key aspects we have called it as
four piece of service management so if
you want to deliver the service you need
have people that means you need to have
people with the right skills
competencies attitude you need to have
well-defined process that means each and
every step or issue that has been
handled is handle consistently the same
manner across the organization and you
use tools products means tools so you
can use your own service management tool
you can technologies to help deliver
business outcomes and you also need
partners for example you have your
service provider
and you will have partners who are
providing network for providing
infrastructure for providing HR services
so all these people together will make
deliver the service to your end
customers at the end of the day we are
all here to serve our customers so if we
want to have good customer service we
need to focus on all these four elements
to deliver the best customer service for
our customers it could be internal
customers or it could be external
customers now this is just a segment in
which your IT services are looking like
so because so you have services like
enterprise computing services we have
infrastructure security services you
have network services and end-user
services so if you are from an
infrastructure management background
these are the underneath layers of how
they manage these services so for
example you can manage the entire data
basis of your customer so you have a
data center which contains all these
servers network storage all that sub you
monitor and see how this works similarly
you can manage your desktops laptops and
an Active Directory network meaning
wireless local area network so all that
stuff so within a service portfolio you
can make this title based managed
services and then you start defining
best practice process of how you will
handle these services to ensure that
everything is delivered on time with a
required amount of efficiency in meeting
the agreed
targets okay so in terms of landscape
you can be doing internal IT or external
IT in that internal IT we are talking
about in a catering to some of the your
own internal employees so you can
implement process you can burn up tools
and you can provide support someone is
saying their support specialist you can
support your network database intra you
can also do consulting those best
practices of how to streamline process
you can also do audits
so on and so forth so these are some of
the landscape mode that you have if you
look at an ox structure if you look at
an item or IT Service Management based
organization you have the head of IT and
then you have service manager which is
called IT Service Management then you
have development manager who's looking
at more of application development web
development and then there is a strategy
manager who takes care of the account
management which is a relationship
management procurements architecture if
you look at IT Service Manager he
typically has the support team and the
delivery team so all the support related
processes are underneath so for example
the service desk which are sitting and
then handling those aspects and trying
to find what are the tickets that are
coming how this is being resolved
repeatedly if you are having incidents
they look at a root cause analysis that
is the problem management and so on and
so forth right so this is typically how
in organization you have these IP I
process managers functioning in in some
of these organizations so this is just
an example but there could be different
permutations and combinations of what it
is now if you move on further and that
comes us to a point
how is certification being organized now
if you look at look at the way
certifications are being organized there
are basic level then the intermediate
level and then the advanced level so I
talked about I tell b3 foundation then
we have item improve idiot and then we
have the advanced or advanced diploma so
the certification level also improves or
a period of from foundation to
intermediate to advanced so in
foundation that is the item b3
foundation we will look at the basic
stuff that means looking at what's the
knowledge what's the level of basic
knowledge about all these processes
the core volumes the five core volumes
and know exactly what is what so you get
a overview of all these processes and
how it is use and how was it getting
benefited for an organization then what
happens you start specializing yourself
so if you look at yourself getting
trained like it could be when you were
in your schooling and then you went to
your college then you do specialization
as masters right and you specialize in
your respective field of let's say
mechanical engineering Chemical
Engineering or accountancy or whatever
that might be in your field you do a
specialization so when you come to
intermediate you then before design
whether I want to go in a capability
route or a life cycle route which I will
talk but then that will be in the second
division so in the second intermediate
round you will be able to comprehend
that means you will be able to apply and
understand using the knowledge that
you've gained and see what are the
scenarios that this will be implemented
and in the third layer which is the
advanced layer you will start applying
those concepts into the actual scenarios
so that's more of the next level of
advance so you slowly increase your
level of understanding knowledge and
applying those knowledge that you've
gained into this workplace now in the
current scheme of certification that you
have and I just wanted to give you a
roadmap as to where do we start and
where do we go is you have the
foundation certificate which is the
class that you're going to attend and
this is going on a credit based system
so then you clear the first cycle
foundation you get two credits or we can
kind of call it as points right and then
in the intermediate layer there are two
divisions we are going to talk about
that in a little while which is called a
service life cycle model now we we have
the system in terms of looking at
a lifecycle module which means every
module there are five modules that is
service strategy design transition
operation CSI that look at three credits
each and then you have the lifecycle
model which we'll talk about in a while
which will again get every model will be
focused but irrespective what you can
pick mix and match or you can do in in
one of them like either fully life cycle
or fully the capability module then you
go to the managing through life cycle
that is it that is a module that
everybody have to do that and then you
become an exporter so if you if you
accumulate credits and if you make 22
credits then you will be able to do that
so I will see if I could share this as
part of module later I'll come back now
let me know whether you are able to see
this so this is right now we are in the
capability stream model now capability
stream meaning our CV which is called
release control validation then OSA
which is the talking about all the
access even management incident
management then we have SOA which is
service offering an agreement then we
have PP you which is planning protection
and optimization so there are little
modules so you don't need to worry about
it we will go in detail when we go to
the section of in the foundation so we
will talk about all these modules so at
the end of the foundation you would have
had an understanding of all the
respective process of what is the goal
of it what are the different roles what
is the process look like
what's the start point and how it is
interfacing with all these process in do
coach okay so this is called the
capability stream in Indian picture now
if you look at
how do you ask for do you go through a
life cycle module or do you want to go
through a capability stream so if people
know about the version two they had
something called as a practitioner
course so it's like a subject matter
expert so it's kind of deep diving into
the current role some some people do are
in to release management or testing or
specialization on those so it's more of
a implementation consideration you will
go through the capability screen whereas
if it is life cycle it is executing and
implementing a complete stage of service
life cycle that is from strategy you
develop certain design then you do a
transition and then you operate and then
you look at continual service
improvement so in capability stream you
will have more prescriptive and deep
type inputs activities concepts and the
other one in life cycle is more for
consultants will manage the client into
it so as I told you in capability stream
it's more of a subject matter expert now
what do you do day in and day out and in
life cycle it's more broader perspective
that you get an in - end perspective for
a client to understand all how these
processes relate with each other now
let's move on now some of the job
opportunities that you will have as part
of this exercise is you will have a
process owner or a process manager
process consultant so you can have
different opportunities that you will
get by becoming yourself certified in
this journey so many of the people whom
I interact asked them okay I've done
completed foundation intermediate expert
what does it mean how can this be
leveraged and utilized in the place that
we are talking about that's how this
works across ok so these are some of the
opportunities where you can go yourself
get yourself associated and then play
those roles in in different industries
and also like support staff
means handling 1st level support 2nd
level support 3rd level support all that
opportunities will also be provided for
people who are certified and have
knowledge in the in these areas now what
really matters you know at the at the
point that we are talking about is what
kind of attitude and value you have and
do you have business and professional
knowledge as to how it works do you have
personal skills that means in business
and professional you have accumulated
those insights from an aspect that you
have knowledge that is your foundation
certified you have understanding of the
customer pain areas you understand the
required communication aspects the
collaboration aspects working with
diversified teams and then start using
that as a basis to communicate and
deliver value personal skills that means
ability to handle irate customers know
many of the times what happens is the
customer ends at you where you are not
actually responsible for the issue there
was some gaff delay or there was some
miscommunication people have
misinterpreted but that's something that
you will have to be patient calm
composed you have to accept or apologize
and then deliver what it is there
sometimes the customer wants to rent out
his feelings so you should have those
skills to do that and importantly you
also need to know in your industry if
you are developing a carrier within
service management what are the people
who are working who is doing what what
is the kind of roadmap that I have how
people have gone through their journey
for example if you looked in LinkedIn
profile you know exactly how they have
started their journey in service
management and how they have grown up in
the industry so that you can actually
use that as your basis to do that now
I'll take a look at questions at this
moment there are a few questions that
have come across so if you have any
questions just keep posting let me move
on
so the
is looking about contacts and buzu there
are forums there where you can be a part
of it which is the IT service management
forum there it is for a nonprofit
organization where you have different
professionals in the field of service
management peace process consultants
tool consultants and people who
understand these elements to do that
Lynden there are a lot of groups that
you can opt for if you are in facebook
there is a group called back to ITIL
which is basically having practitioners
we have people across the globe who can
help each other if you have any issues
in the way that you are fought so do not
think just to do a certificate for the
sake of doing certificate but look at
how this is going to help you in
building your career roadmap and how
this is going to take you to the next
order of doing business or delivering
outcomes and then that will help you to
leverage best of your ability to do that
okay
