I hope you're aware that there has no
mix with the commercial one and how much
lotion and simple is also has the same
amount of packages like that has the
same set of packages but there's an open
source single it's okay so here rpm is
the package manager
that means the packages are available
within dot RPM extension all the
packages so if you want to install
except if there will be an RT that means
the for this package name that ends
slick dot RPM okay so this is the format
the package name question what is the
release and what is the architecture in
the 32-bit or 64-bit like that okay so
I'm going to with a daughter so this
this is all about that package
punishment so there is a command called
art here is English you install the RPM
packages or you check your packet is
installed or not or you can even see I'm
using the world package grateful if
there is a package with an extension dot
rpm inside the package they put the
multiple files we can also check before
prior to the installation we can also
check what files to present as a part of
the package
alright so there are a lot of islands
available um come on this is some
important ones so our team provides
complete software package including free
and post install scripts
dependency is meta information and
installed software database that means
it maintains the database of all the
packages that are installed in your
system so that's what I mentioned even
different are do and you can get to see
all the installed packages the versions
and the twenty is a database of all the
information in the database of all
storage software maintained evolution
comes in handy for tracking and updating
dependency verification
and software management so you can have
you know multiple virtual related
packages available so these are some of
the already see this is how this
managing all the content information the
database looping you just cross check
say you have already thrown the package
if you find so in the package one second
you'll get to see message tactics
package or this particular version is
already in store or it also when you try
to install packages it also helps to it
also tells you if there are any
dependencies involved you will get to
see lot of information when we install
the packages so we'll see all those
features so this is in general about
reddit package manager so there are the
basic options that will be making user
how to install a package how they'll
install the package very another package
is installed or not or if you are
upgrading and next level so how do you
do that okay verification all this okay
also it automatically verifies whether
specific these are sections or whether
whether this particular package is which
kind of encryption the package is
missing
okay and yeah it automatically arty have
been vapor they put the unresolved or
dependences elephant so here comes the
dependence on you whenever you're
installing a particular package there
can be other dependencies which actual
which which must be installed along with
this package a service might have might
involve multiple packages you will see
that when we install the pieces rather
than installing just a single package we
have install the dependency salsa okay
so so RPM what it does is and you try to
install a particular package it will
check whether there are any dependence
is involved and then it will tell you
that you need to install the dependency
sensor alright I'll try to understand
this vengeance early particular package
it rpm the I feel if there are any
differences involved the RPM will
display message that you can also
install these dependences before
installing this participation there are
differences okay
it will not install the dependencies for
you okay and one more thing if you want
to install a particular pattern is in
partying let's download the package and
they believe that package and an
argument low RPM come on okay so they
will possibly making user it's a command
relativity is the third command in order
to install the packages just the
differential between RPM title here so
our team installs on the hub could
download the packet and give that is not
going to RPM come on to install it
okay and if there are any dependence six
RPM you will not bring the business so
you need to it will list the
dependencies you need to download the
dependencies as well and then you need
to try installing that package ok which
is a very I would say it's a very tough
job using the octave for installing the
packages because you know
how many dependents is that it worth but
for a package so it is always preferred
to go with young come on why you young
so young will help you to pull all the
packages whatever dependencies have to
pull everything and it will ask you for
a confirmation to query the
demonstration process you'll see that so
we have a very handy tool so I think is
also another option available if you
have an individual RPF it does not have
dependences you can quickly install it
is in the RPM command alright we will
see other options how we make this yes
regarding this question yes pressors i
will cover how young they install the
packages in there it will fill the
packages from okay for our team we need
to provide the packages an argument
whereas with yum come on you need not
have to download any package okay so we
will tell em to fetch the packages from
the deposit okay I will tell you how to
configure the repository and where this
deposit is that present in general if
you have searched for the next any kind
of odd p.m. people then you will go
there
there are many deposit first present
okay ever even read Aardman vintage the
repository symbol repository and you get
a deposit please another mystery I mean
that further on the board
we just have to leave if we have an
internet connection we can simply
configure that repository in the
configuration or you donated to you and
tell you to install you can give a
package name just the board a related
word and automatically you will go and
pull this package and its dependencies
from any of the deposit risk okay under
the last people confirmation you see the
options so the main difference within
the party MLM but I came in okay
download the package you know the
differences as well whereas for iam you
just have to tell them that this
packages are present and this particular
positively worth it
automatically ok the next one is a
package manager too so we have team the
command line process on how to install
the packages now on the graphically on
how to install the packages so you can
simply type this command system -
conflict - packages let me tell you this
there are lot of other commands again if
you remember since just type system -
config and then tab all right you'll see
a system - conjugate and other comment
system if you want take fill other
comments so mostly these are negative
this graphical tools that are available
so here you can see the best of packages
okay you can select the package install
the packages you have to check this box
and then click apply to install alright
so this is the package manager they
prove how let's talk either to have this
packages from that you can so this is
the comer
where you can select the package install
automatically so this is the if you are
done level pipe because all the
difference this is how this this tool
works ok so similarly so you can you can
run this system item country typing
packages and you can see all the other
options installation available packages
how to do both the packages of them here
the advantages you can get to see you
know some description about what the
package is alright so the process is
very simple how to install it or install
ok here we have one example
ok regarding Colonel of tradition
okay so our before showing you how to
install the packages they can be this so
if you're using Ubuntu okay another
flavor there you might there you will
see a complete different command here I
have mentioned my um there you will see
apt I can get so that is the
installation package manager that you
will be using to install the packages in
Ubuntu okay so some there will be a
small variation in mode is some of the
tools that we use from one favor to
another flavor so let's start with
Bianca come on first what we'll do is
yum update okay so we have an update we
will try to update your system just it
will ensure that whatever packages that
are already installed in your system
they are the latest packages alright so
it is recommended to use this command
before you start installing any of the
packages in case if you face any kind of
issues when you are installing a package
just by doing yum update first
automatically it will try to switch all
the latest versions of the packages it
will install it and then you can start
installing the service or the packages
that you own so when I see our latest
package it means whatever packages which
are already installed on your system if
there is the latest version of those
packages will pull all those packages
are influenced on it other than that if
you are going for a different service
altogether you need to download this for
me and the dependences and then install
it okay you can see it is just listing
lot of packages okay this particular
package will be updated will be updated
will be updated all right so I haven't
used yum update command so it is listing
so many packages
I'm not sure about the version of 75 in
stone maybe even because the target
might be a bit older version so that's
why I prefer to Lucy so this is how
young works okay so it is asking me
whether it is okay to install this
particular then starting to new packages
and rotative installing and it is
upgrading 80 packages
okay so you can see all the left here
I'd say yes start okay so this is the
same thing if even if you will yum space
install space a particular package name
what it does that really quickly search
for this package and it's dependencies
and then it will list here and this
somebody it will list
okay so we'll show you okay this is the
package that I have installed this is
the okay architecture and this is the
version this is the spice and cylinder
it will display the dependencies and it
will ask you for a confirmation okay so
once you give yes automatically it will
download and install all those packages
okay and the concept wise I mean
functionality wise even open to apt-get
does the same you will say let me get
TPT a dead space a package name space in
stone similarly it will list the package
as well as the dependencies and it's
okay just like we did yum space update
and open you could do a pretty cat this
update command automatically through all
the packages latest versions of the
packages in who burn okay
so legged complete installing all the
latest ones see everything ends with an
RPM okay what I will do if I look at
another terminal now this is what I was
mentioning before so here you name is a
come on okay so when you use this
command I hope you are aware of this
right so if you have x86 it's a 32-bit
architecture to put a 64-bit is there an
x86 and x64 this is how we check and the
difference is that you can I mean most
most of the system's memory is people
here so that is what does it display so
this is the architecture give it the
package name ok this is the version
information package so once this is done
really cool within station of the other
one yeah yeah
yeah so
nowadays I mean as far as I have seen a
lot of companies they use their
underpinnings okay because they have
it's a commercial one that support is
available okay and there are people they
have their own deposit fees and there
are all the latest packages are
available so simply what we do is since
we have taken a commercial version we
can simply run yum space update or yum
space install a package automatically
all the packages which are present in
the repository will be downloaded for
your system all right
that is when it comes to a specific
package a single package that is not
available in the repository or when
there are scenarios where people you
know they build will build their own
art-tips so it's like if they build a
new functionalities in the system in
linux system or developing some
applications they'll develop therefore
not we can create an RPM alright and we
can generate the list of scripts and
then bundle them as an RPM so you can
take their dozen scenarios where you're
using an RTF command individually that
is specific to that application or there
are packages which which may not have
dependencies you can even download those
practices and so on but most of the time
we expect most of the packages are
present in the proposed official with
people they implement so you can take
RPM and regarding the other example i'd
see that the packaging ponder is a new
feature all right yeah that is where are
you can also configure this in are you
there are companies who may not you know
blindly install whatever packages that
the ice-cream they've read out they what
they do is they again once again they
perform they don't chicks okay they try
to add some features into that RPM
package so what you do is as I said we
can list all the content of that wave
packet we can extract the contents
came packaged you add some more scripts
to the title to turn that before you
install this I also want you to check
these things or I want you to read click
these users all right so it's like pre
and post installation scripts you can
add to that the impact if you can hear
it or not feel of zero and then you try
installing it on all the systems so like
that there can be many different use
cases where I can command is also useful
and the uncommanded also useful ok ok
let's go - thanks
ok so this is the output of your name -
eh alright so starting from here let's
keyboard argument so the first one is
about RPM - QA grab - i colonel
alright if you grip I'll see how often
we are using this command all right so
let's see first let's go through the RPM
command RPM - here see what it is
so Delta's display all the packages that
are installed in your system along with
the version numbers alright so here I
think it's very the database and display
all the packages better install it the
system ok you can you can see the
Vantage Pro rpm here so hopefully is for
all display all the packages see when
your man page is just like your
dehydrator okay I searched for something
I'll press n to go to the next queue per
baby
alright just like your man page you can
search the words here Q per quit
finally so this is how we
the rampage and sorry he is rocky so you
can see there are some more options if
you want to know the colonel name in
fact you may not have to wait for the
colonel here but chick
okay
you didn't comment itself will give you
the cool grip it okay next
so here there is a quick example given
on you know regarding this rpm using
making user type import given is so
there is a kernel which is already
installed among the operating system so
here what here trying to fool
there is the new packs are available for
the Carmen alright so here's the IPM
using this IBM command I predicted
pattern in downloaded all right so rpm -
I need H so this is the I do not have a
little bit it downloaded okay so we need
to download this and then we need to
install this patch so once this patch
has been installed so what happens is
corresponding to this particular package
this rpm you'll see all the three files
again okay that means must be up like
this so all the 3 p.m. lines and then
you have your in it are the image and
then you have the quantity just like you
have on a single kernel and the
corresponding files in your system the
moment we install the parts again we
will get quickly the other files your
system okay so he had what he have done
it he has added a new entry so if we can
that's what I mentioned before you can
boot your system with multiple corners
we just have to make an entry we have
Broadcom restart your system select this
kernel and then we go to your system
that's that's what you can do in order
to has the latest kernels
okay so for now you won't be downloading
this Hyundai dispatch you can you can
try this on your
topic so the only thing is check your
current kernel version you name item a
or you can also open rpm I can create
hybrid kryptonite burner okay and then
so you can you can also and just compare
the kernel that is given here if you
have the same one check further next
patch Lord up kernels are available lot
of repositories that are a little bit
easily get there Coenen just make sure
that the corresponding version numbers
out there
I mean Connor you're searching word
should have an extra version numbers
download that corner so after
downloading that RPM
simply install that yeah installing this
is if you only create this points okay
so you need to make that exactly the
same entry in the grub dot-com whatever
is there just copy this ones I hope you
remember how to copy and paste by Y&amp;amp;P
looking for my way and P make another
entry and then modify these things
corresponding to the new country other
than the version number but for me of
liners and limit Rd rest of the
arguments would remain the same okay and
this person as this is in the same tax
will remain the same only the version
number would change so you'll have two
entries for your current the next time
you restart your system and the grub
dot-com you will get to sleep two
different kernels okay so let me also
tell you this in case you have done
something wrong and you'll unable to
login login normally in the run level we
have we have already discussed level
single user mode okay where you can log
in and you can delete the second
configuration you have created and you
can restart your system and one more
important thing it is always render team
to create a back up of the configuration
point do not touch the configuration
file
that's the original contribution I mean
always keep a backup the moment you feel
that you want to make a change in a
constellation when it's a blood drop
third fun first take a copy copy that as
grabber gonna curve back or something so
you have your original file same okay so
even if you mess this
find dr. Khan until you have mailed
wrong and you're unable to market to the
system what we can do is we can log-in
be single use it won't we have a back-up
plan already
copy that that will find again you
rename it to grab blood Khan and you
restart your system right so this is how
we can fix this and it is very very
important that we have a back up of the
configuration files a link so you can
try the same in the same way to go back
up download the new up here you could
change the person try logging into
flowing with the new one
okay so the RPM - is the cover to
install QA WC WC is for work on ok so it
will work on and we had some arguments
here anybody list it's like the number
of increase ok that this comment in the
output so our theAmerican here we list
all the number of packet all the
batteries are installed and we want to
know how many what is the number then
you can pipe it and say ok if you want
to check if FTP is installed or not this
is the command file transfer protocol
hold it and see this is a little foreign
key 1 so this comment clearly start p.m.
dedication returns information have both
the package including the package being
version and the description of the
package so in the
the common collector one system -
chomping - packages you can see a
graphical tool where you can select the
package and install the package
there at the bottom we have seen the
description for the package where if
using Cumberland if you want to see the
same description what you can do is you
can simply give - is an argument to it
next one is RPF
here discover and determines which IBM
package given file is associated with we
think um okay see so you have installed
a particular package all right
so what happens is unless why I'm
installing you unless you say - I
feelings for boots it will display all
the set of operations that it is
performing all right I'll see a package
is already installed in your system okay
so when this that you are not there at
the time of installation and you want to
know what are all the configuration
files that are part of this package so
someone said this is the example someone
has entered FTP
okay so here if you see red
corresponding to FTP these are all the
list of files which are part of the
dartium okay so when you install FTP
package so something gets stored and use
it in something in the same to the FTP
and we will also see so corresponding to
FTP there are manual man pages that are
present here in this location so if you
want to check man pages from all the
comments go to this location user share
man under this folder will get to see
all the one pages with all the come on
so with every comment and with every
service you'll be installed in your
system
there are also man taped man which is
associated to that service they would
get a restored in there okay so
sometimes what happens is so why
proposing you get to see one and there
are a lot of comments you have to see
some command and you want to try to
check the new thing now functionality
and then you try the term and it will
say the command not found after that
means that package is not installed in
your system what do you think you can do
simply uninstall that package mean if it
is a command you need to check which
packages or command blocks and some some
package or an angel combined it for
almost the same Meeropol install that
commands when you install it that
combine that binary as well as the
corresponding man fakest would get it or
not only we will get to think Icarus 49
page 4
okay go through all the other options
that are available here here are the
documents so it does all these tricks
Natyam come on you can also make sure
that you don't rather than upgrading you
can have two different packages
installed in your system
all right so yeah so here this is about
grid option try there so what you can do
is you can directly provide the name
whatever the deposit racer said you also
get those repositories like it works
okay this is a red cent deposit thing
somewhere you can install it because
that to me
so this IPM is present in that creepy
server you can download an obligatory
install it
okay so this is removal process so when
you just like you install the process
along with the dependencies you can also
remove the packages along with the
dependency or without the dependence
different ok so this is the option use -
- no limit okay we can install the
packages we told the dependency size
them ok so but we have to explicitly say
that I don't want the dependencies to be
installed in the system
ok the next one is young should be put
just like IBM young would also have no
yep install they both give upgrade you
can perform all kinds of operations the
only difference is young will have the
configuration point for it ok there we
will define there should go and fetch
the Artyom's we define the deposit fee
from there you can go and download all
the RPMs
okay you give me if you have a red hat
if you have this collect license then
provide either Red Hat deposit fee or
you can take and keep depositing their
company instantly and that location must
be specified specified in the
configuration file from there you can go
and fetch it
okay so this is the directory structure
EPC I'm not the first party where we
have multiple repository pystep and
creator you cannot want to put
repositories so if my default will
follow the order except for first
deposit is not available until search
for other deposit patients will so you
can have my developer positive you just
have to configure it you can you can
configure the repository make it
available even visible a tour the
neighborhood but you can have a prior
configuration these are some of the
checks you know packages so it's not
like every package we download from the
internet will have this signature that
means that this package is C so that you
know if you have your own little Linux
box and you simply do search you very
positive online and some location and we
will try to install the package but if
you want to ensure that whatever you
install is safe we can have this CPC
chicks and even in that system okay
setting up at repository okay in order
to set up a deposit read what you need
so this package first that is create
depository and then we need to run this
combined and then it will set up a set
of go and you should report the tree
first
so it's pretty simple setting about
fifty positive so it's like creating an
empty container okay that's what the
clear repository command then what you
can do is simply at the time of the
installation process you will get the
same lot of packages which are present
in your CV okay but will not install all
the packages for some basic packages and
on a new basis we go with the swish of
the rest of the packages so when we want
to install at a later point of time so
rather than you know downloading it or
not copying it from somewhere what we
can do is we can create our own report
the treat to copy those packages on the
packages which are present in here right
to that location so creating a
repository we are creating our own
repository and copy all the packages to
them to project three and then this is
how you compute the DM repository
locally our deposit okay so first
install this it creates the container
copy all our games to that container all
right one see I'm done now you create
this so create require pending so what
happens is it will clear all the
metadata and the first funding
information okay once this is done what
you can do is you can hear the cash
coins okay then we can list all the
packages that are available in the
depository and we know that you say you
have installed a particular package it
will go in H that package from your
local repository so these are all the
advocates that are available I don't get
yep so if you have installed a TP no
dependence is resolved we'll pull the
packages okay rather than you know
pointing here propose to some location
outside and you can hang your own local
if they're not connected change that you
want to install a package and if it is
available wait put is readily available
rather than copying it from other stores
what you can do is you can create a
repository along with your operating
system
although all the packages you can keep
all the patent is the deposit free and
simply use the uncommon to install the
packet automatically the transmission
will happen so manually will not have to
wait as a I mean when you install your
operating as a part of your operating
system will have the all all the set of
packages available from you so you can
copy all those packages and you know
keep it in a clear that the positive
rather than installing everything the
first time it's fill so on a need basis
you can keep on unnecessary packages you
can keep it in your repository and it
will still at a later point of hold it
or do you take another example
okay see you're part of an organization
well then you know allowing people to
download the packages from outside or
from other reported things you can
maintain a repository inside in
photography to which you know all the
Linux systems can be pointed to the
topography so that people will start
installing the packages from the local
deposit rates rather than going in
filling the packets from from some other
proposal so I mean it it all depends on
an age-based but at least you will get
to know that okay this is the process
this is the package I need to install
this is all create a local container or
local deposit fee this is there I can
keep my packages for know it is very
easy right
doing and going forward when you start
using your company will understand
simply yum installed a particular
comment automatically pulls the
dependences so what I would suggest is
first try using an RPM come and get from
open so I will tell you some utilities
which may not be available by default by
using rpm it will list the dependencies
because I have faced such scenarios but
it will list a dependency I'll download
the dependency again it will ask another
dependency for the dependencies and so
sometimes you know it goes on asking or
not so you'll get educated downloadable
dependency the main story so young would
really help useful if you have a
repository circuit like
even um then pull your dependents
daughter to share some rightful seconds
so yeah okay come on all the same rpm
you can use them so it will fit women
and stole everything okay here there is
an example service given here ok this is
all about creating different repository
so we have seen all the arguments of
p.m. so far right so the next thing is
show your period and repository so we
can enable HTTPS service on top of that
deposit fee so when I say it's to TP
service what happens is ok see the
speech so when you hit that particular
service he'll get to see all the
paddlers main tips so like you wanted to
know that I can use the RPM command you
can download these individual packages
so this is where HTTP service would be
helpful for you so we'll see how to
configure an HTTP service so no
understanding service is it's too early
to start but we'll go through some basic
options I'll tell you I will do what
exactly with this is a perk if you have
seen here HTTP service that means you
have you have all your team go take
direction at some location ok
it still appears you know it's a
protocol using which we connect to that
location we fixed everything whatever is
present with them so we are trying to
access the deities or extradicted
service ok so HTTP the server or a
service and peedee peedee is the
underlying demin ok so I'll tell you
put a new one on this work flow kind of
thing so whenever it comes to a service
so by default we'll be following a few
steps okay the first step any kind of
service that we are going to install
that we wanna see in modules but
installation to getting services okay so
starting with HTTP any service so first
of all the first thing is what is this
going to be so understanding what it
does finally be okay this is assertive
for example cups okay except printing
for this so it helps to it helps to
connect to your system to the printers
okay so just having an understanding of
what the service is the next important
thing is what are the packing you think
world okay so for this we need not there
are two ways we did you you remember the
set of packages or you can simply you
know do you have install cups okay
so 99% world 99% of the time it will
pull the back you hold the correct
product packages that are associated
with the cup serviced okay so to lift
all the packet it along with the
dependences you install the surface once
you have installed the service the next
step is you need to configure the
surface okay check the status using ATC
radar deep cups
status stop so we have installed it we
haven't started it then what we do there
are configuration files associated with
this amis okay so we need to know where
these configuration files are present
okay then we go to the corresponding
configuration file make the changes once
you have made the changes we started to
surface
okay now the surveys have started then
we enable the service in that particular
term level so that the next time we
start the service along with the system
other processes the furthest also gets
started
okay so
this is the further configuration okay
then we will see the client
configuration so how the configure your
client which makes use of your surgeries
basically protocol server and the plan
we configure the server which serve the
client so the client if at all there is
some configuration needed from the
client side as well you'll see similarly
what is the client package what exactly
climb this what kind of history will get
from the server how to install it so
this flow is the same I want I will keep
repeating it every service that will do
so what if the survey is what is
important go to the consultation what
changes you have to me how to enable
this that waits out a little bit from
and then what does it mean how we make
you look okay so now we have started
that is critical service so young info
it's pretty pretty it will give you all
the information okay see here you have
installed
httpd star automatically as it said it
will list all the packages corresponding
to HTTP service alright so once we have
installed that service what happens is
okay so okay I know how think since
you're running out of time I just
whatever floor I'd talked about we'll
see that flow and I'll explain more
treatments in the next session okay so
this service first step I am install
HTTP dispatch so we have been installed
the surface okay the next step is there
is a configuration file first one HTTP
location is UTC httpd.conf HTTP 2.1
because the configuration file
corresponding to that families all right
so we go to the fund will go to the
service by default every service
listens at a particular put that means
by default every server will respond to
the client requests at will default port
for HTTP it is 80 and it is also for
before okay so here what we do is we
just open the configuration file we make
some basic changes to it and we define
that you know so this is the port number
or these are some of the other files
with respect to the service okay so once
that is done okay so here we'll see the
Trinity service means you are hosting
some that papers here all right so we
will say that this is the folder where
I'm going to give my HTML files or this
is the folder where I'm gonna keep my
other scripts which when you get any
cuter than the flip pages this fit and
then we defined some basic configuration
we put some registrations that these
users can only see my things not about
these groups can see my things like that
we set up some restrictions so once that
is done what we're doing the permissions
we haven't explained there so far we
give permissions to the repository
you all can modify those folders or
fines once that is done we have started
the service so every it's pretty pretty
please start okay
now the service is up and running so
once the suddenly filled up so this is
the host on which we have installed the
service followed by C and B so this is
the folder where my my HTML files were
some content whatever I want to store I
have told the content in that location
so once the service has happened only if
you hit that location you will get to
see all the files that I have copied to
that location okay so this is also if if
you have users in your network when your
users if you have given access to them
they can take this link and they can
download that so basically what you are
doing is here you have created a shared
folder we have kept everything in that
and this can be accessible way other
users enjoyment
so this is one kind of so this that it's
HTTP service alright so again next what
you can do is see this is how you
manually download it you can access this
one you can you manually download
now what you can do is you can configure
young all right inside the m dot the
post or t you can here the configuration
find and see their young can clearly
based HTTP service and install install
the packages what our patent is it point
you won't get it from this decision they
are very bit of misinformation all right
so it's good if you baby anyway
that is the service it provides to you
ok so one started done young clean all
it leaves the cache and on and then so
every time you modify something you need
to refresh it so that it pulls the
negatives configuration so once that is
done you can you know list and you see
all the midst of packages that are
available in your service
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
