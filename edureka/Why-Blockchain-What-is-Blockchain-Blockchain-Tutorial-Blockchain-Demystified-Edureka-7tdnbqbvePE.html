Rica and welcome to this ad rica live
session on why blockchain now before we
begin this session
i'd like to clarify that this session is
not about bitcoins Bitcoin investment or
how to make bitcoins rather it focuses
on the underlying technology which made
Bitcoin possible as well as popular in
today's world which is blockchain now
this session is not practically oriented
how if you do wish to learn the various
practical implementations that can be
done on the blockchain technology then
you can check out our angelica
blockchain tutorial playlist and go
through any of our videos that deal with
respect to different technologies are
launching now blockchain is one of the
biggest busts of the last quarter now
apart from being one of the most
trending keywords blockchain in itself
is a technology that can be called the
dark horse of all the technologies that
have occurred it is a technology that
does not come with a hangover of any
previous technologies anyone can start
with this technology and this is
something that's going to be quite
widely used across different domains as
well people have also often called
blockchain technology as being the next
stage of Internet as well so this is
something that's going to gain a lot of
popularity going forward now let's move
forward and look at the agenda for the
session we'll start off by first
understanding what is blockchain and why
use blockchain following which we'll be
talking about the various features of
blockchain and where can blockchain be
used finally we'll be also looking at
blockchain trends where we'll be looking
at the upcoming job trends the salary
trends as well as we'll also be looking
at the future of blockchain as well now
let's start with respect to the first
topic which is what is blocked chip now
before I go on to this I'd like to know
if any of you have any idea on what is
blockchain if you do please put it
across in the chat box
meanwhile at any point in the session if
you do have any queries feel free to put
it across in the chat box and I'll be
taking them accordingly
okay to give you an understanding of
what block changes let me make it quite
popular or quite clear as well
blockchain as a technology became quite
popular after the implementation of
bitcoins to put it quite simply it's a
data structure wherein each block of the
blockchain is stored in a timestamp
chronological order but you might be
wondering okay what is a block in the
first place so a block basically is
similar to a file where in all the
recent or validated transactions are
stored which are not stored in any of
the prior blocks now there are two
things that the statement makes are
firstly only validated transactions are
stored in a block and you do not
repeatedly store data onto the
blockchain if a certain transaction
details is stored in a block then it
would not be stored either in a previous
block or any upcoming blocks as well now
to me help you understand this better
the block of a Bitcoin blockchain can be
referred to as a ledger in itself now
how we all have account based Ledger's
and pass books there in all the
transactions that we perform be it an
ATM withdrawal be it a cash deposit meet
a net transfer each one of them are
individually sure however in the
blockchain Bitcoin ledger the only
difference being is that the details are
stored with respect to everyone across
the club who is using bitcoins as a
medium of transactions so put it quite
simply a block of Bitcoin blockchain
actually stores the transaction details
of everyone across the globe using
bitcoins as a means of transaction now
does up or can a block only store
transaction details definitely not today
blockchain technology has evolved more
than bitcoins or any cryptocurrency for
that matter it is something that can be
used across different domains and we'll
be seeing how it's being used across
different domains ahead as well now to
put it quite simply blockchain is one of
the biggest busts in the industry today
and a lot of organizations are trying to
understand this technology so this is
the right time to put your invent time
and effort to learn this technology as
well as master this blockchain is or
bitcoins in itself the most popular
digital cryptocurrency and the first
cryptocurrency is actually an
implementation of blockchain
technologies it was introduced in a
white paper on 31st of October in 2008
where in the world was facing a
financial crisis and this paper actually
gave us an idea of how a decentralized
cryptocurrency system can solve all the
issues that was being faced across the
globe that time with us during the
financial crisis of 2008 it's estimated
that close to 11 trillion dollars was
lost across the blue now that's a very
huge amount comparing with respect to a
specific event now this one solution
could make sure that this does not
happen any time I have now as we have
seen again earlier blockchain basically
is a continuously growing list of
Records called blocks which are linked
to each other in a time time record
manner and is secured using
cryptographic techniques now I'm storing
a transaction detail onto my blockchain
but what you need to understand is that
it's completely accessible to anyone
across the globe so in a way in order to
avoid manipulations they use various
cryptographic techniques which ensures
that these details are not manipulatable
as well as the users who are using this
are completely anonymous and secure as
well now let's try to understand why
blockchain blockchain can be blockchain
has various features for that matter but
I've just listed some of them here one
of the major reasons which makes
blockchain quite popular today is that
it's impossible for anyone to tamper any
data that's present on the block or
ledger as part of the blockchain
this is because of the various features
and security measures that are already
inbuilt
in the blockchain technology next comes
the worldwide adoption to give you a
simple idea of how wide blockchain
technology is let's go back to the
Bitcoin blockchain implementation now
there what has happened is today it's
estimated that close to 20 million
people are part of this network and 20
million people are spread across the
room so blockchain technology has spread
so widely across the globe in just one
implementation imagine this being used
across different technologies as well as
different domains as such now then comes
the option of automated operations like
any technologies blockchain today has
evolved in such a phase wherein you
don't need to completely write codes or
perform operations to manually what
happens here is that you have various
applications which makes it quite easy
for you to perform this operation as
well now to give you a simple example
here let's take the case of Bitcoin
mining as such today most people just
run the application which in turn
validates the transaction and ensures
that they try to get bitcoins for
validating or creating a new block but
earlier what used to happen was that
this operation was done manually as the
technology has grown so has the various
functionalities and operations
associated with it today you just have
to use a UI based application and just
click on about it and your operation
starts now blockchain is one of the most
popular open-source technology and this
in turn has made the blockchain quite
widely popular and effect any
implementation any development with
respect to the blockchain technology is
completely accessible across the net to
give you a simple idea there are about
180 different variations of the original
Bitcoin and blockchain core system so
180 different versions which I just
manipulated or variated from the
original core package and completely
accessible to anyone that wants now one
of the key feature that made blockchain
quite popular and effective was his
distributed architecture all the data
that was being stored in the Bitcoin
blockchain network that is the
transaction details were spread across
the globe
so anyone who became part of this could
actually hold the complete transaction
details back from the start
now to give you an idea this is not a
small data and blockchain system has
grown a lot with respect to the same
feature because it's distributed across
the globe as well today the entire
blockchain ledger system would be about
150 GB but at the same time you have the
access just to look at individual
transactions rather than holding the
entire ledger as well finally comes the
flexibility now as I had said blockchain
is just a technology that can be
manipulated and molded as per your
requirement as such using various
programming languages you can manipulate
this technology as per your requirement
going ahead we'll also be looking at
some of the domains and applications
which have made use of this flexibility
factor now comes the various features of
blockchain that has made its child above
all other technologies first comes the
encryption system now blockchain in
itself uses a hash encryption system to
store any details associated with it be
it the user details made the transaction
details be it
any details with respect to a same you
use a hash encryption system to be more
precise it uses an sha-256 encryption
system for that now this encryption
system is so complex that even a slight
variation with respect to the input can
make a massive difference with respect
to the animal you would not be able to
differentiate both the input and the
output and it's a unidirectional option
unidirectional process so even if you
have the output you cannot somehow
reverse engineer and take identify the
input given here as well now the second
major feature which makes blockchain
quite popular is the distributed ledger
feature now when I talk about the
distributed ledger system this has
various implementation as such now let's
take a simple example of music share
today we have platforms like YouTube we
have platforms like SoundCloud but
they're all managed by a centralized
Authority or a centralized body who
takes care of it musicians what they do
is that they put up a copy of their
music on this platform and thereby
everyone can
but again it's managed by one single
entity and when you look at it there are
a lot of ways where I can actually
download these songs as per my names now
about 65% of a musician's profit is lost
just from illegal downloads and using
blockchain systems we can highly insure
that firstly they just have access to
view it and not commit copy of it at the
same time everyone who wants can
actually view it as well so thereby you
can manipulate this distributed ledger
feature as per your requirement as well
now yes I am pushing details into the
blockchain but how do I know this is a
valid details or not because one of the
implementations of blockchain is
identity management wherein users
actually upload their identity cards or
their details with respect to that on
the blockchain which can be verified and
validated by different sources as well
but unless an I am until I've made sure
that the initial data that is coming on
to the blockchain is valid
I cannot ensure that the entire system
would be foolproof so that is where
consensus mechanism comes into the
picture consensus and mechanism
basically is a process through which you
validate whatever data is going to be
put on the blockchain is valid as well
as perfect okay finally comes
immutability factor now one of the
reasons that blockchain today is highly
being used in the financial domain is
because of this factor if I give or if I
store a transaction details onto the
blockchain then because it is immutable
I cannot manipulate it going forward
here the distributed ledger system also
plays a factor because the details with
respect to the transactions are spread
across the globe but at the same time
the system in itself and shows that no
single entity can manipulate it and even
if someone tries to do that then
definitely everyone else apart from that
system rejects this manipulation as such
now I hope you as a following till here
meanwhile if you do have any questions
please pull it across in the chat box
either me or my team will be able to
answer them
alright moving forward to the next
question
where as in where can block can be used
now you've understood what blockchain is
you've understood the various features
of blockchain but why do I want to use
it and where can I actually use this as
such now to give you a simple
understanding of where it can be used
I'd like to go to dr. Adrian's
definition on where blockchain can be
used blockchain actually can be used in
domains and organizations which
basically fits into the fits model or F
I TS which is basically an acronym for
fraud intermediaries throughput and
stable data
okay so domains which have high
possibilities of fraud okay like you
have your insurance domain you have a
financial domain these are domains which
can be highly impacted through the
implementation of blockchain then comes
intermediate tree domain now any domain
where an intermediate trees are present
through the usage of blockchain I can
actually ensure that there is a complete
transparency with respect to that now to
give you an example or a real-world
implementation of the same let's look at
this supply chain management system now
here what has happened is that IBM and
musk has come together and implemented a
supply chain management system which
thereby has more than a lot of
transparency and then and cut the
overall expense in world with transfer
of goods by about 50%
as such okay now if you are looking for
more details about the use case you can
check out the following link that my
team will be sharing which talks about
IBM and Marc's use case then comes
throughput off data which is the next
aspect now throughput of data basically
is domains where I have high amount of
data being processed on a single
instance now to give you a very simple
example this would be your financial
sector now in your financial sector just
to give you a rough estimate Visa and
MasterCard processes about 80 thousand
transactions every single second
now through the variations of the
blockchain implementation today
implementations like Korra or coda which
is an r3 product can process up to
hundred thousand transactions at a given
instance
so this thereby gives you way more
throughput at compared to the standard
systems that are present there finally
comes stable data now what do I
basically mean by stable data is that
this data is not something that is going
to change over a fixed or over a
duration of time now to give you a real
world example it would be relatable to a
person's personal details of his
identity details or it could also refer
to your land or asset titles now land
documentation is also another domain
which is getting affected a lot through
fraud systems today about 70% of the
land deals are messy and do not have a
clear-cut understanding with respect to
how the previous owners through
blockchain you can actually build a
system which gives you a clear-cut idea
of the previous owner the present owner
as well as perform land transactions on
this system as well now going forward
let's look at five of the industries
which are going to be disrupted by
blockchain and are all to an extent
being disrupted as well first we'll be
looking at financial service dummy now
financial service domain is one domain
which has already being using the
blockchain for a while now 2016 was
first when Berkeley actually carried out
the first trade transaction using
blockchain you also have another popular
blockchain platform like Cobra which is
being creek which is created by JP
Morgan and has gained a lot of
popularity of recently six of the top
financial organizations have already
come together including Barclays HP HSBC
and so forth to create a separate
blockchain through which all the
financial transactions will be taking
forward there by highly increasing the
throughput of the data and ensuring it's
highly secure and confidential as well
apart from that Nasdaq which is the
national sin
national trading organization is already
built
a platform through which it can ensure
that all the sales as well as straight
done relay stocks are kept in track as
well as it can ensure that the company
is working with these are valid as well
the next domain is the wording domain
and is one of the most popular and
interesting domain that I personally are
interested now Estonia basically is a
country which had implemented blockchain
through an awarding system and cast wood
which ensured that complete turnout was
there as well as a fruit to a foolproof
system was present as well now follow my
wood is also one of the most popular
online voting based solution which is
being based on blockchain and it's also
believed that by 2024 the US elections
in itself would be conducted on a
blockchain system as well thereby
ensuring no Ward frauds happen as well
as these systems are completely tamper
proof the next domain is real estate
domain now like I had said if you have
data which is not going to change over
time then definitely blockchain can be
used and this is one domain that has
already been disrupted through
blockchain Sweden has already began the
process of migrating all the land
registries to blockchain so that in
future any land deeds that can be
performed will be performed on
blockchain itself apart from that
ubiquity is an application through which
anyone can actually track as well as
transfer land titles and property deeds
to users who are part of this platform
as well this in turn is something that
is going to grow into a last or of very
vast technology as well coming down to
the next domain which is music streaming
domain now we've already discussed this
in our previous slides now as I had said
artists lose about 86 percentage of the
proceeding due to illegal downloads are
such now my Celia basically is a
platform through on which artists can
actually sell their work directly to the
user thereby reducing the profit made by
middleman as well as gain the loss that
is being caused due to illegal
downloading
finally comes supply chain management
now in the supply chain management
domain as we have talked i've been
unmasked are one of the biggest players
in this domain and they've already
implemented this and are going to build
a global scale blockchain through which
not just mercs but any of the users can
come in and improve their system as well
pronounces actually is one of the
competitor for IBM in this domain itself
which provides a transparent as well as
a traceable trade on the blockchain
system earlier what used to take two
days now takes about fifteen days on the
blockchain with respect to supply chain
domain and can be cut short even further
as well this is mainly because it is
cutting down on the cost that is being X
put on middleman as well as the time
that are being taken due to the lack of
transparency in the system as well now
let's just take a look at the blockchain
trends now before I go on let's this is
just a Google Trends craft that shows
the growth with respect to the
blockchain in the past few years now if
you see the trend or the growth with
respect to blockchain came in 2015 and
is growing quite rapidly trust me guys
blockchain is something that is going to
grow a lot more and is going to be used
across different domains without any
bounties as such now just to give you an
idea of what blockchain holds in future
this is the technology this is the
tectonic shift that blockchain is going
to cause going ahead now this is based
on a data that is being that was
provided by world economic forum
now as on 2017 it's it was said that ten
billion dollars is being invested in
blockchain but this is not actually
correct because almost close to 30
billion dollars is invested in
blockchain technology alone from
pharmaceutical domain and in 2018 first
quarter there's going to be a separate
block chain itself by the pharmaceutical
term it so a lot more has been
implemented here now one of the major
things that I want you to focus here is
by 2024 you're going to attain critical
mass what I basically mean by this is
that by 2020 for most organizations or
any organization
the world is going to realize that it's
now the point whether they have to
migrate to blockchain and by 2025 eighty
five percent of the global technologies
would have implemented blockchain as
well now coming to the social impacts
that blockchain is going to cause you're
gonna expect the world governments also
to implement blockchain technology India
has already started
Indian blockchain Council which is going
to ensure that all the processing and
operations done on the blockchain system
would happen they're also going forward
by 2027 ten percent of the world's GDP
is going to be present on the blockchain
now what I mean by ten percent of the
world's GDP on the blockchain system is
that it's going to be stable on the
blockchain system this is excluding the
incoming and outgoing flow so at least
10% so this is a very huge amount which
is going to be in trillions as such now
with respect to the job trends with on
blockchain technology if you notice by
2015 a lot of opportunities has grown as
I had mentioned blockchain is one
technology that does not come with the
hangover of earlier technologies anyone
who's interested to learn blockchain can
start off and this is the right time to
do that as well and with respect to the
salary trends as well on an average and
to professional today who knows
blockchain technology is paid about 40
to 50 percent higher than any other
developer job that's there in the market
today and this is not just in one
specific country as such this is across
the globe as such now let me just
summarize what we have discussed sorry
let me just summarize what we have
discussed as part of this session we
started off with what is blockchain and
then we looked at why blockchain we also
looked at where blockchain can be used
and the blockchain trends as well now if
you are interested in a breakers
blockchain trading program you can check
out our arabica blockchain training
wherein we have 30 hours blue 30 hour
course which is distributed over five
weeks and 15 days as well as well as if
you are interested to keep yourself
updated to the latest technologies that
are being used across different domains
and that in Eureka can offer you make
sure that you're subscribed and modified
to our channel as well now finally if
you're looking to know more about
blockchain you can check out our entire
blockchain tutorial playlist to get
insight with respect to the different
technologies associated finally since
all of you have stayed up for so long
you can use the survey link and provide
us feedback on this and avail an
additional discount on any of our
courses across the course across our ad
rika-chan now if you do have any
questions please pull it across in the
chat box and I'll be taking that block
okay I have a question here from Zara de
Sade's is asking me is the computational
problem needed in a traditional block
chain same as in a private one no
Saturday because it depends on how you
actually implement a block chain across
the technology domain as such now what
resource would be used by an individual
organization while they are setting up a
block chain privately there would not be
the same that is being used by the
Bitcoin block chain or etherium block
chain as such so a public block chain
system would require more computational
effort compared to a private block chain
but it would depend on how much F how
much data that you're going to be
processing and the number of nodes that
are associated to that block chain as
well okay so I get a question here from
you can our which language is used for
creating block chain applications so
there are various applications through
which you can learn you can implement
block chain as such you can build block
chain as well as block chain
applications using different language
some of the most popular languages that
are used is solidity and Co
okay so I think that's about it so with
that let me just wrap this session thank
you guys for staying for so long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
