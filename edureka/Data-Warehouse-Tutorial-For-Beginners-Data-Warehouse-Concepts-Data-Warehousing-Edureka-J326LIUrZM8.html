of ADA Rekha I welcome you all to this
webinar on data warehousing and business
intelligence I'll be your instructor for
today and I will be teaching you why any
company needs to business intelligence
and thus thereby do data warehousing so
without wasting much time let me show
you the agenda for today so these will
be the topic that I will be covering in
today's session and this will be the
order in which I will be covering them
ok
the first topic that I will be talking
about is what are the needs of business
intelligence and after that I will talk
about the need for data warehousing so
business intelligence is one of the most
important aspects for any company to
grow well and do good right and data
warehousing is among the most important
activities of business intelligence so
that's why these two things are
interlinked and that's the connection
these two have so you can think of data
warehousing to be a kind of a subset of
business intelligence so I will talk
about these two things enough that I
will talk about the key terminologies
that are related to data warehousing
architecture right and some of the key
terminologies are those of OLTP and Ola
the differences between the two okay the
OTP somewhat very similar to the
databases and OLAP is what represents
data warehousing so when you understand
the difference between the two you will
also understand the difference between a
database and a data warehouse you will
also understand why a data warehouse
suits this is intelligence more than
data base so that's about these two
topics and then we'll talk about ETL so
ETL stands for extract transform and
load
eatle is a strategy to convert the data
from your database onto your data
warehouse right so moving the data from
one place to another that's all done by
ETL so we'll talk about ETL and detail
all right and after that I'll talk about
water data martyrs and then what's at
metadata
now these two things are two topics
which I can only explain once I have
given you an introduction to the other
topics all right so any of you tie it
out that you have during the session you
can ask me at that time and I will clear
them right away and once I am done
teaching about all these four different
topics related to data warehousing
architecture I will show you the
complete architecture and the complete
the life cycle of data and what kind of
insights your company can get and what
can our advantages you can get out of
data warehousing right so data browsing
architecture will be the last topic in
my presentation and after my
presentation I will show you a
demonstration of creating data warehouse
where I will import data from database
and sort in a data warehouse
right so this will be the topics of
today's session I hope at the agenda is
clear everyone if you all agree with me
please start knowledge that and also to
acknowledge the fact if you can hear my
voice and see my screen so if everything
is fine I can get started with this
session you can acknowledge and put any
of your doubts or queries during the
session inside the chat box that you see
on your right side so I'm going a couple
of acknowledgments from my everyone all
right so Rodney says yes Roger says yes
all right guys and a couple of more
people are also able to get my voice and
see my screen great so since the agenda
is clear everyone let me get started
with the first topic that is what is the
need for business intelligence okay so
will understand why business
intelligence and data warehousing are
among the fundamental and the foundation
for any company's success so why do we
have to go for business intelligence
right business intelligence is the
activity which contributes to the growth
of any company and there are also so
many MCS which have been established
with the past few decades now how did
that happen
they just didn't happen by luck right so
there were all small ideas there were
small companies that start with a small
idea and then they grew bigger so that's
what any company that wants to do good
that's what they do the first thing is
they plan what they want to be and
depending on that plan then they start
gathering data okay now once they gather
data they know they're in the right
direction now so they know what to do
and how to do it and then they do
further data analysis on that they make
up their plans and they come up with
strategies they come to know what is the
important thing that needs to be done
and all these things so when they
finally have a conflict and then they
execute it into a business action and
once those actions are taken then
they're all good right that's when the
business starts to grow that's when the
company gets back all their investment
and that's how actually any company
grows so any company that has done well
over the past few decades of beaut
Microsoft or Google or Facebook or
Amazon Facebook's all of these companies
that have all grown from small ideas and
they've become something big right and
any startup that's also trying to do
great nowadays even they have got off
the same strategy and the same plan this
is a very common thing and this is
something that everyone knows okay but
this is not whatever you know come to
teach all in this section what I've come
to teach all is something about data
warehousing
and that is one of the most important
strategies or activities which is part
of business intelligence right so before
I talk about
data warehousing let me go into details
of business intelligence so what exactly
is business intelligence BI is the act
of transforming raw or operational data
into useful information for business
analysis right so BR your stance or
business intelligence that's the short
form and yeah it is the act of
transforming any law or operational data
so when we say R or operational data
it's basically the data that you've
collected the data that you have about
your business so it can be revealed with
your company starting from scratch then
whatever data you've gathered so you've
kind of got to take that data and
convert that into useful information
right so that you can plan and make
strategies and if you are a company
that's well established then you have to
look at your passes us how your company
has done over the past six months or the
past the last quarter or the last year
or two and then may come up with proper
plan for your future so when you do this
then this entire access call has
business intelligence and how does it
work and this working of business
intelligence is with respect to the ID
technology okay so VI which is baitul
data warehouse technology okay this is
the key term that you got to remember
the VI is based on data warehouse
technology it extracts information from
a company's operational systems and the
railer is extracted is first transformed
and remediates transformed it's cleaned
and integrated and then it's loaded into
data warehouses now the thing here is
there be data in many forms it can be
the form of flash files you can be the
form of databases such a running company
and if you are trying to do good ok if
you've been working for a number of
years then you'll have data about your
past success about your sales data your
marketing data your expenditure all
these things you might have served on
any form maybe the form of databases may
be in the form of for Excel flat file so
all these things so these make up your
data source right so you have this data
over here and this data is first
transformed
ok it's of course it's first extracted
then insert the data warehouse it's
transformed we just cleaned and
integrated ok so once it's transformed
then it's ready for you to do your data
visualization or data analysis it's in a
form in which you can get inside and
this is the data which the end users
will be using so you will have your data
analyst in a company right your data
scientist your data analyst and all the
other people your managers your Rob and
the other guys you call the big shots in
your company so all these people they'll
be getting they'll be using this data to
make your analysis and that the role of
data warehouse it is
between these two end points and this
serves as the basis or the springboard
for success and finally since the data
is credible it is used for business
insights yeah this is again something
that I just spoke about right so now
you'll have a better understanding of
how business intelligence works right so
you all know that this is intelligence
is something important and how important
and how good it is how does it work
is what I've explained in this slide so
you all guys all agree with me here
anybody has any doubts
Rodney Rajesh Jacob okay pretty good all
right nice okay so I have a question
from Jacob Jacob is asking is it our
house the only thing that's needed okay
Jacob this is just an overview of
business intelligence okay the rough
diagram and it's actually not just data
warehouse so data we're also something
that I'm concentrating on today's
session okay so that's why we have data
webs there's another important step
called of data visualization so that
visualization is done by end-users right
since it's done over here on mention
this diagram but what you got to
remember is data warehousing is probably
the springboard without data warehousing
the visualization cannot be done and
data from the source is right from here
it cannot be directly used for any other
purpose so that's the role of data
warehouse so that's what data warehouses
and yeah I'll clear take off now okay
great
that's fine so let me go to the next
slide then another you know what exactly
is business intelligence let's go to
details of data warehousing let's
analyze the challenges in achieving
business intelligence so first of all
why should be user data warehouse
because data collected from various
sources and certain various databases
cannot be directly visualized ok now
look at this immature in this diagram we
have different databases like Oracle you
have the sap base you have the - of
sequel server and then you have other
databases like sequel database and all
these things ok you can also have flag
files in this list so all these make up
your data sources you as a company can
show data everywhere so if you're a
small company you might just deal with
Microsoft Excel and you might just use
small analysis tools okay but occur a
big company that has a lot of data
coming in so if you're a retail company
then you'll ask for details about your
sales your marketing and what's been
your growth so for all these purposes
you need big databases right so all the
data will be stored in all these
databases ok
now the problem is some teams in a
company might be using one database and
the other teams may be using another
database now
the biggest problem that people would
find while they are doing visualization
or doing analysis data is they're in
different databases and they'll have a
tough time integrating them right now
that's where data warehouse comes in and
that's where data warehouse course data
Pharos it will get data from all these
databases and then processes that data
and brings it in a form it is very easy
to do visualization ok that's what the
second point says the data first needs
to be integrated and then processed for
visualization takes place now this is
the problem that you have with the
regular databases ok the data from here
they cannot be directly use of
visualization and since data warehouse
can do that since it can integrate data
from multiple data warehouses and since
that data can be processed easily since
it brings the data in a form which can
be easily visualized that's where it
arose has the advantage that's where its
course so that's the problem with data
base and that's the advantage the data
by rows are in fact little arrows it's
more like an act it's a discipline which
is followed by people ok these are
actions which are adopted and studies
which are taken ok that's what rate of
warehouses and that is the role it plays
in us doing very good visualization all
right so now there should be a little
more clear few people as to why data
barrels plays the key role in the whole
BI aspect right ok great let's go to the
next slide then now let us understand in
details what a data warehouse is now a
data warehouse is a central location
where consolidated data from multiple
locations ok or databases that's what
locations me from multiple locations are
stored now this needs this is exactly
what I explained earlier right so you
have got a DES that's coming in from
multiple data sources you have all the
data you consolidate all the data into
one single place and the data barrows is
mated separately from the organization's
operational database now TWh your
Stanford rate of warehouse all right so
and here it says that data warehousing
is made in separately from
normalizations operational database ok
and yeah the DW has your Stanford data
warehousing and the reason data
warehouses are stored separately from
the operational database is because the
reader should not get affected so you
will have your operational data on one
end ok where all your legacy data will
be stored where all your Raymond
probably in your real time data will be
stored so all your transactions all your
sales all your marketing order
operations data all these will be sold
in one place and
in during the alpha-beta warehousing
what you're doing that when you are
making analysis when using the data you
don't want that to get corrupted right
so it's more like a backup so for backup
to our purpose your operational data is
separated so you have an operational
data you keep it in one area and then
you create a new database okay in fact
it's called a date of bed house okay so
you get all the data from multiple
sources or maybe from a single source
get it into a data warehouse and from
here you do your analytics so the
process of getting the operational data
into your data warehouse that's called
extraction transform and loading ok now
when you've done these three things you
form your data warehouse and from your
data warehouse you use the OLAP strategy
okay so all apps and for online
analytical processing so you use this
OLAP or strategy or with this analytics
processing for the business users to do
analysis so it's there in the name right
stands for analytical processing so the
business users water analysis they want
to do they do it because there is the
the observe pull up and then along with
the analysis they can also do
polarization for visualization you have
various the tools like tableau and click
you write they are some amazing tools so
you can get this data you can get it
into the data warehouse and the data
warehouse also it can be sort in some
kind of database it can store this data
back into some kind of Oracle or sequel
server or maybe even in Excel and when
you have stored there then you can do
your lab activities there and also you
can import that data into your various
visualization tools like tableau or Rock
click view and tasks you can you know
get insights you can get insight into
your data you can download presentations
during your board meetings you can show
your findings to your superiors or your
managers into all these things so that's
what a data warehouses ok and then the
next point we have your end users access
it whenever any information is needed
yeah so this again the same thing right
so once the data comes in from the
operational system it's stored in the
data warehouse it stays there so this
data is not going to change so whatever
change you want to do your operational
data that can be done ok you can modify
the data you can update it you can
delete data here you can do all these
things but once your data comes in your
data warehouse
it cannot be deleted ok you can maybe
modify things the worst case scenario
you can modify data here ok but it's
highly advisable not to but of course
you can so that's the thing
but yeah the keep on you got to notice
the angelus can use any
they can probably access data that is 10
years old or 20 years old and all these
things and how can they do it by using
Ola so they can do the analysis and they
can run it over different times right so
these are a series of snapshots so based
on you can find data analysis like what
happened at this particular day on this
particular York all these things you can
see what kind of product was sold
Namie customer spot which product all
these details can be easily gathered and
access from here so that's what we save
and you know the data can be accessed at
any time by the end users or the
business users so the business users
here are typically those managers it can
be managers or people who are leading
board meetings who are making a plan for
the next quarter or the next half year
or the next one year and all these
things so guys yeah that that was a
question which Jacob asked eyes so Jacob
ours would be the end users would be the
business users so that's what they are
okay people will be using this data it
can be even data analysts or data
scientists and all those people right
guys are you clear Jacob okay great and
there is no to get the data whereas your
it is not do it every time when new data
is added to the database so what this
means is you have data coming in to your
operational data ok this operational
data will get updated every minute
probably every second if you have a 24/7
working sales team then they'll be
making sales around the clock right so
as and when any sale happens the data
will be added to your database your
operational data but that not
necessarily needs to be added to your
rate of arrows also so what you find in
your data warehouse is legacy data right
its historical data which you can use to
perform analysis or all those find
inside the operational data if you have
new radar coming in here this has to be
imported and this has to be moved to
your data warehouse first and then once
it's moved your rate of warehouse from
here it can be used for analysis and all
these things by our end users so that's
what this diagram here means and that's
what the last point also means okay data
warehouse is not loaded every time you
read are added to this database okay so
I hope it's all here Rodney Rodney and
Rajesh okay great so fine then if you
guys are gonna said what data warehouses
I can go to my next slide and I'll talk
about the next topic so
was about data warehouse now let's look
at the advantages of a data warehouse
when we compare it to any database or
just regular flat files and all these
things the first advantage is that
subject questions can be answered by
storing trends so this is the biggest
benefit that you can get right your raw
data analysts and data scientists they
can answer strategic questions they can
read the past data they can predict your
future also by coming up with by having
their strategic questions be answered
because friends can be analyzed they're
using the data warehouse is basically
the Riddler stood in an operational data
also but it is that so easier to study
trends on your data warehouse rather
than data base ok because Rajat sure has
a question guys Rajesh nothing why not a
database what is it that data where else
can do that database cannot do so guys
that's what I was answering correct
Rajesh remember the first thing is let
me go back my previous life was this ok
so you have an operational data here so
you have all your data here which is
probably legacy which is even real time
all these things will be present here
but in your data warehouse you only have
your legacy data you only have the
historical data you won't have real-time
data but that doesn't mean it's not you
know it's any lesser than operational
data since you have your data completely
your you have the freedom to do your
analysis and you also have your freedom
to do your data visualization ok so
that's one advantage and the other
advantage with the data warehouse is
that your data will be coming in from
multiple sources right it will have
water coming in from multiple sources
your tables will not be related to each
other even if it's from the same greater
risk you'll have multiple tables for
multiple teams right and you can't
easily integrate all these tables
because they'll be separated
ok that is one big problem that you will
face when you are doing the analysis or
visualization but in a data warehouse it
will be stored such that all the data
will be interlinked right could be
related by using schemas or all these
things so you have a different schemas X
star schema snowflake schema galaxies
schema and all these things so you have
all these dimensions and facts all these
concepts using which you can relate your
row tables you can relate your data so
all your rows and all your columns your
which are unrelated which are sort of
separate databases or in separate flat
files separate tables they
all be integrated they cannot be stored
together so there'll be a relation so
every single row or every single table
will be linked with each other and when
you do an analysis like that then you
can probably pull data across the
database right so whatever it has stored
across the various databases you can put
all that data and link them all together
by running one query and you can get all
those details in this store by just
running one single query using your data
warehouse so that is the advantage
Ratish right so did you get it Rajesh
this is the second advantage okay that's
why business users they prefer to use
the data coming in from data warehouse
so this is a more structure and this is
the more related data when you compare
it with the operational data and the
basic data source all right fine fine
fine very good very good as it I hope
you've cleared your doubts I hope that
the same thing with even others right
okay even with your great grid Rodney is
telling now I've got reading okay fine
fine
ready night that was a very good
question good you asked me that and yeah
I'm glad you stopped me because I could
explain it in a better way so anyways
moving on
that was about tour data warehouse and
talking about the advantages of data
warehouse I spoke about the fact that
you know you can other strategic
questions by studying all the trends by
asserting your past data you can you
will have all the graphs you can have
the pictorial representations right you
can see what was whether the trend is
growing or not which practice getting
sold how better is getting sold all
these things you can easily read by
using a data warehouse because data
warehouse makes your data more readable
information so that is the thing so you
guys must own the different wien data
information right so information is
something that is processed process the
data is called information so
information is easier to understand
easier to relate to and easier to use
now that's what data warehouse does it
takes you one step closer to information
right so that's the advantage and yeah
the other thing is data warehousing is
faster and it's more accurate yes this
is something that's completely true
because in your data base you will have
loads of data you will of course you'll
have a historical data and real time
data but the thing is it's run going to
be as fast as our data warehouse data
warehouse you'll have links there you
will have
we'll have tables you have relations
between the various tables and because
of all these things you can easily
gather and you can now easily access
data here and the data that is gathered
from your also more accurate because
they only much change because there's
not going to be any question of
real-time data coming in and changing
things around right so you may live so
whatever you know processing or analysis
it's done based on the past data that is
stored in the data warehouse and that
makes this data more accurate it makes
it more stable so stability is the key
word here and stability is not something
that you can have all the time in
database but you will have it with the
data where or so that's the second big
advantage and in fact there are many
more advantages right so data
warehousing is something that you guys
will understand when you start
implementing so in the demonstration
that I'll show you later today that time
you'll understand you know you lunch and
the other advantages with data
warehousing ok and one important point
that you need to notice that data
warehouse is not a product that a
company can go and purchase ok it needs
to be designed and it depends entirely
on the company's requirement so like I
said your data base is something if an
answering right your database or your
various own your data your data source
is something that you have to have and
then your data warehouse is something
that is designed and which complete
depends on your company's requirement
based on your data source based on the
requirements that you want to get out of
your data source out of the error that
you have in your data source you can
come up with a way to design your data
warehouse right so data warehouse is
more for concept and strategy and it's
not an end product it's not a tool or
something that you can use you have
multiple tools to implement data
warehousing and the thing you go to
notice data warehousing is not a product
ok so it's a strategy that you adopt to
make your data more readable and make
your data in a better fashion ok so
that's the biggest advantage with data
warehouse so look at this guy here ok
he'll just run one query on the data
warehouse
ok now what the data warehouse will do
so the data is taken from the
operational systems alright and in fact
if there are multiple operational
systems then all those multiple data
from multiple operational systems will
be integrated together and then that
will be standardized and any
inconsistencies there and that data will
be removed ok now these are the three
important things the data has taken from
the operational systems
and that data if there are multiple
operational systems those will be
integrated okay and then the real will
be standardized and any inconsistencies
will be removed and once all these three
things are done then it will be stored
in an easy format which can be you know
which is very suitable for analysis and
access and that is what the data
warehouses so whenever you run the query
on this kind of data warehouse which is
the process on which is ready in such a
fashion you can get the result quickly
and this result close to be more
accurate all right so this is a big
advantage with the Year data warehouse
so I hope but this clear it's a pretty
simple concept and it's just overview of
what I explained in the previous slides
right right Jacob cadre Rodney all right
okay so moving on there are four
important properties that a data
warehouse has okay and the default
properties are based on what Bill in one
set bill inmon is the father of data
warehousing and initially you define
data warehouse as a subject oriented
integrated and myriad and non-volatile
collection of data in support of the
management decision-making process okay
so when we say subject oriented it means
that the data will be categorized and
stored by the business subject rather
than by the application now let me get
back to this point after I finish these
three ok now this the most complicated
point okay
now talking about integration right he
said that it has integrated so the
meaning here is data on a given subject
is connected from disparate sources and
sold in a single place so this is
something you people known it has
collected from multiple sources and we
are all stored in one single place so
you don't have to you know go about
searching for data and different tables
or different sources and all those
things and then your data it is time
variant it is stored as a series of
snapshots
each representing a period of time so
when you do your analysis you can do it
based on a series of snapshots of time
okay
you can see what was your raw company
status on this month or that your or on
this month this year what is the
progress that has been made or if it's
not a progress if it's the same if your
raw code hasn't stagnated then you can
find out what are the metrics what are
the reasons why that has happened you
can find all these things and you can
look at all those idiots from a time
approach right from a time variant
approach so
is what data where O's the advantage
sure is okay that's one of the
properties and the advantages are you
have and then data is non-volatile the
data in a data warehouse is not updated
or deleted so this is what is the other
property that I mentioned earlier once
the data comes into a data warehouse it
cannot be deleted or run either can it
be changed in fact it can be updated but
the process of form to update it is a
little complicated okay but of course it
can be updated and deleted so that's the
thing but it's highly recommended not to
operate okay so that's the advantage
with the data warehouse and since it
will not be changed there is no question
of quit getting corrupted and that's why
doing analysis and all these things are
you know a better option now getting
back to the first point we you said that
it is subject oriented right there does
categorize and store by business subject
rather than by the application now what
this means is the data here will be
stored or the data that you will your
that you retrieve from a reader
warehouse right you will get in the form
that you wanted to now if you want to go
me an example of that let's say that we
are dealing with a radial company and in
my retail company I have a marketing
team I have a sales team and I have a
Operations team and my system kind of
keeps keeps track of all the sales that
happens over a period of time okay let's
say the last one month whatever sales
they've done they have showed all those
details and then you have your
operations team which will make sure
there is a smooth running of all the
process once the sale is done gradually
the activities involved right like
shipping the product and you know all
these things shipping and coordinating
via transferring activities and all
these things and then your marketing
team is or someone is probably that team
which would take care of for your sales
which would ensure that the right leads
come in to ensure that the right people
get the right the kind of service and
it's all about acquiring more such sales
right so your marketing team is on top
of the funnel and they do all these
things now if you want to integrate all
these details if you want one single
view of them and you want to find
details such that in this particular
month
what was your dose is and what was the
kind of operations that was done right
what kind of service was given to those
customers and from how they became our
customers so when we the question of how
something related to marketing so if you
have a question like this where three
factors are involved then at that point
of time it's your data warehouse which
comes to the rescue
because many order questions are related
to this particular time and these three
different term metrics say is marketing
and operations then all these things can
be integrated and you can get one single
view similar data warehouse this is what
a database lacks correct so you know
integrating all your different data
sources and you know storing them
together and making them ready for any
time axis is the biggest advantage and
the most important property of data
warehouse so if you guys had any problem
the previous slide then I'm pretty sure
this is something you have really
understood after this slide because this
is probably the epitome of for data
warehouse right these three properties
if you understand these four properties
then you are pretty much ready to
understand the next part the next or you
are ready to go to the next step and
data warehousing right so finally you
should have understood how important all
this is why I know how important
business intelligence is and what can
improve the data warehouse place you can
just think of how among us our deal a
data warehouse is correct yeah so a
couple of people are satisfied with that
so in order to spoken about the
properties let's go to the next slide
and okay now we have to talk about key
terminology okay so right now we've
understood data warehousing from a
higher level
okay now let's dig deep let's go to mode
basics okay let's understand the key
terminology that are all related and
that are involved in a data warehousing
so first of all we have LTP and OLAP
okay now there are four things I will
talk about the differences between OLTP
and Ola okay then I'll talk about UDL
I'll talk about data Mart and then
finally about metadata okay so let me go
to the first topic that is Ltd versus
OLAP okay
so in this part which is l DB over DT
stands for online transaction processing
okay now this is something that is the
representation of data fir database if
you're running any kind of queries on
your database then that's called online
transaction processing okay and then o
is last stands for online analytical
processing and this is the property of a
data warehouse
so any kind of query or any kind of
analysis that you run on your data
warehouse that's called as an OLAP
activity correct so let's go to the
differences between the two so first of
all any data that is stored in a
relational database right in an which
involves OLTP that contains the current
data as well as past data okay
current data as well as path data but
with respect to data warehouse and while
performing an OLAP you will be dealing
with only historical data here okay it
contains only historical data and the
data that will be stored in your
database okay when you use the OLTP then
those queries will be useful and running
your business okay when you have to run
your business like if you want to store
the data of the number of sales that has
happened today like every time a field
happens then your records in your
database as we updated right so that's
what we say so when you update your
record with the latest details of your
customer then that is what is the
meaning of useful and running the
business okay but in order for something
that is usually analyzing the business
so here the kind of activities that you
would do is that of finding out details
like at what time how many customers
bought the products or at what time
which customer but which all products
all these kind of questions will be
answered with as both hola okay and then
the whole OLTP model of accessing data
of accessing or querying data on a
database is based on the entity
relationship model okay but whereas with
the data warehouse it's based on the
star schema or the snowflake schema and
the fact constellation schema okay so
it's called also called as the Gatsby
schema so all these three things will
come into picture okay and then your
relational database it provides a
primitive and a highly detailed data so
since you'll have one database if you
run one kind of a query like a select
star from this particular table then it
would give you all the details that are
stored right so you cannot filter too
many details with respect to the data
that is stored in a database okay of
course you can but the level of you know
the filtering and analysis that you can
do is not that much so the reader that
you will get back from your query write
the result that you will get back from a
query will be highly detailed okay and
it will not be exactly what you want so
it will not be that accurate but whereas
with
pull up when you do an OLAP on a data
warehouse it provides summaries and the
consolidated data Neverland point to you
exactly what you want to look for
correct so it will it's a very processed
data and it points to one particular
aspect which matters the most so that's
what this is and then the oil TB you use
this for writing data into the database
okay so ever like I said the same sales
example whenever a new sales happens
your database has to be updated right
with the new records of the product sold
of the customer who bought the product
and all these things so you basically
use it for writing data into the
database but your data barrows is
primarily used for reading data from the
data warehouse so right into the data
warehouse or something that is done so
that you can do the reading from the
data warehouse ok the primary concept
here is to read the data from the data
warehouse and to do the analysis and all
the visualization actually but with the
database it's more of writing the data
into the database alright and the size
so speaking of the size a databases size
would raise anywhere between hundred me
to 1gb ok and this is also a very big
number 100 MB is a very less number I
would say and one tip is also very less
so it would typically be much more than
this but come back to this range if you
look at a data warehouse a data
warehouse is ranges from 100 GB to 1 TB
correct
so your data wells will have all the
historic Durant and it will have all the
relationships between the different data
right such that so you can do your
analysis straight away so since it makes
all the data more efficient and stuff
the data here the size ranges from 100
GB to almost 1 P so that is what our
data warehouses and that's the part of
data warehouse all right and I can
actually show you the difference between
the two in today's demo session ok later
during this session I'll show you that
the size of the source file that I have
added with the different sizes of the
two files that are they using as the
source and then after the UH processed
the data are all sorted in my data
warehouse I'll show you what is side of
that data so there will be a big
difference between the two okay and the
red arrows will be modes in the database
I will show you that aspect later all
right
so and that's about this point and then
yeah of course this will be fast ok
database is fast and it provides high
performance alright so your data where
owes of course it's not as fast as your
database but it's how you sexy
it's highly flexible because it gives
you different views so you have
something called as the OLAP cube right
so using the OLAP cube you can get the
you can look at insights from different
angles different perspectives and
different views of data we get so that
is the big advantage sure okay and the
number of cycles that is accessed it is
intense but whereas with the data
warehouse the number of records access
is in millions all right an example of
this can be all the bank transactions
made by a particular customer so if
there is one customer and whatever
transactions he's made you will get all
those or you know all those videos right
so supposing take the example of any
email statement that you request for any
email statement or a bank account
statement all these things so they are
an example of OLTP so whatever radials
are present in the database those will
be given to you but whereas the bank
transactions made by your customer at a
particular time okay this is a most
filtered query and the answer also will
be a very accurate and point Q to
exactly that particular question so
that's what an OLAP is so it's normal to
be one overview here is one exactly
point you to what you want it's not very
much in detail but it's more accurate
correct so that's what an app is and
that's the difference between LTP and
OLAP okay so there are two strategies
that are used for you know accessing
data
well DB is used for accessing data in a
database and we'll appreduce for
accessing data in a data warehouse
alright so I hope I mean this is cured
everyone all right guys
okay if you have any doubts then that
will be cleared by this slide okay
because the examples are there for both
these strategies so if you want more
examples of an OLTP then one would be
that of a supermarket server which
records every single product purchase at
that market okay so every single perk in
their history or probably in the last
one month all these things can be
accessed using your OLTP okay from your
database so you don't have options to do
much of filtering here and then another
example that of a bank server which
records every time a transaction is made
for a particular account every time or
transaction is made in a particular
account the data will be updated in that
table and you can create that kind of
data and you'll get that result okay
another example is our railway
reservation server which records the
transaction of a
so whatever equities that passenger does
so all these things will be recorded by
the reservation server right so this is
one example but when you look at the
OLAP there will be much more detail the
query juror will be much more detail and
the answers will be much more accurate
and very crisp okay so an example is a
data from bank manager wants to know how
many customers are utilizing the ATM of
his branch okay because maybe based on
that he may take a call whether to
continue that idiom or relocate that
idiom to a different place right so this
guy this bank manager would want to one
of us for understand if there's any use
and having the ATM in that place are
people using it correct if people are
using it then how many people are using
it at what time are they using it or
would it be better to have the ATM in a
different location where it's much more
easier for people to access it so all
these kind of questions will be answered
only if you have the oil up in place
okay only when you are a data warehouse
in this not with the database so another
example is that of an insurance company
that wants to know the number of
policies each agent has sold okay this
will happen a better performance
management of agents so you'll have
multiple agents in your company and
you'd want to know their performance
right you know you would want to know
who is the best performing agent you
would want to know how they're
performing why is this person performing
better you can you know optimize each of
their performances so all these things
can be done with the help of data
barrows and they can be done with help
of Allah right the OLAP strategy the
OLAP activity that is done on a data
warehouse so that is a difference
between the two right so I hope you're
getting the difference as your guys
right OAP and OLAP okay since it's all
clear let me go to the next slide now
the second important terminology that we
have with data warehouse is that of ETL
extract transform and load so by going
by the definition usual is the process
of extracting the data from various
sources transforming this data to meet
your requirements and then loading the
data into a target data warehouse okay
you are exciting the data from here
right you're extracting it and then
you're transforming it into the way you
want in a more readable fashion in a
more relatable fashion then once that is
done you load the data into a data
warehouse and the whole process of for
getting rid of from your data source to
your data warehouse this
done by the EDL the activities of
extraction extraction transformation and
loading so we have got popular tools for
for this very process so you have tools
like talent informatica you have open
all these things and informatica and
talent are probably the most popular
tools for this process for extraction
transformation and loading data into a
data warehouse right so this is
something that usually understood by now
and it out guys because I don't want to
waste much time I want to go to the next
slide and teach the next concept ok
great so the next one is data Mart okay
now if you've understood so far to LA
ETL then half your job is done
because data Mart is something that's
very close to a data warehouse and you
don't have that much of a difference
when it compared it to our data
warehouse but the basic difference
between the two is the data Mart is just
the same data warehouse itself but a
smaller version ok so let's look at the
line the definition here the data Mart
is a smaller version of the data
warehouse which deals with a single
subject ok the data Mart's are focused
on one area hence they draw the data
from limited number of sources and the
time taken to build the data match is
very less compared to the time taken to
build a data warehouse now to give you
an example or an explanation of this in
your data warehouse you will have all
your details right all your raw periods
that you have so this itself is more
refined ok but your data mods are
smaller versions of that data warehouse
which is used to satisfy only a certain
users supposing you have one particular
user base ok that is your sales team or
your sales manager who wants to use only
or receives data then that can be done
with the help of a data Mart and
similarly you have a marketing team who
wants to access all the marketing data
then that can be done by using a data
Mart ok
and then again you have other operations
team that wants to do wants to access
the operations data then you can give
them only access to that data by using
data Mart separately ok now the need for
data Mart is first of all your data
warehouse will show all the data ok your
sales data marketing data operations
data so all the data coming from
different data sources so you'll have
multiple data sources right all that
will be stored in one single place and
from here this will again
like separate data sources right so for
the sales team this will act as a data
source for a marketing team this lap as
a data source and then for the operation
seen this Mart will act as a data source
now the now as in the question as to why
we need them it's to you know probably
more security to enable more security
and integrity because since all your
data will be there in your data
warehouse and if you let all your your
entire company access the data warehouse
they will get access to all the details
and all the all the work that is done by
other teams okay so there might be
multiple teams and every multiple
strategies which you might not want to
reveal other rates so at that enough
time you can divide your data warehouse
such that only this particular users
okay your CL user or a particular user
base gets access to only certain data
from your data warehouse so at that kind
of a time a data Mart is useful or you
can have a second data Mart for only
another set of user base for example
your marketing users so they will get
access only the marketing data from your
data warehouse right and then your
operations data similarly which can be
accessed only by your operations force
so that's the different advantages that
you have since the data is all divided
it's all stored separately different
people have access to different
different parts of your data warehouse
so this probably brings more advantages
right so that's the data Mart and that's
why I told you that you know if you
understood so far till then half your
job is done but data Mart or something
like that extends the functionality of
your data warehouse right so that is the
thing and stinking off the differences
that is there in this table the data
warehouse will store the enterprise-wide
data right the enterprise of the
enterprise wide data whereas data much
will store it departments wise data
there'll be multiple departments in the
whole company in the enterprise and they
will sort department-wide data and then
the data warehouse it will have multiple
subject areas okay but a data Mart will
have a single subject area there'll be
multiple data sources in case of a data
warehouse okay but in case of data
Mart's they'll be limited data source in
fact they can be just one data where all
right this will act as a source pure
data match but however we have gossiped
limited your because not always do you
need a data warehouse there are also
instances where your data source itself
as an input data model okay now that is
something that you will answer
next slide okay so just don't get
transfused when we see that limited
resources it does not mean this is the
only source they can also come from a
data a property a source like a flat
file or from a data base and all these
things all right and then a data
warehouse it occupies largely this of
course because there is a lot of data on
to price where data will be stored your
multiple subject areas will be dead
because of that there's larger data here
at state and that's why there is greater
memory that's occupied okay but in case
of your data mod it occupies limited
memory because it's very crisp and
limited to only a particular department
okay and then the other thing is data
where else is long it takes longer time
to implement but a data Mart is a takes
very short time to implement it is once
you have all your data warehouse or
stuff in place you can easily divide
them by creating different data mass
okay so be a tough part is your data
well so once you've got a data warehouse
ordered you can easily from your data
mass in fact there is even the other way
there are also practices where you first
bring your data mass and once you've
done that after that you create one
single repository and that's when you
create a data warehouse so there's also
two approaches here one is the
top/bottom approach and the other one is
bottom-up approach so those are the two
things and I'll go to details about
these two approaches in my next session
ok of course I can't do it today because
we have very limited time all right so
moving on to the next slide
ok now speaking of the different types
of data mass ok this is what I was
talking about in the previous slide so
you have three different types one is a
dependent data Mart the other one is
independent data Mart
the third one is hybrid data mod you are
dependent data matters are the data's
first extracted from the OLTP systems
and then populated in the central data
barrows and then from this data
warehouse the Ritter travel to the data
Mart so look at this example ok this is
the standard practice or the year the
default approach where you have an OLTP
source then you get the data into a data
warehouse and then from the data
warehouse you form a data model ok we'll
have multiple data mass where each
different Mart will have particular data
from the entire data warehouse ok this
is the first regular approach and then
you have the independent data Mart which
is a slight variation compared to
dependent so here the rears directly
received from the
system okay you don't have a data
barrels in place over here that is what
this line means and this is suitable for
small organizations or smaller groups
within an organization so basically an
organization which is very small it
might not need to go to the trouble of
creating a data warehousing stuff so you
can just have an OLTP source and from
there they can just get the data in onto
a data Mart and they can use for various
purposes okay that's what we have an
independent data Mart for so that's the
difference it just does not involve a
major data warehouse so directly the
data goes to a data Mart in fact you'll
have multiple data Mart over your you'll
have great or not one dat amount to one
stuff okay which they coming directly
from the OLTP source and then you have a
third type which is the hybrid data Mart
so by definition you might know what
this is right by your the name of by the
name itself is pretty obvious it's
combination of these two the data here
is fed from both the OLTP systems as
well as the data warehouse okay so look
at this example for that tour instance
you three are here it's coming from the
ODB source as well as from a data
warehouse so this is what the hybrid
data models and depending on your
company depending on the size of your
company the requirements of your company
or your organization you can choose one
of these you can model your entire
database and data barrows in any one of
these models either the dependent or the
independent data mass or hybrid Radames
alright so that's about the different
types of data model so moving on to the
next slide we have something called as
metadata now people here from
programming background or from the
technology background you might all be
aware of what America does metadata
basically is defined as data about data
okay
it contains data about where your actual
data stored supposing you have your raw
data right where is that data stored
what is the size of that data so these
are the answers to these kind of
questions is what will be Plus on your
metadata your metadata will contain the
location of your actual data it is not n
the size of your actual data it will
contain details like which was the
source it came from and when was it
created all these details will be stored
in your metadata right so that's what
made our IRA's so that's how different
our metadata is from regular data and a
metadata is specifically in a data
warehouse it defines the Soraa there is
a flat file
a tional database and other objects so
the reason that we give so much
importance to metadata in a data
warehouse is because take the example of
any company that's having a 24/7
business okay they have a rolling system
that works throughout the clock the 24/7
they are sales coming in data will be
going into your database okay now in
this case you cannot always you know
keep adding data into your data
warehouse because you know that data
warehouse is not real-time correct so
you have to manually update your data
into your data warehouse probably at
every day at a particular time maybe at
6 o'clock every day in the morning
or maybe once in the night at 10 o'clock
or at basically at regular intervals
you've got to so data into your data
warehouse and this whole strategy
becomes difficult because you have to do
this process every day so every day when
a guy comes in in the morning he has to
look at the new data that has come into
your data database correct and then from
that data base which is data source he
has to add that adagio data warehouse
now this process becomes difficult that
is where a metadata comes in handy with
metadata you define the address where
your data sources okay you define the
address of your raw of that file from my
data's coming in or your relational data
from measure data is coming in and then
you can also impact us or the metadata
of your raw data warehouse where you
want the data to go so it basically
Ellen you know see a lot of your time
okay and this is the most common and the
most you know unspoken fact about data
warehouse so any professional that's
dealing with data barrows you would
always be using metadata because it
saves a lot of time because every time
you cannot be importing data from a
database you always have to get it from
your metadata by defining rules and
defining your source and your targets
correct
so mirror it has gives lot of your time
and this is something I will show you a
demonstration on ok and when I show
demonstration you will understand how
easy it is so we just read the rule says
that you have your source over here and
then you have your destination over your
target over here and once you've written
this thing you don't have to go back
here so every day it might pick up the
data from here and it might move your
data warehouse and all these things it
will update all the new details
which are present in your database and
it will add it into your data warehouse
so that's what a metadata does it's a
very big advantage and it's one of the
best sergey's are being
okay and then the final point here is
metadata is used to define which table
is source and target and which concept
is used to build a business logic called
transformation to the acts alone but
yeah this is what I told you right so
it's used to define which is your source
and target and how to build your
business logic called transmission so
transmissions basically your rob act of
converting your source data into the
form that you want to and what is the
logic that you use correct so all the
different the filter criteria all the
transformational criterias all these
things can be also done using the
metadata correct so even the process of
forgetting data from your source your
destination it can involve extra
additional steps which can save your
time and default process basically so
every time you have data in a particular
format you might want to store it in a
different format and for all that
purpose you can use a metadata right so
since things will already be defined
you're the work of metadata is just to
get the data from the source define and
do the set of activities that is
required and which is already defined it
will perform all those activities and it
will sort in the case where you want to
do so that is the role of a metadata
correct so many data is very very
important very very very highly used and
it's actually the most important or
let's say the epitome of data barrows
okay this is probably the best thing
that can happen to data warehouse right
so that is the thing about the major a
degrees now going to the next slide we
have the architecture so now that you
know everything okay these four raw
terminologies are in our removin enough
for you to understand the architecture
okay so let's understand what the
architecture is so this is the entire
architecture diagram okay so this is
what you know data comes in from various
sources it can come from either a
database or in the from flat file and
then that data an action of ETL will be
performed on that data and it will go to
the staging area okay this called the
sitting area and this is the staging
database and the rails are stored over
here it is temporary data before data
completely moves to the data warehouse
it will be present in this area okay and
that is done by using the act of ETL and
also between moving to the data
warehouse the process of idle continues
so ETL process starts over here and it
ends over here okay and between the
conversion it is a temporarily stored in
a staging area and this is most often
present inside the ETL Coolidge okay
like your talent order semantics and all
these things and then this data will be
stored in your data warehouse so
whatever is the extracted transformed
unloaded it will be loaded into your
data warehouse and in your data barrows
you'll have metadata okay and of course
you'll have your raw data and then you
will have your aggregate data okay and
this is the reason why a data warehouse
is generally you know it's a larger in
size because it has not just raw data or
data base which from where the data is
coming in it will only have your raw
data okay but your data warehouse will
have additional stuff here it will of
course your metadata and your aggregate
data and together all these three things
together is what helping you being you
you doing your analysis sooner okay this
is what powers you're ready to do OLAP
online analytical processing okay so
that's what a data warehouse is and
that's what it stores and there's this
data warehouse you can either your
entire company can use the data
warehouse or if you want more for
security based access then you can
divide it into a different data mass
where your sales team and your different
teams like here we have a purchase table
and then you have a stock table so these
are like three different maths data mass
for three tables like a sales purchasing
stock so you'll have different tables
here and different teams can access
different set of tables okay your
purchase can be something that's used by
your operations people right and then
this may be something that's used by
your raw sales people and your stock may
be again used by your operations or your
sales group so that's what each of these
your you know defines you have your user
group one user group two and user group
three and each group will be getting
access to different parts of your raw
data warehouse because your data valves
will be divided into different data
Mart's and your data your different
groups we could access only that data
which they want to or which they can get
access to right so this way no group can
get access to every data that is
personal data warehouse and there's
advanced there's a little more data
security in this is okay same thing over
here so this group get action into this
data and this data and this table or
this mod right and then this user group
gets accessed
only the Riddler is Belgian they smart
and then this Mart so that's what the
entire architecture looks like and
resolve the data flow is right so if you
guys have understood this much then
you're ready to get a demonstration
correct guys and this is also my last
topic in this presentation so right now
I can go to my demonstration and what
I'll be doing in my demonstration is
I'll be using talent okay so I'll be x
importing data from my database I'll be
using be getting it from my Oracle
database and I'll be showing that into a
data warehouse which can be ready for
any kind of analysis or visualization on
any other visualization tool okay so
this act over here which I'm going to
show you this is what powers your
business intelligence right so are you
guys ready for the demonstration any
doubts your guys okay great Ronnie says
he's already he's all pumped up already
Ronnie that's very good so Jacobs also
ready and so is Rajesh are you Rajesh
can I get a yes from you yes very good
very good olive oil Rajesh so let's go
so let's go to the next part of my
session and there's going to be
demonstration where I will populate or
detail barrows okay
I'll be using talent for the data
warehouse activities and let's see how
we can import data from waste data
sources and create or data barrows so
for our hands-on session I'll be
importing data into my talent bi okay
like I said earlier we love using my
talent bi for night data warehousing and
ETL processes and I will create a data
warehouse out of using talent bi okay
now the data set that I'll be using is
that of per 10,000 row table and 3,000
row table okay so the there be one table
having 10,000 customer details okay and
then there'll be another table having
50,000
rows of transactions which each of those
customers make okay now based on this
data we have to find those customers who
have the lowest number of purchases okay
so right now my dataset is present in my
Oracle database okay and so I have two
tables and both my tables customers
table and my transactions table is
present in my Oracle database I also
have them in my here excel so first let
me show you how they are present in my
excel file okay okay so this is my
freshmen table
as you can see we have all these days
right we have all these fields here so
we have customer ID we have customer
name we have the address of that
customer city the country is from the
contact number and his email address
right and if I do this then you can see
that there are almost 10,000 cutoff
fields here so 10,000 rows are there
here so this means that you know I have
it's a pretty big data set and I can use
this in competition with my other table
okay so here we have customer ID as the
primary key okay and if I go back to my
other data set that's my transactions
table you can see that I have
furthermore freeze your Abdul for
invoice number of a stock code I have
description app quantity I have invoice
date unit price customer ID and Product
ID okay so there's a customer ID over
here also so the customer ID is the
primary key for there and this is the
foreign key over here so basically the
customer ID is the same and I will have
to do a lookup to that table with the
help of my customer ID okay since these
are two different tables I can create my
data warehouse with the help of this
particular primary and foreign key
concept I can create a link and I can
create I can probably just link these
two tables with the primary key for a
key concept okay so any doubt guys I'm
sure that you all know what a primary
key and a foreign key is and I fed all
anybody has a problem please let me know
okay so Rodney says I don't know what's
a foreign key okay so see Rodney the
thing is we have something called as the
primary key and a foreign key okay and
we use these two columns when we want or
when you want to use a combination of
two different tables right so if you
would consider the example of this one
then you can see that there are a number
of columns here and not everything is
matching with the radius in that put in
the other table okay so only customer ID
is the only common field okay so there's
a customer ID here and even in this
table we have a customer ID now the
thing is the customer ID is a primary
key because it's it's constant and it's
unique for each and every single record
over here so each and every customer
here will have a separate customer ID
okay so no two customers will have the
same customer ID okay and over here the
transactions here which has the inverse
numbers the
description of the product data spot is
the stock code the quantity all these
things are sorted by the customer
writing okay so if you find a particular
customer ID more than once then well
here you can find the person already
more than once that's because a customer
would have made more than one
transactions he might have you know come
on to their no we might have bought from
the same person more than twice or
thrice or four times or something like
that right so supposing I go back to
this person and I buy his products since
its radial so I buy products say 50 50
times then elapsed for three different
times my customary will appear here okay
but however URL it will not appear again
because it's a primary key right here so
that's the difference
so here the uniqueness is there that's
why it's called the primary key in this
case and here there is no uniqueness for
the customer writing okay can appear
more than once and that's why the
foreign key over here and what we're
going to do is for every customer ID
over here right so for every customer ID
over here we are going to link it to
this particular table with the help of
this customer ID since the customary is
the common field in both the cases I can
make a table which would show which
customer which would probably display
all these details along with the other
columns okay
now that's because I have customer ID
which is common in both the tables and
using that I can link the freezer are
there in this table and which are there
in the customers table right so that's
what I'm going to do now the similar
thing is also there in my or actual
database so let me show you that so this
is my your sequel developer GUI okay so
I have two tables that have customers
table and I have transactions table
right and then I have a final table but
this is not something which is relevant
so this is not something we'll be using
but we have the same two tables customer
table and transactions table as I showed
you you have these two here and you have
almost the same fields over here right
because if you see the customers table
we have the customer ID we have the
customer name we have the customer
number and the email address okay and
here we have originally we have the
address city and country now what I did
is when I imported this excel file into
my database I did not I ignored these
three columns right I didn't want these
details because I was not going to use
them in my data warehouse so if you see
a problem statement here
it
money says you have to find out the
cosmos grab the lower number of
purchases it doesn't mention that you
need their contrary details or city
details or anything for that matter of
fact so so because so for that reason in
power using the country city and address
fields would be your ways so that's why
I'm not imported these into my data
warehouse I have only the customer ID
the customer name my contact number and
my email address fields okay this would
be sufficient to find out the customer
details okay and to find the purchases
right and to see who has all the lowest
purchases we can use the other table so
in the other table there is a
transactions table we have this quantity
field right we have this column this
quantity table basically represents how
many products this particular person
purchased so this person with this
customer ID process
71 products right and then you have
another person whose purchases 67
projects products and so on so you also
have people who purchase only seven or
nine okay now our problem statement is
such that we have to find those people
who have made unless a very less number
of purchases okay now if we define less
to be ten then we can extract the data
such that the data warehouse gets the
details of only those people who have
made purchases of less than ten items
per order right so per transaction
whoever has made less than ten number
choices so this person has made seven
and this one this person has made nine
right so we can get a list of those
customers right using the customer ID in
go to that customer table and get his
name we can get his email addresses
phone number and other details okay and
we can now publish all those things and
we can probably export them to another
CSV file like this or we can put that
into our database basically into
anything which would support data
visualization right so that's what we
want and this function is what our
talent is going to do okay and what I'm
going to do for that purposes I'm going
to do a lookup from this table onto my
customers table right so this is my
transactions table and from here I'm
going to use the customer ID field to
look up to my customers table to obtain
their name email address and phone
number and all those things so first of
all let me introduce you
our talent interface again so this was
the Oracle sequel database which I
showed you earlier and this one is the
talent right to talent open studio this
is basically the data integration
version of the project okay now what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to show
you how talent works I'm going to show
you the layout over here first of all so
on the left here you can see that you
have something called a job design we
have a standard you have demo and then
you have various other projects here
right so all these are the different
projects that I have or created okay and
when we say job design so job design is
what you use to create your jobs on the
UI here okay so in our case in talent
whatever the actions are we performed it
we gotta do it with with respect to a UI
so we don't have a quoit this is not a
coding interface okay so of course this
talent runs on Java but it we don't but
talent is known for its GUI okay so we
can drag and drop the items on the job
task so this is the job design task bar
and we can first of all create a new
task ok supposing I wanna create on your
radar arrows by importing videos from
another database then we can start by
creating a new job design okay okay and
then create a new project in that job
design so right now we are in my your
local project so I'm going to create a
new job design okay I want to say create
standard job let's give a name to this
particular job so let's say data
warehousing bi session ok and
demonstration is the purpose so I'm just
gonna copy plates the same videos into
my description field also and I'm gonna
say finish ok now what you can see this
is a job designer so this is where I can
get all the data from my different
databases or fields files and get them
to my data warehouse so I can run my I
can write my projects over here and then
on the right hand side you have your
pilot okay so from your palette you can
choose the files or the database from
which are you from where you want to
input your data ok supposing you want to
import from a flat file then you can
just go to this heading file here so
under file you have input right so under
input you have all these options so if
you choose any of these options here and
if you just drag and drop them over here
then you can use them as a means input
data using
set the path where the exit file is
stored okay and you can choose that and
when you the Center for the fields you
can get the data in from these excel
files to your data warehouse okay to
your talent okay but exa file is a very
simple thing and I don't want to show
you that let me show you how to import
this large data from our database right
so we have also other options like big
data big data intelligence intelligence
we have business we have cloud right so
we have integrations with numerous
technologies here and what we would be
considering now on is that of databases
right so I have my Oracle database so
I'm going to go to a rattle under
databases and under Oracle I'm going to
say tea or rattle input okay let's see
where is it
articulate current put is right here so
I'm going to just click on to your input
and paste it here okay I'm going to drag
and drop it here
and now that I've done this I can use
this as a means to get my data in from
from my database okay so this is my
Oracle database right so let me
contribute my input first so first of
all I need to configure all these
details with respect to my host the port
number on which its hosted the database
name the username the password and all
these things okay so let me first start
off from the host
it's hosted on localhost right it's not
on any server it's not on any remote
server so one is going to say low close
and the port number is 1 Phi 2 1 so
these are details that I got when I was
when I installed this Oracle sequel
server right so you will have to
probably enter the same details when are
you create one and one fight 1 is
actually the default port on Metro at
use what happens usually was it so you
should have any problem there so
database you're this exit in my case so
ok and then my username is important and
the password is something we have to set
over here ok all right
then I've done this my connection type
is our atlas ID my database version is
11.6 alright so all the deals here are
correct now let's check my schema the
schemas basically is what is going to
you know map your fields from your
database to your they are talent right
so this is your you
so we have to define a schema here to
add details
okay so now that we have all these
filled here now let me go back to my
database right so we are in my customers
table and in my customers table I have
four pins customer ID customer name
customer number and email address so let
me add these four fields in my talent
okay
first column is going to be customer ID
this is going to be customer name this
is going to be customer phone number
this will be customer email address all
right so that's all fine basically the
data type that is coming from is all bad
care okay so if you see here the data
type that is it currently is in is back
at okay they have different sizes oh but
email address beat email address or
contact number or name or ID all are
back to type so I'm gonna just say the
input also to be as bad care right so
it's all bad care - everything is
technically work attitudes it's picking
up the same data type by default all
right so let's define the length over
here - let's say the customer ID is
going to be 5 characters in length I'm
going to say the lens for the name is
going to be around 30 phone number to be
around 20 or technically it's 10 so
let's do a buffer of another 10 and say
20 email address is going to be another
20 characters okay the customer ID let
me just increase the length through 10
so these these are the lengths of the
fields which are going to be stored okay
so I'm going to set the length over here
and I'm going to say ok now whatever do
is I need to set the default query okay
so I'm going to say select star from
customers select star from customers
okay because customers in the name of
the table in my Oracle database right so
I'm going to choose the table name here
I'm going to say the table name here
also okay there's something I forgot
earlier you got to mention the table
name that you want to import from and
you order specify the query you want to
run okay now let me run the same query
in my Oracle and let's see what details
I get so I'm going to feed the same
query here okay so it's going to be
select star from customers so when I say
this I have this table option here okay
now let me just run this query okay so
I've got the same radius in here also
right so my table name is customers so
let me put my talent and set that its
status customers already and this is the
quays in korea be running here buddy
hold all right I'm going to save this so
I have set my first data and write it so
I've gotten a cosmos data and here so
let me say another T Oracle input and
I'm going to configure another input for
my transactions table right so I have
another table for transactions so let me
set that also and as you can notice
every time you add a new input or
configure a new output then you'll have
to add these details right you have to
add the hosting and database name
username password on all these things so
instead of this you have a shortcut here
so you have a shortcut with respect to
mater it are some metadata something
that I explained earlier right so it
basically contains data about your data
so under metadata tab if you see you
have DB connections you have file all
these things right so so if you want to
create a standard input for data coming
in from a particular database then you
can just set it once over here okay so
onto your DB connections you can set one
connection and it can be using any
number of jobs in this particular
project so instead of four so the same
probably laughter enemies enter the
details of this particular table okay
but if I set the same thing through my
metadata here then I can use the same
metadata every time I want to import
data to my talent warehouse so what I'm
going to do is the same let me show you
how to do it through metadata
I'm going to say create connection once
the name of the connection is daily
input all right let's say database input
purpose to get data from Oracle to
Ireland let's have the description also
and say finish so k we go to the
database type over here okay now the
database type that I want to import is
that of Oracle right and I'm going to do
it with the help of Oracle with the
service name so when you choose that you
have your login you have your password
and all these details so in place of
your login give your username here so in
my case it's worse than okay password is
this one
the server is localhost and the port is
one five to one so is name is X II okay
now to verify if the connection is
correct you can now click on check over
here
so as you can see the DB input
connection successful messages come okay
this means that your tunnel be able to
successfully communicate with your
Oracle which is hosted on a port number
one five to one okay so now that I have
done this I can not straight away say
finish and add this metadata over here
okay
now I'm just going to click on the drag
and drop this DB input over here when I
do that I can choose this to be for
either input or output or anything here
because under Oracle you have all these
options right so I have chosen this
metadata for any of these options your
so I want to use as input I can do that
also if I want to use that output I can
do it even at that time so I'm going to
say to your our input and I'm going to
say okay now as you can see my DB input
here this is a meta data which has these
properties already input okay so in case
of this one I had to give it manually
but here in my metadata I specified it
once and it's already replicated so the
advantage here is that even if there are
ten different tables from which you want
to get data in then you don't need to
add a ten different database connections
in your row talent right when updating
your metadata if you create the database
connection once and then using that one
time you can establish ten different
connections you can now get it and from
ten different tables or replicate the
same thing again and again so that is
the advantage you're right so that's a
thing so next let's give the table name
here okay
so the table is the transactions table
right so that's what I'm going to enter
here and the query that we have to run
is select start from transactions
i ruinous transactions okay now let me
also verify if this query is running in
mind my sequel developer okay and let me
run this query and yes it able to fetch
shooter from my transactions table also
now going back to my talent now that
I've set this let me go and edit my
schema now okay so where do I have my
schema option okay it's right here so
I'm going to say edit schema I'm going
to consider all the different of columns
and fields over here because I'm not
wrong there are five different columns
your invoice number description quantity
customer ID and product right so I'm
going to rename everything here I'm
going to say invoice number
description
quantity
what else do we have we have customer ID
and Product ID right
all right so even the details here have
been set to work l okay now this
basically means that I'm getting the
data from a database and the reader type
of that is back here right so as you can
see from here mana click on this all my
data all the fields have that care to
wait attack so that's why I'm setting
them as like a 2 over here and I'm gonna
set the default length for everything to
be as well not for everything
so for invoice number let me give a
length of 10 for description and want to
give a length of hundred for quantity
let's say a 5 for customer ID it's going
to be 10 and product ID again let me
give a length of 10 so I want to say
okay so my schema is basically set for
both of these files now what I've got to
do is now I have the controller two
inputs now have to get these inputs into
my talent now to check if my data is
coming in from my data sources
appropriately let me just check the T
log row right so the component name is a
deal or oh but since I can't find it or
I can also search for it here so T log
row then I just put enter I have these
options right so in this captain Steele
oh go and drop it here now you can
create connections from here you can say
main and you can establish a connection
over here okay and similarly I can use
another T log row you're okay drag it I
can paste it here and check actually no
I won't do that
check of my data coming to my tea log
row from here right so my component is
added over here so let's say so let's
just check the schema once so as you can
see these are the details that are
entered in my source and it's already
been mapped since I gave a connection
between to a pretty mighty log row and
my input one these fields have been
mapped here also so I'll be getting my
customer ID customer name phone and my
email details you're okay now let me
just stop you conocchia go down and here
the field separator would be this
pipeline I'm going to say print header
print content with log4j all right so
now let me just stop save this and let
me run this now you can see the part
near right
when I say run it would build my job
basically and should be able to import
my data from there as you can see all my
data is being imported to this let me
just minimize my screen so as you can
see all my materials are here right so
customer ID customer name customer phone
and customer emails where the four
different fields that I'd configured to
enter into my t logo from my input and
they have come there D headers of these
and the radius R so for customer ID its
thousand and the customer name is this
one here and then his phone number is
right here right so this is his name
here this entire row and things like
that so each and every feature is
separated by a pipeline so that's
because I had in the component editor
over here because in the component
editor where your ad set we feel
separator to be pipeline okay so that is
the pen so since my component editor has
the pipeline's for every field in my
data that is coming through my Teague
log row it has been separated by a field
separator that is pipeline now if I just
go back here and you can see by just
clicking on run over here or over here
you can get your output okay
this I've just done this to show you how
trade up comes in okay so now that our
data is coming in successfully I'm just
going to delete the steel over okay
because we don't really need it for our
demonstration so you can just click on
this clear here to clear your
lock screen so now that we've
established our connection what we got
to do is we've got to merge these two
tables right so we've got to create a
lookup field and I've got to make sure
that my tables are joined so for that we
have another component you are called
tea tea join and when you hit Enter you
have this right
so under processing you have this option
of tea join so you can just drag and
drop here and what this would do is it
basically join these two different
inputs so we have the source input of
this one and this one right so it would
basically merge the two of them so let's
first create one link over here to my
tea Jane and similarly let me create one
over here from my input to 290 low now
if you can see here instance this was
the first connection that was
established this took up the name of
main okay and my second connection took
up the name of lookup now that's because
this table here this will look up to the
customer ID field in this table and
match the subsequent rows or entities
with this particular columns right so
what this lookup would do is it would
use the customer ID field in my in this
table and it would do a lookup to this
particular table and match the remaining
rows and columns right so let's
configure the schema for that first of
all since we are joining these two we
are using this tea joiner
okay so tea join let's go to the
component and edit all the other details
here so we have to check this include
lookup columns and output this means
that at the output that comes out of
this joint we want to also include the
fields which are present in my lookup
fries right so that's why I have a check
this car so besides that here it says
column mapping right so we have to
always map these two different tables
during one lookup field right so it's
either one lookup fluid or the primary
key foreign key relationship so both are
the same so that's what we were to
define you gotta define which is the
parameter which is the foreign key or
which is a lookup or failure okay so
first of all let's go - let's go edit
the schema here all right so we have the
two different fields here we have the
input field one and the input
stuff we do over here so let's add all
of these I'm gonna say control a and I'm
going to move it here all right so I'm
going to join all these things and from
the second table I'm going to move my
invoice number my description well I
don't want to move description so I'm
going to move my quantity customer ID is
already there so I would then want to
move my product ID okay now the reason
I'm not going descriptions because I
don't need description as for my problem
statement they don't need for our
description okay similarly even product
ID is not really needed for me so I can
actually remove this also right so I
have these so these will basically be my
output fields my customer ID customer
name customer phone customer email
address invoice number and quantity
right so this will be my output fields
and another upset my schema even the
event has been auto picked right so this
is the nice thing about talent things
are pretty simple and it's all
straightforward so in this click on okay
so guys another will set a schema here
let's add the columns that we want in
our output from our lookup table okay so
this is a lookup table and from here
what all columns will be what we want in
our output so that we've got to include
over here right so let me add the
different entries so I really want my
customer ID to be there so I'm going to
say a row to got customer ID row to a
row basically means this table right so
and then I want my quantity to come and
that I'm going to set as a row to what
quantity I'm going to add another entry
here and that's going to be for invoice
number okay so I'm going to say this is
row 2 dot invoice number all right so
now that we've done our column mapping
here this is pretty good enough now
let's go down and set our key definition
so here we set our primary and secondary
key a foreign key definition okay so let
me add an entry here so the primary key
is going to be customer ID and the rock
table is going to be row 2 dot customer
ID okay so with the help of these two
fields we're going to find our we're
going to make our way over toward lookup
and another advantage here is that I can
also go back to schema and edit the data
of my quantity okay since I'll be using
quantity as my differentiator for my
problem statement I can set the data
type to be something else I can set it
to be integer okay so I can do this and
set the length to be either 5 or 10
right I can give okay so now this
basically means that or even though all
these are in string format my quantity
can be an integer and the best part
about talent is I don't need to change
anything over here okay
so I can get the data and from any data
type the data that comes in can be of
any data type okay but the data that I
store all the other I finally export
that I can change the data type of that
particular data so that's the advantage
so quantity comes in the form of vodka
to data type and I'm converting it to
into integer from inside talent right so
that's the thing about advantage with
talent so I'm just going to say okay now
all right so now that I've done this I
think I'm done everything with respect
to T join okay so now let's go back to
my problem statement for a minute now
what they say is they wish to find out
only those customers who have a low
number of purchases okay so it is
quantity which defines how many
purchases that they have right so I'm
going to go back to my talent here
another of added might be log in over
here I will be getting all my details
and all my data into this component
right so my input one would be giving me
those rows from customers and this would
be giving me those rows and fields and
records from my transactions table so I
will be getting approximately 50,000
rows from here and 10,000 rows from here
now that I have all these rows over here
what have to do is have to filter them
based on the quantity and our problem
statement here says that we have to find
out those customers who have a low
number of purchases and if you remember
we define that when if you want to find
row number of purchases it's not exactly
defined so let's say we want to find
those people who have less than 10
transactions or whose quantity is less
than 10 right who put is less than 10
items so for that we can just go back to
our data warehouse and create another
filter okay
which would filter out those people who
have less than who opposites less than
ten items per transaction right so for
that let's again go back to my palette
here and search for this component
filter
so as you can see there is pee filter
row and tea filter columns okay but I
want to filter rows Swami is going to
drag this one drop it here so T your
filter okay and I want to connect these
two right so now I'm going to give a
connection here and what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to define the the
filter criteria okay so I'm going to add
an entry here but before that let me go
to my or schema and as you can see I
have all these entries here and same
fields are here also right and even the
data type has been picked up by default
that's the talents functionality so this
will be the input that will come to my
filter and this will be the output that
will go right so let's just click on OK
and now coming to my criteria for
filtering I want to filter my quantity
right so the input column that I want to
check is that of quantity okay on the
function that I would want to do is
empty now for now let let's just leave
it empty and the operator is if it's
lower than or equal to right so if it's
lower than or equal to 10 that is the
value that is present in this column if
it's less than or equal to 10 then I
want to filter only those rows and I
want to send only them okay so basically
my command is also set over here all
right so in my schema and my function is
set over here and now what have to do is
have to set the output for my data
warehouse okay now where do I want to
extract these results and store these
this data warehouse all right so let's
say I want to store it in an Excel then
I have to just go back to files over
here that means it's typed file and hit
enter and I have these options read out
50 file input XLV file output X L so I
am going to choose the file output Excel
and drop it here this would essentially
mean that the result that are filtered
over here in this component this would
come and get stored in this excel file
which I am going to create now okay so
let me connect these two all so I'm
going to say filter and put it here and
supposing if I want to also get a list
of all this
who have more than 10 transactions then
I can do that also by using this option
of rejecting so whichever rows get
rejected right which will get rejected
from moving to this particular file
those can go to another file right so we
have that functionality also that as
I'll show you even that but before that
so let me just show you how this looks
like so I've set a row filter t file
output Excel and let me edit the
component over here and let's say the
file name is this one d wh
VI
demo all right I'm going to say include
the head also head up basically is the
part which would say customer ID phone
number and all those things from one say
include head up alright and I'm going to
say define all columns to auto size
that's just to auto size those columns
right so it's all fine now everything
set and my file would be saved in this
particular path okay and this would be
the name of my file which will be stored
when I run this so I've copied this path
now what I've gotta do is I just save
this job and execute this
okay when I executed that it's showing
me an adult over here
okay so the error it shows us that the
error and the complex properties type
mismatch cannot convert from string to
integer okay not a big deal I can fix
this error
okay we can fix that by first of all
checking our schema right over here if
you see the schema here it says quantity
is type integer right but over here
quantity is still type spring so that is
what we need to change we got to change
the type over here to integer so I am
going to say number and I'm going to
click on okay fine
okay so now let's go back to this file
right and let me edit the schema and set
the properties correctly okay so it's
not able to convert this right so the
type of string and the DB type is number
so this is the problem so so I can treat
this also two integer right so it goes
right here so I'm gonna choose this as
the integer database type I'm going to
click on OK and now let me go back to
the T log join and check the schema over
here okay so this is my table and
quantitate this is integer this also
integer is coming here and now it'll get
converted over here into this so now it
would lightly throw me in here now let
me just save this and run this job ok
building job ok it's showing an error
again cannot convert integer to string
okay so let's see what the error is now
okay so we have a problem here invoice
number right so this is the problem so
invoice number it should be Row 2 dot
invoice number so this was the type
mismatch error that we were getting
right so no problem
okay so again it's changing right so
right I'm going to save this now and we
won't have the type mismatch era now
okay great so it says connected and
disconnected as you can see the output
over here we have got around these many
rows from this table and about 50,000
rows from the table job and we've got it
here and then we would have probably
join these two with the help of the
customer ID field and then to my T log
row it would have filtered all the
fields so we've got the input has
basically been eight three four two
number of rows eight thousand three
hundred forty two rows out of which 841
rows got filtered and stored in this
excel file awesome right so let's just
go to this path and check if on field
content are correct so this is the path
where the file store right so I'm going
to copy this path I'm going to go back
here and paste this path so this was the
file that we created right and yes as
you can see we have got customer ID
customer name customer phone the email
address invoice number and the quantity
okay and the best part is the quantity
here is the sorted and it's only that
which is less than ten right so that was
the criteria that we attack we had
filtered for those fields to be only
less than ten and to show you further
proof what I can do is I can now do this
a lot of filter okay
and if you can see here the only options
you are 110 okay that means nobody whose
quantity was 90 or 100 plus has been
added over here
right so so this is how simple our
talent is and this is what data
warehousing is in basics right so this
is a very simple example that I've
showed you where you can get data in to
your data warehouse by filtering some
data from the database and probably you
can use this data to make your analysis
or visualization on a tableau or
click-through or any other data
visualization tool okay but there was
another thing that I promised you right
I told you that you will have a filtered
row and you will have another rejected
row so if this was the filtered column
then I can probably have another excel
here I can say T file output Excel so
okay so T file output Excel I'm going to
paste it here
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start one when I say reject and here so
the rejected the fields or rows and
columns are going to go into this
particular fields okay so I'm gonna name
this also as rejected data right so this
also won't be present in the same path
and let me edit the gonna say define
Auto columns sighs I'm gonna say include
header and yeah I'm gonna save this and
run it again not again I have the same
list of fields over here right another
same rows over here right so as you can
see the same 8:41 rules have been added
to this file okay the filtered results
are here and the remaining ones which
were rejected
they have gone to my new file and this
file is called the rejected one so if I
go back to that same path this was the
original one and reject data is your so
when I open here you can see that the
only options here are those of above n
okay so if I just show you with a filter
column right so you can see that there
is nothing less than ten so that's the
thing so that's how you filter data
that's how you get data in and all these
things so that's how we work with talent
guys
so you get a run so the same thing here
you can also store it to some database
right so instead of having a file to
excel for this I can just delete this
and I can just delete this and let me go
to databases first of all
all right so here when I say Oracle and
T or a clout put okay I'm going to paste
it here and now if I am going to say
reject
or yeah project right so all these
rejected entries would go into this
particular file of mine so let me add
the components and edit the component or
the hose reels here it's localhost
okay port is one five to one database is
X E right yes it is XE and my username
is important my password is a de Rekha
all right so and then you have the
action on table right so the action is
going to be create table okay so when we
say create table they've got to give me
your table name also and the table name
let's say rejected output okay when I'm
getting there is nothing by that name
yep there is nothing here by your that
name so we have customers final table
and transactions right so we will have a
new table that will be formed over there
so which the action is going to be
interesting you want to insert or update
an existing file then you can choose the
various options but in our case it would
be create a new table and the action
would be inserted okay so let me just
save this okay and run this now
so seems like my new table has been not
created here let me just go back my
sequence here or a clue table and we
need to refresh this yes so as you can
see there's a new table has been created
and when you see here these are the
different fields error message was
another field that gets auto-generated
and if you look at the contents of the
field you have all these right so guys
that's how you get your data back into
your database right so earlier I showed
you how to do it and sort on an excel
file now I've showed you how to create a
new table and how to get your data
warehouse data back into your database
so that's the end of my demonstration
all my queries have been passed
successfully now let me just quickly go
back to my slides for a minute and oh
yeah
this hands-on is what I completed it
showed you how to get our data and your
data warehouse so yeah so the I think
that brings us to the end of the session
and let me just summarize whatever I did
in a minute right so first of all I
spoke about the need for business
intelligence and then I told you what is
business intelligence why you need it
for your business and what is the role
of data warehouse and then I spoke about
data warehousing right I give we went
into the depth of data warehousing and
spoke about the key terminologies and
data warehouse we have the EDL we have
data Mart's we have the metadata and all
these things and then finally we spoke
about the architecture of the data
warehouse and we finish off the session
with the hands-on demonstration of how
to populate your data warehouse using
talent so let's that's it and thank you
for being in the session so that brings
us to the end of the session trip
probably will have another session on
new data warehousing and I'll talk about
more advanced concepts like Chema's
right I spoke about there are three
different types of schemas right like
star schema snowflake schema galaxy
schema all these things so I will talk
about all these things in my next
session and probably also I will talk
about dimensions and fact tables and all
these things right so it doesn't seem
like you guys have any doubts so if you
do have any doubts please put that in
the chat box right okay
so thank you guys thank you for being in
the session probably I'll see you on
until next time okay
