and welcome to today's session on
Springwood tutorial so thank you all the
leds for joining in today's session
before we start all of it just give me a
quick confirmation on the chat window
whether I'm audible or not
okay I've got ideas from Abhinav Mona
Karthik alekhya and I've got a few more
uses too so that's great so now let's
get started first let's look into all
the topics that we're gonna cover in
today's session we will start by
understanding what spring boot is and
then understand the need of spring boot
after that we will get into the
differences between spring and spring
wood and lastly learn how the spring
would work so guys I hope that you clear
with today's agenda okay I've got many
S's so now let's get started
so what is the springboard well
springboard is a spring framework it
makes it easy to create spring-powered
production-grade
applications it not only creates a
nominated view of the spring platform
but is also used to create standalone
java applications now before deep diving
into how the spring would work let me
tell you what spring boot is not well
spring boot is not an app on a web
server it does not implement any
specific framework and it also does not
generate any code so now that I've
clarified the confusion between what
spring boot is and what spring wood it's
not it's good time I should tell you the
need of spring boot well it provides
faster and widely accessible getting
started experience for all the spring
development it finds quick ways to tie
words from the defaults so basically it
is opinionated to be out of the box but
it gets out of the way quickly as
requirement start to diverge it provides
a range of non-functional features that
are common to large classes of projects
such as empted server security metrics
health checks etc and the best part of
what springboard is that it does not
generate any code so by now you've got a
basic understanding of what springboard
is so now let me clarify the confusion
between spring and spring boot well
spring is a dependency injection
framework and springboard is a suit of
pre-configured set of frameworks or
technologies so basically consider
yourself as if you're baking a cake
spring is like the ingredients that are
required to make the cake and
springboard is the complete cake in your
hand coming to the second point spring
manages the lifecycle of java classes
and the spring boot you need not worry
about configuring a data source finally
if you have to run a spring application
spring takes a lot of time to have an
application up and running and
springboard is the shortest way to run a
spring application so guys I hope that
you're clear of what springboard is
now let's get into how the spring would
work with a simple demo well in this
demo we will be using a simple spring
wood project to develop spring waste
applications so I feel it's really
important that all of you understand how
does it work in the background before
getting into spring boot I'm assuming
that all of you have good knowledge of
Java as that would be of great help okay
I've got many yeses so that's great so
now let's continue just in case if you
do not have Java installed on your
system we'll learn how to download and
install java 8 that is the Java
development kit and not GRE and also
know how to setup Eclipse IDE that is
what we got to use in this demo you can
check out my previous video on
installing spring boot setups as I
mentioned before in this video I will be
using Java 8 and it is recommended that
you at least have a maven version of 3.0
so now what are we going to learn with
this demo we will start by understanding
how to set up a launch swing word
applications with maven an eclipse then
we will create a simple less controller
and understand more about swing would
start a web ad spring would start a
parent so it is clear guys
okay that's great so now let's get
started with the hands-on so now the
larger Eclipse application you have to
go to the directory of your Eclipse
folder so let's go to start this PC go
to C go to eclipse and launch the
application so when you launch your
Eclipse application you see that Eclipse
asks for the directory of your workspace
so what is this workspace
well workspace is basically a folder
where in all the files belonging to your
projects are stored so let me show you
with an example so let me just go to
this directory
so you can see that their various
projects that I've already created on my
Eclipse IDE so now let me just open this
hello world example you can see that it
has all the files and folders regarding
this projects just main dot Java class
form file etc so guys is it clear what
workspaces okay so let's continue now
once you choose the directory for your
workspace click on launch button so this
launches your Eclipse application while
it's launching let me tell you that you
have to make sure that you have
downloaded Java EE Eclipse ID so once
you launch your Eclipse application a
window like this opens up so the setup
maven project with Eclipse you have to
go to file you have to go to new and
choose maven project in the window that
opens up you have to choose to create a
simple project as we want to create a
very simple project to get the
understanding of Springwood also you can
choose the default location for your
workspace to store all the files after
that click Next
in the next window that opens up you
have to choose the group ID artifact ID
description for your project so over
here let me just tell you that the group
ID plus the artifact ID is equal to your
project name so any maven artifact that
you create needs to have a group ID and
an artifact ID it's basically similar
how would you give a package name and a
class name to every class you create
isn't it so let's just say I put the
group IDs comm dot ed u-- rayker dot
example and the artifact ID as spring
boot demo let the version be zero point
zero point one snapshot and a packaging
BGR in the description I can put as demo
and then click on finish so basically
this would create your first maven
project that you can see in your project
Explorer so now let me take you to the
project structure of this project so
when you open this project you can see
the folders such as source main Java
source main resources etc well all the
folders are empty for now let me just
show you
at the bottom you can see a Palm D'Or
XML file this file is basically the
configuration for your maven project
housing all the dependencies required
for your project so now coming to the
folders let me brief you a little bit
about every folder coming to the source
main Java folder does folder concerts of
the source code of your project the
source this Java folder consists of the
unit test or the integration test now if
you open the palm dot XML file let me
just open this for you
you would see that it has to group ID
artifact ID version and the description
that we just entered okay so a pelham
has a question here on why do we exactly
need maven well I've enough let me tell
you that the java web applications use
jar files that are the dependencies for
example let me just say that we are
trying to create a spring project we
need a spring jar
so before maven came into picture we had
to download this jar manually and then
put it in our project workspace but
after maven came over it benefited us by
introducing the dependency management so
let me just show you how that happens so
suppose I want to include a spring cold
jar for this project what I have to do
is I have to find out the required
dependency for sprinkle
so in the Google you have to type maven
dependency Spring Framework open the
first link with say Spring Corps after
the link opens up you have to choose the
release version let's say I choose to
release version 4.3 point 1 4 so I'll
click on that so once it opens I just
have to copy the dependency section and
include this in the form file of the
project but before you include the
dependencies you have to create the
dependency section and then include this
dependencies so let me just go to the
form file create the dependency section
and then includes dependencies so well I
haven't saved this file at present you
can observe that there is no folder as
maven dependencies but as I save this
files we just save this you can see a
folder named maven dependencies showing
spring code and logging files
so as these dependencies the spring code
and the logging dependencies which is to
transitive dependency for spring code
are needed to create a spring project we
need maewyn in our projects so up enough
i hope that i've cleared your doubt okay
so now coming back to the session to
create a springboard application and
launching it with embedded tomcat the
launch to Springwood application we have
five steps let me just show you well we
have to first add the spring would start
a parent and then we will add the spring
would start a web and then configure the
java version 8 after this is done we
will add the Springwood plugin and
finally create a Springwood application
launcher so well these are the 5 steps
to launch a springboard application well
we will start by adding a spring would
start a parent as it manages the
dependency versions for everything so
once we include the spring would start a
parent we need not specify any version
now after that we will include the
spring would start a web but why do we
need this well one of the main reasons
is that if you have to develop a web
application then there are a lot of char
files that would be needed so suppose if
you use spring MVC instead of spring
boot then you have to include all the
dependencies manually and this is really
tiresome so that's the reason we will
include spring would start a web after
that we will configure Java version 8
and add a spring would start a plugin to
launch the spring put application
finally after all the steps are done we
will create a Java file which is called
the application launcher so are the
steps clear to everybody okay that's
great so now let's get started by
configuring spring boots start a parent
so to configure spring boots start a
parent you have to type spring boot
start the parent
so you have to click on the first link
that opens up and then choose the
release version again so let's just say
I choose the release version 2.0 point 0
so I'll click on it so once I choose the
release version as two point zero point
zero to include the group ID artifact ID
and the version of spring would start a
parent you have to first create the
parent section in the pom file of your
project so for that let me just go back
to the pom file and let's first delete
this dependency section as that is not
needed at present and then create the
parent section and over here let's just
go back copy the group ID artifact ID
and the version and paste it here once
it is done just save the file and thus
your spring would start a parent is
added
ok so Mona has a question for us on what
does exactly spring boot parent provide
well Mona let me just tell you that it
provides default plugins it provides
various versions of releases and so on
so once you include the spring boot
parent you need not include the version
number again and again for every plug-in
that you include for your project so
Mona I hope that I've clarified the
question for you
okay so coming back just right-click on
this project go to maven and choose
update project and in the window that
opens up you can choose all the projects
that you want to update the maven so at
present we are working on one project so
I'll just go for that and click on OK
okay so that's how you can include your
spring would start a parrot so now let's
go to the second step that is by
updating the screen would start a web
let me first tell you about what spring
boots starter web is well spring would
start a web is like a parent for
developing any java applications it
kinds of links in the core stuff logging
stuff finding stuff and other things
that you need to develop a typical web
application with Java so similarly to
configure the spring would start a web
you have to type on google spring boot
start a web and then choose the first
link that opens up over here you have to
choose the release version I'm going for
two point zero point zero as I've chosen
the same version for the parent
so over here you just have to include
the group ID artifact ID in the poem
file of your project so let's just copy
that and open the poem file of the
project so before you include the group
ID and the artefact ID for Springwood
start a web you have to create a
dependency section so for that let me
just create the dependency section
under which let me again create an
individual dependency section
and then paste a group ID and artifact
ID okay so now let's just save this file
once you save this file you can see and
the Maven folder that all the jars are
downloaded by itself so is it that
simple rather than downloading jar file
manually for each dependency needed now
a question may come onto your mind on
why we haven't included the version for
starter web well the answer to this
question is that the spring would start
a parent provides the version we want to
use so for this project all the
Springwood starter would use a version
of two point zero point zero so what's
exactly happening here basically what's
happening it is tag once we configure
the spring would start a parent and
configure the dependencies for the
parent all the spring boot dependencies
use the same version as the parent so
when you look into the maven
dependencies folder you can see stuff
like logging empty Tomcat or the
configured jar etc now coming to the
third step where we have to configure
Java version eight you just have to add
the properties section and include Java
version of 1.8 so let me just do that
let's create a properties section and
then include Java version
1.8 once this is done save the file
so what have we done till now we have
configured spring will start apparent we
have configured spring would start a web
we have also configured Java version 8
now to choose the plug-in to run the
application that we are creating you
have to build the plug-in so on your
browser type spring boot maven plugin
open the first link that comes up
and then copy the bill section so now
you have to include this in the poem
fill of your project so let's just
include this pill section and then
remove the version execution and the
goal section as these are not required
at present so just save this file so now
your pom file is ready now coming to the
last step to build an application to
build an application what do you have to
do is you have to go to the source pin
Java folder right-click on this folder
go to new and choose class in the window
that opens up you have to choose the
name of your class let's say application
and then let's just say we want to
include the method stubs as public
static void main and then click on
finish
once this is done you can see a class
named application created before moving
forward into building an application let
me just show you a short way of creating
a springboard project so for that we're
going to use a simple spring would start
a plugin that is the spring tool suit so
you have to install the spring start a
plugin from the eclipse marketplace so
for that go to help go to eclipse
marketplace
type here spring tool suit and then
search for it well this is already
installed on my system else you have to
click on this install radio button to
create a simple project you have to go
to file go to new and choose spring
start a project in the window that opens
up you have to similarly choose the
group ID add a fact ID the name for your
project and the description as we did
before and then click on finish so let's
just say I put the name as demo project
and then I choose the falling for the
group ID artifact ID and then click on
next once I click on next you can see
that the version number is two point
zero point one and you can choose the
dependencies you want to include for
your project so let's just say if I want
to include web so I just have to type
web and then I can choose it and if I
have to include Dave tools I just have
to click on it and then choose finish
once you click on finish this will
create your new projects let me just
show that and you can see on the left
side and your project Explorer that your
project has been created so well that's
how you can create a simple project
using your spring would start a plugin
coming back to the application that we
were building on let's continue to build
this application so you can see in the
class named application you have to
import some annotations to make it a
springboard application so for that you
have to type at the rate spring boot
application so to resolve this error
just click on it and you just have to
import this annotation so click on it
and this import your annotation once
this is done you want to create a simple
application so to create an application
what you have to do is you have to type
application context space CT X is equal
to CT X is basically an in variable name
that you can take and then type spring
application dot run and in the brackets
include the class name so here it's
applications so type application dot
class comma arguments and at the end put
a semicolon so now you can see an error
at application context that's because we
haven't imported the required file so
for that just import this just click on
this and import
so when that results in rather so now
just save this file so basically all
this class does is that it just launches
your spring application what we have
here is a simple Java class with a main
method now observe this annotation
spring boot application what does it do
well this launches the spring boot
application so it launches up the
application context we pass in the name
of the class to the spring application
dot run is it clear ok so if you have to
run this file you have to right-click on
this project go to run as and choose
java application choose application
spring boot demo that is the main class
and then click on ok
once you launch up this java application
you can see in the console the spring
banner and at the end of the console you
can see that the application has started
on port number eight zero eight zero so
guys that's how you can run your spring
applications so now if you have observed
in this project we have not created any
controller here so basically we have a
server running but there's nothing
running on it so let me just show you
let me just open this browser and type
localhost colon 8080 zero well you can
see that there's nothing running on this
port so to avoid this error we need to
create a controller so now let me teach
you how to add a rest controller so for
that let me just go back to the project
right click on this package go to new
and choose a class over here let me name
the classes welcome controller and then
click on finish so basically what I'm
trying to do is that when I type on
localhost a specific port number let's
say 8080 I want a message return let's
say welcome to this session right now if
I use this URL you can see the error
that I just showed you to remove this
error I will create a controller class
which would handle this slash welcome
URL so to create a controller you need
to use the annotation address controller
and then we will create a method inside
it so let me just stop this running
application I'll present let's clear the
console
so we are let me just import this
annotation adder addressed controller
and you can see another so for that you
have to just go to this and then import
this require annotation so we are let's
just create a simple method let's say
public strength welcome
in this matter let's return a message
let's say welcome to this session
now how do we map the slash welcome URL
to this method so for that you have to
use this annotation address request
mapping
so let me just import this annotation at
the rate request
mapping and in brackets let's include
what we want to pass as request let's
say I just want to pass the request as
slash welcome so well you can see an
error so to resolve this error you have
to again import the require annotation
so now let's just relaunch this
application by right-clicking on this
file and then go to run and choose java
application
on the console you can see that the
slash welcome URL is mapped to the
application an application has started
on port number 80 80 so let's go to the
port number 80 80 again and pass the
request as slash welcome
well this returns a message saying
welcome to this session indicating that
your controller file is working now just
in case if you want this welcome message
to come from a welcome service you have
to create the Welcome service class
which will be responsible for getting
the Welcome method so let's go back to
the project create the class welcome
service inside which let me just create
a method so let me just type public
strength
welcome retrieve let me just say and
let's just say I want to return a
message hey everyone
once this is done you just have to save
this file now if you have to include
this welcome service you have to type
private welcome service service is equal
to new welcome service also you have to
change the return to service dot welcome
retrieve
once this is done just save this file
now have you understood what's happening
here let me just explain it to you guys
well this particular service has been
called and the message in that would be
returned so to check that let's
right-click on this project go to run
and choose java application and then run
this project again
okay so at the end of the console the
application has started so let's go to
the browser let's refresh this you can
see that the message has been returned
from the service so basically welcome
controller depends on the Welcome
service to return the message this
welcome controller right now is creating
a dependency so basically it is handling
everything by itself now that it's
handling everything by itself it will
create a tough problem to replace it
with anything else so that's where the
frameworks like spring coming with
spring what you can do is that spring
can manage to specific beam and create
an instance by itself
so once the Welcome service is created
we would just want to inject it then we
can create multiple implementations on
welcome service based on whatever
implementation welcome controller would
work with over here a question may come
to all your minds on how do we tell
spring that it is the component which it
has to manage by itself so to help
spring to identify which components it
has to manage for itself you have to use
the added component annotation so with
the added component annotation spring
knows how to manage to beam so whenever
you start this application spring will
automatically create an instance of this
beam and be renovated so let me just
include that in the project
so suppose we want to help spraying to
identify the welcome service as a
component that it has to manage by
itself you can add the added component
annotation here
and let's just say we update this return
message so that we know the change and
let's just say good morning guys now to
resolve this error just click on this
and import the annotation required once
this is done just save this file now how
do we tell the Welcome controller to use
this instance created well this can be
done by something known as auto wiring
so Auto ything is the process where
spring creates the beans and injects
them wherever they are needed to perform
this process or the wiring you have to
use the annotation at the rate order
wired so let me just add this annotation
added Auto wired
and then over here changes to private
welcome service service Nandan save this
file so now Springwood take care of
creating this welcome service and auto
wire it to the Welcome service here so
now let's just free start this
application
and now let's just go to the browser and
refresh this so well you can see a
message saying good morning guys that
means a component has been identified a
question may come to your mind what of
spring does not find the component it's
looking for so let me just close this
before I move forward and let's just say
I remove this annotation add red
component and now let me just restart
this application
well you can see that the application is
failed to start and you can also see
that the Welcome controller file is not
able to find the required beam so guys
that's how spring raises an error when
it does not find the component it's
looking for so now let me just close
this console and let me just add back
this component annotation here and then
just save this file and then run again
so at the end of the console you can see
that the application has started so
let's go back to the browser and let's
just refresh this and well it shows the
message good morning guys that means our
application is running fine so guys
that's how you can create and launch
your first springboard project now
coming to the other spring would start a
project let me just tell you that spring
would start our web services are used to
develop web services and web
applications you can use web services to
build web applications using soap coming
to spring would start to test you will
be able to write unit tests and things
like j-unit using spring would start at
JDBC this would bring basic JDBC and
Springwood JDBC spring would start a
security would bring into spring
security and auto configuration spring
boots starter data JPA provides some
interface to query data from jba stuff
lastly spring would start the data rest
kinds of makes it very easy to expose
rest services so you just have to create
basic entity beans
so guys that's all for today's session
