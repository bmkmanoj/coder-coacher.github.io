Rica and welcome to the tableau
dashboard tutorial and like I always do
I want to confirm that you all can hear
me properly say if you can drop me a
confirmation on the chat window all
right so Julia and wish of and up high
they all can hear me properly okay I'm
getting confirmation from the others as
well so let's get started so this is
what we'll be learning today we'll start
with the basics of tableau and then
we'll learn table using a use case which
is the Indian Premier League popularly
known as IPL in India after that we'll
see the IPL flow diagram this will show
you the insights that we're going to
make using the IP and dataset with
tableau we'll also see how to manage
data sets how to integrate different
data sets together to make more fruitful
insights we'll understand this by a
practical demo I'll show you everything
starting from connecting to data
integrating data and making
visualizations and hence getting those
insights and in the end we'll take a
look at the tableau success story what
companies have been using tableau and
how they have benefited using tableau so
I hope that the agenda is clear to
everyone so shall I move forward all
right then let's get started with the
basics of tableau so the first thing
that you need to do in order to make a
visualization is connect to your data
set now a table can connect in numerous
kind of data sets you can connect to an
excel file you can connect to a text
file or JSON file a CSV file and many
more you can also connect to different
servers you can connect directly into a
tableau server a Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle server and also with Amazon
redshift so you don't have to worry
about the data set that you're going to
load into tableau because tableau is
compatible with any kind of data source
file if you're trying out tableau for
the first time and you don't have any
data
to experiment on I'll tell you that the
tableau has some sample data sets like
the example that you can seen first your
screen which is the superstore data sets
so when you load or connect to a data
set you can see a brief overview or a
preview of the data source that you have
loaded and the one which you're going to
use to make visualizations so you can
take a look at the fields that you're
beginning with so we have got the order
ID or the date ship date shipping mode
customer name segment and all the
different fields that is present in your
data set and you can also choose whether
you want to make a live connection with
the data set or extract some of the
fields or all of the fields and then
make changes onto the data set since
we're talking about data fields in a
data source we should know that what
kind of data type style do support so
you can see in front of your screen that
these are the data types which tableau
supports the first one is boolean and
you know these are simple true or false
values it's either true or false
then table supports date values and the
format could be like this like December
31 comma 2015 a false in that there are
also date and timestamp values which
contains the month the date the year and
also the time and it can be in this
format like you see over here
it will contain the hours minutes
seconds and AM or PM a tableau also
supports text or string text like
welcome to table this is an example then
it also supports numbers both a decimal
and whole numbers
now tableau has a very special kind of
data type which are the geographical
values and this field or this kind of
data type is automatically detected when
you have a field like city state or
anything that describes a geographical
location so whenever in science
geographical locations like New York
France India Beijing or any other place
named tableau will auto-detect it as a
geographical value now you can also find
out which data type is which with the
items over here every data type that W
support is mapped with an item so if
it's a text or a string value you can
see the item is ABC if its only date
values its represented with the calendar
and if it contains date and time values
we'll have a calendar with a little
clock on here when you talk about
numerical values both decimal and whole
number is represented by a green hash
tag the boolean values are of t pipeline
ups and geographical values are
represented with circle which looks like
a globe with latitude and longitude so
these are at the tablet data types that
you'll be dealing with now while using
tableau you don't have to worry about
what data type should you assign to each
of the field tableau will auto detect
everything and the data types will be
automatically assigned but if you want
to change the data type of the
particular field you can also explicitly
do that in table for example there might
be situations like if you are making
visualizations for a release history of
a particular application and you're
dealing with the year so maybe instead
of a number because you don't want to
make calculations on that particular
field you can treat it like a strip and
in that case you can explicitly change
the data type of that particular field
now moving on we'll see how the tablet
desktop UI looks like so when you open
your tablet desktop this is what you'll
see so you have your database you have
your two
bar you have your worksheet over here
and the marks card in the data pane you
can see all the different fields that
are separated according to dimensions
and measures welcome to what is
dimension and measures in a while and if
you see your closely it has already
categorized the data types together the
customer name if you see that I can over
here you remember that this I can
represent a straight similarly with
segments and if you see the order date
here you can see that a calendar icon is
present here it means that there is the
date the month and particular year the
order ID is also specified as a text and
the ship date is also a date and the
measures like discount profit and profit
ratio these are just numbers and you can
either divide it from the icon over here
now you can also define set which is
just a collection of items and you can
also define different parameters like
the profit bin size the top customers so
we'll be learning how to do that in the
coming demo part and this is the
workspace you can create different
worksheets you can incorporate those
worksheets by creating a dashboard and
many more cells are telling you all
about how to use all these different
options in the tableau desktop UI so
don't worry about that we'll get into
that in a while so now comes dimensions
and measures so these are the dimensions
and these are measures so dimension is
an independent variable it means that in
order to define this you don't need any
other variable whereas measures are
dependent because absence measures are
nothing but numbers and dimensions are
usually text or date values or
geographical values the dimensions are
used to add more details the measures
are just numbers it will just give you
the number the quantity of a particular
data field and only numbers do not make
sense for example if you consider let's
say sales if you just have the number of
sales so that might look like something
like 10,000 20,000 but when you say that
sales of a particular year or sales of a
particular region and years and region
these are dimensions so when you
visualize like that when you're in
corporate measures by defining them with
dimensions it adds more detail into your
data so these are dimensions and
measures so if you have any doubt you
can ask me but you'll be learning more
about how to use measures and dimensions
in the coming part so don't worry about
that
ok so I don't have any questions so I'll
just move ahead and this is the show-me
data pane so after you have analyzed
your data set it is time to produce the
visualization for your dataset
so the show-me data frame will give you
options of how you can represent your
data so you can represent it in
different forms in representative pie
charts and dual axis and circles and
concentric circles overlapping circles
and a bar diagram and many more
sometimes you'll see that not all
options are highlighted for your data
set it is because the fields in your
data set or the kind of data set there
using might not be compatible with these
kind of visualizations now if your data
set do not have any geographical value
you cannot represent your data on a
world map click and choose one from the
available options for your data set and
you can make the visualization so by now
I have given you a brief overview of
whatever options we'll be exploring in
tableau and we have covered mostly all
of the options now let us take a use
case of the Indian Premier League the
IPL in order to understand tableau and
depth so how many of you watch Indian
Premier League let me ask you that first
okay so Surya says that he is a big fan
yes okay bye
Akshay now for those of you who do not
know what Indian Premier League is well
it is a very popular t20 cricket match
and cricket stars from different
countries take part in the Indian
Premier League now there are different
teams that play in the Indian Premier
League so these are the teams there is
the Royal Challengers of Bangalore
Kolkata Knight Riders Gujarat Lions
Delhi Daredevils the higher bus
Sunrisers rising Pune supergiant's kings
xi punjab and mumbai indians and in
india this is the most awaited and the
most popular cricket tournament ever so
let me just ask you which are your
favorite teams can I know that
okay so the serious team is Raj
challengers of Bangalore resources owned
by Indians
okay so seeing that we have quite a lot
of
RCB fans here so we'll find out at the
end of this tutorial that whose team is
the best because we're going to make
analysis about the IPL teams only so
let's see whose team is the best
so let's understand the insights that
we're going to make using a flow diagram
now there is a huge amount of IPL data
now you know that every time a boulder
throws the ball and the batsman that's
it and scores a run everything is
recorded there is a record of each of
the bowl that was bowled each of the run
that was scored by a batsman so you can
imagine the huge amount of data that
we're dealing with and not just IPL you
must have noticed that whenever there is
a match telecasted on TV there is a
pre-show or a post show that is usually
held where the different expert sit
together and they make an analysis of
maybe who's going to win they try to
predict who's going to win or who's
going to lose and how much ones are they
going to score or what is going to be
the outcome of a particular match now
I'm not an expert in cricket but
definitely I can ask tap you to help me
to make all those analysis so we're
going to do the same thing and even if
you have ever watched those fourth
Empire shows you can also see that
sometimes they show different kind of
visualizations like the wagon wheel
which is very popular with shows
trajectory of every ball by a particular
batsman so they see those visualizations
and they make an analysis of it
so we're going to do the same thing with
tableau only we're not cricket experts
but we sure our tableau experts and we
can do the same thing with tableau so
we're going to feed that huge amount of
data into tableau and then we're going
to make different insights so the first
thing we'll do as we'll find the orange
cap and the purple cap holders
throughout all the seasons so you know
that orange cap holder is the one who
scores the maximum number of runs in a
particular season and a purple cap is
awarded to the person who gets most
number of wickets in that particular
season
the next insight we're going to make is
who was the man of the match for a
particular match and who was the man of
the series across all seasons
we're also going to find the overall top
five players who have performed the best
throughout all the seasons next we'll
find out the best teams across the
seasons we'll find out which was the
theme that has performed the best and
we'll be getting onto this insight by
creating visualizations for each of them
and then we'll publish this insights
onto the website
takis if this is what the official IPL
website looks like it has got the
batting leaders names and what is the
scorecard for each of the team now let's
have a look at the data set that will
deal with so the first data set that we
have is the team table so we have a team
ID and for every team IDs there is a
corresponding team name so the team ID
of Kolkata Knight Riders is one for
Royal Challengers Bangalore it's two and
so on and there is also a team shortcode
to identify each of the teams so for
Kolkata Knight Riders xkk are similarly
RCB Chennai Super Kings RC SK and the
opponent ID and the opponent name are
basically the same thing that we have
just gone through the team ID is the
same the opponent ID is the same thief
as team ID so it has got same team IDs
and the opponent ID has also got the
same numbers and similarly the opponent
name is similar to the field team name
and opponent shortcode is also similar
to the field which is team shortcode now
they're telling you why do we need the
data set to be like this next up we have
the player table this is just an example
now this is just a part of the data sets
and there are a lot of rows in our data
set so I cannot incorporate that and
then screen so I just mentioned 24 names
over here we've got the player ID
starting from 1 and we have got player
named corresponding to each of the
player ID we've got the date of birth
of the particular player if he's a
batsman which is his batting hand if is
a bowler which is his bowling arm and
the speed of the bowler also the country
where each of the players belong to and
if he was an umpire so if it's veer it
means that he's not next we have got the
match table now this contains all match
details so called a match ID
we've got matched date the date where
the particular match was held the team
ID and the opponent ID are the IDS of
the teams that have played on that match
the season ID is which season of IPL was
this match held on the venue the stadium
where it was held which was the team
that won the task and what they choose
after winning the toss then if there was
a super over if it's zero it means that
there were superly that means the match
resulted into a tie and to break - hi
they played some extra over so if it's
zero it means that though it wasn't a
tie there was no super over played at if
it's won it means there was and it's
result this field indicates that is at
the end of the game there was a
particular winner since it's one it
means that there was a winner and that
particular match if it's a Duckworth
Lewis this means that whether the match
was interrupted due to rain or something
so that they had to reduce a number of
overs and hence make a new target so if
it's zero it means that there wasn't a
condition like that and then there is
the winter weather they won't buy runs
or buy wickets and how many runs did
they win by or by how many wickets
didn't win by and this is the match
winner ID which team ID was the winner
and then the man of the match either
this is the ID of the particular player
which was chosen as the man of the match
this is the first Empire ID second
Empire the city where is played and the
host country and up next we have the
player match table now it contains
fields like match ID player ID team ID
is keeper and is captain
you can see that match IV is similar and
these are the players who have played on
this particular match three three five
nine eight seven and these are the
player IDs of the players who played
this match and there is the team ID
that's their number one belongs to team
number one play number two belongs of
team number one and hence ten belongs to
two and s keeper so this is for a
particular player pair one if he is a
wicket keeper it will be one and if it's
not it's going to be zero and this is
for s captain it is a boolean again it
shows that is a particular player with
the playwrighting one is a captain there
will be one and if is not it will be
view and now we have the season table so
now it contains the season IDs the
season year so the first season has the
season ID one and it was played at 2008
the orange tab ID was hundred it means
that the player with the player ID
hundred has been given the orange cap -
and similarly it's the same with
personal gap ID and the man of the
series IDs over here so this highlights
at the orange tab purple cap and the man
of the series for a particular season so
these are the data sets that will deal
with and I will get started with the
practical demo we'll perform all this
we'll use all this data sets and we'll
make the following insights that we
talked about
so here it is this is my tableau desktop
and this is where I'll be creating all
my workbooks and worksheets so the first
thing that you need to do is connect to
your data source so you have to click on
connect so the data source that I'm
going to use are all CSV files so I
don't see it here in the options so I'll
just click on more I'll browse on to the
folder where I have my data set so I
want this CSV file over here which is
steam so I'll just click on here click
on open and so there it is and these are
the fields that this particular file
contains you can see that there are
other data sources or there are
different files over here so this is
because these are the other files that
is contained on the same file location
so I need a lot of details right now so
the analysis that I'm going to make is
not sufficient with just three of these
fields if I need to incorporate more
data sources so in order to do that you
don't have to do much you just have to
drag and drop the other data sources
that you want to integrate this with so
the next data source that I want is the
mash dot CSV here so I'll just drag and
drop it over here now this will ask you
for what kind of joint that you want
whether you want an inner join that
means it will have all the common fields
from the Keene dot CSV and mashup CSV
whether you want to less join that we
have the common part of mash or CSV and
team dot CSV and the entire of team dot
CSV similarly the right joint is entire
off master CSV with the common part of
both of these and full other join means
it will contain all the spheres from
both this two data sets so now I have to
define a joint some little the inner
join you also have to define the mapping
it means which of the two fields that
you want to match with so a matching
team ID from team dot CSV and a mapping
into team name ID which is in match dot
seus so now there it is you can see how
the integrated data set looks like this
has got all these different fields over
here okay now I want some more
so I need the master CSV again because I
need to map some other two fields also
again I'm going to choose inner join and
Here I am giving pmid should be equal to
opponent ID
now I need one more data set which is
clear match CSV I have to define team ID
of team da CSV should be equal to t MIDI
from player matched or CSV okay so this
is done also now I'll be making an
analysis during the entire season so
I'll include this new season dot CSV and
defining our inner join I'm going to
match the season ID from match dot CSV
on to the season ID in season year and I
need to map season ID from season dot
CSV
so now I'll just drag and drop this
season dot CSV file
and I'll match the season IDs from match
dot CSV to CNN ieop season dot CSV so
again I need to integrate my other CSV
file which is the player dot CSV file
and here I want the player ID of match
dot CSV
here one the player ID from fear mash
dot CSV
should be equal to player ID and player
dot CSV which is this
and I'm done integrating my different
data sources together so now we'll go to
our worksheet and first let us make a
visualization of all the orange gap
holders and as we remember that an
orange cap holder is the person who
scores the maximum number of runs in the
entire season
so let us also rename the sheet as the
orange cap sheet
okay so now what we need to do is we
just need to drag and drop fields over
to rows and columns and the fields that
needs to be dragged and dropped all
depends on the kind of visualization
that you want now for orange cap holders
I need the names of all the orange cap
holders for all the seasons
I want to know who was the orange cap
holder at 2009 who was it ten eleven and
so on so what I want inner column
section is the season year now we'll
find the season year in the season dot
CSV so here it is so just drag and drop
the scenes over here and I'll drag and
drop the orange cap ID in the row
section
okay so here it is so now we have got
the orange cap ID and the season here
and the ID needs to also tell me the
name of the player so we'll create a
calculation field to find out the name
of the players who actually got the
orange cap so we got to create
calculated field let us name this
calculation as orange cap calculation
so it will be if orange cap ID would be
equal to cleared ID from player dot CSV
then I want the player name
and make sure you end it
and click on okay at the bottom you'll
always find your calculated fields that
you have created so what I'll do now
I'll just drag and drop this over to two
rows
so in order to remove the null values
over here I'll change the measure for
orange cap calculation and I'll change
it to attribute
yeah so the null values are removed now
let us make this look a little better
instead of vertical lines over LS but
some little cap since we're talking
about orange cap so you can just go how
you want to represent it go to shape
click on shape over here go to more
shapes go to the folder where you want
to choose your shapes from now remember
that the shape folder for tableau is in
your my document you'll have a my
tableau repository so you can go inside
that folder and find the folder where it
says shapes and there are these other
folders inside there so if you can copy
that picture which you want to use and
put it one of the folders over there so
I put it in kpi so here is my orange cap
I can choose this one click on OK and
now you can see there are little orange
gaps over here I'll go ahead and
increase the size a little bit because
they look like tiny dots yeah now they
look like gap so if you now over on each
of the gap you'll know that for 2008 the
orange cap ID of the player was 100 and
the orange cap holder was Shawn Marsh
similarly for 2009 it was Haydn in 2010
such aunt and uncle Chris gave Chris
Gayle again and then Michael Hussey then
it's robe in a top bar and Warner and
then Virata Cooley in 2016 so here is
your visualization for all the orange
cap holders throughout all the seasons
and similarly now we'll create our
protocol quarters
we'll rename the sheet and we'll name it
purple cap and we'll do the same thing
again wherever we have put orange now in
the same field we'll put the purple cap
so you remember the first thing we did
was season year and column and then in
rows you need the public app ID
like we made a calculated field for
orange cap will make a calculation for
the public gap also so we'll name it as
purple gap calculation
and the condition will also be similar
so instead of this orange cap idea we'll
use the purple cap ID if it's equal to a
player ID from player dot CSV
then we need to display the player name
click on okay
so here is your calculated scene so drag
and drop it to the Rose section
so again you remember that in order to
remove this null values we change the
measure we're going to do the same here
and again we'll do the same with the
shape so for shape I'll choose a purpose
cap
let me choose this one
okay so this is the increased size so
again if you're over on you can see that
for 2008 it was so has done vid and an
RP Singh and so on so now we'll go ahead
and we'll find out the man of the series
and the man of the match throughout all
the seasons so at first we find out the
amount of the series in each of the
seasons
let's rename the sheet as man of the
series
so now what we will do is we need to
find the man of the series so I'm going
to represent this visualization in a
geographical way that means I'm going to
choose the world map because every
season I feel is hosted at different
countries so why not use a word map
so now you have auto-generated a
latitude and longitude fields so I'll
just drag and drop this and draw
longitude on two columns and latitude on
two rows so there it is here is my world
map and I'm going to pin point out
different cities and different locations
where each of the matches or each of the
seasons were held
I put the man of the series on details
over here so that if when you hover
around different places you find who was
the matter of the series for a
particular year I'll also put filters so
that you can find out that who was the
man of series for a particular season so
now we also have to create a calculator
scene to find the man of the CDs because
we have the player ID but we don't have
their name yet and a particular dataset
so again we'll call it
not a pity calculation
similarly over here we'll say if
none of the CDs ID is equal to player ID
then display the name of the player
and then end
click on okay over here so in detail
I'll add the city name so find that and
match dot CSV so this is the city name
we put on detail
and let us put the host country yes
so these are the cities where the
matches were played so there were cities
in India in UAE and South Africa we know
the three countries that have hosted IPS
in 2008 2 2016 so let's not put colors
for that I'll take the mouth disease
calculation and drag and drop it to
colors
so let me also change the measure
so India's also die feels a lot of time
so insane cities there were mattress
laid over different seasons so we'll add
some filters so that we can visualize it
year after year since filters first let
me put them out of the series I D
sometimes when you can find different
views just use the search over here so I
want the amount of the Feeny's ID okay
so here it is I'll try to drop it to
filters
so select all of them
can't okay
I'll select this can I select all except
null because we don't want null values
and let us also put the season year as a
filter because we need to search who was
the man of the series for a pretty good
season so this is the season year and
let me drag a dropper to here
don't click on show filter so now you
can see that this is for a particular
year where if you just hover on the top
of a circle you can see that the amount
of the series was Watson so you just
have to drag the filters over here if
you want to see that's in 2009
so in 2009 it is Adam Gilchrist
similarly you can go on check for each
of the individual years let's check with
2010
so again for 2010 it is such an
Tendulkar as the amount of the series so
here you can just drag over the years to
see who where the amount of the mattress
you could also choose to represent it in
a more simpler way not in a world map if
you want to so format of the match let
me just show you a very simple
visualization because sometimes keeping
it simple is the best so we'll call it
man of the match
so here we'll do a very simple
visualization want to fuse columns so
we'll just use a rose over here so what
we need is we need the match ID
and then we want the man of the match
okay so let us also create a man of the
match calculated fiend because we have
to display the name of the player okay
so here I'm getting updates about the
IPL so it's a good thing that I am
making analysis of the IPL details from
2008 to 2015 at the time when there is
IP on going on in 2017 so if I could
have played it a few more days to get it
over I could have included this year too
so okay so let me just close this let's
get back to tableau
so we're supposed to call it man of the
match calc right
so against a similar thing so we'll say
that if
let's not search by this
the match ID
we'll be equal to the player ID then
display the player name just like how we
did it
so click on ok.now will drag and drop
this video
so let us open to 15a there it is
so in the text part and we include
something
let me include the wind type over here
so that this column would get filled up
okay so the team which was a winner they
won by runs or by wickets you can see it
displayed over here so let me remove the
null values
okay so we'll add some centers also over
here so
just drag and drop this one as filters
too so we'll remove the null values from
here you can okay so now find that
particular match ID who was the man of
the match where was it played and the
winning team did they win by wickets or
by rats so this is a very simple way to
represent your visualization yet it
gives you a lot of information as well
so you can add more filters here if you
want to but you can leave it like this
if you just want so this was the
workbook for the orange cap purple cap
man of the series the amount of the
match so now what we'll do is we want to
see the overall best team that has
performed the best entire all the
seasons so for that would create another
workbook because our datasource would be
a little different so let me just save
this one
so I'll just name it IPL w1 and now
we'll create a different workbook for
that file click on new
so here I need to connect to data first
so click on more I want in dot CSV again
so here it is Dean dot csz and I'll
integrate this with the mash dot CSV
I'll define an inner join where my team
ID will be equal to the opponent team ID
and then I need the team dog vs B again
drag and drop it
so I'll integrate this with the match
dot CSV so I need a my D
from mad csv get some research from
master CSV and I select the team from
Team CSV one okay that there is now
again I'll choose team dot CSV and drag
and drop it here or choose an inner join
I will again choose match dot CSV so I
need the match winner ID should be equal
to the team ID
here is my data source so we'll go to
the worksheet so we'll rename it as the
best team
so now what we'll do we'll just again
drag-and-drop some fields over here so
we need the match winner ID from Master
CSV
that's here we need the team name from
team CSV to
let's get the team ID from mash top CFC
there it is then we need the city name
and we need the opponent ID
search for the opponent team ID there it
is so I'll just drag and drop this over
here
colors let me put team name
from teen CSV - so over here in the
comment section first thing I'll do is
so in order to represent it in a better
way I'll secure and measures a
go to count distinct
a quick table calculation let's make it
running total
let us modify this more
so try to click this one and we'll use
specific dimensions
and restart every match when ID
I will close this and
let's make sure it fits the height
you
so after you select the fit height you
can see the performance of all the teams
together and you can see that Chennai
Super Kings has got the highest peak
over here
so the second might be the RCB the Royal
Challengers of Bangalore with 41 and the
score for CSKA is 44 and here's the
Rajasthan Royals with a score of 40 and
tOSU rather son royal is the Delhi
Daredevils at 39 so you can see all the
teams over your Gujarat lions rising
pune Sunrisers Hyderabad Kochi Tuskers
Pune Warriors you can see that the
highest peak is for Chennai Super Kings
so they have performed the best they
have won most matches throughout all the
seasons so this is how we have a
visualization of the best team
so now we'll go ahead and we'll find
best players throughout all seasons so
we'll do that in a different workbook as
well because the data force is again
going to be different so it will say
this one
so we'll call it and call it IPL w2
I'll go to file click on you
so this is my new workbook the first
thing I need to do connect to data go to
more now I have a dataset known as ball
by ball
so I select this data set over here
and I'll integrate more datasets with it
so the first one will be mash dot CSV
now here I'm matching match ID of ball
by ball to match ID of master CSV it's
fine
then I need clear dot CSV drag and drop
it I'll put the striker ID over here
I map it to the player ID
that stunt now I need the Pierre match
CSV
now I hear I want the match ID should be
equal to the melody in the pyramid store
CSV not automatically got mapped now
next I want teen dot CSV drag and drop
this and here what I need to do is I
need select a field from ball by ball
CSV and I'll take the team batting ID
and here I'll map it to team ID from
jindo coz
okay so here is my data source so we'll
go to our worksheet and we'll rename
this sheet and we'll say top layers
okay so again I'm going to go ahead and
drag and drop the different seals
so the first thing I need is the clear
name
so search clear name over here
here it is from Pluto CSB
so here is my clear name now I want the
striker ID
ball by ball CSV
I'll select the team ID
I need the team name
the season ID
and the March ID
okay so we'll add some more filters so
we'll drag and drop the player name over
here we'll select all and click on okay
we also put this in colors so now what
we'll do we'll select the batsman scored
into the column section
okay so we'll do our running total that
quick table calculations and running
total so now what we want is we want the
top batsman's the top five passes let's
say so we'll add a season filter to it
that for a particular season who wear
the top batsmen so so we'll create our
calculated field
so
let me call it
top five gag
and this is it let us first to season
eight that means last year let us to
season eight this is for 2015 season so
we'll click on ok over here let go there
right click we'll go to edit table
calculations
do the same thing over here
all right so we'll also add the season
ID filter over here so
try to find season ID
okay since we added the calculation for
the season 8 so we'll unselect
everything
and let me sort this one
so now we'll just lift up the top five
players so we'll go here edit filter
create on top by field let's select top
five
have made that calculation which is
known as top five calc right
here it is
and click on okay
okay so now if you click on fit height
you can see that these are the top
players in 2015 abt Villiers rahani
Warner Simmons and Kohli
so you can hover over here and if you
move your cursor you can see this track
the running sum of the batsman was 562
for coolie it's 505 that's 544 Simmons
this also 514 for Warner and it's 532
for de villiers so these five are the
top players according to our
visualizations we made we use filters to
find out this top five players in 2015
so let's go to the actual website and
verify if these are all correct
so go to my browser over here
this is the official website
ok so these are the 2015 batting leaders
so we'll view the full list
and you can see that we have found our
top one so we had Warner with 562 to
remember that then we had Simmons and
Abie de villiers and Virat Kohli so
these were the five and we got that
fight
so yeah there it is
it means that we have made all correct
insights now what you can do is that you
can copy all the sheets worksheets study
have made and you can include it in a
dashboard so now we have created all the
visualizations that we need in order to
make insight but they are all in
different worksheets if you want to view
them all together or maybe you wanted
for presentation purpose you want to
show it to your senior your manager who
can view the entire thing at once so for
that you need a dashboard in order to
create a dashboard you just go and click
this icon over here and this is your
blank dashboard so these are all the
worksheets that we have created so what
we can do we can just go ahead drag and
drop all these worksheets over here so
that we can have an entire view of all
the analysis and all the visualizations
that we made using tableau so I'm just
going to drag and drop these sheets over
here
now I'll just drop the purple cap
you can also adjust the size
there you go and you can go ahead and
add all the different sheets as well
so this is how it is going to look like
so now I've adjusted all the sides and
I've made dashboard already so this is
how it looks like
worksheets here whatever I want to view
it's right here so this is how you can
create visualizations and put it all in
a single dashboard so that everyone can
see all the worksheets and all the
visualizations that are created at once
so this is what you can do with tableau
this value can create dashboards you can
add more sheets to it and you can adjust
it in different ways also so any
questions so now all right so now you
know that how interesting tableau can be
how can you make insight so easily just
by visualizing your data so let us also
see how other people have also benefited
using tableau so these are the companies
and if you see closely these are the big
giants the most renowned companies were
using tableau starting from Cisco to
Ferrari Stanford University coca-cola
Adobe Deloitte Bank of America and many
more these are just a few examples there
are companies using tableau worldwide to
make analysis of their data and use it
in business intelligence now if you look
at a few of the comments made by some
renowned members of the company like
Ryan Renner from Deloitte says that
tableau is changing the game for us it's
reduced the time that they have to spend
on lower value add activities similarly
Allen Benjamin from Cinemark thanks
tableau by saying you have crafted a
powerful analytical tool for us thank
you so he seems quite happy I think even
when you start using tableau you would
be happy too because it can do a lot of
things for you it could solve different
problems for you because it can give you
insights about your whole business
problem and then you can go look for the
solution of it so there are many more
people praising tableau so these are
just four of them you can go through the
other two and that's it if you have any
questions till now you can ask me do you
have any questions
all right now questions I am happy that
this whole session was clear to you so
let's take a look at what we have
learned today so we started from the
basics of tableau we learn how to
connect to data how to integrate data we
learn about what are the options there
are in the tableau desktop UI then we
took a use case to perform an analysis
and we took the use case of the Indian
Premier League or the IPL we made
insights about that and we also learned
how to manage data sets we have combined
and joined different data sets together
to make an overall analysis of
everything then I showed you the
practical demo where I have made
visualizations for all the insights that
we wanted to make and in the end we took
a look at the success stories where we
have seen companies like Deloitte
Cinemark Wayfarer and One Kings Lane
talking about tableau and praising
tableau so thank you guys for watching
