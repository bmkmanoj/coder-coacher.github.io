of Eddie Rico today in this webinar we
are going to learn about talent
openstudio
how does the talent open studio do I
look like what are the different windows
available what are the features
available then a short demo on how we
can develop a simple job in talent open
stereo right so let's get in
so agenda for today's webinar is we'll
get to know what is talent open studio
what are the advantages of TOS that is
talent open stood you how do i download
the tool how do i configure it what are
the setup required how does the GUI look
how will I use them and a short demo so
what is Stalin open studio talent is an
open source software integration
platform and also talent is a company
that is it's a vendor it sells this
product right so talent is a company
whose product is named after the company
that is talent and there are wide Verity
soft products which are now provided by
this vendor so talent opens to do is
considered to be next generation leader
in cloud and big data integration
software as you are aware in the market
if you go and check which are the tools
which will support cloud integration big
data integration in a very user friendly
manner
the only answer you will get is talent
so talent offers a wide range of broad
right so it has sir Enterprise Edition
it has open source so it has data
quality we'll get to know about it so
this is all about understand valent is
an ETL tool it is an available in both
open source and Enterprise version and
it is considered to be the next
generation leader in cloud and big data
integration so talent open studio it's
an open source project that's based on
Eclipse RCP right so whatever we do now
people who are from Java background
would understand more for people who do
know or Java
it's an IDE integrated development
environment Eclipse we're in now you
know you will have all the API stilted
to Java and use those functions right
suppose you want to do a substring for
example a very general example then you
simply use a program which is already
defined in Java and say sub
of the string which you want and say the
starting index and the ending index
right so there already you are getting a
predefined API right and similar way in
Thailand we have components where you
can just drag and drop and without any
coding just by configuring the
components you can achieve your
solutions and ETL so it provides an
interactive and user-friendly graphical
user interface it is very
psychologically designed so you can just
type in what functionality you want to
get into your job and you get the
components listed over there you can
have a look at the description of the
components and it is a very user
friendly self learning is very easy so
that's how we can start exploring talent
so in two years all you need to do is a
simple drag-and-drop and connections so
go from one component another component
either you want to flow the data you
want to control the flow and that is all
you need to do a drag and drop
connection and controller so Tiwi is
access and code generator right whenever
you drag and drop any component in TOS
it is as good as dragging and dropping a
bunch of code which does that work on
behalf of you taking all your
configurations so it converts all the
underlying programs in java at the
backend and the code generator at the
backend is non editable so he'll have to
do whatever you want to do in the design
window in the component level itself
right so talent provides you a wide
range of products as I mentioned earlier
so talent open studio offered by talent
each one which serves a different
purpose
I'll tell you why as well so there is a
data integration software and there is a
big data software there is master data
management there is Enterprise Service
Plus and then data quality and business
management process for one example I
would like to take is talent Big Data is
a superset which contains all the
features in the talent data integration
less the Big Data components so if you
download and install Big Data these are
as good as using both integration and
Big Data but when the vice versa
is not as you are aware like it doesn't
contain the Big Data components so why
do I simply download if all the big data
related code
all the components when I am not working
with a big data project right so for all
the needs they have provided you the
different software's so you can download
and use only those right so these are
the different products which are
provided by direct so what are the
advantages of talento consider to you so
it is unified yes as I told you that is
based on Eclipse so if you want to do
something which is not possible in atl
say for example you're getting mainframe
file where in one of the column over
there is a binary you can just pass the
column value to a Java program get it
converted get it back in your ETL and
doodlin can integrate all Java related
code or SQL related code over there it
is an unified platform for you and
there's no coding literally required
will have to just configure the
component until a unless the
functionality which you are looking for
is readily available in talent standard
components otherwise you will have to
write the external no times that's
obviously there which is you know beyond
capability of right here then you will
have to introduce your own coding for
optimization purpose or for your subject
need other than that there is no coding
required as such you have to just
configure the components listen to TC so
real-time statistics whenever you run
the talent open studio jobs you will be
you know on the job itself upon the
components the flow will be displayed
and the real-time statistics which will
be showing you in the demo so how many
rows have been passed from filter
whether it is right or wrong so by
looking at the real-time statistics
itself you can come to know whether your
job is heading in the right direction or
not so that's a very important feature
and there's a massive scalability so you
can build your job it gives you an
executables in Java or Linux and Windows
environments you can take that
executables parallel run in different
servers do your job by no parallely
quickly optimize story but also inside
the talent you can have multiple sub
jobs or run them in parallel and there
is massive scalability options in
challenge and of course all your designs
which you are doing is future proof it
is Java based and
the way the metadata is defined or it is
used in talent is a very user friendly
which will make your jobs which of roof
right so these are the advantages of
talent open studio and that's why that's
powerful so how do i download this tool
whether it is freely available should I
pay it should I register for all your
questions you can just log into talent
comm and then you can go into download
section and easily download all the free
products that is open source products
right so I'll show you how so before we
do that so how much sure system
requirements do you need is a ram of a
GB or more a processor which is either
three or more a storage capacity of 20
GB or oh of course
this requirement intraday state will
always be available the steps to
download your talent open studio is very
simple so go to WWI and comp and you can
click on downloads or I actually going
to slash download URL so look for a free
talent products I'll be showing you as
well so this is how your welcome page
looks like so you can just go and click
on downloads once you click on the
download you get all the free products
listed here from here you can download
data integration which is TOS or you can
download Big Data which is again as I
said it is a superset so if i download
Big Data it is as good as downloading
both data integration plus Big Data
components right so this as simple as
this just one click downloads which will
download as a zip file which all the
binaries like it will have executables
for Windows it will have executables for
your Linux like that ok so once you
download you'll be getting a zip file
I'll be showing you in the demo how does
that's if I look and if you once you
extract and double-click on the exe
which one that's it the setup the only
prequels required is Java should be
installed other than that you know Java
home should be configured so only these
two prerequisites are required other
than that installing talent is not at
all overhead so how does the qsg way
look like so this is how your device do
I look like which will have
no a couple of windows which I'll be
explaining you one by one so let me show
you now how the downloaded Exe file or
the zip file looks like and after you
extract how does it look so once you
have downloaded the talent opens to do
big data so it would download a file
like this which is TOS VD the latest
version is six point four point one so
this zip file will be downloaded once
you download it and then once you
extract the zip file you will have a
folder similar to this which will
contain all the required folders for
Tallinn open studio and then all the
required executables for different
environments so I am using a Linux
machine so I have my Linux 64-bit
executable over here so I will have to
just double click on this to start my
talent Open Studio nothing to install
nothing to configure no repository
required it's just the comply
so once your executable is launched
you'll get a welcome pop-up like this
where it tells you to choose a project
on a create in your project so the
highest level of hierarchy in talent is
project inside a project you can develop
a number of jobs and for a different
project needs you can create different
projects so now I come here click on
create new project and I see today's
webinar topic that is tol demo and then
I just say create so it just creates a
project for me and in the backend it
would have created a folder for my
project with all the required default
folders populated so that would be
present in workspace folder where you
have installed or extracted the Talyn
binaries so if you go inside this you
can see our tos demo that has been
created just now right
so inside this do is remove all default
folders would have been already
populated so tolerant Rajat is one file
you see right now when I log into this
project I get into this project all the
required folders and files will be
populated so let's see how does it
populate so I'll just click on finish I
can observe in background or although
you know deform folders are getting
created which are needed for you
executions in your job site all the
related things are will be available
over here so if you look at the talent
features are there all xml-based so all
the files which you read background
created files are XML based files self I
information so you can see now all the
files have been created previously we
had only one file before I logged into
the project so let's not only learn how
the tool looks on how the tool works but
also understand for each action in the
tool what is the background action
happening what is happening in the
background how does it work then only we
can optimally design a job when you get
to know how actually it works in the
background so once your talents to do is
launched you'll get a welcome page like
this we can close this and these are the
different windows which are available in
your talent you always right so all
these are not activated yet it will be
activated only when you create a job so
before we create the job let's go back
to PPT and get to know
descriptions about all these windows
right so the main page of talent goe is
like this the main window interface from
where you can manage all type of data
integration process so we'll have a
repository window the repository window
where you will have business models you
can create ear diagrams over here the
job designs where you can create all
your jobs the context variables where
you can store all your valuables code
which you want to externally link to
talent by Java code or something like
that
and SQL templates which can be used in
your ETL jobs a metadata for all things
which we use in talent ETL a
documentation section then you can add
documents which are required to refer in
your radial jobs and then recycle bin so
all these things comes under your
repository right so that's what we see
so
they can be divided into repository all
this main page can be divided into a
repository section and then a palette
palette is a window which has all your
components listed they are grouped into
their needs like databases under
databases you will have all the possible
database is supported by talent in
similar way all the cloud related thing
you know bi related thing data quality
rating you'll be seeing in the demo
InDesign workspace this is a place where
I design my jobs I drag and drop the
components I connect them control the
flow all of them happens in your design
workspace in the designer we have one
tab called designer wherein we can
develop the job and another tab is good
as we mentioned earlier each drag and
drop of a component is nothing but a
background code will be generated that
code is visible in this section but
again as I said it is non editable code
and then the configuration tabs so the
section where you see here are the
configuration tabs wherein we have job
related configurations context related
configurations component related
configurations and a configuration
window for running the job killing the
job or clearing the locks debug run all
other features are available under run
configuration tab right so basically all
these four are the main windows of your
TOS right then the menu bar where you
can project related things like project
level settings project level preferences
all the stuffs will be available for you
in the in a bar and the tool bar very
shortcuts for you running the job is
available searching the jobs you know
exporting the jobs all those stuffs are
available in you toolbar outline and
view Oh code we are an outline so they
are the sections wherein you can see a
part of code you can just select one
component and that component related
code will be available in output wherein
in this code window complete code of the
job is available right whenever there is
an error in single component so that
component will be highlighted that
component has error you can just click
on that component and come to outline to
check if there is any problem in your
configurations
right so together all these things form
your talent choice main page right so
coming in detail so repository collects
all the technical items and displays
them in a tree structure within as I
told you up so it's a central store like
all the business models you know job
related things everything will be
available in repository sections so
there's also few buttons over here which
will refresh your repository and also
you can filter out so if you have lot of
jobs and you know configurations already
done if you want to search for a
particular project or particular
metadata you can search over here right
so this is all about your repository
window so the major components in
repository window is business models so
as I said so under this folder all the
business model present in the project
are listed like when you can create here
now know ER model that's where write is
very useful and then another job designs
you can design all your jobs can
drag-and-drop your components control
them yeah connect them so context as I
told you so under this folder all the
contextual variables which can be reused
in the various jobs can be created over
the context and code again as I told you
so
under this folder a library of holding
the routines are available wherein
reusable codes can be created with it as
I said your Java code or SQL templates
right so metadata in the other side it
is rather than using redundant
informations everywhere you can create
once and use many times whether it can
be structure of a file you know it's a
database collection whatever it may be
so documentation under this folder all
type of documents having any formats are
gathered by double-clicking on the
document you can open it in the relevant
application a recycle bin so as the name
suggests it has all your deleted jobs or
documents in its place and you can
restore them if you want so this is all
about your repository window so when you
come to palette as I said it is all
about your component listing so it is
docked at the top of the design
workspace to help you to draw the model
corresponding to your workflow needs so
depending on what job you are doing and
which business model you are applying on
it you can drag and drop all the
technical components you know whatever
you want to build him so that is in your
business models whatever we saw
previously in the
you can do that okay so TiVo's provides
900 built-in components so all these 900
building components are available in
your palette and a point to mention is
when you download it to voice and if you
go on search for big data components
over there it will not be available so
you'll have to download the Big Data
version of the talent and then the Big
Data related components will be
available otherwise in simple TOS that
is talent data integration not talent
data integration for big data in that
this components will not be available so
from pollard you can easily drag and
drop the required components and drop
them into your workspace for your job
right so in the designer workspace as a
tool so we can both business models and
job reasons can be laid out here so
designer taps opens by default so you
can drag and drop your components and do
your ETL design here so code tab helps
you to visualize the code and highlight
the possible language errors whenever
there is a mirror which you cannot get
to know by direct a component highlight
because inside component there will be a
number of configurations you would have
done which configuration exactly has the
problem will not be able to quickly
identify store to quickly identify you
can come into code and that particular
error line will be highlighted so you
can look at the error in the code but
then you will have to correct them in
the designer window itself so that's all
about your designer window and the
configuration windows are the major one
so now job window will contain all your
information about the job so including
the name version created date all the
stuff and then context as I said it is
all about your variables whether you
define the variables over there or you
dynamically populate them this context
holds the placeholders for your
variables and the component is very
important it is dynamic component
whichever component you click on that
components attributes or the
configurations will be displayed here so
we'll have to configure them so the run
window as I told you it will let you
learn the job kill the job clear the
locks and run the job in a debug mode
all the stuff right and the geo menubar
and toolbar it's nothing but it's a
project level configuration so whenever
contains some standard functionalities
like save print etcetera and the toolbar
contains icons which quick access like
around the job or important job search
like that as I mentioned so outline view
and code view so this outline you will
have all the components listed over
there along with the standard variables
which are available for it
so in the code view that component so
both the tabs already information
regarding the display diagram like
whatever you click on your designer
window that related information will be
visible here right so let's go into the
talent open studio and let me show you
all these things which ever we have seen
now in the PPT practically and we'll
create a simple job right so let's take
a use case I'll explain any use case and
then we will come up with an ETL job for
that ok as I told you before you have
not created any job in your talent open
studio all these windows will not have
any data or they'll be in the activated
State
so let me create a job so to create a
job as you already know where does the
job design commander it come under
repository so under repository under job
designs
I would right-click and then say create
job and I will give a meaningful name as
per the standards so let me name it as
job 1 TOS demo purposes demo description
is also done and if I want to choose the
version I can choose it author will be
automatically populated this is the
author which we give in the first window
wherein now we can provide the authored
email and then if you want to give the
status you can give it that is
development testing or production and
then if you want to select the path
where you want to store this in the
workspace as well you have to give so
these are all optional only MANET
everything is the name and purpose and
descriptions are also optional but then
it will pop up a warning if you are not
giving those values and that is warning
in the pop-up level only not in the job
right so let's say finish once I finish
so I'll get a job
listed over here and all my windows will
be activated for that job so now we can
see all the windows are activated so a
job has been created so this is the
palette window wherein you can find all
the related components over here you can
come under database and choose whichever
database you want
and that database related components
will be available say for example from
using MySQL allow all MySQL related
components so this are your
configuration windows as you're seen in
the PPT and this is your outline code
window which are empty right now
whenever I drag and drop a company then
by clicking on that confident these
windows will be activated right so
before we start a job so let's get into
the case stating what is that I want as
a solution in this job say suppose I
have two files I'll show you those so
something called as EMP details one I'll
open this file so I have an EMP detail
now Excel wherein I have ID first name
last name and date of joining of all the
employees of a company say for example
ok ID first name name and date of
journey and I have another excel we're
in the next level details of the
embolize say for example employee ID who
is that employee and what is his city
and state so I have them all in
different Excel it's similar to our
employed Department a design in de la
base wherein will have employ details in
employ table and we have department
details in department table a similar
use case wherein I have in one X and I
have all the employee details another
Excel I have the city and state details
right so I will have to create a master
date out of it
wherein I will have even the city and
state information along with all the EMP
informations in the other excel so that
is my use kiss so let's for this use
kiss I am reading the data from Excel
but then I want my output in my data
piece so the master data which I create
this will go to a database say for
example MySQL database and then also I
want it in a reusable way so suppose
tomorrow my database IP changes no
username password changes I should not
go into the job and change it so let's
we have to maintain a design an optimal
ETL job for that right and also once
Lassa data is loaded into the table I
also want another excel with the same
data which has gone into the database
just for emailing purpose or something
which
you can tell today's so many employees
have been loaded or something like that
right so let's have this use case in
mind and let's start developing this job
so in Thailand in a standard way of
developing so we go with the connections
first which all connections we need will
finish that connections or will
establish that carnation in the very
beginning of the job so there's a
component called T pre job the
functionality of this job is it's an
independent component whatever happens
whenever I execute this job the first
component which executes is this job T
pre job that is why it is called pre job
so whatever components I attached to pre
job will be executed first so what
usually we do is all the connections
required all the global variables
setting all the time settings time stamp
capturing all the stuff we can attach it
to pre job so beginning of any of the
Logging's you want to do the job started
at this time with all these
configurations so you can all do that
with attaching the components to the pre
job so now in my use case I am using
Excel as my input and mysqldb as my
output so mysqldb needs a connection so
let me create my SQL connection here so
before I move into the component over
there I told you like maybe tomorrow my
IP may change username password may
change so wherever there is change
expected will directly go into metadata
which is under repository and will
create a metadata for it so when I am
using the database connection in the
five jobs and there is a change in
database collection then I'll have to go
back to file jobs and change it but then
when I'm doing it in metadata I will
have to just come in whether it and
change into the metadata it will reflect
in all the jobs where it is reffered so
welcome to metadata DB connections i'll
right click and i'll say create
connection and I come here and name it
as metadata for MySQL then I say next
I'll choose what is the DB for which I
am creating the metadata I'm using MySQL
so for MySQL let me log in as root and
since it is on localhost I don't have to
provide a password so is my local host
before I provide the database name let
me go and create new database for my use
keys so I will tell my SQL with root
user and I say create database employee
and I see use employee so database have
created so let me come and provide that
database name as you know in this
connection so I will just check this
connection and my connection is
successful I'll just say finish and now
my metadata for MySQL is already created
I can either drag and drop this metadata
or I can either drag and drop a
component from you so we have created
the metadata for MySQL so let me choose
my SQL connection from pallet and say
MySQL connection so under my SQ t MySQL
connection component is available I'll
just drag and drop it so from pre-job
I'll just see trigger that is when the
component is successfully executed so
this is the first component which will
execute and if there is no problem come
and create my MySQL collection so that's
what it means right so now we have
established the MySQL connection the
next thing is I'll have to read two
files as I showed you to excel files so
let me create metadata for them quickly
so the similar way of how I created for
my database so I'll just say metadata
EMP underscore one for the first file so
I'll just provide the file name which is
EMP details so one and then I can read
into it in our 2007 format and it is in
sheet 1
it has read the data it is giving me a
preview over here
so I'll just say next so since the first
row is header
I'll just click on set heading row as
column so it will automatically make my
header 1 and then you order see the
preview you can see the preview again
here and in the next step it will be
populating all the columns width it
predicts the data type of those columns
so I can review it if it is right I can
continue if it's not I can change
the datatypes if I wish to
so it has created the metadata for me so
I tribute in the next step and see
whether all the data types are proper or
if there is anything which have to
remove all the stuff so it has
recognized ID first name last name made
of joining and it has I need to find an
empty column as well so I will just
remove or it can yeah so my metadata is
ready I'll say finish similarly L create
a second metadata for my another exit
fact that is EMP - so I'll quickly give
the file name which is EMP details - and
then I say the sheet 1 rear axle then I
say heading row as column name say next
so since there are so many columns in
the input file it is trying to read the
other columns which is quite obvious in
you know whenever the customers provide
the file will have all these problems so
we can neglect those ignore those and we
can take them at a rate of her only
which we need so now I have created
metadata for both of the excel so my
intention is to join these two excel
perform join on the data which is
provided in the excel so I will drag and
drop both of them into my work area
so just a which component I'll have to
use on this metadata since it is an
input excel I'll use it as in protection
and similarly for EMP - I'll use it as
an input X L so now
I can arrange them directory I'll have
to join them to get the data from to us
this okay and this is a component called
team app which is a multi-purpose
component it can join at can you know
apply filters it can walk on your each
column business tools so what I will do
I'll take the data from my first excel
component so using the road type main
which carries the data and I'll provide
you to team up and I'm using a sir
to look up the second Exel so I'll
provide the main data of the second
component to team up but then here it is
me but the second component which I
connect a team of will become lookup
right so I'll have to join them and I
just what is a key a require for joining
is ID just drag and drop it
so on ID I'm drawing these to doubt put
I require is in the master data that is
what city and
detail so I'll just select all the
columns from my main table and I'd
simply drag and drop to my output and
now the joined output that is city and
state and drag and drop from the second
lookup so city and state up front
lookup so that's all I have to do and
then the output which I am getting I'll
have to put it for a MySQL table right
so what is a component for it and just
search with MySQL so it is an output
which I'm trying to do right my skill
output so I have a component MySQL
output inserts or updates to my SQL
table right but then I have not created
any table as such I have created only a
database but then talent provides me an
option to create as well if it is not
existing so let's see those
configurations so now I'll get into this
MySQL component since I already have a
metadata created MySQL connection I
don't have to give all this information
which I've already provided I'll just
click on use an existing connection
where in all host name details
everything will vanish off so it will
take it from there which connection D
MySQL connection which I have created
here so table name as I say it as EMP
master and what is the action on the
table I have to do is create table if
does not exist first check whether the
table is there if not it can create it
what is the action on the data it is
insert and if you can see the schema
which columns have to create I can just
take it from the team app which has
already synced so these are the columns
which are going into my table so I don't
have to create a schema as well it is
automatically taken care so by this I
can join my two employee details Excel
and the output of the join is redirected
to a table in MySQL very now I'm
creating the table and inserting the
table without doing any create statement
or something like that so it is all
handled by talent but also I told I can
get the same output in the excel as well
so tea file X in output
I can also write this same output which
goes into database for some email
purpose or whatever the case may be for
that I can write the same output in
Excel as well so I can just still in
Excel format and I can give a folder see
inside a gyrator demo output I can give
a file name here master EMP dot xlsx
right and the sheet name can be EMP
details you can include the header row
all others are the default okay
and the schema would be again propagated
automatically
so I'll have the header also and output
created right and now this will so my I
know use case which I had thought of but
then once my use case is completed I'd
have to close this connection right and
also there is a another component called
T post job similar to T pre-job varies
this is the first component which
executes in the job and this will be the
last component which executes in the job
so I can just close all my connections
you know delete some temp files all the
stuff in the t-post job so I can tell T
MySQL close connection and I can choose
which connection I have to close that is
MySQL connection which was opened in the
first step and then I'll tell at the end
you disconnect so this completes my job
now let's go into run configuration
window and run this job so choose a
random component window and I'll JC run
so you can see the real-time statistics
in the job say for example the first
component which will be executed you
define an Okie symbol on it it is
completed and the lookup nodes first so
this is starting and then after that the
main loads and then it loads into the
job right so now our job is successfully
completed with all the rows in their
table and as well as indexing and also
the connection has been closed so let's
login to the database and check whether
I have the data output over there
so I'll just say select star from one of
the table name we are given is master
EMP EMP master so let me check on that
so there is no data credit I think we'll
have to commit the data so let's go back
use the commit
I can also use commit before I close a
session so I can just tell know MySQL
commit and then close
so after commit taken close the
connection
you
- let's select star from but let's use
the same query
now you can see the data has been
populated using the city and country
values as well let's also go to the X in
which we have tried to create in demo
put and open this Excel so even that
should have the data along with the
header so which is also available so
this is how we can create a simple job
