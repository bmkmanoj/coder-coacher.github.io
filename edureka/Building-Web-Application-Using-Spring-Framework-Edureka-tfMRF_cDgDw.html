interaction to Spring Framework and I
will be covering one concept of Spring -
dependency injection and I will also
show you what the Spring Framework
course offered by Eureka cause so let's
start with the interaction - Spring
Framework
so before we start up my name is ash
Rathore one of the cofounders of four
feet apart calm I have around eight to
ten years of experience with Java and
related technologies I have used the
many frameworks including spring so that
should be sufficient for interaction who
will be covering introduction to spring
so will understand why do we need a
spring framework and its features and I
try to cover as much of dependency
injections as possible so let's see an
illustration and I'll try to understand
why do we need a spring framework so
here you can see that there is a
management of an ABC Private Limited has
decided to make web applications for
their customers so the management calls
for the web development team led by
James so James is leading the web
development team and they have decided
to make a web application for their
customers and in the meeting they say
that it's an urgent requirement so I
called you here so one of our customers
needs to build an application for them
and we have very less time and the
customer wants the application to be up
and running before Christmas so they
want it to be developed as soon as
possible and they'll go about that
discussion and I've seen no previous
project there were a lot of course that
we did we did not do anything so you
want something fast and efficient so you
mean to say that there were a lot of
code which we might not have written if
we add used to better technology so one
of them will suggest that we can use
spring framework so can anyone of you
suggest what exactly
is a framework okay so have you used any
framework so let's make it a bit
interactive so that they will not be
boring so can you tell us more about the
spring framework and how it matches our
requirement so the spring is a
well-established framework with a lot of
features that helps the developer to
develop on their applications rather
than worrying about a non-functional
code so what do you mean by
non-functional code it increases their
the perpetuity and reduces the
application development time time and
all of them are happy and they'll go
about implementing it using spring
framework so what exactly is a framework
so let me try to use paint and try to
illustrate it so as let's suppose that
you're trying to build a web application
and what are you trying to build you're
trying to build something very similar
to Facebook so trying to build a social
network so let's assume that this is the
core web app so pardon me for my bad
handwriting
so it is written in PHP so okay so
Facebook is written in PHP so right now
we are not talking about how Facebook is
implemented so let's assume that what
all the functionalities of Facebook so
the Facebook has a core web applications
and it is a web server and they have
something called as maybe a behavioral
analysis they might be having some other
web services like maybe a recommendation
service so the entire architecture will
be a kind of a service-oriented
architecture so there will be multiple
services talking to each other so while
building such kind of a complex web
applications how does a framework help
so let's suppose that you have to decide
to use the Java select and jsps to build
it
and you have decided that you will not
use any frameworks I'll start by scratch
by wheeling it through servlet and JSP
so what are that disadvantages of this
approach so the disadvantage of this
approach is that you have to develop
each and every functionalities of this
web application whereas if you use AZ
framework like spring so let's assume
that this is a spring framework so
spring framework has a built-in security
mechanism and it has adapters so when I
say adapters like a conversion adapters
like XML to JSON to objects so when I
say objects these are plain pojos the
plain old Java objects and there are
many supports like you can do social
network integration and you can
integrate with other social networks
that you can integrate with LinkedIn
Facebook Twitter all those supports are
already provided in sprin so if you want
to develop the web application and you
need not to worry about implementing
security features for your web
application so that's already built in
with spring you can use that feature and
you need not worry about this data
conversion so or else you need to worry
about how to convert from data from one
format and the format spring provides
all those facilities as well as if you
want to connect to any other social
network itself very easily using spring
and there are many other features
available in spring so in in short a
spring framework is a framework or any
framework is a software which has
already some of the features built in
with your applications can use so that
your application can concentrate only on
writing the core business logic so the
application can only worry about writing
the core business logic so other things
will be handled by the framework itself
so that's why we always go for a
framework so any questions on this
so it was created by Rod Johnson has
started the SpringSource company and the
supreme framework is an open-source
application framework and inversion of a
control container for Java platform it
provides comprehensive infrastructure
for developing java applications so if
at all you have perused any framework so
you might be knowing that using
framework will simplify the development
of applications the spring handle is
infrastructure so that you can focus on
your application I have covered this
last point to that IP illustration so
spring is a framework like struts and
hibernate so most of you might have used
this framework for a hibernate which is
an ORM framework so it's same as in the
industries the other than I should focus
on learning more of a spring compared to
other technologies now the spring and
hibernate are extremely popular and
widely used in industries is you can say
that a spring and hibernate are widely
used but in the first sentence what we
say the learner should focus on learning
more of a spring compared to other
technologies is bit biased toward spring
there are other frameworks and there are
other programming languages which are
doing equally well like there are so
many frameworks in Python which are
equally suitable for building web
applications and definitely is a Spring
Framework is one of the best frameworks
available or building at Java based
applications spring is a lightweight
framework and it does not involve any
installation and starting and stopping
activities associated with the container
is quite very easy
so in Java technology there are so many
frameworks that help programmers to
build complex applications easily it's
very difficult to find an application
which does not use any frameworks these
days every application uses so one of
the other frameworks the frameworks
built
bring in a kind of a structure to your
project as well as it reduces a lot of
complexity from developer from
developing each and every component so
some of the frameworks famous frameworks
are this hibernate and most of you must
have used log4j for logging and j-unit
is a framework for testing so there are
many frameworks available in Java okay
so moving on so the spring frame apart
lightweight solution to develop
maintainable reusable enterprise
applications so the a few other examples
of frameworks are hibernate log4j JSF
start so now can we define what is a
framework and anyone of you define what
is a framework ok the class is very
silent set of rules which simplifies no
it's not a set of rules so if you want
set of rules you have to use some other
frameworks like rules so this is not a
rule engine which simplifies our work so
how does it simplify our work so
framework is a set of the use of the
software program that forms the basis
for an application so if you take this
security set the important aspect of an
application so this message adaptors are
an important part of an application so
social connect is an important part of
each and every web applications
developed developed in the recent year
so the important part of the web
applications are already developed in
spring and you can clearly reuse it in
your application so you need not develop
this security feature you need not learn
about to be crypt algorithm to store the
user generator user's password so it's
already there in
radius boilerplate code I would not
agree with that
because spring introduces its own way of
boilerplate another complaint score a
spring framework is that it relies on
XML so there are lot of XML since spring
project it has been reduced by
annotations but still spring has lot of
dependencies on XML and the reduction in
the boilerplate code which it does based
on this using this XML I would say
writing XML itself is a kind of a boiler
clicking so there are other frameworks
like Play Framework which are catching
up with spring the only weakness which
spring has is that a lot of xml's can
confuse Java developers sometimes what
is wrong with XML and why should we
prefer annotation so when I show you an
example of XML and let you know why
exactly it is a bit cumbersome to write
an XML and the mapping from the XML to a
Java code it's not very intuitive so
what do you mean by a lightweight
container a spring framework can be
described as lightweight container as it
does not involve installation
configuration star nest of activities
associated with the container so I'll
show you how for you can use Spring
Framework so I will show you a live
example of how to I install spring
framework on your ID and create a sample
spring application with XML we can have
a different XML for each environment we
have a question from Sri not with XML we
can have a different XML for each
environment like development staging QA
production but annotations is difficult
to hu this what's your thought I would
not agree with this so you can have you
can achieve this through annotations too
so you can have
the configurations related to each and
every environment in your properties
file which can be loaded so when I say
about XML I am NOT talking about the
project configuration so I am talking
about creating the objects using XML so
spring uses creation of object using XML
so I think I will explain it in detail
when I talk about dependency injection
where you will configure the object and
it's property attribute in an XML and it
will be injected into the project I
don't have any problem in storing
configuration related to parameters in
an XML or an external file but storing
an object attribute in an XML is
counter-intuitive fun and it's for
anyone else to you can just go and
search about Spring Framework and its
reliance on XML so there are many people
who gets confused so if you get used to
it it takes some time to get used to it
but once you get used to it you can reap
the benefits of this framework so how
Spring Framework is different from other
frameworks so we can use the develop EJB
applications using spring so you can
develop it the spring has its own
advantages from other frameworks so when
you say other framework if you can give
me an example I can do a comparatively I
can tell you how is it better so if you
say the draw if you are using the raw
servlets and jsps have told you that you
have to implement all these features by
on your own like security the adapters
the social connect and other features
provided by the spring framework like
hibernate so hibernate is not a
framework which you can compare with
spring so hibernate is an urm framework
whereas spring is a java application and
web application development framework so
this is not a right comparison okay so
the the difference between the spring
and districts so there are a lot of
difference between the spring and
Strutt spring provides many more
features than struts for example the
loosely coupling of your object you can
hu loose coupling better in spring
banning struts and stretched us a few
things better that's why the spring use
a provision of integrating struts
application inside spring so this will
be a bit difficult for me to explain in
the interest of time so I would say
struts has its own advantages whereas
the spring has its own advantages too so
one of the advantages with Springs
course over stresses its loose coupling
mechanism so that's what I will be
talking about dependency injection so
loose coupling through dependency
injections okay so okay so let me show
you how to configure is I am sure that
most of you must be familiar with Java
programming language and if you're
familiar with Java programming language
you must be familiar with the Eclipse
IDE so you can install a spring plug-in
and make you are reckless IDE
much more comfortable to develop a
spring applications so let's see how to
do that so it will click on help and
then you have to go to eclipse
marketplace
and once it downloads all the packages
we should be able to search for spring
so let's wait for a while happening so
you have to install the spring ID three
point six one for release so I have
already installed it so those of you are
not installed it you can install this so
Eclipse IDE will become more comfortable
for developing the spring application so
once this is done so you will be able to
create spring applications I have
already created the spring applications
here I'll try to demonstrate few of them
so once we cover few of the theory part
I will try to cover two of the programs
spring simplifies Java development to
back up its attack on Java complexes
spring employs four key strategies
lightweight and minimally invasive
development with plain old Java object
loose coupling through dependency
injections and interface orientations so
this is where a spring scores over other
flavor declarative programming through
aspect and formal conventions this is
also an important pitch aspect oriented
programming is an important region of
Spring Framework boilerplate reduction
through aspect and templates i partly
agree with it because the less number of
a boiler blood pudding in java the more
xml is generated a spring source tool is
not better than eclipse so spring source
tool is also built on top of eclipse i
am making my existing eclipse compatible
with spring orders you can download the
springs with source tool - so that's
fine
okay
so aspect we have seen inversion of
control that is done to dependence
injection this is what I will be
covering in this class aspect another
important aspect is this aspect oriented
programming which enables cross-cutting
the concerns the security feature which
I spoke about in that illustration it
cross cuts the entire project so that is
where we use aspect oriented programming
and there is lot of support for data
access like working with JDBC and
hibernate spring as the concrete support
for interacting with databases either
through your raw JDBC or through
hibernate
so with JDBC there Spring increments
JDBC templates you can use JDBC
templates to talk to your databases or a
spring has hibernate template tool so
which you can use to talk to your
database in an ORM be a model view
controller is another important aspect
so the most of the spring applications
are spring web applications and spring
provides MVC supports through servlets
and struts and this is a web framework
and other thing I would like to say here
is that spring has a good support forest
so the JC library is built in in spring
framework there is lot of support for
integrating Jessie are to your spring
project so those of you who have built
rest application I think I am sure that
you must be knowing about Jessie library
okay
so I'll skip few things so this is how a
spring framework architecture looks like
there is the support for testing you can
integrate with j-unit and then there is
a core container
this is the spring core which comes of
beans Co context and expression language
and then there is support for
aspect-oriented programming and this is
where you have all the support related
to your database connections
transactions for MS etc and this is a
support for you of MBC web app for
building your web applications I have a
question from a source oh yes sir sure
go ahead
I'm neutral by the hot medicine okay
I'll unmute useful give me a second
yes you can speak now
hello am i audible hello hello can you
hear me ash yeah I came here he had tell
me so I have seen some spring dot I your
website also who download spring for
like the different kind of purpose like
for messaging Q or some non-relational
database what you are saying it's better
to use spring through eclipse plugin
hello
yeah so no no I'm not saying that you
have to use spring to exit Eclipse so
usually what happens is that we will be
having an IDE like except you will be
using Eclipse IDE you can use that
existing IDE self and develop spring
application by developing it by just
installing this plug-in pump so I'm
saying but in the beginning you told me
that the spring source is not good so
I'm just just for the ye but I asked it
to both my that not work properly
I'm I have never told that the spring
source is not good I told that you can
either use the spring source tool or you
can use Eclipse existing Eclipse so this
both go both are one and the same
okay okay all right okay okay so I hope
but any other questions
come on Fishman no okay thank you so
we have an interesting question so why
are you in a hurry a person who is new
we will not understand at this pace so I
have to cover introduction to spring
along with that I have to demonstrate an
example of spring in one are so I hope
you understand my challenges which I
will be going through so I think the
recordings will be made available to you
so you can listen to it as many times as
possible so that you will get an
understanding of what I am trying to say
here
so few of you might be having a little
bit of idea about what Spring Framework
is so I cannot cover this introduction
to Spring Framework in detail because
many of you would like to see that how
the important topics in spring will be
covered so I am trying to do justice to
both beginners as well as to those who
have a slight idea what Spring Framework
so you can join the class and then I'll
go in now there are 78 slides and this
will be the 70 slides will be covered in
three hours and I'll go in complete
detail and I'll try to explain each and
every component in detail so quickly we
will try to execute for one or two java
programs and we see how far spring helps
so the object coupling problem so here
not possible to incorporate the changes
without refactoring the code the
requirement is that without refactoring
the code can you change the object so it
cannot be scalable or testable in
isolation or even maintainable without
some degree of code change we will see
this in detail at least we'll spend a
good 20 minutes on dependency injection
so that you can at least say that I
understood what exactly is a dependency
injection in Spring Framework okay
so a dependency injection is also called
as inversion of control container so the
objects created by containers are also
called as managed objects or pins of BC
how to create a B the container can be
configured by loading XML files or
detecting specific Java annotations on
configuration classes we will be using
XML and I'll show you how to use XML to
configure Rabine and how to inject that
bean into your project so Center to
Spring Framework is its inversion of
control container so inversion of
control container is one of the main
pillars of Spring Framework which
provides a consistent means of
configuring and managing Java objects so
all the Java objects where you want
loose coupling will be injected into the
project so what is what do you mean by
loose coupling so now let's assume that
you have a java application and let's
say that you have an object called car
and then you have an object like user
so this example is purely for
illustration so it is not a real-world
example so now let us assume that this
value of this car object will be
changing frequently so it will be
changed very frequently so what happens
if the car object to change is very
frequently so you have to make some
changes in this car in the code where
you are trying to create this car
objects so basically what I am trying to
say is that so when how do you create a
car object you say that car car is equal
to new car and then you will set all the
properties either through the
Constructors all through the setter
methods you set all the properties
related to this car so what happens if
you want to change some of the
properties of this car you have to
change this code so you have to change
so this is called as a refactoring of
code so you cannot avoid this
refactoring of the code because you have
tightly coupled this car object to this
java application so this is called tight
coupling so then what exactly is loose
coupling so if at all this entire car
object was configured and its properties
files can be its attributes can be
stored in some XML file or properties
file just by changing those properties
you can create a car object out of it so
you need not change any part of your
code only by changing the configurations
you will get a new car object in your
java applications so this is called as
loose coupling so spring achieves this
loose coupling through a concept called
as dependency injection so this
dependency of this object is be
being injected into this application so
which is nothing but a java application
and that the new keyword will not be
used so any questions on tight coupling
and loose coupling
okay
thank you so now let's see how exactly
spring accomplishes this use coupling so
we don't create a car object in loose
coupling so summer has a question so we
do create a car object but it's in a
different way so I will just demonstrate
that how it is different so let's go to
the examples part and see how to do it
so you can see that there are two
classes here there is an user plus which
has a car in it so there is a this is a
has a relationship user has a car in it
and then there are getter and setter
methods for this car so there is public
void set car to set the value of hot car
and then there is public car and get
calm and then we have this car object
which has two attributes in it one is
the name attribute and there is a per
day cost so per day cost to rent this
car and then there are Gators and setter
methods for these attributes name and
per day cost okay so now for in spring
all the dependencies which you are
trying to inject into the application
those attribute has to be stored in an
XML file which we usually call it as a
context XML file
so for each you can have as many context
files as possible so it depends upon
your structuring so you can have a
context file for each and every object
if you want so this is how one XML will
look like so the first instance you get
scared off for this XML but I would like
to tell you that this beam and this
everything will be generated by your
Eclipse IDE itself the only part which
you have to bother about is this part so
how do we create a beam so you create a
beam by using this beam tag with an ID
so you can give any value for this ID so
here 3 s given the IDS user and the
class which it corresponds to right now
for the class which it corresponds to is
this co dot ad wrecker dot usage so I am
assuming that all of you must be knowing
about Java and at least the kochava
so this beam has an ID and you can give
any name for this ID and then the class
which it corresponds to so that this
should be a fully qualified class name
and what does it consist of it consists
of a property one this property refers
to the attributes it comes of only one
attribute that is car and here I say
that the name is equal to car it should
be exactly same as this name whatever we
have given here and and it is saying
that it is referenced by this car B so
where exactly have we defined this
carbon so you can see it below here it
says we have defined this car B and then
we have this beam with ID equal to calf
and which class it corresponds to this
is co dot idiotic or car and now let's
see what does this car consist of the
car consists of one name and a per day
cost so here you can see that the
property name is equal to thing and then
the value we are directly providing the
value here we are not referencing any
other object here so we just say value
is sorry no disturb and the second
property name is the per day cost and
the value is 10,000 so this is how you
create an object in a an XML file and
this object will be injected into your
spring application
so are using spring for but the context
or XML has a spring 3.0 fixer in it
so right now in this Wells this slides
were made these were made for a spring
tree but when I create XML files I will
create it based on 4.0 existing okay so
in the test class you can see that first
we are loading the context so
application context context equal to new
class path XML application context so
there are many application context
available like there is a file system
XML application context are using a
context you can get the objects which
are created in XML so we have created
user and car objects in XML so these
objects can be got through the context
so how will we get it so here you can
see user and he has named it as object
context dot get been here you are to
give the the name what your forgiving
for this ID so you can see that we have
not used the new operator here but we
have got this user object and if you
want to change anything in this user
object you can simply change in this XML
and it will be reflected in your program
so let's try to see if I have this
example already for it or not so let's
okay so I have this a car class which
has name inferred a cost and it has this
gate name set name get per day for stand
set for any cost
so when does the beam objects get
created when we lower the context in the
test class or when we write the core in
XML when you write the code in XML the
beam object will not be created when you
run the program then it will be created
so I'll show you that example so and
then we have this user object it as a
private car in it and there are getter
methods and setter methods so is this
clearance so there is there are two Java
classes one is the car class which has
name and per day cost and then there is
this user class which has this car
object okay so now we need to see the
XML file
so there are many XML files have written
so now it will be difficult for me to
choose which XML file I might have used
okay so it's good that they're not able
to find it so to create a spring XML
file
you're right click on your project go to
new and then you choose this file called
a spring bean configuration file so
click on this file and then your name
for this so I'll say so dependency
injection basics so you can give any
name for this XML file and then it will
ask so we show all existing namespaces
you want so I'll say that I want this
beans and I will choose this 4.1 XS the
latest one and I want context and what
else do I need so I need beans and
context so that search that should and
to it and then I'll click on finish so
you can see that this XML files are all
automatically generated by actives so I
did not write this namespaces and this X
s DS so what I need to write is just the
bean so I will just say property sorry
not property it is bean ID is equal to R
and class is the fully qualified class
name of car
so which is code or did you record car
so into the sense works here too and
then we have to set the properties to
property let me refer to it name is name
and value is and then you can set a
value to it so one for one attribute we
have set so another properties per day
cost value is ten thousand and then I
will create another beam that the user
be
class is code on a jury cannot user and
it has only one property that is
property name is car which is referenced
by as come so this car whatever I have
written here is nothing but this ID he
should be same as this one so that is
all about this XML file so now we can
write a test method
of just fall just made one so I'll write
a new main method and I will be using
the file system application context and
this file name should be the file which
we have created just now so that is di
di basics dot XML and then I can get the
user object now choose a user sequel to
you need to do typecasting and from the
context you can get the user you call
gate beam and whatever you have forgiven
the ID parameter in this di base is
better to copy this and paste it here so
now you have got this user object once
you have the user object you can print
this so once you have this user object
we can print this card it is
so this is from once you want this user
object then onwards it's straightforward
you can just say user target card or cat
name and the per day cost is user dot
cake cutter per day cost so now let's
try to run this and see if there are any
problems in this we can just click on
this run tests are so you can see that
we have got the car name which is serene
understood and the per day cost which is
ten thousand which has been configured
in this XML so what have we done here so
we have created a loose coupling from
this through this dependency injection
approach of spring framework so the car
object has been the properties of the
car objects are has been defined in this
bean tag and all the properties have set
so now for the beauty of this is that in
future you will say that okay the
requirement has changed and the car
should not be here in order stir it
should be some other it should be some
other car so now how will you handle
this if it is some other car so you can
just say that you can say that it is BMW
and glass is equal to Co dot
anti-wrinkle dot R and then you can have
these two properties and just copy this
and instead of an order stir you can say
BMW and you can see the per day cost is
thirty thousand and here instead of
referring to this car I can now refer to
this BMW car so now you can see that the
user class will be having a different
car object itself but I have not even
changed a single
of Java code so everything has been
changed in this XML only so now if I run
this carp example so you can see that it
is the car name is BMW and the birthday
cost is 3000 so this is how you can
achieve loose coupling in the Spring
Framework so I hope this is clear
okay so we have para won four more
minutes left in this webinar so I would
like to take few questions so this is
also called as a setter based dependency
injection how many ways we can get
application context so there are many
ways in which you can get application
context the most common way is using a
class path application context who I
should be typecast user to user object
so if you don't typecast
then this context dot get bean will
return an object it will return of the
type object so we know that what kind of
object it is so then you have to
typecast it so any other questions
and what is the difference between the
file and the classpath so the the file
system XML application context will look
at that file from related to your
application where you have created for
example these file app context or XML or
this VI basics dot XML is available in
this folder itself hello spring whereas
the classpath XML application context
will try to find this XML file in the
classpath so at that time you have to
put it in this source / main slash
resources whatever you put it in the
resources will be available through
class path application context so the
better way to use is through class path
XML application context so I have just
used filesystem XML application context
say any other question
okay
being factory or application context
which is better so application context
is also a kind of a bean factory itself
can i define null values you can define
null values there are peas so one of the
slides covers it I'm not very clear
about it
of the flight covers about how to define
null values okay
so we have come to the end of this
webinar I hope you bought a bit of
introduction to Spring Framework it is
very difficult to do it justice to such
a broad concept like Spring Framework in
one in one arc so I think I did my best
to cover one of the most important
widely used concept in spring paper that
is dependency injection at least you
came to know that we don't use new
operators when you want loose coupling
and we try to get all the attributes of
an object from an XML file
so can you please explain the last line
so last line as in this system dot out
dot println there is just printing the
car it's just getting the car object
from the user object and it's printing
the name and the per day cost yeah get
card or gate name we'll get the class
car object and from the car object you
will get the name and user or gate car
we'll get the car object and from the
car object you are getting the Purdy
post okay so I hope you enjoyed this
