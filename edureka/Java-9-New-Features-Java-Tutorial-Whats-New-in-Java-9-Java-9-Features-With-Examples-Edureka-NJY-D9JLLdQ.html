and welcome to this interesting session
on the various new features that are
introduced with Java and I now without
wasting any time let's move forward and
look at today's agenda to get a good
idea of what we'll be discussing as part
of the session now talking about the
most important features of Giovanna and
we'll be starting with the rupal J shell
which is a very interesting concept that
has been added to Giovanna and then will
be going on to look at the collection
factory methods as well as the HTTP to
client feature that has been added as
well apart from this we'll also be
looking into the jigsaw project which
helps us achieve modularity in Java 9
and we'll also look at some of the other
mentionable features that have been
included here so I hope you guys are
excited for this so let's move forward
to the first topic of the session which
is the ripple gesture now for those of
you who are familiar with other
programming languages like groovy Scala
or even Ruby and Python you must have
heard about ripple from before it
basically translates to read eval print
loop now with Java 9 as well the ripple
tool has been introduced and it makes it
quite easy for you to try out different
language features as well now what
basically does is that it helps you
write simple code and test Emma so if
you've worked with Scylla then to just
print hello world all you need to write
is println and then hello world but in
Java when you count down you need to
define a class you need to define a
specifier then go into the function use
the system dot out dot println command
and then only it gets executed but with
the GL scripted you can actually write
this in a single go and thereby making
it quite easy and effective in order to
check whether the statements are valid
or not as well now to help you
understand this let's look at a demo now
in order to execute the command and you
use it on the gesture let me start by
launching my command prompt ok now one
thing that you need to see is that
before you go on and work with the
gesture you need to see which version of
Java you're using so let's use Java -
version this will actually tell me which
is my present version so I am add Java
version 9.0 4 so only versions about 9
will actually have the J shell feature
as well now - in order to get into the
jail it's quite simple you just need to
the command jeschill and your insights -
shell as well so when you're going
inside Jason you are also prompted with
the current version of Java that you're
using as well now at any point if you do
need any help or you want some
understanding more about the gesture
then always you just have to use the
command slash help ok so this will be
really helpful I will give you all these
necessary commands and overall idea as
well with respect to the various options
present here now let's actually
understand with this with an example
let's say I wanna print hello world here
so I'll use system dot out dot println
ok so this is a standard command that we
use in Java to print
okay I will close this put a semicolon
at the end and voila you have hello
world being printed here that's how easy
J shell has made my life in order to
test certain conditions or certain
parameters as well with respect to the
Java program
okay now let's also try to understand
something slightly more complicated let
me try to help you understand how we can
use the J shell to declare a variable
and then we'll be looking at a method as
well so let me start with int a is equal
to 9 and okay as you can see a has been
initialized to 9 now let's move forward
and let me show you something
interesting here now you might be
wondering okay do I need to even
initialize variables not really you can
even directly write the command let's
say I want to add two numbers I say 9
plus 2 and you can see here dollar 3 is
a new variable that is being created and
to that the value that is the answer 11
has been assigned as well so this is how
it works up so now actually let's see
what happens is let's take an example of
a method and let's see how it works but
before that let's say at one point if
you want to have an ID of all the
commands that you have executed just use
slash list and it will give you the list
of commands that you have executed as
well so you can see here I started off
with a print statement then I went to
initialize any variable that was a and
I've given it the value of 9 and then
I've just added two numbers as well so
going on forward let's actually look at
something more interesting now before we
go on to look at how to create a method
one thing that you need to understand is
that the numbers that are present to the
left these are actually identify as for
the commands that we have executed
that's why when we had given the
addition operation the left-hand side we
had used dollar 3 that was the third
identifier used to store the value 11
okay now let's just write a simple
program that will print hello world but
I'm gonna write it inside a function so
what I'll do is I'll make it a void
function so let's start with void and
I'll call it output message
no parameters I'm going to open the
curly braces and I'm already inside my
function so here I am just going to use
system dot out dot println ok now inside
that let me define hello world
all right and if I hit enter here and I
close this function then you can see
here it is already telling me that it is
missing parentheses so this is something
that's quite important okay so let's say
no matter what you do the syntax needs
to be followed so let me just restart
this ad nakulan and I close this now
what you can see here is there's a
method that's being created called
output message so this is what I had
defined earlier as well so at any point
let's say if I want to call this method
then I just need to type the name of
that method
and if I call this yes hallo world is
being printed as well so apart from the
standard definition I can also write
methods here which are quite useful and
helpful for me as well but let's say I
want to go back to the list option okay
to see the list of commands that have
executed now as you can see here the
entire code that is the entire function
that I had defined is being referred
with respect to a single identifier it's
not considering each of the lines
separately as such as in the earlier
case as well so this is something that's
quite interesting with the J shell as
such now again what you need to
understand is that the J shell tool is
actually not meant to create projects
but the main intent of this is actually
to get a prompt response that is you
want to check if the logic of the code
or the output of the of a particular
logic is correct or not that's the exact
situation when you can use J shell as
well now what you might be wondering is
can we actually edit any of the code
that we have written earlier as well
definitely that is possible and let's
see how that can be done again what you
can see is that you can use the list
method to get the identifier for that
method once you understood this then
just use the following command slash
edit and then just specify the
identifier so in this case it's for now
what you're seeing here is a gel editor
pad and this is something that's coming
out by default so let's say instead of
hello world I'm just going to say hey
everyone welcome to Eddy Rekha
okay once I'm done with this I can
accept it and then I can accept this
okay now what we want to see is that let
me go back to my list and if you see
here it has been updated as well so this
is one way through which you can modify
or update any existing methods which are
part of the J shell as well now again
let this validate this function as well
that whether the changes happened or not
so for that I'm just gonna call the same
function again and here you can see the
output also has been updated as well so
this is something that is quite
interesting and useful as well now in
the last step always is leaving out the
j-shot so you might be wondering how do
we do that just you slash accept and it
brings me out of jail as well and it's
nice enough to say a goodbye as well so
that was a demo on the ripple J shell as
well now again what you need to
understand is the entire process that is
present here with respect to the
triple-t shell is that you're always in
a complete loop when you first take an
input and read it then you evaluate
whether this is correct you print it and
this loop keeps running around an era
okay so this is what it refers to and
this is something that's quite newly
introduced in Java 9 as well moving on
to the next interesting factor about
Java 9 is the collection factory method
now talking about the collection factory
methods Java 9 has added new static
factory methods on lists set and map
interfaces as well now this actually
makes it quite easier for you to create
immutable instances of these collections
as well now if you look here if the
function that is list dot off function
that you're using can actually be used
to create immutable lists and same with
in case of sets and maps that is you can
use set dot off for creating immutable
set and map dot off for creating
immutable maps as well now what are we
doing is I just show you a memo that
will help you understand the difference
between the newly introduced collection
factory method and the existing methods
as well so let us take a simple example
let's say I'm going to create a set as
well now let's go back to our J shell
because I really like the J shell
feature and let's look at the example as
well so let me just go back to the J
sure now before I actually start with
the method let me just give you a simple
idea of what sets are for those of you
who are not familiar with it now set is
basically nothing more than an interface
which extends the collection class and
which
is an unordered collection of objects in
which duplicate values cannot actually
be stored okay so now let's actually
look at how it was implemented in the
earlier versions and how it can be
implemented now so let me begin by
creating the code which was used in
earlier version so it's set and then you
specify the type let's say string I use
set is equal to
collections dot unmodifiable set
and let's say I'm going to define a new
hash set
and I will define the type to be of
string
and let me open curly braces for this as
well so once this is done do this let me
just add a few items let's say I like
food so let me add apples first and do
not forget to add the semicolon let's
say add mangoes
and let's say I'll add orange
and let me just close all this
and Priscilla : at the end okay so you
can see now a set has been created which
contains apples mangoes and oranges but
in reverse order okay now this is how
traditionally it was defined but now
let's see how you can conveniently
create this you in Java 9 as such so
here just use set and then specify the
type with a string use the name of the
set equal to and then use the function
set dot off and then specify the
elements here inside curved braces so
let's say I'm gonna call this so let me
just change the name of this set I'll
just call the set one okay and I'm gonna
go back and here let me just rename this
and let me add the elements let's say
apples okay so let's say if you want to
add multiple variables then make sure
you're separating them with a comma
again let's give banana and orange
add a sim cooling and then we are done
so now you can see I have actually
defined a set in just a single line
instead of five different lines that was
actually being used earlier so this is
what set off function which is being
introduced in the latest collection
factory methods helps us to do now same
let's take the case of let's say list
now list is basically an interface which
is a sub interface of the collection
class and it contains methods to insert
or delete element on index basis as such
okay now let's see how lists can be
implemented compared to the earlier
version as such now let me first show
you the command for creating lists in
the earlier version now let's actually
understand how this works out let me
just show you the command for lists I've
already typed it out okay now what you
need to see here is this was how lists
were written in the earlier days so once
you execute this it creates a list which
contains the element apple mango and
orange a spa now newer heads square it's
slightly easier in terms of writing now
it does not depend on the array class so
it's just list and against type off list
that you're creating so in this case
it's going to be string
and the name of the list so I'll just
call it list one and this is equal to
list off this is was the function that
has been introduced recently and then
the values that are going to be included
here so apples mango and last but not
least orange
and you can see a new list has been
created so again if you can use either
of the conventions that are present here
but it's up to you on how you want to
fall now similarly if you want I will
show you four maps as well but before
that Maps can basically are a key value
pair system okay so this is something
that's quite interesting that makes it
stand out with respect to all other data
types that are present here now each key
and value pair are known as an entity
and this map contains only unique pairs
of keys which are actually helpful while
searching or updating or even deleting
an element based on the key of well okay
so let me just show you the command
which was used earlier for creating maps
so this is how actually maps were
defined using the older syntax when you
have to first specify the keyword map
then you have to specify the type of key
type of value that was that a string in
this case then use the name of the map
then the parent class which is
collection dot unmodifiable map and then
specify what kind of map so this is a
hash map wherein the key value pair
would be off string type itself and I am
specifying two values here which is key
one body one key - value - okay so let
me just and execute this and you can see
a new map has been created now the same
thing can actually be reduced while you
are using the map of class so in that
case you just want to write map specify
the type of key and value so first is
key so let's say string itself comma the
type of value then name of the new map
variable so I'm just going to give my
app 1 now I am basically using this to
distinguish both variables so I am just
going to say map off function and here
I'm going to give the key value systems
now what you need to understand is that
every odd parameter would be considered
as a key and every even parameter would
be considered as a value as per so just
remember that when you're passing this
so let's say I'm gonna give you a key 3
separated with gamma let's say value 3
P 4
and value for
so now you can see what had actually
taken me five different lines for
executing is now again getting sorted in
a single line so again these are quite
interesting and easier fact now now what
this does on a long run is that it
basically helps you reduce the overall
number of codes that are involved while
you're writing the program now we all
know that today while you are writing a
Java program it's not something that you
were right and having maybe 100 or 200
lines but when you have redundancy when
you need to write long lines of code
such small effective code handling
skills would be really helpful as well
now this is something that Java has
introduced with respect to Java 9 and
it's quite interesting as well as
effective as such so moving forward
we've discussed about these commands as
well how they have helped us so let me
go on to the next key feature which is
HTTP to client feature ok so let's talk
about the snake now the first thing that
I would like to tell you about the HTTP
to client feature is that this feature
is actually expected to change either in
the subsequent releases or even maybe
removed completely but what you need to
understand is that earlier developers
used to often resort to using
third-party libraries like Apache HTTP
Josie and so on in addition to this
Java's HTTP api predates to HTTP 1.1
version Java's HTTP api predates to HTTP
1.1 specifically and this synchronous
and hard to maintain as well now these
limitations call for a need to add a new
API as per so why hasty tp2 what are its
benefits let's look at them one by one a
simple and concise API to deal with most
of the HTTP requests now this in turn
makes it quite easy and useful in while
you're managing the HTTP requests within
your application as well and it also
supports the HTTP 2 version
specifications as well so this in turn
is helping it reach out better in terms
of booths performance as well as
security as well
now again apart from this there are a
lot more enhancements that have been
added to it but that we'll be seeing
later on but again this is something
that's quite interesting and I'm not
sure how long it will be there for but
definitely you can make use of it right
away as such so now let's actually look
at another key feature which is project
jigsaw but before we talk about that
let's right
Andres why jigsaw project what are
exactly are eight benefits to Java 9 now
project jigsaw has been in the bus for a
while now because it is going to
introduce something that's new in the
Java environment what it basically is
trying to help you achieve is that it's
trying to help you achieve the concept
of modularity that is it's going to
support for creations of module in Java
9 and apply the same to your Java
development kit as well this actually is
the modularization of the Java
development kit
so let's actually look at some of these
key features to help us understand what
led to this feature being added with
Java 9 as well now the first thing that
I would like to bring is it is strong
encapsulation now what do I mean by that
is that in this module you can only
access those parts of the module which
have been made available for use so
let's take an example wherein we have a
public class as part of the package this
package but will not stay public unless
and until the package is explicitly
exported into the module info 5 now this
in turn makes it quite strong in terms
of encapsulation as well now the next
key feature would be in terms of
dependency that is you have clear
dependencies as well modules often need
other modules to fulfill their
obligations as we all know this is
something that's quite true and that is
something quite necessary as well now in
order to fulfill these obligations any
such dependencies must actually be part
of the module definition for the module
to be self-contained now these
dependencies give rise to a modular
graph nodes represent modules and the
edge represents dependencies between
modules which is important for both
understanding the applications running
in it with all the necessary modules as
well
now then comes the reliability factor as
applications are more reliable by
eliminating the runtime errors now let's
take an example wherein you're running
an application and during runtime you
miss there are some missing classes
again you find the error which is class
not found exception so all these can be
actually eliminated by making use of
modularity so this is what project 0
actually brings in and helps you achieve
as well now in order to give you a
little more understanding of VIII jigsaw
project let me just help you understand
how the jigsaw project has any
JDK enhancement proposal okay now you
first start off with the AP 200 which
actually enables you to achieve modular
GDK this in turn also will help you with
the JEP 201 to achieve modular source
code as well then
JEP 220 will help you achieve modular
runtime images and 260 will help you
encapsulate most of your internal API
saspa
261 is on the same line you'll be helped
be able to achieve a modular system and
finally with 282 jailing the Java linker
will also be part of the modularity as
well so this is just a rough idea of how
Zig saw project is helping the jdk
enhancement protocols as well now let's
actually look at some of the other Java
9 features now the first thing that
we'll be discussing is the multi release
Java system now this is actually a
feature which is quite interesting and
good news for people who maintain
libraries as well
now when a new version of Java comes out
one of the biggest challenges is that it
takes years for all your libraries to
switch to the newer version as such now
this in turn actually means that the
libraries must be backward compatible
with the oldest version of Java which
you want to support now ideally given
present that Java 9 is released maybe
you would want to stick to Java 5 I
would be more favorable to 6 or 7 as
such but what you need to do is that you
need to understand that I always need to
be backward compatible now this actually
means that you won't get the new
features of Java 9 in your library for a
very long time but through the mighty
release jar function it helps you create
alternative versions of classes that can
be used while running the library on a
specific Java version now let's actually
look at the directory structure here now
if you look at the Java multi release
jar feature you have the meta
information under which the version also
has been specified and under that you
can find the multi release class and the
helper class as well now what this
program basically means is that we've
actually used the multi release jar
which can be used on Java now instead of
the top-level multi release dot helper
class we can actually go for this which
is present under the meta section as
well so this in turn ensures that the
features of Java 9 are possible with
program a spa now this basically is a
Java 9 specific version but at the same
time it also ensures that while using
this jar on any version which is earlier
than nine it would still work since
older versions of Java will only see the
top layer of hierarchy as one so this in
turn ensures that there is backward
compatibility at the same time providing
you with the features of Java 9 as well
now the last feature of Java I will be
discussing is the Java doc now again
Java doc is always the parent or the
main source for any kind of information
that you are looking for because if you
ask me if someone wants to study Java
this is the correct place that they need
to do because this is where every
information is present and there's been
a major improvement with respect to the
Java Doc's and this is something that's
quite interesting and helpful for you as
well so definitely do looking they've
had a major upgrade with respect to the
Java doc itself now they have included
searches in the right for the API
documentation itself now as a bonus you
can also believe that Java dog output is
now actually html5 compiling as well so
this is something that's quite helpful
so again any information that you want
with respect to the newer features or
newer updates as well this is the
correct place to go to
now with this we actually come down to
the end of our session and before we end
up with the session I'd like to just
finish with on a lighter note when I
just summarize what we have discussed
about Java 9 as well now we started off
with Jay shell and how it had helped us
with achieving rippled feature and then
we moved on to collection factories and
how it made it easier for you to define
immutable sets lists and maps as well
after that we talked about the dig saw
modularity is feature which has been
introduced with Java 9 and how this can
actually help us achieve a modular JDK
environment as far and following that we
talked about the multi release style and
how it also ensures that the newer
features provided in Java 9 is present
at the same time it's also backward
compatible and we just had a look with
respect to the update in Java Docs as
well so this brings us to the end of
this session I hope this was an
informative session now with this thank
