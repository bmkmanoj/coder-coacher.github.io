everyone present today I hope all of you
are in good health now these are the
concepts that you actually deal in coop
programming that is object-oriented
programming so we'll just see how those
coop concepts are actually integrated
are used in Java moving on I come to
create new object type with class
keyword whenever you have to declare a
class you'll be using a class keyword
you would have seen many times right
here in animal whenever you want to
define a class class keyword is used in
aquatic as well you can see the same
thing reptile you have got the same
thing and even in the main so class
keyword has to be present whenever you
have to define a class now a class
definition can contain variables in it
it can contain initialization code in it
it can contain methods in it okay so
these are the three things that your
classes can contain variables you know
that like X is a variable like there was
a type variable in the class animal okay
so these are all variables that can be
defined within the class then you can
have initialization code you wrote that
type equals to not human okay you are
actually initializing that variable so
that is a kind of initialization code
similarly you can have methods we'll be
dealing with methods in a while so you
can also have methods within your class
okay
now an example class package tom dot ada
lake identity so this is a package name
in which you have got a class car a car
class has got three variables in its
string name string color and float
weight so you can have many variables
you can also have methods within your
class like public void move now this
method is not returning anything because
it is void the return type has been set
to void as well as it is not taking any
parameters neither I just got a
definition in it okay so we'll
understand what is a method so this is
just a example of a particular class
that you generally have in Java moving
on what are all
what is the function of an object first
of all object is the runtime
representation of a class okay that
means whenever you have to use a
particular class you'll be using an
object you'll be creating an object of
that particular class using that object
you can use the things that are present
in that class okay like if you see the
example right here we have used object
when I come to main class I wanted to
use the content that is present in the
equity class so what I did I created the
object of this equity class first of all
I wrote the name of the class that is
equated then I mentioned OB that is
object name equals to new operator
actually allocates memory for your
object and then I again write the
aquatic with the parentheses and I put a
semicolon so this is the syntax how you
actually define an object of a class
using this object I am using this
variable that is type as well as the
variable that is lives okay so I am
using the content of the class using the
object of that class hence it is told
that object is the runtime
representation of a class okay you would
have heard that an instance of a class
is called an object now object hold
state with variables can anyone of you
tell me the meaning of this line over
here that is objects hold state with
variables please write down on the chat
window these are all considered it as a
poll question but instead of clicking
the radio buttons you have to write on
the chat window so I'm sure sy will
answer this question
he loves questions so all of you write
it what do you think is the meaning of
the statement that is object hold the
state with valuables if you do not know
you can write no on the chart so I says
Lal I don't know the answer okay what
about the rest of you machines is know
locai says don't know sir objects can
change the variable Zoomer says okay us
Ashraf says object whole class wearables
okay Aaron says lifecycle okay any other
answer none of you is perfect right now
no value of variable without object
okay Nikhil says variable with its value
okay that's correct
now he is quite close Nikhil says that
variable with its value every object has
got its own instance variable okay
yes myung exactly the correct word
instance variable every object has got
its own instance variable and that
variable will have their own different
values okay I will show you a
demonstration as well on this let's see
other answers Amin says means it has
value of variables or it states Omar
says variables are associated with
objects okay mine says instance variable
let's check out I'm going to eclipse now
let's make a do project I'll close this
file I'll go to new Java project
testing is there a project with testing
name nope so I write testing and this in
the source folder I'll add a class that
is test one and finish first of all I'll
add one more class new s2 I'll include
the main method in it and I will click
on finish machine chaser I'll be back in
two minutes okay
ashraf says it's old default values okay
now in this i'll declare one variable
integer state okay s dat
I put a semicolon I come to test to file
in the test to file what I did I want to
use that variable I am creating an
object of that parable test 1 equals
sorry the object name OB 1 equals 2 nu
and test 1 semicolon I create one more
object that is test 100 B 2 equals 2 new
test 1 and I put a semicolon see we have
got two objects using the two objects
both the objects will have their own
distinct instance variable what is the
instance variable this variable right
here will be the instance variable of
the objects of test 1 class okay
so I'll be using the instance variable
by using the object that is OB 1 dot
state it was 210 I put a semicolon obd2
dot state I am using the instance
variable of second one and I will assign
a value 18 and I save it so I am putting
different values in both of these things
now it does not mean that the value of
this state variable will change to 18
now okay I will just print out the
statement system dot out dot println and
in that first I will print this one and
then I will print this one ok first I
will copy this and in that I'll change
it to OB 2
okay I run this code ctrl f11
I received 10 and 18 on the console
window then that means that these two
objects are actually holding the state
of their variables Rena says different
copy for both object exactly correct
okay so they'll be holding the state of
their variables whatever value is
present in that variable will be stored
okay it will be safe it won't change so
all of you are clear with this line that
was present that is object hold state
with variables everyone right down on
the chat window if you're clear
Astro says yes sir maybe says yes
psiphon of amede Mayank ahran ahran say
state is of object type no state is not
of object type state is off I think it
is of a nature type yes it is of integer
type it is not a fob dick type okay okay
then I come to the third statement that
is objects do some words with methods
that is you can use a method using the
object will be discussing as soon as we
discuss the objects sorry as soon as we
discuss the methods part then will be I
will be showing you how to use method
using the objects they are used in a
similar fashion like you are using the
object okay now objects can be created
during runtime as follows right here
as I told you you first write the name
of the class then you mentioned the
object name it could be any name equals
to new and car with the parenthesis and
you put the semicolon this way you will
be creating the name of the object you
will be creating a new object let's move
on and I come to methods a method takes
some parameters perform some
computations and then optionally this a
returns a value so whenever you want to
create a functionality okay mine sent me
aside smiley
now whenever you have to make a
functionality like for addition you want
to make a function for addition you want
to make a function for subtraction or
any other thing if you want to provide a
particular functionality you can make a
method this way you'll be modeler izing
your application okay you'll be making a
different method for that and by using
by making a method you can call that
particular method at many places this
way you'll be reducing the redundant
code okay you'll be reusing the code now
we'll see what are the things that are
present in a method methods have got
five components one is modifiers we will
be discussing about modifiers in the
later part of the class modifiers are
like public private protected and there
is a default one whenever you miss
writing an DD any one of them then in
those cases it will be taking the
default one now we come to return type a
method can return a value it could be an
integer value it could be a string value
it could be a character it could be
float or it could return nothing if you
are not returning anything you'll be
mentioning void in place of the return
type that means this method will not
return anything a me says is there any
difference between methods and functions
now you would have also heard of
procedure
okay method is a general name there are
two kinds it is action methods is
actually divided into procedure and
functions procedure is the name given
for a method which is not returning
anything which has a void return type in
that case the method is called procedure
if a method is returning a value whether
integer or any value in those cases that
method is termed as functions okay but
they'll always remain a method it is
just a definition it is the theory part
that is a method returns anything it is
a function if it does not return
anything it is a procedure are you clear
on me please write down on the chat
window okay good
now was on
dunt I so I guess you are understood
with you have understood return type
that is it can return a value or it
cannot if it is not returning any value
in those cases you will be mentioning
void we come to method name the third
one method name is actually the
identifier of a method using the name of
the worth method we can use that
particular method okay so it is the
identifier of the method the method name
third thing is the list of arguments or
you can call the parameter list now it
contains different arguments that is if
a method needs certain values on which
it has to do the computation in those
cases you actually take values right
here example if you are adding two
numbers the method is adding two numbers
then it will require two numbers with as
the parameters will you'll pass integer
a comma integer B as the parameter and
those values will be used in body of the
method now we come to the part that is
body in the body it will be providing
the definition of the operation okay
that has to be performed that means you
can say that functionality of this
particular method will be present in the
body of the method that will be enclosed
between the curly braces okay we come to
modifiers now I told you it is a part of
method or any class or any where it is
used all over the application now first
modifier is a public modifier any method
in a class can access the field okay
that means if anything any entity has
been mentioned as public that means that
particular entity can be used all over
the application whether it is available
a method or a class okay so it could be
used all over application it is a
government thing like if it is a
government property a government Park
anyone can go there similarly if you
have got a public variable that variable
can be used by any class anything okay
it would be used all over the
application we come to protected any
method in the same package or any
derived class can access the field when
an entity has been mentioned as
protected that means that entity can
be used within the body classes that are
present in the same package or can be
used by a derived class okay this is the
condition it could be used other body
sick classes that are present in the
same package or it could be used by the
derived classes finally we come to the
third access modifier that is the
private if some entity has been
mentioned as private that means only
methods within the class can access the
field I have also shown you an example
for private and protected as well as
publicly have been using all over the
application so whenever something has
been mentioned as private that could
only be used in that particular class
itself finally when you do not mention
public protected or private any of the
modifiers then in those cases what
happens it takes the default default is
that only methods in the same package
can access the field okay that means the
classes that are present in the same
package can only show you access that
particular entity in which you haven't
mentioned the access modifier so first
of all what do you mean by abstract what
do you think abstract is Yogesh is
derived from one class Aaron says hiding
exactly correct hiding that means you do
not provide a abstract thing do not
provide the detail okay you do not get
to know what is inside that you just
have an overview of that and that is
called abstraction that is that a hiding
for example right here abstract class
shape you have got a class say shape
that is abstract class now you do not
know in that shape whether that shape is
a circle whether it is a rectangle or it
is a triangle you do not have that
detail right so you have abstract class
shape which gives an overview that it is
some kind of shape now when you further
classify it it could be a rectangle it
could be a circle it could be a triangle
so in Java what you do we define
abstract class and you put some details
into that just the names okay finally
you can extend this shape like rectangle
is a shape so what you did class
rectangle
extend shade class circle extend shape
and class Triangle extent shade okay
like this you can have many other kinds
of shape like octagonal hexagonal
anything they all will come under this
category that is shape and you can
implement this you can extend this
abstract class into that particular
class moving on board is an abstract
class I have stacked class that is
declared abstract is called an abstract
class okay a class we just preceded by
an abstract keyword whenever you define
abstract class you write abstract then
the name of the class hence that class
is termed as abstract class example is
abstract class demo
so this class demo is actually an
abstract class because it has been
declared as abstract right here using
the abstract keyword it may or may not
use abstract methods and what do you
mean by abstract methods first of all I
hope you are clear with what are methods
because we did it in the last class now
last two last class I guess now tell me
what is abstract methods I've told you
what is an abstract class can anyone of
you tell me what our abstract methods
in france's only had a nobody
okay that's correct mine says methods
which do not have anybody exactly
correct both the fuel phone and my ink
that's correct
moving on now as you said what is an
abstract class a method that is declared
abstract first of all a method that is
declared without an implementation you
do not have the body you do not have the
definition of that particular method
present okay so that that method will be
termed as an abstract method which does
not have a implementation and you
actually mention it as an abstract
example is abstract void add int X and
int Y so you have got a method that is
add which is taking two parameters
integer X and DDJ boy so ICSI beneath
them leaving for job now so countered in
the class so will you will go through
the video later thanks we'll miss the
class okay that's fine sign you can move
forward but I guess you'll be present in
the next class right he says yes will
surely that's good okay now goes on
abstract methods you mention the
abstract keyword you write void add
index identify so this is an abstract
method that you have declared it would
be present in an abstract class an
example right here public abstract class
shape okay I've implemented the same
example that we saw in the starting you
have got a class shape which is an
abstract class in that you have defined
abstract void area so there is a method
that is an abstract method since it is
mentioned as abstract and you do not
have the implementation of the method
right here so after that you close the
abstract class now you have a class that
is rectangle and the other class first
circle in rectangle you wanted to use
this class that is abstract you use
extent shade as soon as you extended
this class you can use this method that
is area now once you X
in this class you have got this method
area within that you can provide the
implementation like when if I have to
find the area of the rectangle you are
using length into width okay now when
you implement the same shape when you
extend the same abstract shape class
then in that in the area of method what
you are defining 3.14 into radius into
radius in case of circle the formula of
area is different so what is the benefit
of this abstract method it is that as
soon as you extend this abstract class
you can implement this method which
would be common for both rectangle and
circle but you are providing different
definitions within them okay so this way
you have got the structure there is no
detail present you have the overview you
have the structure and what you can do
whatever detail you need whatever detail
you require in your application you can
implement that e-tail using that
abstract method and the class we come to
interface what is an interface the
interface are declared using the
interface keyword whenever you see
interface keyword you should understand
us this is an interface interface it's
kind of a middle layer you can say that
not like that but what you can do you
can consider it as a medium through
which you can use certain methods which
do not have a you can use certain
methods which do not have an
implementation right there is an
interface now this interface has got
three abstract methods one two and three
there is a class this class wants to use
this interface so what it does it
implements this interface the keyword
that is used to use an interfaces
implements instead of writing extends
you'll be using implements and using dot
you'll get all the three abstract
methods you can use all the three
abstract methods within your class you
can define them in the class right now
what is the advantage of an interface
can anyone tell me do you have any idea
what is the advantage of an interface
any one of you
okay now how many of you know that
multiple inheritance Nikhil says we can
create a template for every object max
is a kind of protocol to be followed by
the class how thick stays no idea of a
shield says it is you used as multiple
inheritance
Vasile that's a good answer pratik say
supports multiple inheritance exactly
now in Java Java does not support
multiple inheritance but you can attain
it by using an interface you can only
extend a class particular implement
multiple classes as mine gave me a poem
lost in the last class ladders sky is
blue something like that you can extend
one but implement two that means it
could be two three anything you can
implement as many interfaces as you want
so this is one of the importance of
interface in Java so that you cannot
take multiple int inheritance ok myung
sends me a smiley so I hope you are
quite clear with this diagram right here
the motive was you should understand the
keyword that is used as well as you
should understand all the classes will
be used in the class all the methods and
interface will be used in the class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
