Rekha today we will learn how to install
docker and how to run a docker container
on a sent OS machine if you want to know
what is stalker you can find a link on
your screen just click over there and it
will direct you to a video that will
tell you about dock and architecture
docker containers images pretty much
everything that you want to know about
docker so let us proceed over to docker
installation in my previous installation
videos you must have noticed that I have
listed some steps in the beginning but I
won't do that here because installing
docker is like a cakewalk you just need
to run few commands first I'll make sure
my existing packages are up-to-date so
for that I'll type sudo yum update and
here we go so no packages marked for
update I will clear my terminal now now
I will run a docker installation script
so for that I'll type curl - FS the cell
and now I'll give the link HTTP GET dot
docker dot-com / SH on here we go
this script adds the docker dot ripple
repository and installs docker it is
done now our next step is to start
docker service so for that i'll type
sudo service docker start and here we go
so docker has now started successfully
now I will pull a docker image for
Ubuntu operating system docker images
are used to create containers if the
image is not present locally the docker
will pull the image from registry hub
docker comm currently I don't have any
image so I'll pull an image for Ubuntu
operating
system and further I'll use sudo talker
run on the image named our is Ubuntu and
here we go
as you can see unable to find image I
can highlight that if my cursor as well
so just notice it is unable to find an
image locally that means it is pulling
from registry table docker com
so it has downloaded a new an image for
Ubuntu in order to start using container
you need to type sudo docker run - IT
and the name of the image which is
Ubuntu and here we go as you can see
that we are in open two container right
now I'll open one more tab over here if
you want to see all the running docker
containers you can type sudo docker PS
and it will display it for you so as you
can see the name of image is Ubuntu and
this is the container ID for that
particular image thank you for watching
