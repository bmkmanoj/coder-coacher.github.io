Arica and welcome to this ad acre live
session on python oops oops which
basically stands for object-oriented
programming system our object-oriented
programming as it's most popularly known
is one of the most popular programming
paradigm
now although python is not completely an
object-oriented programming language but
still it uses major concepts of
object-oriented programming style as
part of this now before we move forward
let's just recap on what we have
discussed in our previous session on
Python programming now in our previous
session we started off with what is
Python we looked at the radius
applications which were built using
Python in different domains as well and
then we moved on to the Python code
basics
wherein we spoke about the different
data types the different data operators
we saw condition statements we saw loops
and so forth now in this session what
we'll majorly be talking about are
classes and objects classes in Python
and object-oriented concepts in Python
as well now let's first start about
classes and objects now to those of you
who are not familiar with the different
programming paradigm two of the most
programming paradigms is object oriented
programming and procedure oriented
programming now when you look at older
programming languages like C or you can
see Visual Basic as well
these followed procedure oriented
programming language staff where in what
used to happen was that the entire
program was divided into smaller parts
as known as functions and the importance
was not given to the data but the
sequence of actions which were performed
also what used to happen there was that
the entire process took a top-down
approach as such but what happened is
when you're programming languages came
up they realized the value of the data
and they came up with the opportunity of
creating something known as objects now
objects are quite similar to what you
can relate to in real-world entity as
well now anything that we see around
anything that has different properties
can be called as an object and here how
it differs
from the older-style that is the program
procedure oriented programming style is
that it goes from a bottom-up approach
as well as there's more data security as
well and you can use various operations
like data accessing data or loading data
expansion and so forth
now some of the examples of
object-oriented programming languages
the c-sharp Java was your basic dotnet
and so forth now let's first address the
question of what exactly is a class an
object now to help you understand this
better let's actually look at an example
here now to give you a simple one-line
definition a class basically is a
logical grouping which helps us reuse
and rebuild our data as part of the code
now to put it quite simply it basically
is similar to a template or a blueprint
that we use once I have defined a
specific requirement of mine then what I
can do is that I can go on reading with
respect to that now let's look at the
example here now if you look here I have
created a class called employees wherein
I have defined some of the most common
parameter each of my employees will be
having there would be his name there'd
be their age and there would be their
salary now I have defined a blueprint
but it come there comes a time where I
need to implement this so an instance
which is basically entity of the class
is referred to as an object here now if
you look here there are basically three
different objects
I have object one which is referring to
Sarah whose age is 37 as well as salary
is 10,000 my object to is John whose age
is 43 and salary is 21,000 similarly is
Jessica as well whose age is 26 and the
salary is 24,000 now how does Python
implement classes now again go back to
the definition a class basically is a
blueprint for which objects are created
now coming to the basic syntax for how
to write a class in Python it's quite
easy because you just need to define the
keyword class following which you need
to specify the name of the class now
let's go if you take the previous
example
the name of that class would be
employees and each of the objects would
be created from that same class now what
I'm going to be writing inside the class
would be three major aspects I would
have my class variables I would have
instance variables and I would have data
members okay now these are the three
major aspects to any class as such now
if I need a variable which is going to
be shared by all the instances of the
class now do not get confused when I say
instance it basically is referring to Oh
object itself so here we refer to an
object as instance now each if I want
each of the instance to share a common
variable then I would make it a class
variable but let's say I want each of
the instances to have a specific
variable okay then I would be using an
instance variable as such then comes the
third part which basically is your data
member this basically is a class
variable or an instance variable as such
that actually holds the data associated
with respect to the class and objects
now without confusing you any further
let me actually switch to my PyCharm
okay and let me show you this by writing
by defining a class here itself okay so
if you guys can see my PyCharm can you
give me a quick confirmation in the chat
box
okay I seem to get a lot of
confirmations thank you guys so let's
start by creating a simple classroom now
let me use the first keyword for
defining any class that is class then
comes name of the class now for today's
example what I'll do is I'll create a
class called cars okay
so I've created a car class called cars
okay can you guys see this okay and here
what I'm going to do is that right now
I'm not going to write anything so I'm
just going to use the keyword pass then
comes the time for me to create objects
for this class so what I'll do is let me
call an object let's take Honda for art
okay so this is the name of my object
and then I'm going to specify to which
class it belongs to so it belongs to the
class car and this is how you create an
object in Python
right
similarly let me create another one let
me call it sharpen okay Tata is also
going to be off car okay so basically
what I have done here is that I have
created two objects that belong to a
specific class now time now comes the
time when you actually assigned values
to these instances or objects as such
now let's see I want to add the name or
the model number for the Honda car so
I'm gonna say a Honda which is my object
following which use a dot operator and
then specify what instance variable you
want to use now let's say I want to
specify model name okay model name is
equal to I'd say city because I like
Honda City okay now I'll also add
another variable which is year of
manufacture so I'll say your M okay and
this basically is going to be equal to
let's say 2070 now I'll also add price
okay
I'd say about ten lakhs does that sound
fine now let me just copy the same and
let me create an object for Tata a car
as well now here let me change it to
data
and let's say this is bold okay so let's
keep the year the same or let me reduce
it 2016 and let's see the price is let
me reduce it I'll make it six okay
does that sound fine now what I have
done here is that I have created
instances of the class or objects to
that class and each of these instances
themselves have a specific variable
assigned to them as well so in this case
what you see here is the model name what
you see is the year and what you see is
the price so these are basically
variables associated to each of these
instances as well now if I say just
print and I say Honda dot model name
okay let me take the price itself
let's try running this you see the
mistake here can anyone guess what's the
mistake here with respect to the code
okay it's with respect to the definition
of the class now if you go back to if we
go back to our slides here can you see
there's a small semicolon here that we
have missed out so this is how it is a
single semicolon can make a lot of
difference okay now let's just save this
let's run it ah okay I can see the price
of my Honda car you know this is a lot
of pain for me when I'm working with
multiple instances which have unique
variables to them but let's say if I
have common values that needs to be
created for all of these if I was using
other programming languages we had a
concept known as constructors but don't
worry that same is present here as well
with Python so to create a constructor
use the following command which is def
which is basically defining a function
and use in it now in it is basically a
constructor here and what it is
presenting is that it is going to
initialize the value of the variables
now if you notice here there's a keyword
that is already added here that is self
self basically is a reference to the
object which is going to be calling this
function now those of you who are not
familiar with functions can check out
our video on Python tutorials where we
have talked about functions and also
check out our Python function video as
well ok now what happens is do this let
me pass a model name I'll also pass the
manufacture and let's say the price as
well okay now I need to assign the
values for these variables for all the
object now if I need to do that then
what I need to do is that I need to
first reference the object so that self
dot model name equal to the model name
that is getting so then serve dot year
of manufacturing
and finally self dot price
okay now what I am basically doing is
that for my constructor I would be
passing these three parameters so for
the object or the instance which is
going to be created please add these
values for that okay now let me show you
how to change this as well now I don't
need this so I will remove all of this
okay
so here what I'll do is I'll pass Honda
I'll pass city okay I also pass the year
of manufacturing is 2017 and let me pass
the price again same for Tata
so what I've basically done is that I
have generalized the requirement that I
want now again if I run the same what
you can see here is I'm getting the same
output that I had gotten earlier as well
so this basically is a constructor that
is going to be used when I have to
assign specific values to my objects or
instances at the time that they are
creating apart from this if you want to
create or you want to add any specific
value you're free to do that
now let's say I want to add a new value
let's say I want to create Honda dot
let's say I want to add the CC as well
the CC of Honda City which is equal to
thousand five hundred okay so this is
also very simple now what happens here
is that I have created an instance
variable for the Honda object okay now
same thing let me just say if I want to
see the complete values that are
associated to an object then what do I
do is that I check the name space for
now how do I check the name space for it
is that I use the dictionary option
sorry I use a dictionary function okay
so if I use ticked function and if I run
this then what you see here is that I
have a model name which is City I have a
year of manufacturing 2017 I have a
price and I have the CC associated as to
it as well okay now what basically it
tells me is if I use this object and
request any of these values then this is
the output that I would be getting same
if I change for Tata and I run this then
what you see here is that CC is not
present so I hope you understand the
difference between both can I have a
quick confirmation in the chat box
okay that's great good to see that all
of you are following it now if I have a
class then if I don't perform any
operations in it then I'm basically not
optimizing or using the complete
capability of that class as well now
what I'll be doing is that I'll be
creating a function here so this
function what it basically does is that
it's going to increase the price of my
car so what I'm going to do is that for
defining any function use the keyword
def okay following which the name of the
function so let's say price underscore
increase okay now this is a function but
it's going to be performing on its self
as well so use self here okay and I'm
going to start defining this function
what do I need to do is that I basically
just need to update the value of price
okay so what I'm going to do is that I'm
going to use self dot price equal to
then I'm going to do a simple
computation let's say the present self
dot price sorry about the typo into okay
how much do you think the annual price
range would be let's take a guess let's
maybe a fifteen percent rise in that
case I'll go with 1.15 okay now I have
defined a function here but what you
need to understand is that it's not
exactly in the scope of the class so oh
sorry about that
now how do you identify if it's in scope
or not it's basically one of the ease
with respect to pie chart if I expand it
then I know what is part of the class
and what is not so this is one of the
major reasons that we recommend you use
PI Tom as an IDE as such ok now I need
to increase the price so what I'll do is
let me go back let's say I want to check
the price of the Honda first ok then
what I'm going to do is that I'm going
to call the function with respect to the
class now it's defined to that class so
what I'll do is that I'll send this fund
I'll use the Honda Honda object to call
that function now to use any of the
functions associated to a class make
sure you are using the instance or
object of that class so Honda dot now
you can already see here the different
suggestions that comes to it now price
increase is the function that I want ok
and again let me copy this and paste it
okay so again see the media issue here
is it's considering this so if you just
W indent it it's going to set back okay
just save this and let me rerun this
okay now it's giving me the output so
it's converting it let me just add int
here just to convert it to integer type
okay so the output should be converted
to integer type for me
so it's incremented the value to 1.15
times okay so these are basic function
operations that you can perform with
respect to Python now let me go back to
my presentation and here let's talk
about the various object-oriented
concepts in Python now in this session
what we'll be talking about are the
three major concepts which is
inheritance encapsulation and
abstraction now when we come down to
inheritance inheritance basically is the
ability or the opportunity for any class
to inherit the attributes and behaviors
from the parent classes now when I talk
about a parent class it refers to a
superclass as such okay
so let's take cars itself for an example
but before that let's look at the
example here now your parent becomes a
base class and son becomes the derived
class as such this is same that we'll be
implementing in our program as well
so in our pycharm what I'll do is that
I'm going to create a new class and let
me call it supercar
but if it has to inherit it the
properties that are present in the car
class then what I need to do is that I
need to specify car here okay that means
it becomes the parent for the supercars
okay so I'm not going to define anything
I'm just going to say pass and let me
remove this from here and let me add it
here
okay now rather than making Honda as a
instance of car class let me let me make
it off the supercar class okay now I
have not defined an init operation on
nor I have I initiated the values for
these variables as well okay so what I'm
going to do is that let me just try
running this okay let me remove this
okay and let me just print the name
space for Honda which is Honda dot
before that let me just show you let me
just print one of the values itself
first before I show you the namespace
completely let's say under dot here
okay so you're of manufacturing is
defined here I have not explicitly
defined in the child class but let me
make sure let me just run this and let's
see the output okay so here basically
it's just passing it ah spelling mistake
let's rerun this now here what is
happening is that it is referencing to
its parent okay now to get a better
understanding of what exactly is
happening here okay we're going to use
something interesting what we're
basically going to do is that we're
going to use the help function print
help and here what I'm going to do is
that I'm going to pass Honda let me
comment this
now this is something that I really want
to show you guys okay now if you see
here what is happening is that it's
showing me the method resolution order
so basically is showing me how it is
going to follow the sequence of
operations first it is going to check in
supercar for init method but I have not
defined it here so what it's going to do
is that it's going to refer the car
class if it is not defined there as well
then it will go back to the parent class
for all objects with this built in dot
objects this is the parent class that is
going to be inherited by all the classes
used in this language as such so it's
found the init method present in cars
okay and it's shown methods inherited
from class is the initiated in init
method and it has initialized itself
okay now this is basically the sequence
of operations that happen as well now
when I create define any function with
respect to the child class it's going to
check the child class if it is not
present then it's going to check the
parent class as such now it can be
anything as such it can also be the
price increase as well
and
okay
okay let me just comment in this section
out so here again it has inherited this
method as well now let's say if you do
want to define an init method as part of
the class then what you basically do is
that you follow the same sequence you
write define okay following which you
use in it then you specify the
parameters it has to take
okay and then what you basically do is
that you shouldn't actually copy this
entire code and replace it here what you
can do is that you can use the keyword
super dot in it okay so what I'm
referring to is that it should call the
init function present in the superclass
okay in that case what I'm going to do
is that I need to pass the parameters
here as well so I'm going to pass the
model name I'm gonna pass the year of
manufacturing as well as I'm gonna pass
the price as well now this is basically
to reduce the code that you're going to
be writing as such now apart from this
let's say there are few other variables
that are going to be taking let's say
I'm going to include CC as part of my
superclass then what I can do is that I
can write yourself dot cc is equal to CC
so I'm basically building on what is
already present and this is one of the
major aspects that you can use
inheritance for this in turn reduces a
lot of code dependency as well and is
one of the most popular and major factor
for any programming language that uses
object-oriented programming systems okay
now coming back to the next concept that
is associated to Python okay
you have encapsulation now encapsulation
basically is the method through which
you bind your data and your code
together now it also helps you in hiding
your data from people whom you don't
want to do it don't want to give
visibility to so this is one of the
major key factors for any programming
language as such now there are two major
ways through which you can I access or
achieve encapsulation one is by using
the getter and setter method and the
next is by using at project okay now
we'll be talking more about that in our
next session but let me give you a
simple understanding what happens is
that you want to change a specific value
as on went in the go itself let's say my
year of development or my year model
year
just keeps changing continuously in that
case what I need to do is that I need to
update these values on regular interval
but let's say if there's a specific
dependency on these variables ahead as
well then it becomes an issue same can
be said with respect to price now the
price is going to be increased
continuously through get a set up method
I can ensure that this is going to be
implemented every time there's going to
be a change as well apart from that one
of the major concepts with respect to
object-oriented programming is
abstraction now with respect to
abstraction what basically it means is
that it hides the implementation details
and only provides the functionalities to
the user now if you look at the image
here now a mechanical engineer or an
automobile engineer who works with your
car is aware of the inside and out of
your car as well now if I need to drive
a car I don't need to know that I just
need to know how to turn on my car how
to change the gears and how to move
forward as well so that is what
abstraction helps me achieve I don't
need to understand what exactly happens
when a gear shifts from second to third
but I just need to know that a gear
shift from second to third is going to
make it easier for me to move ahead as
well okay so this can be achieved by
using abstract classes and an abstract
class is quite similar to an actual
class itself but how is it different
from an actual class is that an abstract
class cannot have an object of itself
you need to inherit the abstract class
and you need to create an object of that
abstract class as well now let me go
back to the same example let's change it
here okay now what I'll do is that I'm
going to add a few additional lines of
code okay let me just copy this here
let's say I'm going to say from ABC
ABC and create abstract method okay now
what I'm going to say is that my car
class ABC is also inheriting this
abstract now I'm going to remove all
this and okay here I'm going to make
this an abstract method wherein I'm not
going to define the logic here
okay for now what I just do is that I
call it okay
and in my superclass what I'll do is
that I'm going to create the same
function
but here I'm not going to define any
logical okay so what I'm basically doing
is that in my abstract class I'm
defining the method to increase the
price but based on my requirement now
let's say I don't want my supercars to
have an increase of just 1.15 so what
I'm going to do is that I'm going to
increase this let's say the annual
increase is going to be two percentage
so this is one of the major uses through
which I can perform or I can use
abstract classes I can just define the
basic logic which is needed to be
implemented in all the classes going
ahead and then what I can do is that I
can implement or variate these functions
as per my requirement okay now with this
let me go back to our slide and let me
just summarize so we started with
classes and objects we talked about
classes in Python and then we talked
about the various object-oriented
programming concepts in Python now if in
case you do have any questions please
put it across in the chat box and I hope
you have a great weekend thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
