topic for today's session is SSI as
tutorial now SSIS stands for sequence of
integration services which is the
service from Microsoft so without
wasting any more time let's move ahead
and look at the agenda for today so
we'll start of the session by first
discussing what is data integration and
why do we need it now data integration
is the teeth using various tools so my
next topic would be why essa science
came into picture and why it is
preferred over the other data
integration tools next we'll be looking
deep into waters exercise and what are
the different components of exercise so
we will be learning about ETL data
warehousing followed by a quick
installation of visual studio and data
tools needs for the same moving towards
the later half of the session we'll be
discussing what is the SSIS package and
how you can create a package in visual
studio finally we'll be doing the
demonstration wherein we'll be taking a
real-life example and integrate data
using exercise so I hope you guys are
clear with your gender and you drop me a
quick confirmation so that I can proceed
ok enough is V s so the Sam may give me
a thumbs up all right so I bought
confirmations from many of you so let's
begin the session so my first topic is
why do we need data integration so let
me take example you have to understand
the need of data integration so if you
look at the image here suppose I am in a
company where I have different
departments now if the department has
some data right so based on the company
requirements to choose the database so
for example my accounting team chooses
SAT to store all the analytical data or
you can say my sales team uses
Salesforce CRM after manage all the
customer details
similarly different team uses different
database my marking team is using Oracle
manufacturing is using db2 and many more
so all this depends on the requirements
of the company now I have different
databases where my different type of
data is stored but let's say the manager
asked me to analyze all the departments
and tell me who brings the best revenue
out of all the teams so what we do now
any idea guys if you could suggest me
with something or you could help me with
this current problem
okay so Sam tells me you can connect the
databases yes and we can connect the
databases this is absolutely right but
let me tell you to connect the databases
it's not free you need a connection
object or adapter for it
what about dealing with these connected
databases will create more complexities
for you because if you have large data
say you have hundred databases and to
connect all of them it will consume a
lot of time so I hope you understand why
I am NOT saying to connect the databases
okay but now what would the solution
there here a simple solution would be
data integration now potata integration
what I mean is you can integrate all
your data present in different databases
and combine them at the same platform so
let's understand more about it and get
an answer to what is data integration 16
the name of data integration now let's
understand data integration and what
exactly it means so data integration is
a process you follow to get data from
multiple sources your data can be in any
form it can be heterogeneous and
homogeneous now by this term I mean data
can be in structured form it can be semi
structured form I can be unstructured so
these are dissimilar data but if these
dissimilar data are combined together
into meaningful and valuable information
wouldn't that be great
so this exactly is data integration now
data integration was going recently but
before that also people uses the data
integration the people then realize the
potential of data integration so they
use different methods to achieve it so
here I have listed few ways from which
you can achieve data integration such as
data modelling where you first create a
model and then perform operations on it
then there is data profiling bit you
take a sample data and check if there is
some inconsistencies errors or some
variations to it
similarly there are different methods
from which you can achieve data
integration now it is not necessary to
achieve data integration using a single
process they may be collection of
different processes therefore there is
no limitation as to how you achieve data
integration now let's see some
advantages of data integration so the
post advantages it reduces complexity
now we're saying this I mean it is easy
to deliver data to any system so data
integration is all about managing
complexity streamlining these
connections and making it easy to
deliver data to any system now the
second advantage is data integrity
now integrity has a major role in data
integration so data indicative basically
business with cleansing and validating
your data so all of us need our data to
be high quality and robust right so data
integrity ensures that your data is free
of errors inconsistencies or any
duplication thirds you have data
collaboration now with accessibility
comes easier collaboration now what I
mean by accessibility I mean data is
easily transformed and people will be
more likely to integrate the data into
the project share their results and keep
it up to date
so here the data collaboration catalyze
last bit on the least smarter business
decision now you can make smarter
decisions as your integrated data also
they're supposed to transmit processes
within your company so here you are
given the opportunity to better
understand the information hence it is
much easier and more informative so
based on the information collected you
can actually make smarter decisions so I
hope now you guys are clear with the
need what it is and different advantages
of data integration so kindly reply me
in the chat window so that I know you
guys are with me also if you have any
query or any problem you face you're
free to ping me anytime if not now
you can always contact up support team
which is 24/7 available or directly you
can read it to me all the details will
be there in an LMS alright I am getting
confirmation that way okay so now let's
move ahead so there are various data
integration tools available in the
market such as ab initio microsoft
sequel server IBM InfoSphere or it could
and many more now let's just focus on
Microsoft sequel server integration
services that is SSIS so the to--going -
what exactly is this a sized first let's
understand - by path
so why exercise so now the first point
is data can be loaded in parallel to
many beta destinations
so and the quality learn that it
collects data from multiple sources now
exercise is responsible for connecting
to each data source extracting the data
and merging it into a single data set so
this is how exercise plays an important
role
next it removes the need of hard code
programmers this is because exercises
infuse the capability to load large
amount of data directly from the flat
file or excel file in sequence level
next we have IDE integration with all
the products of Microsoft also the best
part about exercises it is cheaper than
most of the other tools if you compare
it with respect to base product their
manageability business intelligence
availability and multi Co so these are
few of the points that have listed as to
why you prefer SSIS over other data
integration tools now let's understand
what exactly is exercise so as we all
know SSIS is the service of Microsoft
that basically performs data integration
or you can say merging of data from
different data sources which can be from
flat file it can be from exit it can be
for SCP all right pull or anything so it
is basically used to perform a broad
range of data integration as well as
data a transformation task so in a whole
you can say it basically perform data
migration so exercise is a platform for
data integration and workflow
applications by data integration we
already know the data is retrieved and
combined in a structure which has a
unified view next we have workflow now a
workflow can do several things sometimes
you just need some steps or path in the
path that institution which is either
based on time period or maybe a
parameter that is passed or queried from
the database now after identifying it
you can choose any path you want to take
this is how SSIS works out next we've
already discussed that exercise is a
platform for data integration and growth
to applications so these two things are
carried out using an exercise package
we'll be talking about exercise package
in for the most light to air and I'll be
teaching you how you can create an
exercise package in your visual studio
so exercise consists of three major
components the first is operational data
followed by an ATM
process and then the data warehouse so
let's understand each one of them in
detail now so the first component is
operational data now what exactly it is
so an operational data or you can say an
ODS which stands for operational data
store which is a database that is used
to integrate data from multiple sources
also one key point of operational data
is analyzer master date of tow where the
data is not pass back to operational
systems it may be passed for for the
operations and the data warehouse for
reporting but it is not passed back to
the operational system so about data
warehouse will be starting in just few
more slides next there is equal process
which is very important so ETL is a
process to extract transform and load
the data so ETL is a process responsible
for putting data out of the source which
can be of any format it can give
excellent flat file and placing the hole
into a data warehouse also an ETL
process ensures that the data stored in
the warehouse is relevant it is useful
to the business users it is accurate and
it is high quality also it is easy to
access so that the warehouse is used
efficiently and effectively by the
business users so it will help the
organization to make meaningful
data-driven decisions by interpreting
and transforming large amount of
structured and unstructured data even
though ETL is a three word concept but
it is actually divided into four phases
so the first phase is capture it is also
known as an extract phase so in this
case it basically takes the source data
or metadata which can be present in any
format so the next process is scrub
subscribe basically identify errors in
your original data for checking these
errors and inconsistencies it uses some
artificial intelligence techniques to
verify the quality of the data should
verify its quality of the data and
basically ensure that the quality of the
data is met or not thirds we have
transformation the transformation is
another process where your source data
is converted to the required format you
want
the transformation is modeling or
changing your data to meet the
requirements it can be with respect
number of rows and column processing if
you want to increase the number of rows
or columns you get transform it
accordingly next final stage is load and
index so in this date it knows the data
and validates number of flows that is
processed meets the required number of
rows once your loading is done indexing
helps you track the number of rows or
the amount of data you are loading into
the warehouse so it basically checks the
data through indexing and identify the
data is inside format or not let us move
on to another major concept that is a
data warehouse so data warehouse is a
single complete and consistent tour of
data which is formulated by combining
the data from various sources and then
they combine the data from different
sources they are not simply saying just
go and take data from different sources
and combine them together it has to be a
purpose for it so we as an analyst or
consultant go ahead and see whether this
particular database is suitable to
answer any be a question or not
so much reminding that we are just going
around around talking about very similar
things but these terms are extremely
important for you so once you understand
what the data warehouse is what a bi
system is all this will become secondary
and it will naturally come to you so
data warehouse is a technique where you
pull the data or assemble the data from
various sources and combine them in
order to answer the question which
business users want so stop me if you
have any doubt these terms on any three
entity to data warehouse all right super
bait here ask me question is data
warehouse different from a database
where is the answer to a question is yes
no both no because a data warehouse is
also database if you compare the
physical representation of the database
same representation is of data warehouse
also now yes because data warehouse is a
structure of their analytics various
queries can be fired and you can get
faster query responses if you compare it
to the database so I hope you got an
answer debate
okay so he's saying he's clear alright
so now let's just quickly go ahead and
understand the architecture of data
warehouse so if you look at the diagram
it is read from left to right on the
left hand side you have your operational
data now operational data as we've
discussed before it means all the
transactional data that you make in
transaction system let's say sale system
or let's say banking system where you
can transfer money from one place to
another place so those are operational
systems they're actually making
transactions so that particular data is
kept in to your business system now this
data is picked up and I have already
talked about ETL right which basically
is a process that helps you pick the
data from the operational systems so
this arrow goes to the bigger blue box
that you can see saying that extraction
transform and load happens and then it
pushes the data into data warehouse from
data warehouse data goes into cubes sort
of structure so tube is categorized as
OLAP structure so Olaf here refers to
online analytical processing this comes
in the SSS with all your data analysis
inside don't worry guys we'll be talking
about SSL in the next session now once
you have this OLAP structure you just
have to build in your reports on it and
export it to business users and then
they can go ahead and make the analysis
so this is a typical database house
architecture so any doubts - here guys
okay so a nice clear and this thing all
good all right then next comes our
installation part now before the started
project we need to have all the
necessary tools with us now let's have a
look at different tools required to
perform exercise first we will install
it will server so as you don't see in
the slide I have a screen - attached
where I have highlighted the link and
download tab they can go directly and
download it so let me show you how it is
done so I'll go to my Google and just
type in SQL Server
so here the first leg comes up of
Microsoft so just click on it
so this is the operation that's right of
mine to solve so here as you can see
there is a download tab so just click on
it and then you will learn two different
versions available for sequel server the
first is free trial evaluation second is
developer edition and third is Express
Edition so the free trial evaluation
gives a free trial only for 180 days
next is the developer edition now this
edition deals with all the development
and test database in a non production
environment thirdly it's your Express
Edition it also deals with your
development and production but it is for
small server application so you can now
get any one of them based on your
requirements so I have downloaded this
developer edition for downloading it you
just have to click on download now once
it gets download it's a very easy
process to install we just have to click
on Next Next Next and your installation
with the dad Twinkie if you have any
problem in the download or installation
part let me know I will be happy to
assist you with the sale next there is
data tools so why do we need data tools
so as you can see in this slide it
follows the same procedure so here you
should go to this link and then download
this SQL Server data tools same three
point one so let me show you how to into
this show download data tools you just
have to type in SQL Server
so the poor thing that comes up is of
Microsoft so just go and click on it
Sohail as you can see you can download
this SQL Server data tools same Dean
point one you just have to click on it
and again to the solution process will
be the same so here this is the setup
you can go on and install it now you
must be wondering why I have downloaded
two different tools for it so it screens
over 2014 is the actual silver our DBMS
so whenever you install it you can go
and create the database or create people
into it next we have downloaded the data
tools which is used to create the NSA
project so the whole process of
extraction transformation loading
reporting will be done using these data
tools so now let us understand what is
there's a science packet and how will
you create exercise package using these
T so package is a fundamental globe
where you go ahead and code in the
exercise now code here Laurie opposed to
any programming language is the
development you do so the development is
done inside a package so exercise is
essentially for ETL and the package will
go ahead and do the ETL process now
patents will have some connections now
these connections will help you connect
to the various data sources if we have
control flow elements and data flow
elements as well so these two components
combine together to form a package now
hello your control flow element handles
your book through the workflow is you
are doing something in steps like step
one step two step three step four in
sequence of the bun and two in parallel
so the sequence is done through control
tool and then you have a place where you
do the transformation so these
transformation are handled by data flow
elements so let us move to a demo part
where we will have a look at student
information system Swindon's I will
perform ETL that is extraction
transformation and loading using
exercise package so here I am extracting
the data from a CSV file now remember I
am taking my file input a CSV which is a
comma separated file but you can take it
from any other sources wills after that
and perform some transformations to it
and then load it to database so all
these set of operations are performed
inside in size package now to put your
data for mercy
the piles first you have to create a CSV
file so let us go to notepad and create
a comma separated file and go to the
notepad plus plus so my demo is all
about student information system so the
first thing I should keep in mind that
is my student ID
Thank You manga hub shouldn't need
then not
I'm Kendall
now I included some dummy value scale
say for example student ITW one shooting
name can be say Yoshi marks let's say ap
gender is female similarly and I can go
on and feed in more detail so I already
have some so I will just copy pasted
so here if you see it I have some 500
rose data now let's see how you can
import this data into a database so
first of all I will save this let's say
in my desktop
I mean student through an information
understand
so let me open a sequence over so you
can find in all programs like the sequel
server 2014 and here it is
the poster point I create a new project
so here as you can see there are two
metal cages so the post is a scratch
template where you can perform an EPS
and the second is using Avatar so we'll
go to indigent services project so I'll
change the name to student information
the information exercise
so this is the location if you want to
change it you can then I pick one
obvious
so that garden is getting loaded
so here is to get some basic samples
they have been get an introduction so
now it's don't eat it so I'll just close
it so as you can see here we have five
different tabs here one is controlled so
then data flow parameters even handlers
and package explorer so we have already
talked about control flow and data flow
now these are something that I use
insider in a science package now
remaining I will talk about them later
and if you see here the light is slide
it shows your project name which has a
project or pattern then we have a
connection manager then I have package
which has an extension of DPS X which
stands for data transformation services
then you have the clean air so report
the data vault I have to create a
database wherein I can create some
tables so let me go to the windows panel
all programs and open sequel server
management studio so let me just open it
so here as you can see this is my
advocacy that is the silver name then
ahem databases now in databases you have
to create a new database let's say I
have Troodon warehouse
I just click on okay
so to go on databases my student a house
is created
if you see here I have tables column so
inside a table I create a new table now
so here is my CSV file now I want whole
letter to be imported so here I will
write the column name the first is your
student ID
and then a lab data type let's say n VK
50
second I will have a student named
select data type
and similarly for others
now marks can be my real value
and gender would be again and we cared
so we'll just save this table and we'll
give a nice name to it let's say student
table
so here I will go to my student ID and
create this as primary e now hope you
guys are aware with the primary key
concept so once my tables created now
let me go back to my visual studio the
already discussed about control show and
data flow now here is my exercise
toolbox there is one data flow cast so
I'll just drag and drop this data flow
cast and put a nice link to it soon it's
in your CSV file so once it is done when
I double click on this component it will
automatically go to data flow so again
I'll show you if you can see I am
hearing the droll geotab when I drag and
drop this data flow element and when you
double click on this automatic goes to
data flow so what does that mean
so here it means that control flow is a
container for data flow so now my
control to invokes your data flow
elements when my data flow I have to
extract my CSV file so I have common
here are the transformations where then
perform transformations then I have
other sources then I have to load the
data so I'll go to a the sources and
have a flat file too so here I have just
drag and drop this black pipe sauce now
as you can see there is a red cross over
here
so does this mean this means that your
component is not completed so let me go
and edit this so every prompt will need
to be connected to the actual data so we
need a connection language over here
select missions phone create a
connection manager so click on new
so here let me put some name say ssize
connection
or you can say exercise flat by
connection
I can have some description to it I just
spoke to this connection manager named
Lee and then I have to import my flat
file so again my flat point words in a
notepad so there I have to browse the
location it will say that my desktop so
it's not clear through an information
so here everything else is already
filled you don't have to change anything
next you have columns so here it is a
good preview of my table all right this
is fine then I have a preview again this
also looks fine so I click on OK and
again okay now if the notice that my Red
Cross is gone so this element is now
configured now if you close you see this
element it has two arrows the one in
view and the 100 the view now defines
the actual data that will come up from
this flat panel and the data all did
move the errors now I have to perform
some transformations on it but before
that liquid Oded our database so we have
an option here other destinations so
I'll click on it and I have a do net
destination so I'll just drag and drop
it again
now why of choosing this destination
this is because my end users is feasible
so now I have my class source and I have
my destination so as I already told you
that this view sign denotes the data now
I have to connect my class pencil to my
destination subtitles now again if you
notice this is again that Red Cross
coming while again go and edit it so
here also it asked for connection
manager but this time it's not the same
because the end user insist with shun go
to new
then I hear the mule
now it asked for so the name so I go to
my management studio and see what is the
name of my show so I will open file
connection object Explorer and see the
server in that is admin PC so I'll just
copy down here and paste it over here
next I have to choose the database so
here my database is student warehouse
and just click on it and I take the
connection now my - connection succeeded
and paper okay I mean ok ok then I have
to insert a table now if I open the
drop-down list my table name is here so
I trip on it so my table is selected
then I'll go to mappings
now mapping what will it do it will just
have my student ID - student ID
it's basically snapping the source bias
to the table that you've just created so
there we have to pop all of them she ran
into the name box we can to mark the
gender which connected to gender as you
can see I've created the connection
let's click on OK
so my Red Cross has gone now this means
that my data is successfully loaded so
let's just run this program
it feels green tip that is nice and
again nice I must have noted that my
input from platform soul has been loaded
to my destination path which has large
data that is my 500 rules are imported
from platform souls 2 and destination
path 3 we are done with the extraction
and loading path so what is left now now
let us see how drug formation is done to
it so let me go back to my management
studio here I have my table so if you
see here all the children in our new
work is so let's charge from these
student name to uppercase for this first
appropriate this table right-click and
execute this query
so my table is deleted now why are we
ablated her table because in my table I
have sent my primary key a student ID so
to avoid all the prime G key violations
I have to create the table
come back here first of all I'd leave
the connection so here if you see I have
my other sources which is extraction
that I have taken the black pencils next
I have other destination where I have
loaded the data and here comes the
transformation part also again since
common section where it has a game
transformation route so I take at the
right column mail
so here my derive color is nothing but
if we create an extra column in the
existing column data so here first of
all I have to make a connection which
says it mixes connection
now that's a ghost
so here you have to create an extra
column let's say a capital goal so for
this I have this column let's click on
this so I already have these four
columns over here strength ID should
remain mass and gender so have to
transform it to a name so I will drag
and drop put it expression now here I am
getting two options either add as a new
column or replace so add a new column
let me give a nice name to it say
opposed to the name
now if you see I have different
functions available you
so it has mathematical functions drink
functions date night functions and
animal so I like to go to the stream
function and see if there is any method
for aperitif
so you find an upper function so let me
just drag and drop to here
and inside this I have to transform a
character expression
so it'll be detail first of all I have
to drag and drop my upper function next
I have to transform a student name so I
will just drag and drop to the character
expression and hence it is done
so I click on OK then I go back to my
destination then again I go to edit so
remember we have done some mappings over
here so again my student name has been
mapped to sugar name so I have to remove
this and app to insert and upper student
name so now the upper sugar name is
napping - miss - in name now click on OK
and just sell it so as you can see my
black pants is also got a bit and
definitions also got from an extraction
transformation and loading has been done
successfully
so let us go back in my management
studio
and let's see what is choose
so next star on this and I'm just
executed so if you notice here my
student name is in capital case there is
it some extraction transformation and
loading has been done
so I hope you guys are clear with all
the depositions that I've just discussed
the ETA process if you are facing any
problem any of the concepts that I've
talked about in the session you can just
write it down in your chat box or
probably crank with me in my next
session so any question guys all right
so I don't see any questions he'll order
- thank you so much guys also this video
will be uploaded to your element and if
you have any doubt any query you can
always reach out to a support team which
is 24/7 available so by this I hope you
guys had a better understanding of
exercise well thank you prevent have a
great day goodbye I hope you enjoyed
listening to this video please be kind
enough to like it and you can comment
any of your doubts and queries and we
will reply to them at the earliest to
