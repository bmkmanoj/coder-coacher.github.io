us-based non-for-profit organization
which was established in the 1969 and
it's headquartered in Pennsylvania and
you know across the world the
certification is been widely recognized
and wanted for there are over 500,000
members across 171 countries currently
who are PMP certified now PMI is
actively engaged in advocacy for the
profession setting Professional
Standards conducting research providing
access to wealth of information and
resources they have like carrier surveys
they have chapters across various or
cities across the globe where you can
become members and have opportunities
for volunteering in India in the US and
in all the geographies
now prima also promotes career and
professional development and offers
certification networking and community
environment
one of the suggestions we always have is
that be a member of the PMI and
participate in the various events that
takes place that will help you to
connect with a lot more project managers
in different industries not only ID and
and that gives you a lot of
opportunities down the line to know
different ways people are working how
they are solving their problems of
project management and you get to
drawing each other now PMP certification
is an industry-wide recognized
certificate across the globe now project
management professional credential is
most important industry recognized
certificate for project managers
and it's credential demonstrates that
the professional has the experience
education and competency to lead and
direct project which means we have to
understand this here because what it
says is this is not a course to learn
project management the certification
proves that you are already an
experienced project manager who has the
capability so it is certifying or
endorsing your capability that you are a
good project manager as for the global
standard and that's one of the reasons
why we will see that there is a need for
experience on project management to
apply for this certificate costs now
there are two streams one is if you have
a high school diploma that is you don't
have a bachelor's degree and the other
is when you have a bachelor's degree I
would assume that we all have bachelor's
degree so bachelor's degree or global
equivalent is what you need to have if
you have that then over the last three
years then is thirty six months you need
to have four thousand five hundred hours
of project management experience to
apply for PMP exam along with that you
will also need to have 35 contact hours
which is you will get by this ah by
attending this particular we impede a
course from a director if you are not a
bachelor's degree and you are having
some diploma in that case you need to
have over the last five years seven
thousand five hundred dollars of project
management what are all the views for
having this is because a lot of the
project managers comes from non-id
backgrounds like construction and all
who are who have been there in the
construction industry for very long time
and they may be having diplomas or not
that's that's how this started that's
why it's still there now the project
what the duration must not overlap which
means that a lot of times we work on
multiple projects let's say for example
between first January to 20th of
February if
there is a project where we are working
on two different projects we cannot say
that for full two months we have been
working on both the projects we have to
say how many hours we have worked on
project II and how many hours we have
worked on column B so there cannot be
overlap it has to be separate I have got
a question I'll just take it once I
complete this slide the experience in
the project during the last eight years
what it necessarily means is that you
must have project management related
experience it is not related to the
designation you have when you will go
through the course you will understand
what all we are talking about so
basically we are talking about starting
from activities which is the very to be
done at the initiation or at the time of
landing execution monitoring and control
closure in any of the process areas if
we have worked as on any of the project
management related activities that can
be taken as a project management
activity 20% of the applications are
picked up on a random audit and in my
experience from 2005 have only seen one
person getting that audit where they
call back to the references that you
have given so when you have apply in
your form you need to give the name and
the mobile number of the person who you
are giving as a reference for your work
now that person has to verify that yes
what you have written is okay but that
as I said I have seen only one person
here in all my trainings that has taken
place from 2005 if it happens you have
to make sure that whoever whoever's name
we are giving knows what you have
written there and can vouch for it
by your question I am NOT a project
manager though I have master's and
real-time experience can I apply for PMP
certificate as I said your designation
as a project manager is not what is
looked at if you have been doing work
which is related to project management
like if you are managing some people if
you are managing some activities whether
it is at an initial stage weary of
creating a project charter or whether
you are doing some planning like
creating the project schedule and all
now all these activities will be taken
as project management activities just
remember one thing if you are a
programmer let's say in a project team
in that particular case that activity is
just a project team activity then that
is not a project management you need to
do some activity of the management level
where you are managing either a team or
you are doing some monitoring and
control not just taking information and
generating a report
where you are guiding somebody where you
are that is that is an experience which
is required as a project manager
does that answer your question okay so
if you have any specific questions you
can always send a mean to a to a kind we
will try to answer that
giving your specific situation what
activities you have done now let's take
a being a demo class let us take one
area of these studies and see how we go
ahead so the first chapter is about the
basic concepts and obviously this
project management's and we are talking
about what is a project the PMI
definition is a project is a temporary
endeavor undertaken to create a unique
product service or result so the first
thing is a project has to be a temporary
endeavor that means it has to have a
definite start date and an end date
so a software project
have a definitely neighbor we have a
start date when we start doing the
project we have a ended by which we need
to complete and implement the project
and it creates a unique product that is
your software that you will be
implementing it can be a service like if
you are doing a ERP implementation the
service is configuring the tool and
training and handing it over to the
customer now what is a result we have
seen product we have seen service so
what is a result in some cases we are
called as on a mainly on a consulting
engagement where we have to only give a
feasibility study report now that report
becomes a result that is not a product
that is not a service it is a result
if in in our day-to-day lives we also
see our children doing projects at
school which has a definite start
definite end we plan our vacation and we
go for our vacation the vacation itself
is a project and
to understand progressive elaboration
that is at the beginning of the project
we know or we have a overall idea about
what we want the scope of the project
but gradually as we start getting into
the project we know more and more about
it and accordingly we have to change our
design
our development based on the overall
scope that we have already defined we
are not here we are not talking about
the commercial aspects because for that
we need to look at the change management
and other areas which we will see when
we are into the details of the different
knowledge areas
any questions so far
you
you
okay so we will proceed
so what is we know what is project what
is project management now project
management is applying the combination
of knowledge which you will get in the
course the skills that is your
experience that you have gathered the
tools and techniques which you use and
what you will learn more during the
course to the project activities to meet
the project requirements so this is the
application of the skills knowledge and
tools and techniques for meeting the
project requirement
dick management requires or has a lot of
generic management skills a lot of
general management skills like
negotiation conflict management people
management
all these are part of general management
skills which is required on a day to day
life of a project manager now one thing
I would like to just add at this point
of time based on my experience of my
students is that one of the problems
that we face during the exams is we
start thinking in terms of what we do in
our offices in our organization
when you come to this course when you
are sitting for the exam do not think of
what you do in your office how you do it
because that might lead you to a wrong
answer you have to think only from the
perspective as specified in the p.m.
Bock as specified or as I will specify
during the class it is very very
important for you to understand this and
be conscious about it
most of the time if you start thinking
and comparing with what you do in the
office is where you will get your quick
answers wrong
now a project manager managers the
project means what he has to balance
various constraints or competing demands
to ensure that the success of the
project is achieved
the only objective of the project
manager is successfully completing the
project and when we say successfully
completing what does it mean it means
that balancing the competing factors
like scope time cost quality there are
two other factors also which has been
added which is this and resource all
these are constraints all these are
competing the ones all these requires
the project managers attention to manage
that in a proper manner we all there
will be a scope which is defined when we
start doing the things we might find
that there is more things coming up we
need to change through a proper change
management procedure there is a schedule
if there is an increase in the scope it
will impact either either or in both
cases I mean in both like time and cost
both now we have to balance those
through proper change management
practices or see if that scope is
actually required or not we have to
ensure that the product that is
delivered the service that is delivered
is as for the expectation when we see
quality quality does not mean something
different quality means that you give
what you have agreed upon
resources we don't always find all the
resources as we want we need many
experience resources but we get some
experience resource on our team we get
some freshers but we have man we have to
manage with that give them the necessary
training that is required to make them
productive it is project managers
responsibility to take care of those
things
so the project manager it is
- duty to balance and achieve the three
not often competing goals not only three
it's six basically scope time cost
quality risk and resource
you
questions
okay now a project manager manages
actually two things the project manager
has to deliver the project
and the project manager also has to
deliver the product we need to
understand the differentiation between
the two now what is the product in our
example of these software implementation
the software is the product which has to
be as per the functional requirement
specified by the customer that is your
product whereas the project is how you
will do the execute the project to get
that product out that is managing your
team managing your resources managing
within the triple constraints of the
competing demands that is your project
now in case of product
a product lifecycle and that product
lifecycle goes beyond the project life
the project like product lifecycle
starts when the project is conceived and
gets in to life so you start executing
or initiating the project your product
lifecycle starts your project life cycle
starts when you deliver and handover the
product to your customer the project
life cycle ends but now the product
still is life the product is handed over
to our operations to run it
and II will run it maybe for five years
10 years 15 years till the time the
customer does not want to use that
product anymore and once our new product
the time this product is sunsik this is
the product lifecycle and we calculate a
product lifecycle cost to understand
what is the overall expense and what
benefit we get today we are talking a
lot about benefit realization now when
we are developing the project the
benefit does not come it is during the
operation and the output of the project
the product of the project starts being
used is when we get the benefits so in
our business is we compare these things
okay
can operations come under project
management or is it a soft process
management okay operations by definition
we said project has to have a definite
start and a definite end date operations
doesn't have a definite start and a
definite in state operations is a
continuing activity and a repetitive
activity so it is not a project part of
the project management it is operations
management
and that is why in this particular slide
you will see project development is the
overall project management part of it
operations is a separate activity
so there are 47 project management
processes in the fifth edition of the PM
bak which is currently running and these
47 processes are spread across five
process groups and the five process
groups are initiation planning execution
monitoring and control and closing so
these you can also say as the five
phases of a project you initiate a
project where you assign you say that
yes this project is not going to happen
you assign a project manager you create
a project charter and take it forward
from there once you do it the next thing
that we need to do is plan
so we decide that okay we will go for a
euro vacation
decide on it and we say okay we will
have this much of fun fun
this vacation that is initiation
planning is where we start talking to
the agents to the travel agents to the
hotels and plan out where all we will
want to go where we will do what how
many days we stay and plan out or how we
go by flight by train whatever all those
is at the planning stage execution is
when we are actually going and doing the
work or where we are on vacation where
we have bought the tickets where we are
now traveling and we are moving at all
he will always see that even in such
cases we go to a hotel we don't like the
hotel maybe we change the hotel the
location is not good are we trying to go
in in train but we find that it is
better to go by car to certain
destinations we plan to visit particular
places for instance we heard that it is
better to go to some other castle or
something we can that now that is
progressive elaboration where on a
regular basis we get to know more about
the place about the work and we make
changes to our plans now when we are
doing all this there needs to be a
control a monitoring and control so the
parent will always be the father will
always be doing the monitoring in
control to ensure that you don't spend
money more than what was planned
and finally once it is done we close we
pay back all the agents we paid all the
vendors with whom we have interacted in
hotels car whatever it is and we come
back put our photos in the album put it
on the Facebook and all those that is
closing 10 p.m. I always says that once
you finish your project you should also
party with the team that is basically
for the motivation of the team for the
hard work they have put in so in each
process what we will see is there is
inputs there are some tools and
techniques to execute that process and
the process will generate some output in
a software project we have the scope we
have the contract all those will come as
our inputs to the our requirements
gathering once we do the requirements
then gathering by interviews and
conference room pilots and all these we
will then generate the output which is
your approved requirement specification
documents and the acceptance criteria
so that is how all the processes will be
the whole p.m. Bach is also arranged in
similar manner
for you to study there are n knowledge
areas which is covered in the pimba
first is the integration management
it's all the pollak areas together we
have scope management time management
cost quality management human resource
management communications management
risk management procurement management
and stakeholder management
so p.m. Pok well there's a
what is the PM box and four pm Bacchus
project management book of knowledge
that is your basic standard which is
published by PMI based on which is all
the certification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
