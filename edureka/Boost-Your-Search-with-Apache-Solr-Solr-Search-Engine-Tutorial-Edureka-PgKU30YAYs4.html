welcome you all on behalf of at Eureka
to this very informative session today I
am a Tita Aurora and I have been working
in solar Lucene and related technologies
so been here for about nine years now
and I carry experience of developing
applications in social media news and
healthcare domains so I would be taking
you through a quick introduction on how
we can build you know better
applications with the Apache Solr so let
me just quickly go about taking up what
exactly and what all we will be covering
today in this session today so at enough
for this module you would be able to
understand that term why do we need
search engines for the enterprise grade
application so why buy exactly is search
needed is what we would be talking about
there there are few objectives and the
few challenges of research engine which
we would be discussing we would be
discussing about indexing and searching
and why exactly would you need them why
exactly anyone would need them then we
will be talking about indexing and
searching how is it handled by Lucene
now for folks who are a little confused
about that the webinar was supposed to
be talking about Apache Solr but there
is something new which we have talking
about here so Apache Solr
is nothing but you know nicely groomed
up um Lusine which is again the apache
library which is the search library
basically so us Apache Solr is built on
top offer this Lusine so it handles
every bit of what you know goes inside
solar so indexing searching analyzing
the data and stuff so I would be taking
you through that step by step so how
many of us have
we used this website flickr.com let's
see how many our tech freaks him ok
olive Garcia actually in video all of us
must have used up this website and I'm
sure everyone must have seen this some
search filled out here and in this field
up we really exploited this field we
type in whatever we want and you get you
know suggestions you get what is the
most popular product in the category you
offer thee products you're looking for
so over here if I say that if we do not
have this search text box available on
this window how would this website look
like to you any guesses how would this
look like to you how about using any
e-commerce website without the search
text field would it be easy would it be
user-friendly yeah bit tedious uh yeah
right Nitin
it actually makes no sense so so the the
user friendliness and um oh yes
narration gave a very nice example car
without steering in fact this text
fields act as a steering that which
direction or which kind of product or
what kind of category of product are you
looking for so um certainly YUM right so
I mean you guys are way more bright and
I actually thought so all right I mean
if we are supposed to be using any he
commerce website and we do not have this
text field over here imagine you know
going through a you know a flat file
search you would have to go through each
document one by one and evaluating that
is this what I need no close this down
open another one is this what I need no
not really close us down another one so
it would be like a flat searching forum
anyone so all these you know fancy
features of you know putting um nice
photographs and providing you with
offers and stuff
is going to be of no use if you cannot
make them um product searchable so these
are a few of the things which make it so
essential to have this video on your
website along with that on the left hand
side if you see that we have provided
more flexibility to easy to research
that the products which are rendered on
the basis of the text which you're
searching they are bifurcated on the
basis of the price range they belong to
the brand they belong to the operating
system they work on another right hand
side you had few suggested products that
people who were looking for the kind of
product you are looking for also
consider looking these product as well
so this comes handy I mean if I'm very
very new to the e-commerce website I say
I'm looking for a quad core mobile phone
and I have few suggestions out here with
KitKat OS with you know it's a Sony
mobile phone or is there any minimum
screen specification I want to you know
provide along with my search text so
this is providing me with the author
suggestions as well along with that it
also consists to off for what are the
popular category of products which fall
under the same category or the same
product term you know bracket of the
same product which we are looking for
currently so this makes it so flexible
for anyone to look for a price or brand
or any particular feature you are
typically considering when searching for
any particular product so this could be
I mean this is the mobile you know
example which we have taken it could be
anything like you know it could be a
dress or it could be a hardware you know
essentials a hard drive or headphones
and stuff so you can easily you know
look for the product which you're
looking for only basis of price on the
basis of brands so this is all
configurable so this is all controlled
by the UM xml's and the configurations
which come handy with solar so I mean if
you look here I mean the first text
field which we have highlighted is the
text base
so text-based searching so it aids to
the text we can provide for searching
the second one which we have highlighted
is one of the powerful feature which
comes handy with solar is like filtering
the result set on the basis of say price
or brand operating system or say could
be anything so it could be you know
features as well so third one is we have
highlighted one picture which is not
really a picture but everything goes
inside in the form of a document so when
you click on this particular product you
are redirected to a screen which
consists of all the information right
now we're just you know summing up all
the information like the name B star
rating of this product say which
category it belongs to in mobile in
mobile category then the actual price
and the sale price which is offered by
the site and there are few important
features which we feel distinguish this
product from the other products so this
is how we are representing this some
product as of now however if you click
on this product you are redirected to
the document which consists of all the
information regarding this particular
product so this is how essentially a
search engine works so it makes it
really really easy for the user to trace
or find a particular product which they
are looking for excuse me
so over here it mean if we talk about
that we're talking about the search
engine or the search capabilities of an
application what exactly should it all
have like if you need to have a storage
engine to search records or documents on
the basis of text or um you know the D
free text keywords search should support
following features so first of all it
should give you the optimized results
for faster text searches so along with
that it should also provide you with a
feature that they could be a case in
which a few of the products may not have
the same feels as on the field in the
other
right so let me just quickly take an
example like talking about schema and if
you're talking about the mobile phones
here so suggest me guys
we have name of the mobile phone we have
the brand of the mobile phone we have
say price range of the mobile phone can
you guys guess any anymore rub anymore
schema fields a mobile phone os yes
processor yes yes guys Wow okay
processor and yeah screen resolution
right and camera yes so Ramius color yes
right so you can have hello our features
so uh we not needing a system which is
going to limit us so that every product
should have the user you know feels I
mean every product may not may or may
not have these um you know field values
like a normal you know a phone might not
have a camera so I could say that no
there is no camera or I might not
provide any information so if I'm
talking about the iPhone I say that yes
it has in camera and it has got um say 8
MP resolution and on the other hand I
have some very very you know basic
mobile phone which you do not have any
camera so either I can say that not
available or I can say I have I should
have a freedom that I can add or not add
any values pertaining to any field so it
should it should be flexible enough to
accommodate these kind of you know
features so if I'm pushing any document
inside the repository my you know my
document when I'm saying document it
means that I'm talking about one Lusine
document so a geyser this is this is one
you know similarity or I can say I mean
I just want to create a little
similarity for you guys to understand
how things really work with the Lusine
so
I'm sure every one of us have worked on
some our DBMS saw some database of any
any variant I'm sure most of us have
worked on some sort of DB Yes No maybe
right okay anything says yes okay all
right all right okay so I hope everyone
understands that whatever goes inside a
database you know goes inside in a form
of credit card right everyone is aware
of that as well so everything goes
inside a database in the form of a
record in this similar manner in Lucene
everything goes inside in the form of a
document right so likewise you can have
a small similarity that term in database
we have something like column column and
we define that what type of column it is
going to be what are the limitations if
it is going to be say primary key or not
so this is how we define the schema in
our database table in the similar manner
when we talk about Lucene or solar for
that matter we have the xml's so they're
going to control that what although
means that this basically defines that
term a record is going to consist of say
n columns and what are going to be the
type in the similar manner we have
leucine and everything goes inside in
the form of a document and every
document is going to have a fleet and
the fields are going to have the
properties in the similar manner we have
the column properties in our database is
that clear guys I mean I'm sure this is
going to help to understand how things
really work so do not get confused when
I say you know document document a lot
many times because what I'm essentially
talking about is a record so everything
in database which was a record is you
know set or called a document in Lucene
or solar ok so so it should support
sorting of documents as well because
obviously we would
wanting them to you know look and sort
the documents on the basis of how user
would want to along with that it should
be very scalable which means that it
should be optimized for reads because
the data which has some on the website
is read more more number of times so I
mean I'm not sure about the figure but
the flip card Amazon these sides I'm
sure are visited by hell lot of people
every day
so you're um you know hardware your
software your application should be
robust enough to handle you know so so
many you know number of reads along with
that it should be document oriented as
well these search engine
why because everything which is
displayed to the user is displayed in
the form of a document so everything
comes handy when we have a document or
say a record-based term system
hiren right so everyone is a line to
these things that we should have a
system which supports all of these
features any other feature you guys feel
a certain in should have apart from the
features which we have listed here yes
no maybe no okay so I guess so are we
good enough so um this is one of the
examples from the clear tripper spatial
search so special search if I mean you
guys are not aware of just to you know
right right
so we we are going to perform a search
on see of math and every document
essentially which I mean what I mean is
a record so every every you know record
is going to consist of a lot longer
field and we are going to represent that
particular lat/long field on the map so
we can also search on the basis of the
position or the location of that
particular document so if you look here
this is the spatial search UI which is
provided by clear trip and if you look
here and there are lot of for you know
pointers over here and it is basically
representing all these hotels out here
on the map
so if you if you look for a particular
hotel it is going to you know tell you
that what is the landmark or how far is
this 4l from the place you're in what is
the star rating what is the location
what is the price range for a night rate
of this hotel so this is how the spatial
structure looks like so this is again
this is a the add-on feature of which
came handy um with solar after a rum
solar for okay have you guys seen this
UI before the spatial search UI have you
guys ever needed things to be you know
displayed on to the maps there's these
the pointer help yeah okay cool so okay
alright so just to give you a brief
interest because solar is built on top
of leucine so I'm not sure it firm if
you guys are not aware of where this guy
here anyone who can relate to this
this guy with something else other than
leucine the dark cutting yeah hadoop
okay alright okay okay alright wow what
an overwhelming response okay everyone
is aware of um who this guy is great so
okay so so this guy is indeed the
creator of the Hadoop as well so I mean
he created a leucine way back I think in
2004 and he had named um leucine
isoleucine after his wife's name so
leucine is very very very power
Java search library that lets you easily
add or you know the incorporating the
search capability of on the textual
search on your application so you can
add the information retrieval and the
text searching on your application using
this library so you can be rest assured
about how robust this library is going
to be that this is used by LinkedIn
Twitter I guess Amazon as well and their
many more I mean when you get in this
presentation I'm sure I'm sure
make sure that you click on this link
and you will see that there's so many
you know robust names which are actually
using Lucene because it is highly
scalable and it is high performing
indexing API so it lets you create the
powerful and accurate and efficient
search algorithm on the basis of your
needs and again it is claw
cross-platform as well and it has open
source so you're not supposed to be
paying anything against the licensing
cost it is 100% pure Java so that
vouched for um why it is um you know
supported on most of the platforms in
fact every platform for that matter so
implementation is also available in
other programming languages as well
which are index capable so how does that
really goes about I mean we have been
talking about okay all right so you guys
know a lot of things I mean I'm pretty
impressed with most of you folks women
right so we have been talking about
indexing and searching quite a lot
because these are the true say um you
know essential features which should be
there when you're talking about a search
engine so how does indexing really works
about so like look here I mean we have
taken example of a three documents iam
so we have the first document which
consists of the text I like at Eureka
courses
and the document - Sadie - is the
document ID it says that EDI Rekha
teaches Bagheera courses the third
document III is saying that at Eureka
helps learn new technologies easily now
if you look here we have we have this
created all of the information which was
provided so if you submit these three
documents for indexing we are going to
have this type of matrix so this matrix
is nothing but ax inverted index matrix
so we're going to talk about it in a
little while so over here if you see we
have split all the documents in the form
of firm key terms so if you look here we
we have picked at Eureka and courses
from the first document then we picked
out at Eureka teachers big data from the
ante courses from the second document
and essentially the similar terms from
the core document as well so if you look
here we have ignored few terms here like
I and like and new easily these these
things we have ignored so we would be
discussing why we have ignored that as
well so we are essentially storing the
crux of all the documents here and we
are maintaining a matrix in the format
that we are going to maintain something
like if you know we are storing all the
terms your key terms
Eureka is there in document d1 d2 and d3
courses the word as in as a key term is
there in d1 and in d2 as well along with
that when we two spoke about the third
thumb teachers it is there in document -
only similarly big data and helps sorry
big and data was there in document -
however helps was there in documents
free only so this is a kind of index
which Lucene builds up at its end so
whenever somebody is looking for at
Eureka for that matter it is going to
quickly look into not what
all documents consist of this word so it
is going to go through not going to go
through all the documents I mean it is
not going to go through like the flash
searching mode it is not going to you
know go through the entire content of
each document it is going to simply
refer to this matrix this table only and
it is going to quickly see that this
term was there in which all documents so
this is something very very easy to look
up I mean you guys can see that I mean
the difference in parsing through all
the documents or you know quickly
referring to this matrix which one is
going to be easy any of you obviously
the matrix one yeah yeah right so so
this this matrix is something which
Lucene looks for when it is looking for
searching so during indexing process it
is actually analyzing it is going to
take or strip all the content which is
you know it decided on the basis of
algorithms which you are using so it is
going to discard a common you know
English words like I like new easily so
it has ignored these words it has not
indexed these words so this is on the
basis of the algorithm which on which
sir we were analyzing or indexing this
data so we're going to quickly talk
about that as well so let us not confuse
you guys with introducing too many terms
on each light so we have spoken about
the document to be consisted of a number
of fields so the number of fields is
pretty flexible in case of leucine so
say a I mean unlike the our DBMS the
schema is not very rigid so if if you're
trying to push any data in a table in a
DBMS which would not consist of a
particular field value so it is it is
not going to you know successfully push
the data inside that table
however the case is not same in case of
leucine so if at all you have that field
Aaron it is going to store that the
fields value if you do not push any
value for that particular field it is
simply going to consider that this
document did not consider do not consist
of this field
so in this similar manner we have a
document which is a set of fields and it
goes inside the system which consists of
the analyzer so analyzer as the word
suggests is going to analyze deacons
content so the analyzer is going to can
consist of the process wherein all the
data is basically parsed and on the
basis of the algorithm you have a few
analyzers which come handy with the
Lucene library itself however if you
want you can build up something similar
to what term you know as per your choice
so in our course in and this course
which we're going to start soon the
Apache Solr course
so we basically talk about the code as
well so we're going to talk about how
you can use the analyzers which come
handy with solar however if you want you
can also build up your own analyzer so
the analyzer is basically the process
which is going to analyze your content
and this is going to say accept the
content in the form of a document and
then it is going to render you the
tokens the tokens are then pushed to the
index writer and then the indexes are
written inside the directory okay
is that clear guys do you have any
confusions over here meanwhile I see
that there are a few questions over here
open ask me that those Lucene works on
the basis of inverted indexes yes
correct
arpund yes so it works on the inverted
indexing only and I'm going to quickly
discuss what exactly is inverted
indexing in case you know all of us are
not aware of what inverted indexes are
so Manish says a matrix is easy but
tough to maintain ah not really Manish
um this this is a this comes pretty
handy when you talk about say the
documents which are coming in the form
of the stream and you have indexes which
are rendered by the analyzer itself it
would simply go and update the existing
metrics so it is not really tough I mean
as an how you think so along with that
okay open has another question can you
please show the example of for the
control flow okay I will be showing you
a few examples as well okay
how does analyzer and next right roll
look like and where is the directory
stoat yes okay I would be taking you
through that as well
Rakesh yes you can develop your own
custom analyzer as well I'm not sure if
this is going to make any sense I'm just
going to give you a little tweak on what
exactly do we do in the classes here so
if you look here we have this I mean we
generally discuss this you know very
very explicitly in the classes which we
do so if you look here these are few of
the Java examples in which we spoke
about how you can use that in your code
so the course it does not really you
know talks about what solar is and how
can you you know make it work how can
you accommodate it what are the features
and stuff we give you the practical
knowledge as well so we let you know
that how exactly can you use this
particular feature or you know this the
power off for the things which are
developed and delivered by solar in your
existing application so we we completely
guide you through the entire workflow so
I'm not sure for some reason I'm not
able to pull out the code yeah actually
right open it is actually stuck so let
me take a few slides and we'll come back
to this and I'll show you we have
developed a few analyzers impacter I
gave her this as the one of the
assignments to my classes that they were
actually one thing
user you know few features from some
some analyzer and some other you know
few other features from some other
analyzer so they asked me that can we
use more than one analyzer in any
process so the process goes in such a
manner that we can use only one type of
say D D tokenizer and we can use
multiple filters so I would be coming up
to that in a little while so that this
is going to be more clear when we see
that in action basically so I think
everyone is clear about how the flow
goes like right we have documents we
analyze the content we create the tokens
out of it and we push the tokens to the
index writer which writes all the tokens
to the directory so directory is nothing
but a file system basically so if you
look here these are this is my instance
these solar instance so this is another
very handy feature our charm comes with
the solar is that it supports multiple
collections or multiple cores on a
single instance so until I'm just
running a single instance on my machine
however I can bifurcate or I can
separate out II collections on the basis
or form how in how is exactly you know I
I want it to be so like I have I have
bifurcated my you know data in for
course collection one collection to edge
Eureka and hotels so if you would like
to see that how data is basically stored
so this is the index files which are
generated which are created by Lucine
and solar so this is how the data is
stored so I mean you would have to
specify that what all fields goes inside
the indexes what all does not goes
inside the indexes so essentially this
is how the indexes would look like I
think that is one of the questions from
a few folks out here yeah
okay so along with that okay Nathan says
just analyze take your love stop words
yes indeed Nitin we in fact I mean I I'm
not sure actually I should have set a
few things out here if you if you look
here this is while indexing so you can
use the analyzer if you look here I I
should have actually shown you this and
Eclipse would have been more clear then
but anyway the while writing the content
to the directory we can analyze the
content only paces off or the choice of
analyzer you want
likewise for here we are using the
standard analyzer which has certain
features so I'm not going to go into who
you know depth of what standard analyzer
does we have simple analyzer we have
Stopford analyzer we have porter
stemming analyzer so you have lot of
analyzers available with Lucene okay and
we are going to provide all the examples
of using that through code in the real
classes so right now I'm just wanting to
give you the idea of how things go about
yeah I indeed you are right this is
pretty similar to what happens in Hadoop
as well okay wrong will also ask me this
question and hi if I have to specify
what goes inside the indexes then what
does analyzer do
okay so I guess I'm not sure at all if
you notice here we created a file here
okay and if you if you look here we are
creating the indexes here and we can
choose okay let me just quickly
okay this is the document and these are
the feels if you look here these are the
few of the fields here so if you look
here rummel we can mention the
properties as feel store yes or no and
index true or false so we can specify
that through code as well and through
configurations as well so I'm not going
to go in details about this so because
we have fixed a Giunta forum this webmin
are some not going to I would I'm not
going to actually take you to the
details as such so what I'm wanting to
do here is that I'm actually wanting to
give you a nice idea of how things go
about so these things are covered
basically in the actual course which we
run so we have spoken about how do you
guys indexed in the loop seem however at
the query time as well we have the
analyzers available so likewise there is
a small example I would like to you know
give you that say I have got a school
website on and I want through this card
if anyone is using any abusive language
or abusive text searches on my system so
I'm not actually going to let that
search go through on my system on my
application data in fact I'm going to
just quickly discard that you know text
or at the query time itself so I can
make my custom analyser which I can use
every time of query and then I can sort
out the data on the basis or the
analysis or the kind of subroutine I
have provided my code so if you look
here we have the query parser over here
which translates your text from the end
into the arbitrarily complex query for
searching so the query parser is going
to also work on these similar concept of
an analysis it is also going to be
analyzed through the analyzer and it is
going to break this into the text flag
fragments then it is going to create the
query object from this and then it is
going to push this query object through
the index searcher which is going to
push this query object to be indexed
rectory and it is going to fetch out the
results as an how they're required okay
is that clear guys okay so chief says
does filtering use indexes or only
searches I think Steve you're talking
about the face hitting filter which we
were talking about here am I correct
yeah so yes it is also going to use the
index is only in fact another very very
important thing in Luci means that if
you are you know skipping up field say I
have this similar the similar scheme I
had and I'm saying that I am indexing
name I'm indexing brand
I'm annexing price but I'm not indexing
OS in processor another thing to take a
key note of here is that if I'm not
indexing a particular field I would not
be able to search through that field so
essentially to support this search
feature that particular field value is
supposed to be indexed okay is that
clear yet
does that answer your question so in a
way the filtering which we are applying
on the data sets it essentially has to
go through the process of indexing again
this is another very very nice feature
which comes handy with the solar is that
scoring scoring is nothing but the you
know we are assigning the beta CH to few
documents in the result set so I'm sure
everyone must have seen the paid ads on
Google Plus so when we are looking for a
particular say text we have a few
documents which come you know as we
talked mostly results in the in the
Google how have you ever seen that the
basically the advertisements have you
ever seen that anyone of you yeah yes no
maybe
okay say guest Ajit has seen it okay
Nathan is also seeing Raj has also seen
uh Europe and right so ecommerce website
are basically making money out of it by
endorsing few brands so this is in fact
the you know but the the sole motto of
it that we are providing a vantage on a
particular say a search of keyword so if
this can be done on the on the index
time and on the query time as well so at
the time of indexes creating the indexes
we can always say that feel dot set
boost and we can boost that particular
field so on the boost is basically used
because in solar let me just take a
quick example over here over here so
maybe this is going to be more clear if
we take a quick example over here so if
you look here I'm saying the star dot
star which is more like select star from
your database or table so this works in
a similar manner so you so I have 42
documents which are here and I have this
document which is coming first so there
is a reason this document comes in the
first place is that this document if
there is a score which comes along with
each document so it is actually this
particular document is having more score
than the rest of the documents and that
is why it is coming first in the there
in the search results
so scoring is doing this similar thing
scoring is helping you have more score
the score of the document is basically
boosted so you can achieve that's at the
time of indexing and at the time of
query as well so we can do that so we
basically have a few we have a full you
know lecture which is dedicated to the
scoring in the any course so Lucene
allows influencing search result I
boosted by you know using boosting every
time of indexes and at the time of query
as well so this is going to affect the
score of the doc
and hence affects the position of that
document in these search results yeah I
hope the idea is clear anyone has got
any more any confusion about this
okay nothing says what if all are okay
you mean all the documents are boosted
that's what do you mean to say okay so
anything if all the documents are
boosted or let me say an example in
which um you have two documents which
have these similar score I think that is
going to be more appropriate example all
the documents cannot be boosted as such
so all the documents cannot have all the
terms which are there right yeah okay so
I got a question
so in that case these two documents are
going to appear I mean if they're going
to have for the same score this is okay
honey I'm not sure what are you asking
what give what do you want to make sure
so let me just quickly take a per
Nathan's question okay again hurry if
you're trying to push the same document
again and again if you if you look here
let me just quickly take up this
question with them so if you see here
this is the ID of that document and if
you look here just to answer your
question you have I'm just trying to
push a document over here and say I have
ID 1 2 3 and say the title or same name
name is my system is very very slow
today I wonder why so I'm just trying to
submit this document it went ahead ok
however if I say that the ID of this
document is 1 2 3 name is hurry and next
time I push the another document which
has the ID 1 2 3 but the name is sinneth
on it is going to go through again okay
so if I am looking for something I say
that I'm looking for a name as honey
what do you guys think am I going to
have any results here because the idea
was same do you think we are going to
have any results over here no actually
if you're going to push the same
document it is going to overwrite that
same document again and again however if
you're going to look for a little you're
going to find the document with the name
Nathan because that particular document
was overwritten is the idea clear it is
actually going to overwrite the same
document again and again but the
processing is going to be an overkill so
there is no mechanism by which we can
okay so let me just quickly cover a few
concepts okay I would I would to hold on
any questions as of now okay let me just
quickly wrap up the presentation and now
we can now say that term we can take a
few questions one sub I completely
designated topics is that fine thanks
because I mean I even I do not want to
stretch over the time which is assigned
for the session okay so okay okay
let me just see okay so this is how my
search system would basically look like
okay so this is essentially how my
source system looks like all the parts
which are highlighted in blue are the
part of the leucine and the rest of the
parts are outside the leucine okay so
the first step is going to be obviously
the indexing we have been talking about
it so second step is going to be the
analysis we are going to analyze the
document and then the third step is
going to be searching which is the
practical usability of the data which we
have indexed all right so
over here if you see that there could be
many ways in which I could acquire be
content all the content which is
acquired from being save web or PDF or
Word documents or any document
repository I'm going to build a document
which my Lucene you know a system
understands so I need to have a document
which essentially needs to consist of
field and value pairs okay then I'm
going to push this particular document
into the subroutine where I'm going to
analyze the content of this document and
then I'm going to index the document on
the basis of all the tokens which I
retrieve out of this analysis so I hope
everyone is clear about this that my
analysis phase is going to give you the
tokens the tokens which are generated on
the basis of this subroutine which is
asked for the analyzer I'm using ok so
then after this all the indexes all the
tokens it goes through the indexing
procedure and it goes inside the indexes
so this is this red thing is going to be
where my indexes are going to be stored
this is similar to the directory indexes
which I have just shown you ok so over
here the user is going to be provided a
search UI and it is going to UM say look
I'll search for a particular field or
say a particular document or a
particular product for that matter so it
is going to analyze this particular
query and it is going to build a query
out of this then it is going to run this
query we're on the indexes this rendered
mixes and then these indexes are going
to return the results as in for the
query which you have provided likewise I
just sent the query on my UI saying name
is equal to hurry
her name is equal to Nitin so this
basically converts the query in the form
at which the index store can understand
then it runs the query and it renders
the results on the same UI through which
the user has fired the query ok so this
is how the normal search system works
like ok so over here if you see indexing
is the
processing of the original data into
highly efficient cross reference lookup
in order to facilitate rapid searching
okay then we are actually analyzing
search engine does not index text
directly right we have first spoken
about it the text is basically broken
into series of individual atomic
elements which are called tokens so I
think I've just said I've just explained
that then we have the procedure of
searching which is the process of
consulting the search index and
retrieving the documents matching the
query which you have given through the
UI and they're sorted are not sorted on
the basis of how they're expected or how
they're requested from the UI okay
