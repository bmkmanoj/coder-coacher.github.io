few input output streams that is how to
take input an output using the Java
classes moving on input is the data of
what we give to the program right you
enter the input using your keyboard you
just the program asks you to enter a
particular value or data you just tend
to use your keyboard to enter it and
that is called input that value is
actually used in that program itself
output is the data what we receive from
the program in the form of result that
is displayed on the console window in
case of Java programs what a stream
stream represents flow of Dada Dada is
sequence of data okay so entire sequence
of the data is actually considered to be
a stream now to give input we use input
stream and to give output me use the
output stream moving on how input is
read from keyboard so this is a small
deck diagram to explain how the input is
taken from the keyboard this is a system
dot in class okay it represents keyboard
to read data from keyboard it should be
connected to input stream reader by
using the input stream reader what
happens it trees data from keyboard and
sends that data to the preferred Rita
it reads data from the input stream
reader and stores data in buffer it got
methods so that data could easily be
accessed right so this is the diagram
these are actually linked like their
system dot in inputstreamreader and
bufferedreader whenever you create an
object of bufferedreader you write
buffer a division that you pass the
inputstreamreader and within that you
pass the system dot air you can the
consist the last night we just and it's
understood what is input that is what
the user gives to the program what is
output that we receive on the console
window word is stream stream is the flow
of data and for taking input we use
input stream and for receiving output we
use output stream so this is the first
slide I hope you are clear with
technical and everyone a few piece right
down on the chat window are you guys
clear with that till now this diagram as
well
ulaana
and when we use bufferedreader what does
this linking connected to or send dollar
to shows what it depicts okay okay
everyone says yes that's correct
moving on reading input from console
input can be given either from a file or
keyboard input can be read from console
in three ways the first one would be the
perforator the second one is string to
tokenizer and third one is the scanner
okay so these are the three classes
using which you can take the input from
the console so we'll go through them
each one each one of them one by one and
first of all we'll understand what is a
bufferedreader how to use it so first of
all you use the class that has preferred
reader you create an object of thought
equals to new operator bufferedreader
within that as it is connected you write
inputstreamreader
okay you connect it to inputstreamreader
and within that you pass system not n
that will be the keyboard whatever you
press it comes to inputstreamreader like
that okay now if you let's say you want
to take an integer values you write int
age equals to bufferedreader dot read
read is a method that is present with
bufferedreader using that you can take
integer value from the user
string name bufferedreader dot readline
read line will fetch a string from the
user okay so this is a method within
that method you can use these functions
which are present with bufferedreader
okay so let's go to eclipse without
wasting any time and we'll see the code
for bufferedreader so first of all I
come to inputbufferedreader code so this
is the code right here that has perfer
reader before rita you create the object
new bufferedreader within that you pass
an input stream object and in that you
pass system dot n as an attribute right
so you have created an object of
bufferedreader using which you can take
the input from the user
now I print a statement that is enter
your name first of all second as I
create a string variable in that I'm
storing bufferedreader dot readline that
means whatever string that has been
entered by the user is getting saved
named varible similarly I asked for the
age and age has been saved like this
that is integer dot parseint
bufferedreader dot readline i can anyone
of you tell me why I'm using this write
this why I am writing in teacher dot
parseint all of you please write down on
the chat window why do you think I'm
using integer dot parseint nichols a
snipe cos strain okay so what is the
necessity of typecasting over here I
stuff stays convert string to indeed
you're exactly correct what is happening
this bufferedreader dot readline
actually gives the output as the return
type is a string value but you want to
save it in India so what you are doing
you are passing that string value to
integer value my young says to convert
the string to India yoga say string to
end convert Emma traced by default
system takes everything in the form of
string okay that's good
whatever it is not possible I didn't get
your question Nikhil I I think you're
trying to say that if it is not possible
to pass a string into an integer right
okay so for that what you can do let's
define one more age one viable that is
int age one equals two bufferedreader
dot read so this is one more option for
you read will give you an output as an
integer type so it is quite easy to use
I wanted to show you that you can also
pass the string and save it in the h58
variable okay so I hope it is clear now
now when I run this code enter your name
so first of all I will give my name that
has been eat now enter you age my ages
90 I'm gonna eat 19 years 90 years old
okay I come back to my presentation once
again and I can't distinct tokenizer
that is the second class using which I
can
take the inputs it can be used to accept
multiple inputs from console in a single
line whereas bufferedreader accepts only
one input from a line okay so you can
only pass one name is read as fast if
you want to pass it so in one line you
can pass only one name using the perfect
reader but if you are using a string
tokenizer you can pass many inputs but
just by using a delimiter what will be a
delimiter it could be a comma sign right
so it uses a delimiter space or comma to
make the input into tokens now you write
buffer data you create a buffered reader
so that you can take the entire line as
an input after that you define the
tokenizer object and you pass the entire
string that was taken by the buffered
reader you pass common or wherever it
finds a comma it understands that this
is the first token and after the comma
there is a second token present right so
this way you can take multiple inputs so
similarly name in age is being taken so
I go to eclipse and I open the program
for the tokenizer itself
so I have it here now bufferedreader you
create the object quite simple to
understand enter your name and eight
separated by commas so gamma will be the
delimiter and whenever this tokenizer
finds a comma it understands that before
the comma it is one value after the
comma sign there is the second value so
once you create the object you pass the
string that you have saved using the
buffer data here and you pass the comma
that will be a acting as a delimiter now
I create a string object name equals to
tokenizer dot next token okay so it will
save the name first one into the name
again you declare a variable age because
you know that this after the comma there
will be H present so you write in deejay
dot pass and tokenized a dot next token
now why I am passing it to integer right
now it is because it will return me an
object type okay so I have to convert it
sorry this will be also a string type
that I will be passing it back and
saving in the age variable when I run
this code enter you name it separated by
comma so write finis comma 24 and I
press enter so I am Vineet 24 years old
okay I run this code once again alright
we need this time I give my complete
name with a space shuttle ready comma 24
anything okay now tell me if I just
enter it will I receive an exception or
it is fine
will it take the output and print the
entire result or it will give me an
exception all of you please write down
on the chat window last time I only
passed beneath I should have say that's
fine nickel there is no error when say
that's right absolutely it has tried I
run this code once again let's try one
more thing the same Winnie shut away the
comma I give a space now 24 now will it
give me an error please write down on
the chart
every one nickel says no man says no
Ashraf says no what about the rest of
you yogi says no how much what do you
think may wish promises I don't think so
okay then so I'll just press ENTER and
this time I receive an exception by
exception because you are passing the
delimiter s comma but in the console
when what you did after the comma you
pass a space so it is not taking that
space okay it does not take it like that
hence it is giving an exception now if I
put a space here I save the file I run
this code once again this time again I
pass we need comma space 24 now what
happens this time will it give me an
error
everyone please write down on the chart
from the bank says no other stuff says
no error okay everyone say is no error
exactly correct this time it won't give
me any area any error
one more try okay so that's that is how
your doubts will get cleared what if now
will it give me an error it will be an
exception why because in the delimiter
you pass the space okay so whenever it
finds a space now it is also thinking a
delimiter but the delimiter is still not
complete right so it gives you an
exception so these are a few properties
that are present Nikhil you'll have to
try it on yourself putting the multiple
telemeters absolutely it is a string I
placed it now running part will be your
duty okay consider it as an assignment
and you'll get the answer and
theoretically yes you can use it okay I
hope it answers your query Nikhil
okay so string cognize s done now we
come to scanner it accepts multiple
inputs from file or keyboard and divides
into tokens it has methods to different
types of input integer flawed strength
long double by via tokenizer
does not have okay so stanner is the
best way by using which you can take
input from the user it has got different
methods for different kinds of data
types right as well as as you receive
expressions in case of tokenizer there
are no such exceptions in case of
scanner okay you won't be receiving any
exceptions that is the runtime
exceptions okay because in the compiled
time the wrote a code is Brooks code in
case of tokenizer
but when you run it you receive an error
but not in case of scanner so I will
show you the code for scanner now it is
the best way if you have to take an
input so I come here quite simple first
printing a string that is enter your
name and age string name is equal to
scanner dot next and 80 coldest nano dot
next end
okay next will give you a will take a
string value and next end will take and
teach a value now before that you have
to define a scanner that is scanner
scanner equals to new scanner you have
to pass system dot end okay so that you
are mentioning the input is being taken
from the keyboard when I run this code
control f11 and there you name an age so
right we need enter 90 I am vineeth 90
years old okay so this way this looks
quite easy than the other ways of taking
input from the user all of you what do
you think is that clear to you a side
down on the chat window so I says yes
simple mike says yes Isis and clear yogi
says yes Nick help run off says yes
first of says yes it's clear and condor
per se is yes Emma says yeas proteases
best way of inferred exactly correct
Pradeep
poteete sorry not pretty moving on
writing outputs to console yeah now we
have learned how to take inputs alright
the output on console and we have been
using from the de Burgh not a system dot
out dot print what this is spread is
this correct
all of you tell me we haven't been using
this print we are using println always
system dot out dot println what is the
difference between them that is system
dot out dot print and print Ellen so I
says yeah prints on the same line Emmett
says right now mine says yes hash table
says newline Nichols a their prints
without newline who now says prints
println friends next line that each says
Linda and means friend and goes to the
next lie exactly fatigue that's the
exact definition println means it first
prints the statement and then goes to
the next line
okay it is not so that that it will
first go to the next line and then trade
ok kun that per se is it gives a new
line exactly
now you using the right you can pass the
ASCII values okay when you pass this so
actually the a spy value is being passed
to the right it takes the integer values
and I will be printed using right so
let's see the demonstration as well let
us present an output me okay so system
hello println so what I'll do I'll just
change it to print I'll just copy the
entire sentence and roll seek and vv3
statements okay Emmett says I agree with
Kathy
sorry predecessor here two objects of
system class out and println please
explain it are you talking about println
and this right please write down on the
chart window Katya yes okay till that
time I'll just show you I run the score
I receive hello hello hello why is it so
and then eh
okay because I'm not using println as
soon as I use println in da last one
what will happen a will come in the next
line that is hello hello hello and
finally a comes to the next line okay
ready say system dot out dot println out
and println are objects na no println is
a method in which you pass the input and
that returns an output on the console
window ok print println these are all
different methods that takes some input
and gives you output moving on now this
is a small flowchart for you ok you can
go through it as as soon as I upload the
presentation or whenever you receive the
video ok so these this is just the flow
diagram input output streams it can be
divided into byte oriented screens and
unicode character is the character or
byte when you are dealing with part you
can use input string in that you have
got classes like file input stream data
input stream and for the output string
of God file output stream and that
output stream when you come to in case
of characters what happens you have got
reader and writer input stream reader to
read the data output stream reader to
bring the characters on the output
string that is consoled
okay so you can go through the diagram
and search understand it ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
