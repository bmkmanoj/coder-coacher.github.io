welcome you all on behalf of a tariqa to
this very informative session today I am
Anita
Arora and I have been working in solar
Lucine and related technologies so been
here for about nine years now and I
carry experience of developing
applications in social media news and
healthcare domains so I would be taking
you through a quick introduction on how
we can build you know better
applications with the Apache Solr so I
would not waste any more time I'll just
go ahead and I believe it from everyone
is aware of how you know 80-acre works
so we give you live online classes and
you have the class recordings which are
available through LMS which is the
learning management system which is
managed by ETA come and we have twenty
four by seven posts class support so if
you have any questions you can reach out
to the trainer and if at all you have
any more questions while practicing or
you know going through the content or
the recording which is made available to
you you can always reach out to our rum
support guys they're pretty you know
fast and pretty good then the material
which we are going to provide you with
it comes a handy with the you know all
the modules and the there are quiz which
check your level of learning and the
quizzes are separated and are bifurcated
module wise and just to ensure that
you've learnt what was intended to be
delivered we have the project work and
after completing that you have the
certificate which is verifiable you can
always you know
and you know look for a job or use it to
you know showcase your talent so this is
how you know things go about with it
Eureka so um about this particular class
today because of generally the class sir
is some you know for three yards and it
happens to be on Saturdays and Sundays
every week and you have eight classes
which means that it would be a
month-long course and it's a three yards
of class so today we just have you know
one are so I want to utilize as much as
I can to make sure that what exactly
solar is all about and why is it so much
sought-after and why is a lot of
companies are you know diverting towards
this technology and we would be taking a
few questions as well so just to give
you a brief you know semantics how do we
go about the session is that I would be
taking you through these lights and
would be you know knowledge sharing them
with you guys as in how my experience is
so if you have any questions and at any
given point of time you feel that you
confused about something or you want to
ask something or you have any questions
which are related to solar or any other
thing which is covered on the slide
please feel free to post up the
questions on your question window so we
would be taking a you know logical break
once I complete few topics because the
time is very very limited so I will be
taking up all the questions which you
have posted on your questions window so
let me just quickly go about taking up
what exactly and what all we will be
covering today in the session today so
at enough for this module you would be
able to understand that term why do we
need certain tools for the enterprise
grade application so why buy exactly
search needed is what we would be
talking about there there are few
objectives and the
challenges of research engine which we
would be discussing we would be
discussing about indexing and searching
and why exactly would you need them
why exactly anyone would need them then
we will be talking about indexing and
searching how is it handled by leucine
now for folks who are a little confused
about that the webinar was supposed to
be talking about Apache Solr but there
is something new which we have talking
about here so Apache Solr is um nothing
but you know nicely groomed up um Lusine
which is again the apache library which
is the search library basically so
Apache Solr is built on top of this
Lusine so it handles every bit of what
you know goes inside solar so indexing
searching analyzing the data and stuff
so I would be taking you through that
step by step then we would also be
talking about what exactly is solar and
what are the powerful features what
makes it so sought after by people in
the industry we would be talking about
how their eyes told and obviously
because um we would be talking about
data so there has to be some schema so
what kind of schema solar supports and
what are these structures and what are
the basic features and how do we achieve
the big data or no sequel needs using
the solar cloud so I guess that is a big
question as of now we would also be
talking about how we can leverage these
capabilities which come handy with solar
and we can use um the you know
compactness and the power of you know
Hadoop along with the solar so I guess
we all understand that what Hadoop is
needed for and what solar is needed for
and then we would be briefly talking
about the job opportunities or for the
Salar developers so I would also be
taking up a small demo as well so let me
see how quickly we can you know some of
things so do we have any questions
regarding
the the plan which we have discussed as
of now any any confusions anything else
okay
Nikhil says all clear so I believe and I
didn't you you must have got a kind of
glimpse that what exactly we would be
you know covering today so what all are
you going to take home today after the
session so believe me guys let's make it
very very interactive session I would be
asking few questions as well during the
sessions and feel free to post up any
questions you would like I'm not going
to ignore any questions which is going
to make sure that we do not break the
logical flow of the session so how many
of us have really used this website
flickr.com let's see how many are tech
freaks
Jim okay all of hacia actually indeed
though all of us must have used this
website and I'm sure everyone must have
seen this some search field out here and
in this field up we really exploit this
field we type in whatever we want and
you get you know suggestions you get
what is the most popular product in the
category you offer the products you're
looking for so over here if I say that
if we do not have this search text box
available on this window how would this
website look like to you any guesses how
would this look like to you how about
using any e-commerce website without the
search text field would it be easy would
it be user-friendly yeah
bit tedious uh uh yeah right Nitin
it actually makes no sense so so the the
user friendliness and um oh yes
narration gave a very nice example car
without steering in fact this text
fields act as a steering that which
direction or which kind of product or
what kind of category of product are you
looking for so um
certainly YUM right so I mean you guys
are way more bright than I actually
thought so
all right I mean it but if we are
supposed to be using any e-commerce
website and we do not have this text
field over here imagine you know going
through you know a flat file search you
would have to go through each document
one by one and evaluating that is this
what I need
No close this down open another one is
this what I need no not really close us
down another one so it would be like a
flat searching forum anyone so all these
you know fancy features off you're not
putting um nice photographs and
providing you with offers and stuff is
going to be of no use if you cannot make
um um product searchable so these are a
few of the things which make it so
essential to have this field on your
website along with that on the left hand
side if you see that we have provided
more flexibility to easy to the search
that the products which are rendered on
the basis of the text which you're
searching they are bifurcated on the
basis of the price range they belong to
the brand they belong to the operating
system they work on and on the right
hand side you have few suggested
products that people who were looking
for the kind of product you are looking
for also consider looking these product
as well so this comes handy I mean if
I'm very very new to the e-commerce
website I say I'm looking for a quad
core mobile phone and I have few
suggestions out here with KitKat OS with
you know it's a Sony mobile phone or is
there any minimum screen specification I
want to you know provide along with my
search um text so this is providing me
with the auto suggestions as well along
with that it also consists of for what
are the popular category of products
which fall under the same category or
the same product you know bracket of the
same product which we are looking for
currently so this makes it so flexible
for anyone to look for a price or brand
or any particular feature you are
typically considering when searching for
any particular product so this could be
I mean this is the mobile you know
example which we have taken it could be
anything like you know um it could be a
dress or it could be a hardware um
you know essentials a hard drive or
headphones and stuff so you can easily
you know look for the product which
you're looking for on the basis of price
on the basis of brands so this is all
configurable so this is all controlled
by the UM xml's and the configurations
which come handy with solar so I mean if
you look here I mean the first term text
field which we have highlighted is the
text bates text based searching so it
aids through the text we can provide for
searching the second one which we have
highlighted is one of fer the powerful
feature which comes handy with solar is
like filtering the result set on the
basis of say price or brand operating
system or say could be anything so it
could be you know features as well so
third one is we have highlighted one
picture which is not really a picture
but everything goes inside in the form
of a document so when you click on this
particular product you are redirected to
a screen which consists of all the
information right now it is term you
know summing up all the information like
the name the star rating of this product
say which category it belongs to in
mobile in mobile category then the
actual price and the sale price which is
offered by the site and there are few
important features which we feel
distinguish this product from the other
products so this is how we are
representing this some product as of now
however if you click on this product you
are redirected to the document which
consists of all the information
regarding this particular product so
this is how essentially a search engine
works so it makes it really really easy
for the user to trace or find turn on a
particular product which they are
looking for hmm
excuse me so over here if we if we talk
about the
we're talking about the search engine or
the search capabilities of an
application what exactly should it all
have like if you need to have a storage
engine to search records or documents on
the basis of text or um you know the D
free text keywords so it should support
following features so first of all it
should give you the optimized results
for faster text searches so along with
that it should also provide you with a
feature that there could be a case in
which a few of the products may not have
the same fields as the fields and the
other product right so let me just
quickly take an example like talking
about schema and if you're talking about
the mobile phones here so suggest me
guys we have name of the mobile phone we
have brand of the mobile phone we have
say price range of the mobile phone can
you guys guess any anymore rub anymore
schema appeals a mobile phone os yes
processor yes yes guys Wow okay
processor and yeah screen resolution
right and camera yes
so Ramius color yes right so you can
have hello features these days I mean so
uh we not needing a system which is
going to limit us so whether that every
product should have these erm you know
feels I mean every product may not may
or may not have these um you know field
values like a normal you know phone
might not have a camera so I could say
that no there is no camera or I might
not provide any information so if I'm
talking about the iPhone I say that yes
it has in camera and it has got term say
8mp resolution and on the other hand I
have some very very you know basic
mobile phone which you do not have any
camera so
I can say that not available or I can
say I should have a freedom that I can
add or not add any values pertaining to
any field so it should it should be
flexible enough to accommodate these
kind of you know features so if I'm
pushing any document inside the
repository my you know my document when
I'm saying document it means that I'm
talking about one
Lusine document so Oh guys this is this
is one you know similarity or I can say
I mean I just want to create a little
similarity for you guys to understand
how things really work with the Lusine
so I'm sure everyone of us have worked
on some ID BMS saw some database of any
any variant I'm sure most of us have
worked on some sort of VB yes no maybe
right okay Nathan says yes okay all
right all right
okay so I hope everyone understands that
whatever goes inside a database you know
goes inside in a form of credit card
right everyone is aware of that as well
so everything goes inside a database in
the form of a record in the similar
manner in Lucene everything goes inside
in the form of a document right so
likewise you can have a small similarity
that term in database we have something
like column column and we define that
what type of column it is going to be
what are the limitations if it is going
to be say a timely key or not so this is
how we define the schema in our database
table in this similar manner when we
talk about Lucene or solar for that
matter we have the xml's so they're
going to control that what alderman that
this basically defines that term a
record is going to consist of say n
columns and what are going to be the
type in the similar manner we have
leucine and everything goes inside
form of a document and every document is
going to have a fleet and the fields are
going to have the property is in a
similar manner we have the column
properties in our database is that clear
guys I mean I'm sure this is going to
help to understand how things really
work so do not get confused when I say
you know document document a lot many
times because what I am essentially
talking about is a record so everything
in there a base which was a record is
you know set or called a document in
leucine or solar okay so so it should
support sorting of documents as well
because obviously we would be wanting
them to you know look and sort the
documents on the basis of how user would
want to along with that it should be
very scalable which means that it should
be optimized for reads because the data
which is on the website is read more
more number of times so I mean I'm not
sure about the figure but the flip card
Amazon besides I'm sure are visited by
hell lot of people every day so you're
um you know hardware your software your
application should be robust enough to
handle you know so so many you know
number of reads along with that it
should be document oriented as well
these search engine why
because everything which is displayed to
the user is displayed in the form of a
document so everything comes handy when
we have a document or say a record base
term system hiren right so everyone is a
line to these things that we should have
a system which supports all of these
features any other feature you guys feel
a certain in should have apart from the
features which we have listed here yes
no maybe
No okay so I guess are we good enough so
um this is one of the examples from the
clear trippers fascial search so special
search if I mean you guys are not aware
of just to you know right right so we
are going to perform a search on say a
map and every document essentially which
I mean what I mean is a record so every
every you know record is going to
consist off a lot longer field and we
are going to represent that particular
of lat/long fields on the map so we can
also search on the basis of the position
or the location of that particular
document so if you look here this is the
spatial search UI which is provided by
clear trip and if you look here and
there are lot of for you know pointers
over here and it is basically
representing all these hotels out here
on the map so if you if you look for a
particular hotel it is going to you know
tell you that - what is the landmark or
how far is this 4l from the place you
are in what is the star rating what is
the location what is the price range for
a night rate of this hotel so this is
how the special searcher looks like so
this is again this is some the add-on
feature of which came handy with solar
after a rub solar for okay have you guys
seen this UI before the special search
UI have you guys ever needed things to
be you know displayed onto the maps does
this pointer help yeah okay cool so
okay all right so uh just to give you a
brief introduction first because solar
is built on top of loosing so I'm not
sure it firm if you guys are not aware
of where this guy here anyone who can
relate through this this guy with
something else other than loosing the
dark cutting yeah hadoop okay alright
okay okay alright wow what a
overwhelming response okay everyone is
aware of um who this guy is great so
okay so so this guy is indeed the
creator of the Hadoop as well so I mean
he created a leucine way back I think in
2004 and he'd named Lugh seen as a
leucine after his wife's name
so leucine is a very very powerful Java
source library that lets you easily add
or you know the incorporating the search
capability or form on the textual search
on your application so you can add the
information retrieval and the text
searching on your application using this
library so you can be rest assured about
how robust this library is going to be
that this is used by LinkedIn Twitter I
guess Amazon as well and their many more
I mean when you get this presentation
I'm sure I'm sure
make sure that you click on this link
and you will see that there's so many
you know robust names which are actually
using leucine because it is highly
scalable and it is high performing
indexing API so it lets you create the
powerful and accurate and efficient
search algorithm on the basis off for
your needs and again it is claw
cross-platform as well and it is open
source so you're not supposed to be
paying anything against the licensing
cost it is hundred percent pure Java
so that vouched for why it is you know
supported on most of the platforms in
fact every platform for that matter so
implementation is also available in
other programming languages as well
which are index capable so how does that
really goes about I mean we have been
talking about ok all right
so you guys know a lot of things I mean
I'm pretty impressed with most of you
folks women right so we have been
talking about indexing and searching
quite a lot because these are we to say
um you know essential features which
should be there when you're talking
about a search engine so how does
indexing really works about so like look
here I mean we have taken example of a
three documents IAM so we have the first
document which consists of the text I
like at Eureka courses and the document
to say d2 is the document ID it says
that Eddie Rica teaches Big Data courses
the third document e3 is saying that
edge Rico helps learn new technologies
easily now if you look here we have we
have this created all of the information
which was provided so if you submit
these three documents for indexing we
are going to have this type of matrix so
this matrix is nothing but ax inverted
index matrix so we're going to talk
about it in a little while so over here
if you see we have split all the
documents in the form of firm key terms
so if you look here we we have picked at
Eureka and courses from the first
document then we picked out at Eureka
teachers big data from the under courses
from the second document and essentially
the similar terms from the third
document as well so if you look here we
have ignored few terms here like I and
like
and new easily these these things we
have ignored so we would be discussing
why we have ignored that as well so we
are essentially storing the crux of all
the documents here and we are
maintaining a matrix and leaf format
that we are going to maintain something
like if you know we are storing all the
terms your key terms and Eureka is there
in the document d1 d2 and d3 courses the
word as in as a key term is there in d1
and in d2 as well along with that when
we two spoke about the third term
teachers it is there in document two
only similarly big data and helps sorry
big and data was there in document two
however helps was there in documents we
only so this is a kind of index which
Lucene builds up at its end so whenever
somebody is looking for ed Eureka for
that matter it is going to quickly look
into that what all documents consist of
this word so it is going to go through
not going to go through all the
documents I mean it is not going to go
through like the flash searching mode it
is not going to you know go through the
entire content of each document it is
going to simply refer to this matrix
this table only and it is going to
quickly see that this term was there in
which all documents so this is something
very very easy to look up I mean you
guys can see that I mean the difference
in parsing through all the documents or
you know quickly referring to this
matrix which one is going to be easy any
of you obviously the matrix one yeah
yeah right so so this this matrix or
something which Lucene looks more when
it is looking for searching so during
indexing process it is actually
analyzing it is going to bake or strip
all the content which is you know
decided on the basis of algorithms which
you are using so it is going to discard
common you know English words like I
new easily so it does ignore these words
it does not indexed these words so this
is only business of the algorithm which
on which sir we were analyzing or
indexing this data so we're going to
quickly talk about that as well so let
us not confuse you guys with introducing
too many terms on each light so we have
spoken about the document to be
consisted of number of fields so the
number of fields is pretty flexible in
case of Lucine so say a I mean unlike
the our DBMS the schema is not very
rigid so if if you're trying to push any
data in a table in a DBMS which would
not consist of a particular field value
so it is it is not going to you know
successfully push the data inside that
table however the case is not same in
case of Lusine so if at all you have
that field Aaron it is going to store
that fields value if you do not push any
value for that particular field it is
simply going to consider that this
document do not consider du/dr consists
of this field
so in this similar manner we have a
document which is a set of fields and it
goes inside the system which consists of
the analyzer so analyzer as the word
suggests is going to analyze the concer
content so the analyzer is going to can
consist offer the process wherein all
the data is basically parsed and the
only basis of the algorithm you have the
fewer analyzers which come handy with
the Lucene library itself however if you
want you can build up something similar
to what you know as per your choice so
in our course and this course which we
are going to start soon the Apache Solr
course
so we basically talk about the code as
well so we're going to talk about how
you can use the analyzers which come
handy with solar however if you want you
can also build up your own
a laser so the analyzer is basically the
process which is going to analyze your
content and this is going to say accept
the content in the form of a document
and then it is going to render you the
tokens the tokens are then pushed to the
index writer and then the indexes are
written in inside the directory okay
is that clear guys do you have any
confusions over here meanwhile I see
that there are a few questions over here
open ask me that those Lucene works on
the basis of inverted indexes yes
correct
arpan yes so it works on the inverted
indexing only and I'm going to quickly
discuss what exactly is inverted
indexing in case you know all of us are
not aware of what inverted indexes are
so Manish says a matrix is easy but
tough to maintain ah not really a Manish
I mean this this is a this comes pretty
handy when you talk about say the
documents which are coming in the form
of the stream and you have indexes which
are rendered by the analyzer itself it
would simply go and update the existing
metrics so it is not really tough I mean
as in how you think so along with that
okay open has another question can you
please show the example off for the
control flow okay I will be showing you
a few examples as well okay
how does analyzer and next right roll
look like and where is the directory
stoat yes okay I would be taking you
through that as well Rakesh yes you can
develop your own custom analyzer as well
I'm not sure if this is going to make
any sense I'm just going to give you a
little tweak on what exactly do we do in
D classes here so if you look here we
have this I mean we generally discuss
this you know very very explicitly in
the classes which we do so if you look
here these are few of the Java exam
in which we spoke about how you can use
that in your code so the course does not
really you know talks about what solar
is and how can you you know make it work
how can you accommodate it what are the
features and stuff we give you the
practical knowledge as well so we let
you know that how exactly can you use
this particular feature or you know this
the power off for the things which are
developed and delivered by solar in your
existing application so we completely
guide you through the entire workflow so
I'm not sure for some reason I'm not
able to pull out the code yeah actually
right open it is actually stuck so let
me take a few slides and we'll come back
to this and I'll show you we have
developed a few analyzers impacter I
gave her this as one of the assignments
to my classes that they were actually
one thing to use you know few features
from some some analyzer and some other
you know few other features from some
other analyzer so they asked me that can
we use more than one analyzer in any
process so the process goes in such a
manner that we can use only one type of
say the the tokenizer
and we can use multiple filters so I
would be coming up to that in a little
while so that this is going to be more
clear when we see that in action
basically so I think everyone is clear
about how the flow goes like right we
have documents we analyze the content we
create the tokens out of it and we push
the tokens to the index writer which
writes all the tokens to the directory
so directory is nothing but the
filesystem
basically so if you look here these are
this is my instance these solar instance
so this is another very handy feature
our term comes with the Solaris doctor
it supports multiple collections or
multiple cores on a single instance
so I feel I'm just running a single
instance on my machine however I can
bifurcate or I can separate out the
collections on the basis are from how in
how has exactly you know I I want it to
be so like I have I have bifurcated my
you know data in for course collection
one collection two edge Eureka and
hotels so if you would like to see that
how data is basically stored so this is
the index files which are generated
which are created by leucine and solar
so this is how the data is stored so I
mean you would have to specify that what
all fields goes inside the indexes what
all does not goes inside the indexes so
essentially this is how the indexes
would look like I think that is one of
the questions from a few folks out here
yeah okay
so along with that okay Nitin say is
does analyze take care of stock words
yes indeed nothing we in fact I mean I
I'm not sure actually I should have set
a few things out here if you if you look
here this is while indexing so you can
use the analyzer if you look here I I
should have actually shown you this in
Eclipse would have been more clear then
but anyway the the while writing the
content to the directory we can analyze
the content on the basis of all the
choice of analyzer you want
likewise for here we are using the
standard analyzer which has certain
features so I'm not going to go into you
know
depth of what standard analyzer does we
have simple analyzer we have Stopford
analyzer we have porter stemming
analyzer so you have lot of analyzers
available with Lucene okay and we are
going to provide all the examples of
using that through code in the real
classes so right now I'm just wanting to
give you the idea of how things go about
yan de to a lot this was a pretty
similar to
what happens in Hadoop as well okay
Rael also asked me this question and hi
if I have to specify what goes inside
the indexes
then what does analyzer do okay so I
guess I'm not sure Rahul if you notice
here we created a file here okay and if
you look here we are creating the
indexes here and we can choose okay let
me just quickly okay this is the
document and these are the fields if you
look here these are the few of these
fields here so if you look here Raul we
can mention the properties as feel store
yes or no and index true or false so we
can specify that through code as well
and through configurations as well so
I'm not going to go in details about
this so because we have fixed agenda for
this webinar so I'm not going to die
void I'm not going to actually take you
to the details as such so what I'm
wanting to do here is that I'm actually
wanting to give you a nice idea of how
things go about so these things are
covered basically in the actual course
which we run so we've spoken about how
do you guys indexed until you've seen
however at the query time as well we
have the analyzers available so likewise
there is a small example I would like to
you know give you that say I have got
the school website on and I want through
this card if anyone is using any abusive
language or abusive text searches on my
system so I'm not actually going to let
that search go through on my system on
my application data in fact I'm going to
just quickly discard that you know text
or at the query time itself so I can
make my custom analyser which I can use
at the time of query and then I can sort
out the data on the base block the
analysis or the kind of subroutine on
have provided my code so if you look
here we have the query parts are over
here which translates your text from the
end into the arbitrarily complex query
for searching so the query parser is
going to also work on the similar
concept of analysis it is also going to
be analyzed through the analyzer
and it is going to break this into the
text frac fragments then it is going to
create the query object from this and
then it is going to push this query
object through the index searcher which
is going to push this query object to
the index directory and it is going to
fetch out the results as in how they're
required okay
is that clear guys okay so chief says
thus filtering use indexes or only
searches I think's really talking about
the face sitting filter which we were
talking about here
am i correct yeah so yes it is also
going to use the index is only in fact
another very very important thing in
lucina's that if you are a you know
skipping a field say I have this similar
the similar scheme I had and I'm saying
that I am indexing name
I'm indexing brand I'm indexing price
but I'm not indexing OS in processor
another thing to take a key note here is
that if I'm not indexing a particular
field I would not be able to search
through that field so essentially to
support this search feature that
particular field value is supposed to be
indexed okay is that clear let's read
does that answer your question so in a
way the filtering which we are applying
on the data sets it essentially has to
go through the process of indexing again
this is another very very nice feature
which comes handy with the
is that scoring scoring is nothing but
the you know we are assigning the
advantage to few documents in the result
set so I'm sure everyone must have seen
the paid ads on Google Plus so when we
are looking for a particular say text we
have a few documents which come you know
as we talked mostly results in the in
the Google how have you ever seen that
they're basically the advertisements
have you ever seen that anyone of you
yeah
yes no maybe okay say guess so Jeet has
seen it
okay Nathan is also seen watch is also
seen uh yup and right so ecommerce
website are basically making money out
of it by endorsing a few brands so this
is in fact the you know the the sole
moto of it that we are providing a
vantage on a particular say a search
keyword so if this can be done on the e
on the index time and on the query time
as well so at the time of indexes
creating the indexes we can always say
that feel dot set boost and we can boost
that particular field so on the boost is
basically used because in solar let me
just take a quick example over here over
here so maybe this is going to be more
clear if we take a quick example over
here so if you look here and saying the
star dot star which is more like select
star from your database or table so this
works in a similar manner so you so I
have 42 documents which are here and I
have this document which is coming first
so there is a reason this document comes
in the first place is that this document
there is a score which comes along with
each document so it is actually this
particular document is having more score
than the rest of the documents and that
is why it is coming first in the layer
in the
search results so scoring is doing this
similar thing scoring is helping you
have more score the D score of the
document is basically boosted so you can
achieve this at the time of indexing and
at the time of query as well so we can
do that so we basically have a few we
have a full you know lecture which is
dedicated to the scoring in the Uni
course so Lucene allows influencing
search result guy boosting by you know
using boosting every time of indexes and
at the time of query as well so this is
going to affect the score of that
document and hence affects the position
of that document in the search results
yeah I hope the idea is clear anyone has
got any more any confusion about this ok
nothing says what if all are ok you mean
all the documents are boosted is what do
you mean to say ok so anything huh if
all your documents are boosted or let me
say an example in which um you have two
documents which have this similar score
I think that is going to be more
appropriate example all the documents
cannot be boosted as such so all the
documents cannot have all the terms
which are there right yeah ok so I got a
question
so in that case these two documents are
going to appear I mean if they're going
to have were the same score this is OK
sorry I'm not sure what are you asking
what can what do you want to make sure
so let me just quickly take a per
Nathan's question ok again hurry if
you're trying to push the same document
again and again if you if you look here
let me just quickly take up this
question it them so if you see here this
is the ID of the document and if you
look here just to answer your question
you have I'm just trying to push a
document over here and say I have ID 1 2
3 and say the title or same name name is
my system is very very slow today I
wonder why so I'm just trying to put
some at this document it went ahead okay
however if I say that the idea of this
document is one two three name is hurry
and next time I push the another
document which has the ID one two three
but the name is say nothin it is going
to go through again okay so if I am
looking for something I say that I'm
looking for a name as hurry what do you
guys think am I going to have any
results here because the ID was same do
you think we are going to have any
results over here no actually if you're
going to push the same document it is
going to overwrite that same document
again and again however if you're going
to look for a little you're going to
find the document with the name Nathan
because that particular document was
overwritten is the idea clear it is
actually going to overwrite the same
document again and again but the
processing is going to be an overkill so
there is no mechanism by which we can
okay so let me just quickly cover few
concepts okay I would I would to hold on
the questions as of now okay let me just
quickly wrap up the presentation and now
we can now say that term we can take a
few questions
once I completely designated topics is
that fine guys because I mean I even I
do not want to stretch over the time
which is a sign for the session okay so
okay okay let me just see okay so this
is how my search system would basically
look like okay so this is essentially
how my search system looks
all these parts which are highlighted in
blue are the part of the leucine and the
rest of the parts are outside the
leucine okay so the first step is going
to be obviously the indexing we have
been talking about it so second step is
going to be the analysis we are going to
analyze the document and then the third
step is going to be searching which is
the practical usability of the data
which we have indexed all right so over
here if you see that there could be many
ways in which I could acquire the
content all the content which is
acquired from being saved web or PDF or
Word documents or any document
repository I'm going to build a document
which my Lucene you know a system
understands so I need to have a document
which essentially needs to consist of
field and value pairs okay then I'm
going to push this particular document
into the subroutine where I'm going to
analyze the content of this document and
then I'm going to index the document on
the basis of all the tokens which I
retrieve out of this analysis so I hope
everyone is clear about this that my
analysis face is going to give you the
tokens the tokens which are generated on
the basis of this subroutine which is as
per the analyzer I'm using okay so then
after this all the indexes all the
tokens it goes through the indexing
procedure and it goes inside the indexes
so this is this red thing is going to be
where my indexes are going to be stored
this is similar to the directory indexes
which I have just shown you okay so over
here the user is going to be provided a
search UI and it is going to say look or
search for a particular field or say a
particular document or a particular
product for that matter so it is going
to analyze this particular query and it
is going to build a query out of this
then it is going to run this query we're
on the indexes this rented mixes and
then these indexes are going to return
the results as in
worthy query which you have provided
likewise I just sent a query on my UI
saying name is equal to hurry
her name is equal to Nitin so this
basically converts the query in the form
at which the index store can understand
then it runs the query and it renders
the results on the same UI through which
sure the user has fired the query okay
so this is how the normal search system
works like okay
so over here if you see indexing is the
processing of the original data into
highly efficient cross-reference lookup
in order to facilitate rapid searching
okay then we are actually analyzing
search engine does not index text
directly right we have first spoken
about it the text is basically broken
into series of individual atomic
elements which are called tokens so I
think I've just said I've just explained
that then we have the procedure of
searching which is the process of
consulting research index and retrieving
the documents matching the query which
you have given through the UI and they
sorted are not sorted on the basis of
how they're expected or how they're
requested from the UI okay so from here
we have we have understood that what
exactly is loosing on top of which we
have solar so we understand that what
runs you know under the hood off for
solar right so from here we would be
discussing what are the features which
are provided as ad on on the features
which are provided by loosing okay so
what exactly solar solar is nothing but
our open source enterprise search server
so you can also say that it is a web
application I would say it is a no
sequel database sober as well so it uses
the Lucene search library and it extends
it further to provide very very powerful
features like face attained highlighting
special searching and stuff so we would
be quickly seen that as well so solar is
very very useful because it exposes
everything in the form of a restful Web
services so if you see here the the
query is the web service the the restful
api which it has exposed so which makes
it very very easy for us to look through
the data which we have indexed right so
so larell gives you that are okay and it
exposes the many other restful services
as well so we're going to quickly you
know see through what all things come
handy with soul earlier so if if you see
view this is another hominem I'm
actually running another you know okay
another say a web service which is also
exposed by solar this is the UI which
comes handy with the solar so this is
the web service which is exposed browse
which you know then there's this nice UI
for you guys so you have this UI which
is basically the admin console this is
the admin console so you have a lot of
features here you have the dashboard
which tells you that what is the
configuration of your system on this way
you are running this particular instance
you have the logging feature available
then you have the core admin so this
level of logging is something you can
control
you have the gmx monitoring which is
also supported through solar then you
have the core admin which is going to
control that how many calls codes I
think I've just discussed that it
bifurcates the data storage so that is
the essential you know feature which
comes handy with solar that you can
distribute your data set in the form of
the collections so you can have various
cores on your rum solar instance okay
then you can also tweak in true what
kind of fur tower properties this
particular instance has you can also
select the core you would like to work
on from here the core selector okay and
if you have just seen
I was actually looking into one of 40
cores here so you have again okay what
is happening with my system okay so you
have the cores here so when I selective
collection one here you have the
overview of this particular core you can
analyze the schema of that particular
core you can import data from some other
database through this feature you can
push in the documents through this UI so
all of these are the restful services
which are exposed by solar ok also you
can query through HTTP GET and receive
the text results in the form of XML JSON
CSV or binary results so as an how
they're required by you so this is all
only this is offer me this is the UI
okay so putting the the documents inside
a particular core is nothing but
indexing okay I guess we are all clear
about this thing do we have any
confusions regarding this okay Ellen
says the score is equal to collection oh
well open that is again totally on the
use case which you have so if you want
to have a separate collection for each
of the category of product you have yes
you can say that my my collection one
code is going to have the products from
the mobile category say my collection
two is going to have the products from
my laptop category something similar to
that okay block H there is the solar
also provides crawler kind of thing a
rocket I think essentially you're
talking about how do we basically
extract data from various formats is
that what you're asking am i right
is that right Rakesh so okay if that is
your question then yes we have the extra
we have the content extraction handler
which comes handy with salar only so i
am going to quickly take example of that
as well meanwhile i see that
they've already reached a nine o'clock
which was actually basically the time of
this you know webinar but I'm going to
extend a little bit if you guys are
going to bear with me is a finitely
extendable extend for say 15 minutes I'm
going to quickly wrap up the webinar
yeah okay
okay so look and say is that do we
create a core according to the
department anything again that is
totally on the basis of your needs so if
you want to say index the employees data
which belong to the different
departments yes you can build the course
on the different departments as well
okay all right so I'm going to quickly
cover the key features so again solar
comes with all the features which come
handy with Lucene along with that it
provides you with the advanced full-text
search capabilities as well so we have
just seen a quick example of that we
pushed in a document and immediately we
could query that document as well so
this gives you a very nice you know
real-time neoreul ten searches so along
with that it comes handy with optimized
for very very high volume of web traffic
so considering that it has been so
sought after so you can understand that
how optimized this is for handling the
high volume of web traffic along with
that it provides you these standards for
open interfaces like XML JSON and HTTP
along with that it comes handy with the
HTML administration interface I have
just shared with you the admin console
as well the server stats can be
monitored through gmx so we have a
complete you know say a dedicated one
and a half hour you know session on that
as well how do we go about you know
doing this as well any real course we
have near real-time indexing which is at
at adaptable with XML configurations I
think I have just taken an example for
that when I pushed a document inside and
we could immediately retrieve it in the
text results as well it is linearly
scalable Auto index replication is also
provided so these all features are there
in the solar cloud which came after
solar for so these are all the companies
or I would say the brands were
charge you know using solar so I think
everyone can see that all he respected
and reputed brands are using solar so
brands like Apple NASA AT&amp;amp;T Cisco
everyone seems to be using it so this is
a the very very extensive architecture
so have you been in the classes of solar
I would have taken at least an hour to
describe what this architecture is all
about
so because I'm anyway running short of
time so I'm just going to quickly tell
you that these are the you know a REST
API which I was talking about these are
essentially called the request handlers
in the solar array terminology so we
have admin select spell we can have the
custom request handlers as well so for
that we would have to write our own
servlets then we have your request
writers which is basically you know
telling you that what is the format of
the request which comes to the solar so
then we have the update handlers here
which again this you know kind of
distinguish between the various content
types which it can handle along with
that it has the search components which
are essentially the advanced features
which you know come along with solar
like the query search component the
highlighting spelling faceting more like
this is all like the auto suggestion or
auto correction feature then we have the
clustering debugging stats
these are all these search components
which come handy with the the solar
distributed search is again when we're
talking talking about the solar cloud
this takes care of the distributed
search so this talks about how the data
has been replicated on various charts
and how how the leader and the rest of
the nodes are managed so we have this
feature of ready mainly available in the
solar for so that essentially has its
own instance of a zookeeper which may
sure that what all you know shards are
there and which node has been a bit
charred and then which is the leader
node or for wood child and and stuff
like that so again because we're
supposed to be taking a little brief
about how things go about I'm going to
quickly you know give you a nice you
know tweak into you know the
architecture then we have these schema
and configuration so again this is
something I would like to show you so we
saw the data directory which consists of
indexes here however if you look into
another directory here configuration
directory these are the two most
important configuration files which are
there the schema XML anti-solar
config.xml the schema XML is going to
describe that what all fields can go
inside them while indexing the data and
his solar conflict is basically going to
manage how things are what all search
handlers are there and um if you look
here the query response writer and you
can also define the clustering which
Alwar on which on the basis of which
algorithm the clustering is done
basically okay so all of these
configurations are maintained by this
these two configuration files the solar
config.xml and the schema XML so I think
that they're pretty clear by the name
itself they have then we have the update
processors so signature logging and
indexing are the processors which come
handy with it along with that you have
the extract handler as well the content
extraction which comes along with the
solar so apache tika is one of the
libraries with which you can you know
parse the data from the documents which
come from various sources in know
various formats just a minute guys
okay I'm having a nice you know really
bad sore throat okay so then we can't
the data import hallelujah so the Stata
import handle can handle he contained
from various sources like your sequel
database your RSS feeds then you have
the index replication again this part is
handled by the solar cloud okay and then
you have the advanced features like face
taking filtering search caching
highlighting analysis and query parsing
which are also the part of the
architecture and over here if you see we
have been talking about that solar
extends the architecture of Lucy any
features which come handy with Lucene so
over here you can see that the essential
the basic features are provided by
apache Lusine only however Solar has
extended the architecture of Lusine okay
this is the search process so I think we
have discussed about this as well so the
QT is going to provide you with the what
is the query type okay
then it is going to redirect you to the
stipulated term request Handler so if
you look in the configuration file here
okay let me just say request Handler
only so if you look here these are the
request handlers so these are going to
decide that if you're going to push your
query or push your run request once
select it is going to redirect your
request to that particular servlet okay
so this comes handy with them all the
configuration so you can choose your
custom solet's as well if you have any
complicated or complex features you want
to incorporate the death type is going
to basically tell you that what quaid
Parcel are we going to use along with
that the query filter is going to define
that what all feels you would like to
see in your search results
okay so response rider again now we can
also specify the number of rows we would
like to see you on a particular you know
say search results we can specify that
from
which job you know index we would like
to start then drink the results if Q is
nothing but the filter query which is
performed on the results which are
returned by me main query then WT is the
response writer which describes like
what does he type in which you would
like to see the results okay so over
here if you see I can choose the type of
my results as well likewise I'm actually
wanting to see the results in XML format
I can do that as well so over here if
you see these are the type of result
sets which are supported by solar so
likewise if you're working on Python
Ruby or PHP applications you can
directly say that I can directly use the
results in the format the results are
rendered on the UI okay I think we have
pretty much covered the velocity UI as
well so just in case you guys are still
wanting to have more insight into it so
I'm going to quickly say that this is
similar to the search box which we have
here
but this is going to be the more
interactive you know this thing the UI
so if I say that I am looking for say
Samsung it is going to provide me the
autocorrection of the field which is
already there in me indexes and it is
going to render all the results of the
documents which are already there then
it is going to provide me with a nice
face of selves as well here so if you
look here this is the category of all
the faces which come handy these are the
query faces we can also filter requiring
on the basis of the ranges so these are
the complex features which come along
with the solar so you can incorporate
all of these features in your
application as well okay then we have
these special searches as well so this
applies to all the documents which have
the point defined under them so if you
look here all the documents which have
any points define here they
and you may have this location shown in
the inside here so this is another
beautiful feature it provides so it
comes with all the nice features you
could think of the searching face
sitting highlighting an autocomplete
along with each your special searching
so I think you can take the binary offer
solar and you can play around with this
UI I think by now I'm sure every one of
us are clear about what face the thing
is it is nothing but grouping these
search results in the various categories
so these categories could be defined as
well and these are all custom defined on
the basis of the documents which are
pushed in
okay so searcher are basically
represents it with the index terms and
along with that the numerical count of
like how many documents are there any
particular place it is there so this is
all which comes handy with the the UI
offer these solar so this makes it very
very easy for a user to explore these
search results and it also helps you
narrowing down the exact search results
which you are looking for okay so over
here I think you can see that it's
looking under the books category I can
have faces on the language price say
binding as well or the delivery time as
well so this is how my face thing works
like I think everyone of us are aware of
for how this works yeah so face it in
the oven I'm stressing more on face
sitting because we have this very nice
feature out here so this is basically
done in order to narrow down the results
so that the customer could reach to the
exact document they're looking for so
along with that I would quickly take up
what all nice features we have on the
apart a cloud so we talked about the
features like fault tolerance high
availability so we know that these these
features are there in all the big data
applications so this then the solar
comes along with the capability in which
you can you know experiment with the how
you can start or the solar and the solar
cloud mode and you can have multiple
know
on there on this so this gives you the
you know efficiency in the combat of the
default tolerance system and the highly
available system so it is very very
flexible and handling the distributor
searches and indexes so if you look at
few of the things here these are so this
is the new configuration file which
comes along with my solar installation
so it is going to define that where as
my data stored and what is this thing to
limit what is the take time of each node
okay and this is going to maintain the
zookeeper data as well so this is where
all my things are maintained and you
don't have to use any external feature
for it
this comes handy with the zookeeper
instance however if you want to use any
external zookeeper you can do that
you can essentially give the path off
for the external zookeeper you are
providing okay so documents can be sent
to any server in the same fashion and
then if it is a write request it is
going to be redirected to the leader
node however if it of the ring is
request it is going to be redirected to
any replica okay so zookeeper is going
to figure out which one is the leader
node which one is it replicas so if we
have the read know early the request
coming in it can redirect the request to
any of the replicas however if we have
any write requests we would redirect the
request to the leader node so this is
all managed by the zookeeper instance
which comes along with E so our cloud so
this is how the architecture of solar
cloud looks like we have millions of
documents here and we have millions of
user here this is the zookeeper instance
which comes handy with the Salar
installation so this is centrally going
to manage everything I am listing out
three instances here because anyway my
highly available system is not going to
rely on one zookeeper instance so we are
going to take the possibility if these
zookeeper instance is going to go down
so we are going to have more than one
instance is just to ensure the high
then we are going to have the two
servers over here so each of my server
is going to have say multiple shots and
multiple shot or multiple I mean in each
we can have multiple nodes and each node
could have more more than one shot as
well okay so then we would have a leader
of each node here and then we would have
these replication in the other servers
so this works in a similar manner we
have the sharding conceptor works in and
then we have the web services which
would be used to query or send data to
these two servers are exposed by these
solar cloud so these race web services
are exposed in the XML JSON and HTTP
format so these are sent to the load
balancer which is going to make sure
that which server should take up the
request so I just saw some up there
summed up what are the what are all
these capabilities offer the solar which
comes along with e so our cloud so along
with that I'm sure because I feel that
all of you have got the background of
Purdue how can we leverage these
capabilities which come handy with solar
with using by using Hadoop so I guess we
all understand that Hadoop is something
which works on the MapReduce framework
and it provides you with the efficiency
in the format of storage so what you can
do is you can Tweaker these solar
capabilities by using or storing your
indexes on Hadoop so with this you can
have all the nice features which come
handy with solar and you can have the
flexibility and the robustness of Hadoop
in your application because solar is
going to provide you with fast and
efficient powerful or text searching
capabilities which comes handy with a
near real-time indexing and searching
capabilities through solar cloud which
is very very flexible gives you within
distributed they are searching and
indexing capabilities and will do things
like automatic failover and stuff like
that along with that it is very very
suitable Paulino sequel replacement of
the traditional database
installations so you can use Hadoop in
case of the flat file system like I'm
storing my indexes right now on my file
system so we can replace this layer with
the Hadoop layer so we can do that okay
and we can do this scalable indexing
using the Hadoop MapReduce and the big
jobs and then we can load the index data
into the solar so with that data which
is told only Hadoop cluster or the
Hadoop per instance is going to be used
by the solar so in all the major Hadoop
distributions like cloud era Hortonworks
mapper you can integrate the so large
easily pretty easily so this is the kind
of architecture I was talking about we
can input the data in any format I would
like to push my data in we can have the
raw files and this is going to be my
HDFS which is going to store the raw
files and index files which are
converted by my MapReduce or take job
and then I'm going to expose this you
know distributed file system through my
solar instances which sit on the top of
leucine and my web applications are
going to interact with it with me format
of query and response ok
so this is talking about the drought
trends which you could essentially you
know retrieve by learning the skill so
I'm not going to literally you know go
into the details of how this graph is
all about I I think we can pretty much
see that from Johnny to John 15 we have
seen such a big you know such a major
shoot in the number of jobs or the
number of work which comes for the
people who already have learned this
skill so not for the reason of the job I
would say but it is very nice tool to
have in your skill set okay so this is
talking about the major modules which
we'll cover in these solar course so
first go first module is going to talk
about the introduction of Apache Lucene
then we're going to explore the Lucine
again we're going to go through all the
examples and the concepts which we are
going to cover along with leucine then
we are going to introduce the introducer
so learn the similarities with the
leucine the features it uses that we are
going to talk about how data is indexed
in solar and how searching goes about so
we have individual modules for it and
individual modules means we are
essentially devoting three hours to each
of these topics so what do you six is
going to talk about all the extended
features which come along with us so I
like facing highlighting and more like
this Auto sedation and stuff the module
seven is going to talk about the solar
cloud as an administration and finally
we are going to have the final project
so we're going to explicitly discuss
everything and we're not going to
actually leave you on your own we
provide you with extensive lab exercises
as well and there's this nice offer
which we've come up with for all the
attendings off for the session that if
you enroll in the course and you were
there in the webinar we're going to
provide you with the exclusive 25% off
only on the score of course so you can
no dummy numbers if you're interested
you can go ahead and reach any of the
numbers or email and you can enroll for
this course so guys take my word this is
very nice course survey nice skill to
have in your skill set and I mean you
can also consider the job opportunities
along with it plus I mean you can
explore the possibilities and the
innovative applications you can build
use a built using you're using Hadoop
and solar so again I think we have a few
questions I take a quick you know 5-10
minutes to handle the questions if you
have okay so rocky says what is the
input file format of leucine text file
excel sheet so a rocket I guess your
file could be in any format so you can
choose if you want I can show you an
example as well I have taken an example
so I just wanted to show you that term
there's this appear here curve you know
I have over here so I
and this is again another request
handler over here update request Handler
and they extract extract the data or
affirm the particular content type so if
you going to use this see I think I have
already let me just post up the data on
some other say core
so this hotels is nothing but a core on
my system on my solar instance so I'm
going to push this data into the ED
Eureka core which I have here so when I
give the query here it is going to
basically post and extract all the data
on what comes along with this period so
if you're going to explore this UI here
I can quickly see that if my data is
available here or not let me just call
out this core and see if I have anything
over here so see I am looking for
something like webinar ID this is the
document ID which what I have provided
here so let me see it was on I text the
document which I have pushed so let me
just see I say ID equals two webmin our
ID I think so I'm going to quickly see
if I have anything which is available
why am I not able to scroll here okay
sure so let's see if the data is
available okay there are seems not to be
available because okay BAM in our ID one
is the ID okay let's see if we get
something now okay
do you guys see this I have actually a
tweet entire contained from this PDF and
my contained tag is going to consist of
all the data which Shawn Caleb came
along with this PDF
Rakesh does that answer your question
how can i push my data and stuff so
Nathan asked me that do we need to know
Cassandra to know understand solar as
well not really anything we do not have
any pretty like you said that you should
know this or any any particular
technology for that matter in fact it
has built 40 people who not I mean we do
not want you know Java engineers when
we're talking about you know Manning of
Solaria basically so you just need a
little bit of Linux little bit of you
know come on come on sir which come
handy with your drop in dose along with
that little bit off for Java is again
icing on your cake if you know it
because that ways you can you know build
your custom features on your application
okay so you do not really need to know
Cassandra to learn solar so Hadoop is
okay Roger asked me that Hadoop
experience will be helpful it is going
to be certainly helpful I mean it is
going to help you building any
innovative application however if you do
not know Hadoop for that matter you can
still learn solar here because um in
that way or you can use your file system
directory for indexes okay so along with
that we have okay
Cape says um I need to search products
with release date and technical
functionality I want to learn solar and
want to develop a product repository
search engine for my need from scratch
so okay so lucky sure that's very nice
sir thing I mean very nice visibility
you have regarding where you want to go
so definitely a yoga can help you if you
if you take up this course you can
definitely take help from your trainer
and your support members in fact term
for that matter there are people from my
previous batch who have been working as
technical architects in various projects
sub this far they have discussed how do
they actually basically design the
architecture or
the scheme of the vieira set so I have
personally helped them greeting them to
that level so this is the level which in
which area Rekha can help you
so nothing how much Java is needed well
there is no matrix as such how much is
needed just the basic offer Java is
needed
okay all right so we insert data or one
at a time well you can push your lot of
data as well if you want I mean you
could say star dot star as well and you
could also say star dot PDF as well but
for the type of you know the the command
which I have used I'm explicitly
providing the literal ID so as of now
I'm just going to push one document at
one go however if you want you can
simply use the post or char which comes
along with the solar installation that
is the same droid I'm using to extract
the extract and post the data okay so
you can push a lot of data as well in
one go okay all right I for solar J what
is that
okay nothing that is again the Java
extension or for SLR J so that is
another library basically okay
Rahul say is there any option to load an
X file into RAM for faster access
indexes on disk would lead to latency I
guess okay well you can do that in fact
or with that you can create the type of
indexes you could create the RAM
directory indexes as well so I think
you're talking about the caching
principle you want to make faster
searching so that's something which you
can do I mean you're mean B I mean no
one really stops you for doing that
okay here's another question my
scenarios I have hundred records I want
taught three should be from this hundred
and should change for every request okay
so hurry I think we're talking about the
scoring once again so if you have you
look in the the detailed you know course
highlighting we are covering the
boosting as one
30 topics here so we discuss about how
do we you know go about doing that I
mean not about 100 records we're talking
about 100,000 records so you can apply
that principle on those as well so we're
going to tell you that how do you apply
in scoring so that happens in the real
classes basically so because we always
run out of time in such webinars so okay
what happens if these sides of the core
gets more than the memory size so if
were anything that happens obviously the
searching is going to be affected the
indexing is going to be affected so are
we going to make sure that the size of
the core is as much as at least you know
it would be depending on how many how
much data can you push inside that core
yes it is going to definitely affect the
search process it is going to basically
slow down the process okay so I guess
that's all I had to cover over here
we've already I think extended thirty
minutes so if we do not have any more
questions I think or we should um okay
Rakesh has okay this is going to be the
last question can you please tell me the
difference between Solaria and cloud
solar yeah sure okay so big difference
between so large and so our cloud is the
difference between them is on the basis
of the availability you do not have the
replication principles which comes in
the normal cell or instance so on the
cloud um you have if you need an
application which is highly available
you should definitely go for solar cloud
okay just before anyone you know answer
the session please make sure that do
provide us the feedback of the session
because we would definitely like to make
any Corrections or any more rum changes
maybe have discuss the modules of the
course of the course as well so if you
feel that there's something else which
we should include we should cover these
to provide us these suggestions thank
you so much
rakesh coming back to your question once
again these replication and the cluster
management does not really comes in the
normal solar instance however they are
there in the clouds or Salar instance so
that is a very big difference because
the entire you know disaster management
and the entire principle of replication
depends on these features so I think if
you want to know about what has really
changed you can look forward to capture
um confusion there's this nice webinar
which was given by the lucida lizard
works guys so I think you can understand
that what was the basis of building the
solar solar cloud okay yes Rakesh the
course does cover the solar cloud if you
look here the modules we have over here
we have the complete model on solar
cloud in an administration here so we
have the complete you know handout and
complete plan for and we're going to
cover like how does this you know thing
works
sure thank you so much so if you do not
have any more questions we can disperse
that was so nice interacting with the
very nice bunch of people okay we have
the code repository Nathan yes we have
these are the examples which come handy
for you for all the folks in fact so
these are all the assignments and all
the codes which we are going to use in
the classes so yes we have it we have
the all the coding examples as well okay
thank you so much Raul do provide the
feedback thank you so much guys have a
great day ahead
