today's session is going to be on a zero
training so without any further ado
let's move on to the agenda to
understand what all will be covered in
today's session so we'll be following a
top-down approach today we'll start with
what is cloud and then we move on to why
Microsoft as you are is the topic of
discussion today why do you guys want to
learn about Microsoft Azure once we are
done with that we'll see what microsoft
azure is exactly followed by a use case
which is a real life implementation of a
problem that we'll try to solve in Azure
after that now every problem resolves
solve using services or instances right
so I teach you guys how you can launch
these instances all services in the
Azure environment once we are done with
that I will teach you guys how you can
implement this use case in Azure by a
step-by-step configuration process
towards the end we will be discussing
about is your pricing where I teach you
guys how you can actually implement each
of these services that we are learning
today for free yes you heard it right
we'll be discussing the amazing free
options that ASEAN has to provide us
right so guys this is our agenda for
today are we cleared it all right I'm
getting confirmation so Jason is clear
so Samantha Bebek I you see all right
guys since most of you are giving me a
go so let's move on to the first topic
of today's discussion which is what is
cloud computing so cloud computing is
basically in a gist it is the use of
remote servers on the internet right now
why do you use these remote servers you
use them to store to manage and to
process data when I say store you are
basically storing your files on the
cloud you're storing your files on a
file system on the cloud for example you
have Google Drive right so you store
your files on the Google cloud and hence
you are using the cloud store you use it
to manage right you can manage your data
using database management services such
as MySQL such as MongoDB now you use it
on your own servers as well but instead
of your own servers we are using an
implementation on somebody else
servus right so it becomes a cloud
implementation and then you use it to
process data right now for example I
have some data which will take a lot of
time on my in-house servers to be
processed right so I want a computer
which has more compute power but I don't
need that computer for long say I just
needed for like three for us right so in
that case I will rent a server on cloud
and then I will send my data over there
it'll get processed and then I can fetch
the data back right so you use cloud to
do three things you use cell for either
storing data you use cloud to either
manage data or use cloud we the process
data any application on the cloud
revolves around these C processes only
right having said that this is what
cloud computing is all about images if
you pay attention to the second line it
says it is a delivery of an on-demand
computing resource right what that
basically means is that you don't have
to plan in advance right for example you
launch a website today or you launch an
application today and tomorrow your
application becomes a hit right so if it
becomes a hit you don't have to plan in
advance like tomorrow if my application
becomes a hit I have to deploy these
many servers everything happens on the
go so if your application is facing a
lot of traffic or if it experiences a
surge you can consider your cloud
services as I said it deploys more
servers as and when more traffic comes
on to your application or website right
so it's on the go everything happens on
the fly if you want more computers bang
you have more compute resource and the
best part is that the way you pay for
these services is based on a pay for use
model what that means is you pay for
only what you use if you are using a
server safe around 60 not 25 cores for
three hours you'd be paying only for
three yards for that compute resource
right and afterwards if you are your
usage comes down to say two cores or
three cores of CPU you'll be charged
only for those two or three scores of
CPU that you could be using all right so
that is the power of cloud cover
that is the flexibility in terms of
pricing that you get with cloud
computing and that is the reason it is
so famous today that is the reason
people are migrating from traditional
services to the cloud services nowadays
all right having said that this is what
cloud computing is all about guys and
adjust now moving ahead let's discuss
what are the benefits that it gets up
from using cloud computing so we
discussed that you rent servers and
cloud you don't buy it right so first of
all the cost drastically reduces then
you can deploy an application at a
global scale without having to worry
about the number of servers that you
have to deploy or the cost that has to
be put in to buy these many servers
everything happens on the go you don't
have to worry about anything right your
application is ready to be seen at a
global scale if all the people on the
globe want to see your application they
can you don't have to worry about it you
don't have to worry about all the
servers that need to be assigned to your
application
right then comes performance right so
obviously when you have unlimited
compute power in your head you get the
best performance out of it right you
have better Network latency you have
better processing time and everything so
performance is also a factor then comes
speeds the speed of implementation
increases a lot because like I said if
more traffic comes on to your website or
application it could deploy more servers
you might be wondering how it happens
don't worry guys in today's session
everything will be clear to you right so
we'll be discussing each and one of it
so like I said so app so speed of
implementation increases because you can
assign more servers to your application
of website as and when required then
also productivity increases because say
you are the CEO of the company and if
the hospital time you were worried
whether your website is facing a down
time or whether your application is
facing a down time and whether a service
needs an update or maintenance your half
energy goes into that so when will you
concentrate on the main product when
will you concentrate on the future
prospects of your business right so when
all of this when the maintenance when
the provisioning of the servers and
everything is handled by the cloud
provider
you are actually free to focus all your
attention on an application and hence
productivity increases right then comes
reliability so you have SL is you have
service level agreements with the cloud
providers right so they guarantee you
that they will give you 99.99% of
validity right and with the kind of
security that the power providers do
they have maybe if you implemented it in
your in-house servers you could have got
that much security right so it again
becomes reliable since first of all they
guarantee you of the availability so you
don't have to worry about the servers
and everything secondly the security
part is much much better when you use a
cloud provider but mind you guys you
should always be very careful when you
choose the cloud provider because there
are a lot of new players coming up
everyone is just trying to get into this
industry because the cloud is booming
right everyone wants to move to the
cloud and as everyone is trying to move
to the cloud new cloud providers are
coming up every day right so you have to
choose between the travel providers
which one is more reliable which one has
more cost efficient in them and
everything having said that let's
discuss the different deployment models
in cloud so like I said if you use
servers on the cloud it is one
deployment model if you use servers in
your in-house company if you're using
your in our servers it was a different
deployment model let's see what it is
called so there are basically three
types of deployment models there is one
public cloud there is a private cloud
and there is one hybrid cloud right so
let's discuss what are the difference
between each one of these so a public
cloud is a cloud wherein you use servers
or you are reusing somebody else's
servers and that doehner ten interfaces
in the sense that on the same server you
have like five or six operating system
and each operating system has been
assigned to a different customer so
basically you're sharing your server
with say three or four people you don't
even know about right but at the same
time you get the security part as well
but then basically you're sharing a
resources kind of you using a pub
resource right another reason it is
called a public cloud when you talk
about a private cloud what it basically
means is that you are using your own
servers to host your application or your
website right so you use your in-house
servers or you would take service from
from various your end servers but those
servers are your own right nobody else
is sharing those resources on that
server so this kind of setup is called a
private cloud right now the mixture of
public cloud and private cloud is what
is called an hybrid cloud so when will
you use a hybrid cloud when you have
some confidential files you don't want
to take the risk of putting them on the
public cloud you keep them on on to my
servers right say for example you're a
pharmaceutical company and you have
these searches going on every day in
your company right so you don't want
your research to be leaked because it is
a business asset to your company right
so what you do is you also have a
website or for the public platform for
people to buy medicines from that
website so you put your website on the
public cloud so that people can access
it and at the same time you keep your
research on the private cloud now why
are you keeping it on the cloud is
because obviously you want the research
to be accessible by all the employees of
your company right or the ACA if you
have like three or four branches all
over the world you want each and every
branch to be able to access that content
right so that is the reason you put it
on a cloud but you're not putting it in
the public cloud or instead you're
putting it on your own source or some
other dedicated server provided by some
third party provider right so and when
you are using an architecture wherein
you are putting a confidential files on
a private cloud and you're hosting a
website on your public cloud this kind
of setup is called an hybrid cloud right
so guys are we clear what is the
difference between a public cloud a
private cloud and a hybrid cloud any
kind of discrepancy that you have in
these three topics or whatever we have
discussed so far we will discuss out
computing we discuss its benefit any
part that you didn't done this
we can repeat it again no issues okay
since most of you are giving me a go all
right guys so let's move ahead then now
like I said the cloud industry is
booming right so there are a lot of
cloud providers coming in and it becomes
very difficult to you the tools or a
judge which cloud provider is the best
right so we have listed down the top 12
cloud providers which are out there in
the industry right now and these care
providers are Microsoft Azure
obviously and then you have digital
ocean you have IBM cloud you have EDA
Brewers Google cloud platform Shawntel
mark and VMware right and today's
discussion we are going to discuss
Microsoft Azure because this is the
course that he Kaiser have opted for but
the thing here to think about is that
why Microsoft is there why are you guys
so interested in Microsoft Azure now one
thing is that Microsoft Azure is
actually becoming pretty big I mean the
cloud leader on people's it is AWS side
now but if you see the growth that has
been happening the past few years
Microsoft Azure is actually coming out
pretty big right so and that is a reason
if you look at this graph there are the
job opportunities for Azure has been on
a rise and that is like this is the
primary reason then you guys want to
learn about Microsoft Visio because
obviously you want to make a career
shift enter the cloud industry right and
for that availability of jobs should
also be a factor and if you see the
graph this graph is has actually been
taken from indeed comm right and as you
can see the graph is rising so if you
see in 2014 it was around point zero one
percent in the mid in the late 2016 it's
reached around point zero nine it came
down to a fall but then again it is at a
right so this is a pattern that you see
but if you take my advice because I have
seen the industry as far as I know these
jobs are going to increase multiples in
the future as well it's not only
restricted to Israel if you talk about a
dub
you've talked about any cloud technology
it has become imperative for you to
learn about cloud because it is the
thing everything in the next 10 or 15
years is going to be on the cloud right
any company which is still on it onto my
servers will move to the cloud one day
or another because that is inevitable
that is something that has to happen and
that is the reason it becomes very
important for you guys to scale up to
the cloud level all right now talking
about us you're like I said so
jobs are increasing every day jobs are
there for you so what needs to be done
from you guys is prepare for the exam
that is there for Azure give that exam
get the certification get hands-on
experience and get a job this is the
course this is the path that you should
have for taking a cloud computing load
right having said that so guys this is
the reason why we learning about
Microsoft Azure today moving on let's
understand what Microsoft Azure is
exactly so Microsoft Azure is a growing
occations through Microsoft global
network of data centers right so by
using the Microsoft infrastructure you
build deploy and manage applications on
the azure environment and like Azure
like I said it's a cloud provider I
provide you the cloud services you are
using those cloud services but those
cloud services are actually on the
Microsoft infrastructure and that is
what you are paying them for alright so
this is what Microsoft Azure is all
about guys any doubt guys if you're not
clear with what Microsoft Azure is I can
give you a more detailed explanation
anything that you're not clear with till
now even if it was you don't even
understand what its level I can repeat
it again anything that you want to ask
me
okay so Hana is saying she's all here
good so on
are those guys are quickly guys now
let's try to make this session as
interactive as possible because then it
will be in the benefit of both you and
me because if I understand what you guys
are actually getting a
I would know how to proceed in the
future sessions as well right because
our aim is to get certified to clear
this as your exam right and I promise
you guys if you go along with the
sessions and if you practice what I'm
trying to tell you guys 100% you will
clear the certification there's no doubt
about it but you have to be vocal you
have to be very enthusiastic in the
sessions to learn right because if
you're ready to learn everything will be
very interesting to you all right thank
you Jason
all right thanks parbake all right so
now I've got a confirmation from all of
you guys which is awesome so cool let's
go ahead and move to a next topic yeah
so we have discussed what Microsoft is
yours we have discussed why it is used
we have discussed what is cloud we have
discussed the basic theory around cloud
now let's see a use case now guys my
philosophy is that rather than doing all
the theory first and then going on to
the practical I would like to follow the
reverse approach right I would like to
begin from practicals because that is
what your exam will be based on your
exam will be based on real-life example
that you based on real-life scenarios
new based on what kind of hands-on
knowledge you have in yours as your
domain all right and that is the reason
every session of ours will have a use
case through which we will try to
analyze how we can implement it in the
cloud right so this is a first use case
this is kind of simple guys so please
pay attention so we are trying to make a
website which is something like this
right so what happens here is you have a
set of images and these images are
actually being played in the background
and in this website you have a
functionality to upload more files to
the club and once you do that those
files will automatically be added in the
slideshow and this start running right
so this is a use case and we have to
implement it on the cloud so there are
two stages in the way we are going to
take this use case the
stages we are going to apply pure logic
right we are going to understand how we
can actually deploy it on any cloud
service right and not only reserved but
any cloud platform without that how can
we implement this use case so let's see
that first and after that once you have
understood that you try implementing it
in Azure
so first let's see how we will implement
this in a general scenario by pure logic
so your user base will be accessing the
Internet right now when your user will
try to access the website he will enter
the website name right so all of that
traffic will come at this point which is
called a load balancer now what is a
load balancer a load balancer is
basically a service which distributes
your traffic equally among the servers
running at that time so say there are
like five servers running your website
then and if traffic is coming on to your
servers that traffic will be distributed
among those five servers by the load
balancer so the job of the load balancer
is to distribute the traffic equally
among the service right so this is what
the load balancer is all about so your
user base from the Internet is trying to
access your website so the traffic comes
to the load balancer which load balancer
separates or it segregates the traffic
into equal proportions and give it to
the servers right so once the traffic
comes on to the servers the servers
process the requests and if you talk
about our website so our photos are
actually stored on a file system right
so whatever files you are uploading or
whatever files are there which are
already been uploaded are there on a
file system all right so it will access
that file system for fetching those
files but a server they don't know what
files do we want right what is the like
say for example I upload a file and
before uploading the file there were
three pictures running in the background
so my server should know what are those
three files that I have access right
there should be a list of those files
that the server has to play in the
background now that list of
files is actually stored in a database
right so what my service will do is it
will first get that list from the
database right and once it get that list
it will fetch that list of files from
the file system say there are five files
in the database so my server will
interpret the addresses of those five
files from the database and then it will
call the file system and get those
addresses or get those files from there
and try to for that in this slideshow in
the website now when you upload the file
what happens is first your database is
updated right so whatever file is being
uploaded to your servers that file is
renamed according to whatever parameter
I have set because it has to be unique
rate each file has to be identified with
a unique name right so it renames that
file to that unique name and then stores
it on the database once entry has been
made of the database then it gets
uploaded onto the filesystem right so
this is the architecture of your
application this is the logic that will
be following today any doubt and
whatever I have told you guys
as of now anything that you think is not
clear to you guys I can explain it again
anything that is not clear on this slide
this was the general scenario this was
the way you will implement this website
on any cloud platform see any cloud
platform will have a load balancer it
will have the servers to have the file
systems lab the database right so
anything that he didn't understand so
I've got a question from Suhana she's
asking me what is the case when the
server's will automatically increase the
number when the traffic increases
excellent question so Hana actually I
wish I was going to explain that in the
further side but then alright as
explained you know so for those of you
who didn't get so Ana's question she's
basically asking me like I told you guys
before that when the user base is trying
to access the website and the user base
increases right so it's a around you
have three servers as of now and those
three servers are not able to handle the
traffic your website becomes slow the
processing
come slow so I told you guys if that is
the case the servers increase
automatically right so this phenomena in
any cloud technology is called auto
scaling so you set a metric and order
scaling saying say if CPU goes beyond
60% then increase the number of
instances when I say instances I mean
the server's right so if the CPU usage
of your servers increase after 60% or
above 60% there will be an increase in
the instance and when there is an
increase in the number of servers your
load balancer will identify ok there
were like five servers before now there
are six so it will distribute the
traffic accordingly and hence your CPU
usage goes down and your latency or the
response time of your website is
maintained all right so Sanne is that
clear your doubt about how our scaling
is actually implemented all right she
says thanks it welcomes wanna anyone
else guys anyone who didn't understand
the concept of order scaling or anything
on this particular node okay all well
then you guys are giving me a go so
let's try to implement this architecture
as jános we understood how we can
actually architect this use case in a
general way right let's see how we can
implement it in the azure environment so
in the azure environment the servers
that you're trying to implement is
actually provided to you by a service
called the app service what is app
service we'll be discussing in the
further slides then let's talk about the
load balancer and auto scaling so the
load balancer is actually implemented by
the as your load balancer and auto
scaling right having said that then we
talked about the database so database is
the MySQL database that we'll be using
in Azure and then you have the file
system which is called block storage in
what are these services you might be
confused okay what is your load balancer
what is the app service what is my scale
database what is blob storage don't
worry I will explain everything to you
in the coming few slides so let's go
ahead then so these are the services
that you'll be using
now let's go ahead and understand these
services one by one so let's talk about
the app service first so the app service
is basically a part of the compute
domain alright and in the compute domain
you have a lot of services but why are
we using the app service let's
understand that so there are basically
three kind of services in the compute
domain if you talk about in a very broad
sense the first service is called the
virtual machine now what is the virtual
machine a virtual machine is just like a
traditional computer that you have in
your in-house Danaus it is a computer
that is accessible to you and you can do
anything with that computer you have all
the rights to that computer all you have
to do is basically what you will do with
a virtual machine is you will say that I
need this much run I need this much
storage and I need this much
configuration please give me a computer
so as your will create that virtual
machine for you right and it will give
you the IP address and the password for
that machine what you can do is by
remote desktop connection you can enter
that IP address into the password and
you will be able to connect to that
computer now once you connect to that
computer it is your computer know you
have the access to the user interface
you can do anything on this computer you
can make it a website server you can
make it a worker to your environment you
can use it to for image processing right
you can do multiple things on a so I
like to you wipe might be doing on your
server as well right so this is what
virtual machines is all about you can
configure it to become anything a next
service is called the app service so it
is a basically an automated version of a
virtual machine but with limited
possibilities when I say limited
possibilities it is this service
actually very more focused right so app
service basically it doesn't give you
the access to the user interface all
right but that gives you more simple
interface to deal with because if you
want to host a website and virtual
machine you would have to configure the
virtual machine you would have to
configure the firewalls you would have
to install the necessary software like
say for example you have a PHP website
right so you would have to install the
PHP software on your virtual machine
and then you will have to copy those
your website files or the files that you
have coded into a specific folder and
you would have this file configuration
for your firewall and everything right
so there were a lot of things that you
had to do in your virtual machine with
app service you don't have to do
anything
you just have to specify what language
you want say for example I want a PHP
website so I select PHP I'll do next
then will ask me what kind of
configuration of so as I want I specify
the configuration I click Next and that
is it my website will be deployed
automatically it will ask me to improve
the files I will upload the files it
will automatically send it to whatever
folder it is required and it is done
right so this is the part of app service
right it is more automated because the
virtual machine everything had to be
done manually but with app service
everything happens automatically I just
have to approve my files right so this
is what app service is all about so like
I said so app service is basically used
to deploy an application all right you
cannot do anything else with it you
cannot use it to process a customized
workload or something like that you can
just use it to deploy an application and
that is why it is called an app service
right moving on let's talk about
functions of functions is basically a
very new technology it's called the
server less architecture it's basically
what it does is you don't have to
specify the configuration you don't have
to specify anything you just have to
upload your code and it executes it for
you but it will not deploy any
application for you for example you want
to host a website let's not do that it
just does processing in the sense it
will only do background tasks for you
for example if you have let me take an
example which uses both these services
if you have say an application like
Instagram right so user uploads his
image on your application and then your
application has to store that image now
before storing that image maybe you want
to compress the image or you want to
apply a filter to it or whatever right
so if from your application the file is
uploaded and now these many tasks have
to be done if these stars
are actually configured in your code
which is actually uploading the file as
well it'll actually increase the
overhead on the server which is hosting
an application but what we can do is the
way things happen today is everything is
distributed right so from your
application only the file will be
uploaded once the file is uploaded right
the tasks will be the tasks like
renaming the file or compressing the
file applying the filters everything
will be done using the functions so the
function will get invoked whenever the
file is uploaded using the app service
and the function will execute all the
tasks that have to be done on that
particular image this reduces the
overhead on the server which is hosting
your application right and you have your
background tasks will be implemented by
your functions and then will be stored
in the respective file session whatever
you have coded your function to do right
so this was basically a difference so
recapping again virtual machine is
basically a computer you can configure
it to anything you can actually use app
servers in a virtual machine manually
for example you want to deploy an
application you can use it by
configuring a virtual machine right you
can also use it as a function you are
virtual machine that I mean to save as
and you can configure it to only execute
background tasks but the thing is you
have to consider everything manually if
you want an automated version you can go
with app service app service is used to
deploy an application right but if your
use case is not about deploying
application you want to do some RAW
processing you might as well offer
functions which is a service which is
not useful to deploy an application but
is used to execute background tasks all
right so guys a doubt and whatever we
have discussed like we discuss virtual
machine we have discussed app service
ever discussed functions
all right like I said we are using the
app service why because we are deploying
a website right so for deploying a
website
I need AB service so it cannot be done
using functions can be done using
virtual machines as well but it will
need a lot of manual work and as always
to make everything faster right cloud
computing is all about speeding up
things the speed of implementing isn't
read right so I rather use an app
service and upload my code on the app
service and it will deploy the website
right it's that simple guys having said
that guys any doubt why we chose app
service in the computer domain okay guys
since all of you are clear let's move on
to the next topic of today's discussion
which is the blob storage so the blob
storage is basically the file system
that you need to upload your files right
you definitely need a file system there
is no alternative to this right so your
prop storage is the place where you will
be storing your image files but why did
we choose the blob storage by not some
other service will the stories remain
let's discuss that so in the storage
domain basically you have three kind of
services you have more services as well
but these are the three main services in
the prop in storage domain you have the
blob storage you have the cue storage
and then you have the backup right so
the block storage is like I said is a
file system on which you can upload any
kind of file right and that's about it
there is nothing more to blob so here
this is the thing next is Q storage so Q
storage is basically a chewing service
whenever you have synchronize tasks say
for example process one has to be done
before process two and process to
healthy to be done before process three
so what you can do is you can bundle
these tasks in our sequential manner and
you can add it to the queue storage
right what the queue storage will do is
it will actually hold these tasks
according to the sequence that you
entered right and whenever the two
storage is accessed it will give them
only the first task not the second task
the third task first
so the way it functions is like this say
for example like I said the image
processing application I want to zoom in
files first they want I want to add
filters and then I want to store it on
the file system so these three tasks I
will write it down and I will add it
into the queue storage now say these
paths will be done by my functions all
right so what functions will do is it
will try to interact with queue storage
until ask for a task
all right so queue storage will give the
task two functions in a very sequential
manner in the sense that it will first
give it the task to rename the file so
its rename the file once that task is
done it will again try to xsq storage
and then Q storage will give it a task
to filter the image or apply filter to
the image right that will apply a filter
to the image it will be done with that
and then it'll try to again the choose
storage and then it will see that okay
now it has to store that file in a file
system which is specified the code right
and it will print the task do it and be
done with the first file and then again
access queue sold in the process goes on
right so basically queue storage is used
to give a sequential manner to the
processes that you are trying to execute
having said that this is a world queue
story then comes back up so back up is a
service wherein you can store your
infrequently excess data right
what is your in frequently accessed data
could be for example in my company we
take a record of everything if we take a
record of every class that we do we take
a record of every query that you guys
raised now say if the classes that were
taken say like two years ago right and
as obviously I cannot delete those to
those classes because they have to be
kept for record but what is the point of
keeping them on my life hard drive
because my life harder is where I do my
current task right so rather than
keeping it on my life harddrive I say
okay let me keep it on a CD or a
pendrive and keep it somewhere where I
can take it out when I actually need
them right so this is the concept of
taking a backup now similarly if you
want to take a backup in Azure
say you have your virtual machine and
you have stored a lot of files on your
virtual machine but
think okay I don't need these files
anymore or maybe I don't need these
files as US now I might them need them
later so my tools spend that much on the
stories that you're taking on the
virtual machine right - rather than
stowing the Infinity access data why not
put more frequently accessed data so
what you can do is the infrequently
Excel data that you have in your machine
on the cloud you can actually take a
backup of that and store it in the
backup service now why will you store it
in the back of services because storage
is more cheaper when you talk about the
backup source because obviously first of
all they use magnetic tapes or they'll
use SSDs or something like that to store
your data now why is it cheap is because
obviously it has a downside that the
response time or the time to retrieve
the file from a backup service is
obviously more for example if you are
stored everything in your virtual
machine you can like go to that
particular folder access that file and
that is it right but if you are stored
in the backup server the retrieval
actually takes time but it is worth it
because you don't use that file every
day right you won't be using it and also
you are paying less so it doesn't pinch
you that much because you're paying less
and you are not using that file very
frequently as well so why not put it in
the backup service so this is what the
backup service is all about now today in
our implementation we are using the blob
storage for obvious reasons that we I
want to store my image files right so I
not store it on the backup obviously and
not flow into the queue storage as fluid
in the block so that because that is
what that service is meant to do alright
guys so any doubt why I am using the
blob storage okay you guys are giving me
a go let's go ahead then now a next
service from Azure is the MySQL service
from Azure it is basically a MySQL
implementation on D as your
infrastructures right so you can use any
database you want
Naser you have an SQL service which is
purely SQL so if you're comfortable with
that you can use it I am using MySQL for
my use case today because that is the
way I have quoted my application to be
alright so it is just personal choice
the next service
that we are going to talk about is or
scaling and load-balancing so like I
said load balancing is when you want to
equally distribute your traffic among
the number of servers that are running
that time and auto scaling is actually
scaling up the number of servers that
you're using according to the traffic
that is coming on to your website so you
can actually set a metric that
so whenever between more traffic is
coming on to your website your CPU
utilization will increase because you
have to process more requests now yeah
so your server will be processing more
requests and that is the reason your CPU
usage will increase so you can actually
send a metric let's say my CPU usage
magnetic increase is 60 or 70 percent
increase one more instance or increase
three or four more instances I thought
it is based on your personal use so this
is what aura scaling is all about and
obviously when you're using or scaling
the number of servers is changing
constantly
you need a load balancer along with it
right the load balancer so that say you
have six or seven thousand cell running
right now and say the traffic decreases
and it sees okay now the CPU utilization
is going down so it will reduce the
number of servers right so when it will
reduce the number of servers the load
balancer should identify okay there were
seven servers before now there are like
three so you'll be distributing the
traffic according to those three servers
right so the load balancer actually pays
a very important role in the auto
scaling process having said that so this
is how our scaling actually works so say
you have one server right and the usage
increases it goes on to become two
servers and then again the user
increases it becomes three servers right
now when the user decreases these three
servers can be reduced one server or can
be reduced to server so this is a
diagram representation of what our
scaling is we talk about load balancer
like I said so load balancer is a very
crucial part of auto scaling process
because load balancer is the part which
actually distributes
traffic according to the number of civil
that is running at that time right so
this is how the process works
laughter comes on to the load balancer
and the load balancer sees how many so
is the running and distributes traffic
according to that all right okay so we
are done with the sources these are the
services that we'll be using today guys
any doubt in whatever service that we
are using today any doubt and why are we
using them why not some other service
why not the sources that we discussed as
an alternative the sources that we have
in that particular domain and you can
have confusion you have I can Slayer it
out okay so you guys are giving me a go
so let's start the stop exam so now we
will see how we can launch these
services in the AR user environment so
guys we'll talk about the app service
first we'll see how we can launch an app
service nd as your UI okay let me show
you the user interface for Azir now
so guys this is how the user interface
for a0 looks like you have all the
services just there on the left side
right and this is the dashboard this is
called the dashboard whatever services
you launch you can pin it here for
basically getting accessed quickly it is
just like a desktop on your computer
which has all the shortcuts and
everything and this is what the
dashboard is actually used for all right
having said that let's see how we can
launch the app service in Azure so first
you will click on app services as you
can see from here you can click on app
services and moving ahead once you have
clicked on app services you will reach
this plate click on create app services
and then you click on web app and that
is it let me show you how you do that so
you will click on app sources click on
create app sources you go round click on
web app and over here as you can see
after this you will reach the screen
wherein you will see that you have four
options you can either code your website
in dotnet PHP node.js or Python so if it
is either of these four languages you
don't have to do anything you just have
to upload a code in this web app that
you'll be creating and your app will be
deployed automatically without
installing any software without doing
any configuration
justice right okay so once you've
reached this page you will click on
create so let's click on create and then
you will reach this screen so now you
have to give you an application some
names so let us give us this name as
Eddie Rekha - 0 1 so C is everything is
fine so this subscription is
pay-as-you-go resource group is
something which you can create or you
can use this existing so resource group
is something it's a group of all the
resources right so if you put if you are
creating a storage account will be
creating database account we are
creating an app so it's right so all of
this will come under one group it can be
clubbed in one group and will be called
as resourceful so any changes that you
won't put across the group you can do to
the resource club all right we'll be
discussing in detail water resource
group is and the further modules but for
now all you should understand is that a
group of resources is called a resource
group so if you have an application is
utilizing say 3 or 4 resources it's
better to put those resources under one
group right so this is about that then
you have the app service plan so app
service plan is something as in what
kind of computers you use and everything
so let's create a new plan for you so
that you understand it better
under the pricing tier this is the main
part that you have to select guys you
can select the app service plan you can
give it some name let's give it as
service - one all right and this is my
Absalon you can select what kind of plan
you need let me select the basic plan as
us now and click on select right and
then click on ok so this was about app
so this plan you can click on
application insights which basically
gives you the monitoring tools for now
let's not discuss it let's not go into
it we'll be discussing it later and now
let's click on create so I am taking the
pin to dashboard which will basically
create a shortcut on a dashboard to this
application comes in handy and that's it
guys you will click on create all right
so now my application is being created
okay so alright my my web app is
deploying let me go back to my slide and
let's jump onto a next service which is
blob storage so like I said blob soda
just like a file system you need a file
system to show your files right so that
is what the blobs are is all about let's
see how we can create a blob storage
instance in Azure so you will reach this
is the dashboard you reach the screen
and you will click on storage accounts
once you have clicked on soil accounts
you will click on add and that is it
guys nothing much required let's go
ahead and do this I'll go here I click
on storage accounts I will reach the
screen and click on add and I will start
entering the value so let's give it the
name called a lyrica - 0 1 so this is
taken with give it name as as your ID
you write this name is available alright
so the performance be standard because
this is a demo replication is not
required so I will say locally to down
in storage storage service encryption is
not require secure transfer is not
required and subscription is
pay-as-you-go ok resource group
let's select Eddy Rekha - 0 1 because
this is the resource group that I
selected earlier right and let's spin it
to dashboard so let's click on create
all right so my web app has been
deployed already and my storage account
is also being deployed all right so this
was about it let's go on let's see for
our MySQL now so for MySQL let's see
what all we have to do so we will click
on you we will click on databases and
then we will click on Azure database for
MySQL right and that is about it let's
go back and do this so we click on new
we search for as your database form is
here alright here it is so I click on
this and I click on create so here it is
I have to enter the server name let's
enter the seven emails Lu Rica - 0 1 it
is available it's good the resource
group should be the same so let's select
any Rica - 0 1 so it has been login name
let's give it as Eddie Rekha password
let's give it a break 1 2 3 4 and form
the password lu rake are 1 2 3 4 and it
is asking me some special characters or
let me add the special character as well
okay so basically you cannot have the
login name in your password so let me
change the password to edu 1 2 3 4
exclamation same in the confirmation all
right so this is available now location
thousand to the US version is 5.7
pricing tier let me see if there is
something more less all right I take
this I click on OK
pinnate dashboard and click on create'
it's pretty simple guys you would know
when you will do the hands-on on ESL's
so the pricing tier can be the minimum
if you are using it for demo or if you
are creating an application which is the
global scale application which can
choose the pricing tier according to
that alright while it is applying let's
move ahead
so let's come on to the order scaling
path now so basically we have to
configure our web app to order scale as
and when required so let's see how we
can do that so let's understand the
types of auto scaling first so basically
there are two types of scaling one is
called horizontal scaling and one is
called vertical scaling so horizontal
scaling is when you are increasing the
number of servers that you require say
you have an i7 so for example all right
now the usage goes up so you take two i7
servers and if it again goes up you take
three i7 service right so this is what
horizontal scaling is all about right
let's come on to vertical scaling now so
vertical scaling is when you are
increasing the capacity or the
configuration of your system say you are
using an i3 system before right the
traffic increases so now you're using an
eye-fi system the traffic increasing now
you are using the i7 system so you are
having only one machine but you are
increasing the configuration of your
system right so these are the two types
of scaling which exists in auto scaling
also the other way is manual scaling so
you can also manually scale up your in
the number of instances or the
configuration of your system right so
the way to do that is to manually go
into the service change the pricing tier
and you are set this is how you manually
scale auto scaling I am going to tell
you in a couple of you sides also guys
when you are auto scaling like I said
load balancing is automatically attached
to it alright so when you will be auto
scaling in a web app you don't have to
configure the load balancer the load
balancer is configured automatically and
set automatically for you to be used
right because it doesn't make sense
to use auto-scaling and not use load
balancer and that is the reason as your
have automated the process of attaching
a load balancer when you're using what
is right moving ahead guys let's see how
we can launch this instance so guys
first you will click on app services you
will go to your particular instance
there here I have launched you will go
to scale out and you will click on
enable or a scale all right so let's do
that we will go to app services which is
here so this is my instance that I have
launched I click on ad Rekha - 0 1 I'll
go down and as you can see I have two
options i have scale-up and a skill out
when i click on scale up you see the
pricing clear so I can increase the
configuration of my system right but
this is not what I want I want to scale
out which is I want to increase the
number of instances running right now
right so so it says our scale is not
supported for basic tier of web apps ok
so let me change my configuration
all right so if I go to scale out now
you can see that I have the option to
enable our scale so I will click on
enable our scale and then let's give it
a name let's give the name as a deer a
car auto alright so many auto scaling
property name is a lyrica Auto the
resource group is a Eureka - zero one
right so now you have an option to scale
based on a metric which is based on some
statistics like the CPU usage or the
memory uses or anything right and the
other one is scaled to a specific
instance count so for example whenever
the traffic increases say you were one
instance now like increased five
instances alright so these there are two
options will go with scale based on a
metric and scale out in scale in your
instances based on the Drake alright so
let's add a rule let's add the rule as
in what we want what kind of metric do
we want to monitor and scale according
to right so as you can see the time
aggregation is not something we should
be worried about okay guys so these are
all the metrics that you can actually
monitor and scale according to you can
scale according to the memory percentage
you can scale according to this Q HTTP Q
data in and it out right so let's for
now keep it simple and scale according
to CP percentage right time is not
something you should be worried about
and the operator all right so what
should be the condition so should it be
greater than or should it be greater
than or equal to let's keep it at
greater than or equal to so whenever the
threshold is greater than or whenever
the CPU will go greater than or equal to
74 ten minutes so you can set this as
say two minutes right okay let's it says
that it should be between 5 and sideway
okay let's keep it at 5 and increase
count by so let's see what our options
we have here so you can increase by
percentage you can increase by count too
as in if you were one you can increase
it to 10
right and you can decrease the count or
you can decrease the person by a spell
all right so when you are always killing
guys so you have to set two rules one is
the rule to increase and obviously one
rule is there to decrease so whenever
the traffic goes down you have to
decrease your instances as well so for
now we are setting the increase rules so
let's set the increase count by option
so how many instances will increase I
think one is the fair number and cool
down is something that is actually there
when you are say you are a skier right
now right and then say you order scaled
1min back and again the CPU usage goes
up so rather than going on and scaling
up again what you can do is you can wait
for five minutes and watch the metrics
right because it doesn't happen in a
second that your CPU usage will go down
because there are a lot of services
which are actually running right so you
can be it once your new server has been
deployed you can wait for the traffic to
be transferred to that server as well
and then you can see the metrics go down
right for that we keep something called
cool-down minutes right so we have the
default is four five let's keep it at
five only and now this is it guys there
is nothing else to configure let's click
on add all right so as you can see this
rule has been set let's add one more
rule to decrease so the CPU percentage
is fine the operator should be less than
or doesn't right so whenever the
threshold is less than 50% decrease
count by one instance and let the
cooldown be this much all right so again
the cool down logic goes here as well
say you decrease an instance and again
your CPU is still low because it takes
time for your traffic to get transferred
to three so a number it has the keys
down to right so let's keep the cool
down minutes so we click on add now all
right so we have added
the auto-scaling rule guys this is it
there's nothing much to consider
actually if you think about it it's a
very complex process but as your has
given you the simplicity to do it very
simplistic or a very English manner
because you just say like I said if the
CPU is it is above 70 person increasing
number of servers by one right so if you
go here and if you don't know about
outer scaling and actually figure out
what is happening right and same is the
case of scaling so whenever your CPU is
less than 50 percent decrease the count
by one right so as you can see you can
actually Zeid it here that this is what
we have configured all right so let's
save this now
alright guys so this is how you are to
scale your web app instance now since we
are doing a demo guys we don't require
the auto scale module for my application
so I will just discard it for now
because I can't even demonstrate this to
you right so I just showed you how you
can order scale now let's go back and
see what all is left alright so now we
are going to do the demonstration so we
have launched each and every service we
have launched the app service we have
launched box loaded and we have launched
my scale for short
right now let's go back and check and
deploy our website so let me show you
how the website looks like in my local
host
so my local host is this alright ok so
this is showing me an error because as
of now my code is not connected to my as
your instances right so let's first
configure our instances so let us go to
the dashboard and let's first configure
our database
all right now to configuring your
database the first thing that you have
to do is connect to it right now the way
you can connect to it is using the
command prompt for that you have to
click on connection security now you
cannot connect to your database just
like that you have to configure your IP
address in the set of rules that are
there for the firewall of the database
and when your IP address is listed there
then you can connect to the database let
me show you how let me show you that you
cannot connect as us now so I will not
su command prompt I will go to my - ql
installation right
all right so this is my myosin inflation
guys so I will type in the command MySQL
- net face and then the server name
which is this I paste it here alright
then I will give the port number so the
port number is - capital P guys don't
forget its capital P is stephane then
small P right small piece or password
capital P so the port number and then I
give the username so the username is
this paste it here right and then I will
type in the password hit enter enter the
password which is edu one two three four
exclamation L enter see as you can see
client with IP address is not allowed to
access so all right so now what I do is
I go to connection security I will add
my IP and I will conceive
a breezy connection security let's go
back to a command prompt execute the
same command again type in our password
and now as you can see I have
successfully connected to my database
now I can create a database here called
a Devika let me create a database let me
clear the screen
okay that's a lot I'm working on windows
so in Windows you cannot clear your
bicycle screen or sham all right so if
you are using Linux you could have just
type in control L and it would have been
fine all right so as I was saying let's
create a database called you wake up so
create database ed you rekha and that is
it I'll type in use that Eureka I'll
create a table let's create a table
called image right and title meme as
this one second my column name is name
alright so I've created a table so if I
just type in a show tables it will show
me the table name which is Amit alright
guys so this is done now I have created
a table I perfectly to the database
quality Rekha in my - here which is
hosted on a job and then I create a
table called image in it and the table
has one column called name right so this
is it this is my MySQL Summa MySQL has
been configured now
all right so my MySQL has been
configured now let me go back to the
overview
all right so my my skill has been
configured as you can see in the
databases it will show that there's a
database quality data which I just
created all right let's go back you
might have to add the web apps IP
addresses well we will do that later
let's go to our web app now awesome so
we'll go to our web app and guys this is
a web app this is the URL for your
website we'll click on this URL and you
will see a welcome page this is your
welcome page so now what you have to do
is you have to upload your code over
here alright the way you can do this is
using github or you can do it using FTP
as better now I know most of you are
from non-technical background so you
might not be knowing what github is so
for now what I will be doing is I will
be using a FTP software called FileZilla
for transferring my files from the next
session onwards I'll be using it up and
for that I have actually there is a
video in your LMS which is a short
tutorial on get up how to use get up
which is enough for a demonstration so
you can go through that video before
coming to the next session and then we
will be using data alright for now let's
use the FTP software which is called
FileZilla alright so the way you can
connect here is like this so you have to
create a deployment credential alright
so my deployment credentials is HR 1
let's give it a password and the
password could be ok let me give as
Haman's 1 9 9 right and over here also a
month 1 9 9 all right let's click on
save or maybe this user image is not
available so let me give it HR 1 2 to
them save ok let's try this again
HR 1 - all right maybe I'm connected
here maybe that's why let me say that
seaman $1.99 for
hmmm it's different if
all right so I get the error out of it
right so late we have successfully reset
the deployment credentials now right so
what we can do is I do go back to my lab
alright so now I can get connected to my
tab
I'll have to enter the FTP host name so
it will go here one second all right
the host name will go here the username
is HR 1 2 password is this right and
what else
all right the username is just sorry the
username will be this alright let's
click on Quick Connect
all right so as you can see we have
successfully logged into our FTP channel
so over here you'll go on site right
we'll go on wo w route and then you can
copy all your website files over here so
let us do that my files are some here
all right so let's copy the files now I
can just drag and drop it over here and
process the start now it might take a
while so let us configure some the files
by the website is being copied okay so
now what we can do is we will go to a
dashboard and we can configure our
stories mind you guys I might have to
upload my code if it's in my web app
because there are some things that I
have to change the code because the
addresses are now I'm creating new
sources right so I'll have to change
services address and the code so I'll do
that and then I will update the
particular file that I'll be changing in
in my web app so let me just give me a
minute okay so now what I'll do is I
will create a blog over here I'll create
a container and the container name shall
be hello and the excess type B container
all right I click on OK so I have
successfully created a container called
blob if you go in properties you will
see that this is the URL for it right so
let me show you the code for my website
guys so this is the code for my website
all right um now I have to change the
URL at places so let me do that so it
will get changed
sure alright then my container name is
hello so that is okay and now one more
thing guys whenever you are basically
going to connect to your storage account
order your blob storage you have to go
here I will show you you will have to go
to access keys so here is a key right so
this is the connection string that you
have to include in your code I've copied
it I'll go here and I will include it in
the connection string code alright
I control V and over here you have to
remove the endpoint suffix alright so
this is not required if you put this it
will not work okay I don't think
anything else is required yes I have to
change the database credentials as well
so let's do that as well so your storage
account is set you don't have to change
anything else let's go to the - here but
alright here it is so the server name
has to be changed let's copy the server
name and give it here's the host name is
this alright and let's see so our login
name is this let's put the log in a
manner
password is Eddie one-two-three-four
exclamation whistle right DB name
database name is Eddie Rekha with the
night username visa table as image which
is right and the feed name is name
alright everything seems fine one more
place I have to change it so let's do
that as well so let's copy this paste it
here copy our username
is to sear and everything seems fine now
so now when I try to run the code it
will run on my localhost but it will not
run on my web app why because I'll tell
you so I was getting these warnings
right so let me refresh we receive it so
let me refresh it now okay one second
obviously successfully updated let's go
back and check whether it's working
all right so basically you have to
disable the enforce SSL connection NER
MySQL and that would be it
I forward to do this all right so now I
will choosing a file and I'll be
uploading this particular file which is
desert I click on upload image and it
will take some time to approve the image
and it says well done blob update
complete and as you can see my image is
loading let's check whether we have it
in our dashboard as in in our story the
count will go rosy red you will click on
blobs we'll go to Hello container and
you can refresh it
and as you can see there will be a file
here which says one four nine six seven
four two four six eight alright so let
me connect to my
- here now again all right excuse me a
second I will type in my skill - edge
and then
the username
my hosting lives I'll copy this hostname
pasted here and then my port number
which is three three zero six my
username which is this I paste here and
then the password which is as of now
this Eddie one two three four
exclamation connected to my database
I'll choose the database and I've
created the next table and I'll show you
the record now let's compare it with
what is there it's one four nine six and
photos will succeed and it's one four
nine six and four two four six eight
guys as you can see the same file has
been uploaded here and it has been
mentioned here so what my website is now
doing is it is basically fetching the
file from my database and then accessing
that file over here in my file system
and hence displaying it in its
background so as of now with this since
there is only one image it is not
showing the slideshow let me choose one
more file let's upload the Koala image
and click on upload image
so now when you will see that the image
which is being loaded and if I go here
and i refresh it
I can see that there are two images now
here right and in my database as well if
i refresh it I can see two images
alright guys so this website seems to
work fine it is connecting with my
storage account it is connecting with my
database honest job now let's check if
my files have been uploaded so it says
ok this might take some time guys so
let's meet because we are all set here
and we are done with everything we are
just reading for our files we
transferred here and then I'll show you
how it works
oh there alright so let's wait
alright guys so my transfers have
finished so now let's check whether my
web app is working or not right so I'll
go to the dashboard
I just order by that bap
and this is the link I'll click on this
link now
guys like I said you have to add the IP
address of the web app in the MySQL as
well so when I go here you see an arrow
right and now like I said we have to
send the index file again so I delete
the index file from the server from here
all right copy the index file again
because it's been updated right and now
I will refresh this so as you can see it
says the IP address is not allowed to
access the server so what we'll do is
we'll copy the IP address we will go to
our database vole connection security
all right so here we are we'll select
the web app give the star IP and the n
IP all right
so let's get rid of the spaces and this
is it now we give them safe
now while are we doing this we are doing
this because here we got an arrow that
this IP address is not validated with
the MySQL so we have added this IP
address over there it is successfully
updated security settings let's refresh
it and check
okay awesome guys so now my website is
working so I have successfully updated
my website in the web app alright and I
didn't have to configure anything I
didn't go to the UI I just transferred
my files and my website is up and ready
this is the address which is being used
to get to the website alright so that is
this with the demo let me come back to
my site so let me recap what I did I can
figure my app service with the code I
configured on MySQL with the IP
addresses of my own computer to
configure it and the IP address of my
app service so that the app service can
communicate with MySQL I configured my
blog storage and I configured its
address in my code my PHP code and I
configured the host name and the
password for the created - cursors in my
PHP code as well so that is this is what
we did now you might be wondering I
didn't explain the code so the code is
actually there in your LMS alright so it
is there for your reference I have
uploaded a document which explains the
code as well if you have any doubts it's
pretty simple if you look at it but if
you have any doubts you can always ping
me back or you can contact our support
team they will help you out with it and
anyways is it is not clear to you in the
next session I will take say around
10-15 minutes and explain in the code I
think it will not be needed once you go
through the documentation but if it is I
will be happy to answer those queries
see you alright
having said that let's go ahead guys so
get done with the demo let's get on with
our our pricing now now whatever
services that we have used what if I
tell you that you can use them for free
yeah so let me teach you guys how you
can do that in the zero pricing section
so that as your pricing sections has
these three features all right so for
the first time you register on Microsoft
Azure as a new account you first of all
get $200 worth of free credits in an
account now what you can do with this
$200 is you can
choose it to deploy application as in
when you want so this is a one time free
credit that are allotted to you on
registration also with these reddit's
you can explore any services for free
India zero for the birth 30 days so in a
jar you can use these credits to be to
launch any kind of service for the first
30 days and of course after you use the
services you don't have to pay anything
alright but you might have to register
your credit card with them because that
is how it works they will charge you one
rupee in that and then there is you find
the one rupee afterwards this is just
for verification purposes because once
your free trial ends you have to upgrade
your plan to pay as you go or whatever
that you are looking for right but the
good thing about Azure is that sometimes
it happens that we start using the free
thing and we forget to see that it is
only valid for 30 days and we forget
that and after that it is if you use
another sources you get charged right
but with a zero that is not the case
with a zero what happens is you are
given a pricing theory which says free
trial right so at the end of 30 days it
says free trial expired and they are not
allowed to do or you're not allowed to
access any of your services it is only
when you manually change your plan from
free trial to pay-as-you-go
that when you can actually start using
your services again so which is a good
thing by a job because you have control
of your finances in your hand but you
will know what you get charged for and
that is something very transparent about
the jail with that red eyes comeuppance
is a very good thing having said that
lets go ahead and understand the two
plans which are there so one plan is
called pay-as-you-go plan and the other
plan is called six months or 12 month
plan so basically with pay-as-you-go
plan the thing is that you take a
service or you take an instance and you
use it for one day or two day or a week
or two weeks and you pay for that amount
only right but when you want longer
commitments say for example our website
right our company's website it's called
hurry record Co so it will be dead until
the company is there right
for those kind of cases it is better to
go for long-term plans because with
long-term plans you get discounts right
so if you compare it with pay-as-you-go
if you're using the instance with
pay-as-you-go plan for six months and
you compare it to the service or
instance in which you have opted for a
six months plan or a twelve months plan
and you have gone through the six months
the amount of money that you're paying
in that and the amount of money that
you're paying through the pay-as-you-go
service it is obviously less right so
the other thing is with the plan the
catch here is that you have to pay a
full upfront or a partial upfront
payment for the six months or 12 months
or whatever term that you want the
instance to be running on right so this
is the thing that you have to kind of
things you have pay-as-you-go plan and
then you have a plan where and you pay
in future so it's basically like prepaid
and postpaid prepaid you have six months
in 12 months plan with postpaid you have
pay as you go more
having said that let's move ahead guys
so this is the thing that you guys have
been waiting for the free things that
you get in a journal right so the
services that we use today the app
service for example is free right so it
is free up to an extent that you can
host up to ten web and mobile apps on
any platform or device in a jar for free
right also for more information you can
go to this link which I have added in my
slide so this link will take it there
and it lists all the services with some
of the services that we have not
discussed today are also included under
the free subscription and now the good
thing with Azure is because that even if
your free trial ends these free things
will be there for you right you can use
these free things even if the fee trial
ends these see things are there for life
so the first 10 app services that you
use in Israel they are free similarly
with the case of virtual networks you
can actually create 50 free virtual
networks with Azure
right after the 50 virtual networks that
you have would have created the 50 first
would be charged for you as one virtual
network it is again a cool thing right
so like app servers and virtual network
like I said there are other services as
well
one two three four five six six and all
which are free even as your for a
lifetime so there are some restrictions
like for example an app service you have
we can only run ten app services for
free similarly you have these services
right so this is the cool thing about
Azure that even of the field trial ends
they'll give you free services having
said that guys okay so that brings us to
the end of our session
any doubts guys until it anything that
he didn't understand in the demo maybe
or in the pricing section anything that
I didn't understand I will be happy to
repeat it again any doubts guys anything
that you think you are not clear with I
can clear it to you right now
okay so Samantha sing nice session Thank

right all right then I'll wrap this up
so guys thank you for attending today's
session so before ending this let us
quickly recap what all we did today so
we saw what is cloud and then we went on
to see what is Microsoft Azure right and
then we saw a use case in which we
discussed a general architecture which
can be implemented to any cloud form and
then we also saw it in Java we saw the
implementation and we saw how we can
launch these instances or these services
in Azure once we're done with that once
we learned that how to launch these
sources we went onto the demo and we
hosted this website on the your
environment and after that we discussed
the as your pricing wherein we discussed
some sources which are for free and we
discussed the plans which are there in
with us your and some of the things
right so guys this was our session for
