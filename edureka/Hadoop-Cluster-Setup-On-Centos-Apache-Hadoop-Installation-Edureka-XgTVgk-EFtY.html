so we are going to look at Hadoop
installation so let's get started
alright so now let's get back to our
virtual manage virtualization
environment so this is how we are going
to basically do the Hadoop installation
so so everybody would also listening
need need to have the software
VirtualBox
or you can have vmware from windows so
what you would do is you have to
basically we are going to create one
virtual machine for each of the daemon
that we run in the system so so what you
do is you basically click on new and
then you can basically create a virtual
machine for example I am trying to
create a machine I'll say say lab 1 and
you give the type of ways that you want
so because virtualbox lets you is a
virtualization environment so it you can
basically install any kind of OS so
since Hadoop runs on Linux so we are
going to go with Linux and then you can
have different flavors of Linux you can
have you into you can have basically Red
Hat you can have Linux you can have sent
to s so we are going to go I am going to
do it with sent to s so far sent to s
you see like basically other Linux and
64-bit then you click on continue it
tells you how much memory you want so
you can go with any basically value
based on the size of your laptop or your
miss machine so I have a 16 gigs
basically Ram so I can make it to MC 512
or I can make it 1 MB so you can just
increase the number you can move this
bar left to right so while for time
being I will let it stay 512 MB and then
I continue and then 3 tells that it is
going to create a virtual hard drive so
you can either say no or yes so so as
you just keep on creating this and then
it tells ask you what type of drive you
want so you can see these different
options so usually it's recommended to
use VMDK because VMDK is interoperable
between the watch but should basically
VMware
Claire and this way city goes to for
example you want to move this VM image
to a Windows machine if you have VMDK it
would work but if you use basic VDI it
won't work so you did it was able to use
VMDK and then it's saying the hard drive
you want to make it fixed size or
dynamically so usually it's good to
leave it dynamically because it will
just then shrink or basically increase
based on the space when it's needed and
then you can give the name of the hard
drive and then you can say what with the
maximum size of the hard drive so it is
saying 8 right now and then you just
click create so you can see that now it
has created a new virtual machine for me
which is called lab 1 and since I have
not done anything it just it was very
quick machine and so it just created it
so now I can go here and look at the
settings so it will have all the
settings that I basically initially
created so you can say that I specified
a Linux machine and I said the Linux is
sent to us and then on the system side
it tells you how much memory you have
allocated to it on the storage side it
tells you how much storage you have you
have set maximum 8gb and then on the
network side you can basically tell what
kind of network adapter it will have so
you can you have the options of nat
bridge adapter and then you have
host-only adapter so nat means that when
you have a vm on that basically you
cannot talk to internet because it will
be behind a firewall and it will
basically assign the net IP to it and
then bridged means that it can basically
talk to Internet and can talk to your
laptop also and host only means it can
only talk to your laptop it cannot talk
to Internet again so in mostly it's good
to make it bridged so that you can
basically get files from your laptop to
your virtual machine so that's so we
will make it brushed and and then we go
under storage so here we can see that
the controller so you have to basically
now you have to basically tell what
image you are going to use to form
King thus VM so if you are making a sent
to us obviously you go to send to s
website and download the image so I
download a minimal image and there's a
DVD image also so I'll say that okay
please install this send OS server on
this so basically I am now just
specifying the parameters that I need
for this virtual machine and once I do
this now I can basically go here and so
that'll say press ok and then I can
start this virtual machine so when I
start this machine now this is a new
machine it will start installing the
Centaurs because I just gave my images
sent to us so you can click on enter and
it will start the installation so you
can see that it is going to just now
start the OS and basically install the
file system and then try to make the
hostname and allows you certain
questions just just continue on those
questions say the begin testing you can
say skip or just sauce insulation so
I'll say skip and so it will start
installation so says welcome to sent to
us it will tell me what language we're
one so I select English and keyboard
selection I say us so I'll just go by
default and it is saying that it's
asking me to reinitialize asian adi
initialize everything so i will just
press my arrow key and go to reach
initialize click enter and timezone is
guys will stay leave it as it is press
ok tab to move to ok button and then
press enter and then it's asking me
passwords so I'll enter a password for
this machine so make sure you remember
this password click OK and then it's
asking that is going to replace
everything existing on this machine
because it is a new VM so I can just say
yes I'll just press tab and go to ok
button and then it is saying that it's
trying going to write this changes to
disk so I again say enter on this and
now you can see it is started creating
the file system and
starts basically installing the OS so
this is how basically you will start do
s installation so this process is going
to take some time so what we did was I
did the steps and now I already have a
basic send OS virtual machine up all
right so now basically we have our basic
VM up and now we will do few things so
what first of all what we need to do is
need to make sure that we have a
hostname
and we have it configured so so what I
can I can do is on this machine I can do
like hostname and give a hostname to it
for example I can say lab 1 dot cluster
1 calm and then when I run hostname
command it will have that name but if I
go out and come back again this hostname
won't be saved
so this hostname is just for this
particular session so to save this what
we do is we go to it see sis config and
under network so when you open this file
basically you write your hostname here
so I'll say it my name as lab 1 dot
cluster 1 calm so now when this machine
reboots it will still have this hostname
so that's the first thing that you
should do to save the persistent
hostname and once you do that then it's
good to modify your HC host file and
basically you instead of localhost you
basically just say the name that you
have for this host and then we'll also
see how to assign an IP so once let's
first assign the IP to this machine so
on UNIX basically you run if config - a
it tells you whether you have any IP or
not so right now we haven't configured
any interface for this so right now it's
just a loopback which is one twenty
seven dot zero dot zero dot one so what
I will do is I will now assign an IP for
this so what I'll for that what you have
to do is you have to go to its see sis
config
then you have Network scripts so you go
under Network Scripps Networks Crips and
then here you'll have like all the
scripts for interface so let's go with
our basic interface which is eth0 and
there we'll say that on boot
we'll make it yes that whatever IP is
assigned to this machine what we are
saying is on boot just use basically
store that IP n it so that it won't
change that IP so once we do this now we
will basically just do a reboot of this
machine so what I will do is if I cross
it will tell me whether I want to save
the machine see it want to power it off
so I will say power off and then I will
just start it again so it is booting up
you
so needs us is asking me the username so
I'll say root and at the password that I
entered for this machine and now when I
do if config - a it has assigned an IP
so you can see then under eth0
the i know i netted s is 10.0.0.0 so
that's the IP that has been assigned to
the machine so now we have an IP for
this machine and now we have a hostname
so what we will do is now go under it C
host file and update this IP say
10.0.0.0 and we'll give the name
hostname which is cluster one.com so
that means if some any other node for
example this is a data node and name
node refers to basically this name node
this data node then this data nodes it C
host will basically be able to resolve
it so that's why we need to add the IP
here so you save it so this is one way
plus most in production people do like a
DNS you have a name server and you
basically do the resolution from there
so so that's also something that you
guys can try in your setup so so this
way basically now now we have a machine
where we have a host name and when we
have a IP assigned to it so now we can
actually go and start the installation
so basically this is my similar machine
and now because I set it up as a bridge
adapter so now you as you can see the
typing in this shell is really difficult
so what I do is once I have an IP
assigned for jumping in this case I had
10 dot 0 dot 0 23 so now I can go to my
terminal and what I can say is this knee
open a new tab and say SSH me basically
increase the font so that everybody can
see
so now I can say SSH root at 10.0.0.0
and now I have like my terminal which is
much easier to type and it's a better
interface than this guy so now I can
just do it everything here so so this is
basically the this is how why it why you
even do it because we set a bridge
adapter that means this VM cannot talk
to my host so when in my host machine
from my Mac terminal I open a terminal I
can just give the IP of my VM and just
log in and then it would take me to the
medium so now I have entered - I entered
in my VM so that's how basically you can
go from your host system so so Mohammed
is saying I can do this in bare metal
Linux also here you can do it
so as you don't have a Windows box yes
so like my Mac so I am also using Mac
right so I don't have Windows so I'm
doing it on Mac and I'm just getting a
little so Mohammed if your question is
that you have a Linux OS already set up
and you just want to use that on
directly on a Linux machine yes you can
do it basically what we have done at
this point is just set up a Linux
machine on our laptops so in Windows
we'll use something like a VMware and do
the same things or on a VirtualBox
virtual box comes both for Mac as well
as Windows so that's where we are going
with VirtualBox so so at this point of
time we have set up a Linux machine
which is basically now our machine
machine to install Hadoop so now we will
start with the installation of a tube so
now I will go to my this name node and
so this was basically just to show you
how to set it up and now I'm going to go
to a machine that I have already set up
so that we don't spend time in doing
this so so I will again go to my nn1 see
where it is and
is like really difficult to see anything
here or type anything so that's why your
Linux terminal is basically much easier
to work with so that's why as I said a
bridge adapter so that I can just type
everything easily here so I will again
go to my machine 10.0.0.0 password and
this machine I have named nn1 so same
way that I just showed you how to make
name and have the machines hostname so I
have the host name as this and I have
the IP defined in it C host so right now
you can just look at this one we'll
discuss about these later on so right
now I have one machine where I have set
up my IP and I have configured my file
it see sis config it sees this config
Network scripts might so basically as
you can see that I'm typing something
and if I don't find a file it gives me a
list right so if I'm typing something I
press tab button it will tell me all the
files that start with I so after
pressing I I press a tab and I see all
the files available because I don't
remember the name of the file so then I
can look at the list and I need this
first one so I'll say I FC FC - ETA zero
so that's like autocomplete feature that
now when I press tab UNIX will or take
this this or shell will automatically
complete find the file with this name
and give an auto completed so this is
what we did writes on on boot we said
yes that whenever this machine gets
rebooted we are saying that use
basically get the same IP from DHCP for
this machine so that when we you don't
have to redo these steps of changing our
IP Zod in our it C host file so so now
this IP 10.0.0.0 dot 0.13 is set up for
this machine and i'm i made this the
hostname nn1 which i am saying that no
name node and I've used a domain called
cluster one so that's one my testing so
now I have this machine set up and I
have set up the host name for it
so sham is don't you give a static IP
10.0 23 seems to be dhcp yes so you can
you can have a static IP also or or you
can just use this way of doing it under
Network scripts under it see config
where you say that on board basically
just use this IP so mama I think this is
named load right so right now this is
nothing we are just saying that we have
one machine where we have a sent to s
machine and now we are basically going
to install Hadoop on this so sentencing
from my Windows machine what do I need
to do to SSS from Windows to Linux host
so so basically yeah so with Mac become
it comes with this app called terminal
and Windows has something called putty
is called PU TTY so you download putty
and then you just type the host name and
you just sss you that host on port 22
so that would be putty so muhammad's a
name and then one is name word ya
muhammad so n n1 is the name i have used
for this machine i am going to make this
machine name note so I called it n n1
yes right so first thing for Hadoop what
you need is basically have Java so so
for Hadoop you need Java 1.6 and higher
so first so so what you have to do is
you have to go like you install send to
us you have to basically get you have to
download Java so again you look at that
and then basically you go to Java
website and you get the download Java
and what I do is whenever I have to
download I basically go to something
like index of Shaba and Slean desktop
i'll say say in java 1.7
so it will basically take me to basely
I'm trying to find out a place where I
can have an IP of basically a location
where I can just directly download the
Java so I can even say JDK and so
basically you basically get the download
so you have to download Java 1.6 and
higher so in my case I already
downloaded it on under my practice so I
got JDK this RPM so what you do is you
can either download it your host machine
and then SCP to this machine or you can
just do something like a double you get
so let me try to show you how to do a
double you get so what I'm trying to do
is find this RPM so you can go to
archives and this is not right so this
index right so what I do is I go here so
this is basically a location where I
have this Java so what I do is I'll say
W get copy this complete path and I copy
the RPM for Java at the end of the path
so basically copied at this end of the
path and copy do a double you get on
this complete path so maybe what we
do this thing on this lab one which is a
new machine so what I can do is go under
opt to a W get on this so now since this
was a minimal Center waste so I might my
command might fail but W get not found
so what I will do is I'll do em install
w get so whatever things you need you
can basically install so you'll see that
it will start getting it from start
downloading it so so to download this
package is you need to have W gate so
you can just say yes and W gate will be
installed now you can just type W get on
this complete URL and you will see that
it will start downloading this RPM so
that's one way of basically not going to
your mad machine and then try to get it
on this machine so you can just run
directly W get on this command line and
it will start copying it so since this
is going to take some time so I already
downloaded this RPM here so next we are
going to do is we are going to try to
install this java so that's the first
step you need to have on the system that
java should be installed so what I will
do is I'll run something like rpm - I V
H so that's the way to install an RPM so
I'll say so you can see that it feels
basically since I already installed it
so it will say it's already installed
otherwise it will install and now if I
run java it will basically have Java in
the path I mean it won't have in the
path but then you have to basically now
you have Java in your system so you can
basically now say go under user Java and
the version that you installed and you
can go under bin and you can run
commands like JPS this JPS is a command
just tells you about Java processes so
so Shostak Ashok is saying do I need to
have Linux OS to do this so should we
try it on send to us right so send to us
is a flavor of Linux which is so we are
using sent to s so you can use same
thing that I am using you can use Ubuntu
or you can use Red Hat also so Ryan says
can you pace the downloading into the
chat window yes so this is the link so
let me see if I can paste it in the chat
window
so let me know if everybody saw this
chat download link
but then this could be like any JVM
right so I am going with Java 1.7 so you
can try this and Sunday Seng are these
instructions in elements also yes they
are also in LMS so so you can follow
them from there also right so now we
have Java and now what we are going to
do is that we are going to basically set
up our so now we have to decide on a
user that we want to run Hadoop as so it
could be any user it could be Hadoop
user Hadoop say your own user ID it
could be John so we have to make sure
that we have basically the user added so
what we will do is you have to run a
UNIX command called user add to run so
before that but as if I do ID so IDs
basically identity so if I do ID tells
me what ID I am Swiss D right now I am
root so what I'm going to do is I am
going to create another user Hadoop so
in this case I already have this user so
so you so it basically did not do it so
you can also do like user let's try this
userdel ID du and try to create it so
now I am trying to create user Hadoop so
now it is saying that it says create a
user Hadoop so when I do ID Hadoop I
will have a UNIX user ID assigned to
this user called 502 so that's the user
which we are going to use for our Hadoop
installation so I think you may also
want to save all these commands in a
file so well this commands are also
available on LMS in document so that's
why I am not saving them here because
you can always follow them and then you
will also have my recording so you can
even go through these steps so so these
these are already present on LMS as a
file so you can refer it from there so
that's the first step so once you have
set this user so now what you can do is
you have to basically set up a password
for this user so you can basically run
password do and it will basically ask
you for the password setup so I can say
type of password
if it is too simple it will fail so so
obviously you should make sure you have
a good password and now I will basically
go to this user sudo su - Hadoop so
basically what I'm saying is so um
actually I do not have to do sudo
because I'm already root sudo is to
basically go as routes run command as
rude
so like what I'm saying is su - Hadoop
su is switch user so I am switching user
to Hadoop and I'm giving a - basically -
means that please get the profile of
this user Hadoop also so now basically
now I am as the user Hadoop if I type ID
now I'm user Hadoop so now first thing
that I have to do is I have to make sure
that I have Java in my path so Ryan is
saying should we make lab 1 or cluster
comm as our name node yes we can use
that also but you you can see that it is
still downloading Java is going to take
some time so that's why I am trying to
I've already downloaded all these things
here so I am basically just trying to
show the steps because we want to finish
the demo within our class frame and you
want to discuss lot of other things also
so if we wait for this that one is going
to take some time so that's why I'm
doing the same things that you would do
on a new VM on this machine we have
already just downloaded the RPMs and
basically I just need Java RPM and I
need Hadoop basically a tar file so once
that's done then we are just going to go
with the configuration so right now we
are working on setting up Java so you
have to make sure that Java is in your
path so as you saw that Java was
installed here right so what I will do
is I will go in my bash profile so I'll
do something like dot dash underscore
profile and there I will set up a Java
home which will point to the directory
where I just install Java and then I
will just say path that path will be bin
for that and that I export that path so
that every time when you go because
right now we just install Java is there
but if this path is not added next time
we will come then we type Java it will
fail so basically let's try to let me
try to just remove this from here
right so initially this looks like this
right so when I go here I go as user I
do when I type Java it is still able to
find it from the path but when I try to
say GPS it would not find right all the
commands that are present under Java bin
directory they are they will not be
available so
the issues saying you are not audible
are people not able to hear me Sanjay
Singh if you will help if you open the
document with all commands from LMS and
have it open side side as you got
executing them all right okay so people
are able to hear so Sanjay okay let's
try to do that so Cindy is saying he
wants me to open the document and tell
us side by side what am i doing so let's
do that
so let's go to edit a cut out in and go
to my courses and I'm going under say
installation using sent to it so I'm
going to download this document quickly
I'm going to open this right Hadoop's
lab setting so this is what we are
basically following
so Ryan is saying do we install a
diversion one or two Ryan's or other so
once I finished Java installation I'm
going to come to Hadoop installation so
yes so we are going to start with our do
one and then we are going to discuss how
to do in our further sessions so you can
see that this is the RPN that we just
downloaded right so now we have
downloaded the RPM for this java and now
we are basically setting up the java
park so what i will do is i will go in
my - profile and i set up basically a
java home parameter which points to
directly where i just install java right
and and then i will type my path is
equal to include java home slash bin
directory and the existing path so right
now let's forget about this this one so
this is how we basically now adding if
we are adding Java path to it right so
now when we save this file and we type
JPS it will still complain about the
same thing because we have changed
something in a profile but we haven't
sourced it so what you have to do is dot
bash profile so this is called sourcing
of bash profile so it will get all the
changes that you have done to your bash
profile in your environment and once I
do this now the Java now my environment
my shell environment knows where Java is
and I type JPS it will work and if I die
Java commands they will also work so
this is something that we have to do on
all the machines now my joshan is the
path that I just sent and it works so
now we have Java setup so next thing is
to basically get Hadoop download so
again this is one dot one dot o setup so
again I'll go to the Internet and I'll
usually again type index of Hadoop so it
will basically take me to this location
where I have all the Hadoop basically
directories so you can see that we
have these versions here and all the
older raises are available here so this
will basically have everything here
right so we have starting from Hadoop
0.10 14 it goes to 0.19 2023 and goes to
I do 1.0 so you can see that naming
convention is bit started from zero
point ten so everything under zero point
three up basically less than Hadoop 0.23
is high do one and after 0.23 is I do to
basically so we are basically going to
choose the one of the region so if we go
with Y via with our LMS basically you
can see it is talking about 2025 so
we'll go to to 2025 and we are going to
download this tar.gz so again will go
the same way we'll do a double you get
on this so let's go to my session so
this Java is here so just so that
everybody wants to see how to do it so
what i will do is i'll type RPM dead -
IV h that will basically install my java
i don't want to waste time on Java
installation because we need to
configure it so that's why I didn't show
it so because it's just an RPM command
it will install java and then again we
will do something like this and then it
will get the Hadoop version so so again
I have already downloaded Hadoop on my
this machine so you can see that this is
under MS root so I'll exit out and again
go as route from Hadoop user and I have
already downloaded this few versions for
our test environment so what we so once
you do this w gate and this is not
getting downloaded so I just have this
downloaded version here so now again we
will try to basically install Hadoop so
for that what we will do is we will try
to extract this tar file so so this is
star ZZ fire right this is a tar and up
GZ gzip compressed file so we have to
give this option star - a
gee the size e V F so X means extract Z
means is a compressed file V means give
verbose output and F is like I'm giving
the file options and the file that I
want to uncompress is Hadoop 0 20
especially I will give the complete path
I'll say root I do 0 20.2 5.0 tar.gz and
then I can give the directory where I
want to basically antar it so in my case
I want to run everything as Hadoop user
so I'm going to copy this under the home
directory of Hadoop user so once I do
this basically now it is now extracting
this tar file under the home directory
of Hadoop user so now this is extracted
there so now again I will go back to my
directory and I'm in my home directory
and if I see I should have this
directory here if I do LS - LT r let me
remove this thing for the time being
because we want to start fresh that is
from my previous class so once you
extract you will have something like
Hadoop 0 20.2 0 v dot H so if we do go
into this directory what we will see is
will have all the Hadoop jar files we
have contractor e we have basically Lib
directory so if I go under Lib I will
see libraries the jar files at Hadoop
needs and then n go under conf I have
the con files at Hadoop needs so there
was a question somebody that how do jar
files basically come so basically now
when you have installed her - so these
libraries are the libraries which have
the Hadoop libraries and these are the
lines that going to be used so there is
a one library for fail scheduler there
are common tools common CLI so all these
are the basically jar or basically which
are library files which are coming as
part of Hadoop installation and now like
we did the Java path we have to do the
same thing for Hadoop also because if I
type Hadoop now it will say come on not
fine because my Hadoop is under home
Hadoop Hadoop 0 20
and then bin directory and then Hadoop
is there so once I do this my Hadoop
come on
succeed so what I have to do is I have
to type this Hadoop home also in the
path environment so now as you can see
that this is a version right
Hadoop 0 20 and then when you stall next
version or dupe this will change
so how usually people do is they make a
soft link to the current version that
they are having so what I will do is
will do NS L n - s which is a soft link
and I will say make a softening of two
Hadoop 0:20 and the name of the link is
a dupe so now if I do LS - LT r so now I
have a soft link which is pointing to my
Hadoop current installation that I have
in any time I install a new version of a
- what I will do is I will just remove
this link RM hadoop so when I say RM
Hadoop it's not going to delete this
directly because it is just pointing to
it right so it will is a 18 byte pointer
when I do RM hadoo you will see that
just this Hadoop link is gone and when I
get the new basically release of a dupe
I will download it and then I just
create the link to that new version of
the same ado because then you don't have
to change your system utilities all the
programs that you have layers you don't
have to win you when you get a new
version of a - we don't have to change 0
22 21 in all the different programs you
will just say home Hadoop are tube and
that will basically point to the latest
version of Hadoop so now what what I can
do is previously I was for going to
Hadoop I was typing this big command
right so now I can just say home Hadoop
Hadoop bin I do so now it's easier for
me because I don't have to remember that
big version numbering that Hadoop has
used and now again like Java path I will
also add this path in my bash profile
because I don't want
to type this whole thing again I just
want to type a dupe and once this whole
path is in my environment then shell
will know that when I'm typing Hadoop it
needs to look into my profile and my
path variable and if there's any path
where Hadoop is it will automatically
find it from there and I don't have to
type this complete big name so like I
said Java so in this path variable I'll
just add another thing for Hadoop I'll
say that in my path in so just include
all the Hadoop binaries path also in
your path variable so that when I have
to use Hadoop I don't have to type big
name now I'll just type a dupe and it
will works again it won't work till the
time I don't source this profile so I
have to do a sourcing of this so once I
do this now I type I do it will work I
don't have to type this big name so now
basically we have set up the paths and
Hadoop and Java are now available in
that path so so much here's a question
when your chance can you please show
various yesterday's recording so the
yesterday's recording should be under
the LMS for your account so basically
somebody you will log in and you go
under my courses and then there will be
LMS right so in LMS if you go under
module 1 you will have class 1 recording
so that's where you should have your
recording as well as presentation and
this is where I also got this document
downloaded right now so this is where
you should have it
alright so now basically we have our
Hadoop setup so now what we will do is
now we will start configuring Hadoop so
we set the path we have the bash profile
and now if I go back to my deck you can
see we have a something called
standalone mode right in standalone mode
what we have is what we have right now
we have JVM running we have Java running
we have the Hadoop installed and now I
do Hadoop I can basically run Hadoop
commands where as a loop FS LS it will
just give me the listing of my current
ID if it's a root it will run routes own
obviously I am NOT actually running any
Hadoop daemon I have not started name
but I have not
datanode I have not started jobtracker
I'm just installed basic hadoop and this
mode is called basically standalone mode
in this in case we are not running
anything you are just dev basically just
installed Hadoop and you are trying to
basically use this for developing so in
this case what would happen is some
developer or somebody who is making some
MapReduce program they will use this
kind of environment to write basically a
file and try to guess we run Hadoop
commands on that so so usually this
won't be used by an administrator ever
because you there's no basic use of it's
mostly for like developing some programs
or basically trying to test some
programs because it has no file system
it can only basically just run her two
commands basically commands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
