heaven right it's a very catchy webinar
title and needless to say that this
webinar will give you a lot of insights
there is a lot of content to be covered
rather than running through the slides
you know we will spend a lot of time
running the actual art code and trying
to understand on how our helps you with
the data visualization aspect so what is
it that we are going to discuss into
this session we will have a basic
understanding of data visualization as a
profession we will create basics basic
and advanced graphs in our we are going
to change colors and see how the
visualization is going to appear we are
going to customize few graphical
parameters we are going to learn about
the basics of grammar of graphics and
last but not least we are going to look
into spatial analysis visualization
using our what is data visualization
data visualization is all about
representing the data which humanly you
cannot view and make sense out of that
right it's not always about focusing on
the aesthetics of your visualization
you're trying to tell a story you're
trying to represent your numbers in a
graphical format so that it's easy for
the audience that is your prime
objective in your another prime
objective is to drive and bring about
interesting insights from your
visualization in these insights which
are planning to bring about should help
you make better decisions look at this
for example if I give you this kind of a
visualization right or not visualization
these numbers in tabular format would
this be easy for you would that be easy
for me to look into each and every
number there and try to make some sense
out of that and would it be easy for me
to remember these numbers
or remember the kind of relationship
that exists between two variables for
example miles per gallon and cylinder
there is a negative correlation and if
this number is closer to minus 1 that
means there is a strong correlation or
strong relation between these two
variables which is miles per gallon and
cylinder by the way this is our code I
am going to jump into our and show you
all those things now look at this number
here zero point nine zero two zero
that's their correlation number between
cylinder and probably displacement it
since it has a positive number there is
a positive correlation between these two
variables and since this number is
closer to +1 you say that there is a
strong positive correlation right
instead how can you utilize this or how
can you better represent this let me
show you another way validation look at
this this is our code so forget that -
now let us focus on a wheel realization
this visualization is the same thing
it's the same thing which is represented
in this table now if you see here things
which are in red indicates a negative
relationship between two variables and
things which are shown in blue color
explain about the positive relationship
between two variables what does that
mean let me go for a spotlight ok here
is a spotlight so this blue color here
is showing the relationship between
number of cylinders and the displacement
and by looking at this blue it's clear
that the relationship is positive and
the darker the color more is a
correlation so I know for a fact that
this dark blue means there's a stronger
correlation between cylinder and
displacement in comparison to this blue
here what is this blue here
X
you this blue light blue is explaining
about the relationship between deer ad
and Cusick whatever those variables mean
right that's a relationship here let me
show you another interesting insight
okay let look at the spotlight its hold
on one particular cell there that is a
relationship between hot spot it's a
relationship between horsepower and your
gear hearts power and gear that's the
relationship by looking at this it's
extremely clear for me that the
relationship between these two is
negative however it's not very negative
there because it's light color now do
you all agree with me that data
visualization is much better than just
using the numbers in this format what do
you guys think what is better
representing these kind of numbers to
your senior management and trying to
confuse them are should this kind of
visualization which compresses all this
values in this format which would be
easier for you to remember for a longer
duration obviously right
obviously yes Mita says yes the
visualization is better needless to say
that right
so we will discuss in a while from now
and we will run through each and every
code in our and try to understand that
intention is not to learn the our code
in one our intention is to understand
what are the various visualizations
which are has capability to here is
Steve and view on what an effective data
visualization should look like it should
be simple it should provide you with a
provision to compare two things you
should be able to attend to that attend
to the data and take some action on top
of that it should give you a provision
to explore the data view diversity right
view the differences and ask questions
on why is that so why is there a strong
correlation between two variables are
why is there a weak correlation between
two variables right and be skeptical and
respond so these are eight core
principles as mentioned by Stephen few
there are a lot of other data
visualization cons there are a lot of
concepts principles by Tufte and all
that right you need to rely on these
basic principles if not you might screw
up your visualization any person who
knows the basics of data visualization
would be sitting would most probably be
sitting as part of your audience there
to whom you are displaying your data so
it always makes sense to know the basics
of the data visualization concept and
then come up with your our visualization
in that so these are the basic graphs in
our pie chart
never use them look at that bracket use
them very very cautiously used by shots
only if you are trying to compare two
categories male-female fail pass rate
that we do not use it for any other
purpose server I mean if you look into
the data visualization principles it's
it's scatter plot line graph bar graph
sunflower plot right there is a concept
called over plotting or plotting is
nothing but plotting multiple graphs in
a single view right if you're trying to
establish a line graph then if you're
trying to establish a linear trend and
line graph makes more sense histograms
rack plot density plot box plots all of
these are extremely important right and
now let me take you to our rather than
bore you with the slides running through
the slides let me do this right and let
me erase all the data here and this is
our studio which is GUI based graphical
user interface here is my R but R is
very blunt
and it doesn't have a lot of graphical
user interface though it says our GUI
there it's not graphical using the face
this is more user friendly so let me use
that there are a lot of inbuilt datasets
in our and this command called data of
empty cart is going to actually call
this particular inbuilt dataset so our
says if you want to practice me have a
lot of in building assets rather than
you worry about getting a dataset and
working on that you can use in building
assets and this view is a command which
will actually help you view on what are
the radius observations and what are the
radius variables available for your
analysis in this dataset called empty
cars so we have 11 variables xi columns
here and we have 32 observations so all
the car names here are the observation
so in total you'll have 32 rows and 11
columns that information is come in
there now this is a command and the
output of this was shown in the slide
for you right when does it make sense
more sense all no I don't think so I
cannot remember even 10 of these numbers
I cannot remember probably six seven of
these numbers if I move to the next
slide or go to a different view so that
is how complicated the numbers make a
life right so let us make it Power
winner you might have not heard me for
just a couple of seconds as you yeah so
this is a library
which is called as collection of various
functions and code which people have
written in the past right so let me run
that library what am I doing here I am
trying to load lines of code and
functions which have been written
previously and I'm trying to make use of
that rather and rewrite the code so
within this
there are a lot of parameters there are
a lot of functions which are available
which can be readily used hence we are
loading that particular library called
correlogram now if I run this command
called correlogram of empty cars this is
a visualization which I see here let me
zoom that there we go now after looking
at this visualization for quick two
seconds even if I move to a different
slide right on a different page or a
different view you'll be able to
recollect for a fact that hey
relationship between miles per gallon
and cylinder is dark red that means it's
negative simple even if I close that
you'll be able to remember that but do
you remember what for those numbers no
most people would not remember that the
number was minus 0.85 to 162 zero right
this is where visualization in R makes
your life very easy
iris is yet another data set in Bill
dataset within our let me v1 show you
that also view of iris this command is
actually going to show you one what are
the components of this so you have the
species petal width fetal length sepal
length and sepal width you have this
information right so you have five
variables and multiple observations at
150 observations let us plot this data
and see what happens when you plot this
data all it has done is it has plotted a
scatter plot for me and the moment are
looking to this observation here let me
see whether it's going to drawn on no so
let me choose a spotlight there here the
relationship between petal length and
petal width here is a positive
correlation because it's in the
for direction there so it's clear now
right
even using scatterplot you can establish
your relationship what is the
relationship between pedal length and
sepal length here it is it's a positive
relationship and it's a mirror image if
I draw a straight line a diagonal there
if I draw a diagonal on this chart a
straight diagonal there it's a mirror
image
that's your scatterplot all about and I
see that someone has raised the hand and
gone makoki instead of looking into the
relationship between all the variables
which are available in the particular
data set can we look into the
relationship between only two variables
I want to look into the relationship
only between sepal length and species
can I do that oh yes
we use the same command plot iris dollar
sepal length what does that say I'm
choosing this particular column
zeppelins from this data set called iris
and I plot that this is x and y right
when you plot this you plot in this we
plot X comma y there so here on the y
axis you have species center and on the
x axis you have super length you're just
trying to look into what is a kind of
relationship right well for this
particular species 3 the sepal length is
higher in comparison to
second in the first one force he
extremely sorry on Oh
not sure what's this Murphy's Law here
right so Kavita are you able to hear me
now folks here okay so by looking into
these kind of graphs it's extremely easy
for you to check on what's happening
rather than you know let me take you to
this iris dataset hey look into species
and look into say Poland and make some
sense out of that if that's my question
and if I scroll up and down what is the
kind of relationship that you can rob by
looking into 150 increase there it would
be overwhelming right extremely
difficult task
hence we resort to these kind of
techniques now if I try another plot
this is called as box plot what is a box
plot a box plot shows what is the
minimum value this line here bottom line
is called as a minimum value right and
this line here is called as first
quartile from the minimum value to the
first quartile you have 25% of the data
which is represented nani Krong
yeah it's not good kid all you need to
do is run this code power MF row right C
of 3 comma 2 what does that do Rose
comma columns so all you're seeing is I
want three rows into columns within that
space I want to create the next few
visualizations so let us create this
first one then look at that it has
created a sunflower plot the first one
but what is our take here we can create
a a lot of plots within the space right
so let us run the second one there you
go we have the second one here is a
third chance here is a fourth one here
is a fifth one and here is a sixth one
what did this command O 3 comma 2
has created three rows and two columns
for you and if i zoom it there you go
you have comput sunflower flawed right
normal Claude you have come up with a
boxplot you coming to the line plot
density plot and then the histogram all
in one right is it too simple in other
ways realization tools I don't think so
right also we can do a lot of labeling
here yeah gosh
it's extraordinary truly now look at
this you can beautify your table here
I'm giving the main heading as exam
title there I'm saying I want these
circles to appear in blue color just
color is equal to blue mean is equal to
exam title the main title there X label
right you're giving a label to the
x-axis they're miles per gallon you're
giving a label to the y-axis white label
number of cylinders right compare this
with this right the second plot is a
plot without adding any title or the
subtitle or without labeling the x-axis
and the y-axis this is how it appear but
you can beautify that using this command
can I actually change the background
color absolutely what is the command B G
is equal to yellow background now if I
draw this plot it gives me with a
background blue color remember this that
you're coupling the statistics the power
of analytics with visualization here
that that's a key thing right to in one
you're getting your job done with
analytics and also simultaneously or
getting a visualization come up here in
this broomstick here will help you
actually get rid of all those things all
the previous things now let us create
another view three rows
columns let me run all of these
histograms and look at how you can play
with the colors there Wow if you say
color is equal to heat dot colors of
seven it gives you seven colors and
there's a heat right the fire fling
terrain green Brown this is the terrain
topo color cm right rainbow colors so
you can do all these things in are you
can make as aesthetically pleasing
visualization as possible and this is a
package which helps you do that our
Calabro right you need to load this
package once you load this package you
can actually make use of its strengths
to a great extent so now let us create
two rows and three columns there okay
and that is what it means right rows
comma columns now I'm trying to come up
with all the histograms all you're doing
is you're seeing Brewer dot pal in three
eight set one set to set three grey
screens all this is available in this
package are callable and that gives you
these can offset set one set to set
three what does that mean what color
does that relate to in all that and you
can come up with the skin of very
beautiful visualization now there is yet
another package which is called as hex
bin now you can use hex bin if you want
to a represent a lot of information so
let me do that right if it is not
available right if it says hey hex bin
function was not available if you get
that kind of an error my sage all you
need to do is use this command called
install that packages you'll be able to
install this particular package called
hex pin and then load that and you can
do a lot of things so let me know
brothers what what is it that you're
trying to view here you're trying to
view number of species simple limp and
also the count the darker it is more the
number of values there
they run this now you might ask me can
you explain by showing iris dataset
meanwhile let me take your questions can
R be used on unstructured data set since
most of big data is an unstructured
Foreman absolutely dilip R is used to
bring your unstructured data to a
structure format that's a strength of
our right that's absolutely absolutely
that's a strength of our right so let me
go to hex pin there and try to run that
qu and show you one what's happening
here okay
there you go oh I have not loaded this
package now if I run this it's going to
show me this so what does this actually
mean or let me close this and let me use
this visualization only so that becomes
easier for you so here we are
representing species and species 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
is nothing but the set OSA and Wasi
color and virginica right there are only
3 categories or 3 levels within this
factor call species so you have 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
against that you have the data
represented plotted right now and you
see that there is a per length here on
the y axis now if I see here or if I see
5 against 5 I see the darkest spot
darkest plots is 11 11 10 right so a lot
of values are 4 with respect to species
1 which is say those are here there are
a lot of values who sepal length is 5 or
5.2 5.1 on those lines so look at this
5.1 5.0 5.0 and if i scroll it down like
that you'll see that there are a lot of
fives there right so that is what it
means from 5 to 6 there are a lot of
values but exactly probably 5.2 or 5.1
there are 11 entries so probably or
approximately 11 values will have the
length of 5.1 right let me show you
another thing view of virus is actually
going to show you the data set here now
let me plot something for empty cars
empty cars is the data set of cars let
me view empty cars you'll be able to see
this data set here by running this
particular command plot hex bin empty
cars dollar miles per gallon all you're
seeing is hey plot miles per gallon
against cylinder so always plot will be
in this format plot x comma y what are
we doing here we are plotting miles per
gallon from this data set empty cars
so you see empty miles per gallon on the
x-axis and cylinders on y-axis how many
cylinders do we have if I go here 4 6 4
and 8 even if I scroll up and down those
are the three numbers that you would see
so I have four cylinder vehicle six
cylinder car and it's in the car and
what does this hexagon here say for
example if we look into 8 cylinder
vehicle which provides a mileage of say
16 there are 4 such vehicles so what am
I trying to display using this one graph
though it seems to be a 2-dimensional
thing I'm trying to incorporate pool oh
I'm trying to incorporate three things
here one is miles per gallon another is
cylinder and the third thing is the
count of that so that's a good part
about this hexxus then right now let us
load this table plot and let me plot
that there you go this is an enhancement
to your already available visualizations
which we have seen until now so you're
representing simple length sepal width
petal length petal width and you're also
coming up
the corresponding species there and each
of these colors represent that species
and this actually shows you the
percentage are by just looking into this
particular visualization of species it's
clear that it seems like there are very
few was he color right species where if
you that is what I sense and another
thing that I can actually sense here is
that for say Tosa I see that the petal
width length and the sepal length is
actually reducing there right let me
show you with empty cars miles per
gallon right was a cylinder as an have
the number of cylinders increased my
mileage my or mines per gallon is coming
down and you can establish additional
relationship here on number of cylinders
versus harsh power both of these are
contributing to lower miles per gallon
right and you can come up with a lot of
interesting insights if you spend a lot
of time on this let me move on and
explain about a few more this is for
diamond steel set but let me install
this and show you another interesting
visualization which is called as mosaic
this particular visualization is
something that I like the most because
it shows a lot of interesting insights
look at this this is showing you on how
many folks were boarded on Titanic ship
how many Warren were on first class
second class turn in crew members crew
members who will actually cater to these
people who are on the ship it is also
giving me information on how many male
was as how many female were boarded in
each and every class and also it's
showing me information I'm on about how
many children and how many adult mother
clearly the number of children were more
in your third
class and the female child female
children were far more in comparison to
the male side there and do you know what
this data is all about how many people
survived and how many people died right
so here you have the survived the
information survived no survived yes so
if you see here with respect to the crew
a lot of female right sorry yeah a lot
of female survivor in comparison to me
and so the preference was given to them
while they were trying to save look at
how many male crew members actually died
right and and if you look into the first
class almost all the female child
survived and also almost all the adults
survived so by looking into this simple
mosaic graph I'm able to look into the
class information the gender sex age
adult or children and also where the
death sir whether or not four things are
displayed in this particular simple
visualization on a 2d space you're
trying to display four dimensions that's
the beauty and you are easily able to
make sense out of that let me show you
heat map this is called as a heat map so
let me expand that further now what is
this actually seen this is called as
dendrogram dendrogram what does a
dendrogram see dendrogram says that hey
these are the radius things which can be
clapped together so for example this is
one cluster one segment all these things
here what does that mean these vehicles
right massara tub
until you're probably Camero a duster
right all these vehicles belong to one
segment with respect to all these
variables with respect to the number of
cylinders right weight gear number of
gears miles per gallon has power
displacement if you look into all these
particular variables or attributes these
cars here can be clubbed together this
is that cluster dendrogram which is
saying su and if you look into here
probably all these things fall into one
cluster all these fall into one cluster
and the corresponding cars are a similar
nature with respect to these parameters
and that is what this means now let me
show you interesting stuff around maps
so forget about the code which was
written there but you can come up with
this kind of interesting maps also when
you want to display maps of a particular
country of a particular state you can do
so let me show you India so that it's
easier for you to understand that okay
all the while it was telling that you
need to install this package so I think
you're it has caught me on back foot so
let me install this so this message
clearly sees that this package is
missing there right so that bug message
which you receive on R is also so much
so easy for you to actually trace that
it's saying that there is no package
called R CPP so simply install that how
using the command installer packages
right once I install that if I load the
package once again it's going to work
wonders so just give me a minute here
while this package is getting downloaded
in this way you also know on how to deal
with the box and once it's installed you
need to load it using the command called
library there there we go now let me see
where the roster is available or not
perfect it got loaded now without any
error so let me try to get the data
based on the altitude for country India
and let me plot this this red symbol
sees that an operation is in progress
and there we go
having a map here and you have the
altitude here and we know for a fact
that those which are towards the
Himalayan region Jammu Kashmir there
there are a lot of mountains and it's
high altitude region also your eastern
path as compared to the other locations
as it cure is measured against the sea
level there now let me actually get the
data of probably
Gujarat because that's a state which is
most poking about when it comes to your
development and all that so here this is
how the data would be in GA DM G a DM
pride graphical now geographical
information now I want the first name
there and let me call this one as
Gujarat and let me plot that look at it
here we have Gujarat alright so in this
way you can come up with all the
interesting insights and actually show
what's the population growth in each
state right which which particular
district within this state is densely
populated what is the male-female ratio
right and all these kind of things can
be displayed this isn't shot about the
kind of visualizations which you can
perform on our we have completed just on
time so we have 5 minutes I'll be taking
your questions for the next five minutes
please ask me if you have any questions
yeah but all our presets coming with it
gana chuan has this question I'm in Java
for more than six years is it a good
idea to move to analytics and data
science how could be the jobs for the
people like me all I will request you to
do is go to now pre monster times
dice and all that and do a search for
your own Jana sure because since I'm
taking this session I might give you an
information which might be false also
right so you can do a search and make
sense out of that but if you ask me the
answer is simple Java professionals are
most sought after when it comes to
analytical space because you'll be able
to write the code which is far more
advanced by the weekend right Java
coding are also right and you guys are
the most sought after
there are plethora of opportunities
awaiting your way but it says do we need
to install everything no but all these
are preset your you know built-in
commands which I've used in our ton more
has this question is a heat map
capability of are better than that of
quantum GIS I am not quite sure on that
then why are you speaking about quantum
computing path there try need to explore
that before I make a statement let me
take the question of the key which one
of Sasson are is more powerful when it
comes to data handling it's our belief
because 2 million folks are using our
and each one of them is contributing to
the our development there and within SAS
how many people might be working in
developing the SAS product right so our
I would rate our if you ask me that's my
new so barod says here there's a nice
quick question about quantum so quantum
computing is the next big thing
it would overtake your cloud storage and
all that your data centers in cloud and
it will require them computing one
quantum computing infrastructure would
be equal in to probably hundred cloud
data centers earth on my way to excel
stand in comparison to our comes to data
analysis ooh
ravi teja excel is nothing even if you
use advanced excel it's nothing
probably to perform 5% of the operations
which are can perform are is a core
analytical tool we be know you can not
match our is
matchable when it comes to analytical
space so since most of you guys are
asking that let me take you to something
interesting in show you Google Trends
right let me show you Google Trends on
our and SAS and other stuff oh you said
that one can write java code in our so
so can we write the code in PHP as I
belong to PHP bhangra if you know the
coding Raunak all that you're doing to
yourself is a world of good right
because you're coming so much so closer
to the coding path and if you can
implement the best practices of PHP and
other coding technologies would be very
easy and you guys will pick up fast so
look at this let me show you SAS it's
dipping there and I'm doing this live
I'm not using this from our database of
my own desire girl so if you do not
believe Google do not believe on what I
am searching here SPSS the trend is
steadily decreasing but let us compare
all these three head on and let me show
you what's happening with our the trend
for our is only increasing and it's you
cannot compare it's as simple as that
and even the forecast is saying that our
would keep growing tremendously done
morning so I need to explore that thun
Moines and probably at the end of this
session when you close your window there
will be a survey window please drop in
this query and then one of us will get
back to you delete which bigness program
I shall opt if I'm looking for career in
data analytics at Eureka has one thing
on mastering data analytics with our
that is what any beginner or
intermediate person would opt for and
there is one thing at around advanced
predictive modeling with our that for
the expert level so that would be the
start position for you do I have any
more questions from y'all okay Ravi Teja
has this question is there any
background requirement for becoming data
scientist to become a data scientist you
should be well-versed with statistics
forecasting data mining techniques along
with visualization
so you need to undergo any one training
qualification know if you are a graduate
that's good enough
and the good thing which people sees say
you're a become graduate that means you
have good hands-on on Commerce so you
can utilize your domain experience of
Commerce and come up with some
predictive models so in that sense you
have a niche right so all I'm saying is
you need not be a beta graduate or the
Graduate or an engineering graduate or
an MBA graduate you need to possess
sufficient domain knowledge and you need
to know these data scientist core skills
you can use our our is the tool using
which we accomplish all the data mining
techniques bharat civil engineers so you
can utilize ravi teja your experience in
probably predicting on what should be
the quantity of asphalt to lay route
right and you can actually predict on
what will be the life of the bridges
what will the life of the houses if you
build a particular pillar or anything
using a particular mm of steel or iron
and in those lines you can do a lot of
things is hadoop training mandatory okay
she not has this question I'm a big
Narayan no way to install are you just
need to do are download Serena and
you'll be able to go to the appropriate
page and download are indeed okay he's
hard of training mandatory for data
scientists create no absolutely no more
but good to know but even a person from
comas domain absolutely any more
questions for me or are we done if there
are no more questions then thank you so
much for attending the session if there
are any questions I'll take that I'll
take those now so Barret has this
question I have an experience in IT of
handling real-time servers when we the
server go down but when will your
network go down when we just have a
crash you can do all those predictions
if you know analytics
shake arouses question Ari's a tool
where we can run the commands to show
the visualization yes shaker absolutely
and you cannot just run the commands you
can tweak your commands to such an
extent that the visualization actually
tells your own story yeah thank you so
much done Moy which one is used more in
industry sass or delete sass is used in
companies which have already been using
that and all fleet since 2013 are has
picked up and it's are now the world is
asking you to know are how effective is
using our in conjunction with tableau is
what process question is it's extremely
effective our does your analytics like I
mean like no other tool and tableau is
the best way data visualization tool so
if those two come together you can do
wonders
so shakers question is where coding part
comes into picture coding part comes
into picture not just for your
visualization but to do each and every
analysis be building a predictive model
bead dealing with the data everything
but the coding in R is extremely easy
can we develop the predictive modeling
absolutely Kumar Kumar our analysis
question can be develop predictive
models using her as primary role is
building your predictive models Kavita
has this question how body is per soft I
haven't used that Kavita much so I am
knife to that I should not be commenting
on that that's what I would say and thus
Python and our go hand-in-hand
absolutely moon Python and are our two
pillars of analytical speech how useful
is Hadoop our hope is very useful in
dealing with the big data but how do
does not have the capability of building
your predictive modeling forecasting the
future all that cannot be done yeah
Kumar are can be used for forecasting
using time series techniques and all
that for prediction
first required that it absolutely birth
you need to require the data but are
also can be used to extract the data
whatever unstructured data that you can
think about it can be image it can be an
audio file it can be a video file it can
be social medium information you can use
R to extract that also and what are
languages which are supports C C++ and
all that is supported by our chica yeah
today's session would be shared across
with your crotchy alright friends thank
you so much for attending the session
hope this was helpful how do we have
commands in our to fetch data from
different types of file types oh there
are different commands for that dilip
read dot csv is going to extract the
data from your CSV format read the text
book actually get the data from a table
or text format so in that way there are
a lot of commands available basic
statistics with are you can look into
that that's good book to get started
Janish work thank you so much Shekar it
was nice talking with y'all are
interacting with you all Radha
thank you Jeff er yeah are you have
something called as business
fundamentals with statistics Janish
where you can also refer to that for a
person who is naive on statistics you
can get started with that all right
folks
thank you so much have a great day or
good night for the folks who are joining
in from India</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
