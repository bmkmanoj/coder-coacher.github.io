Rekha and in today's session will be
learning about OpenStack Neutron which
is the networking service in OpenStack
but before I begin I want to confirm
from all of you if you all can hear me
properly if you can then drop me a
confirmation on the chat window please
okay so Vlad says yes Jason says yes
great so let's get started so this is
what you should be expecting from
today's tutorial on Neutron so these are
the topics that first we'll take a look
at what is OpenStack and the OpenStack
architecture then we'll see
OpenStack Neutron this is what the
entire tutorial is focused on today and
then we'll take a deep dive into Neutron
will create networks with Neutron and
then we'll associate floating IPS to the
VMs that we created and we'll try to
remotely access those instances or VMs
so this is what we'll be learning today
any questions on that
all right then let us jump on to what is
OpenStack sir OpenStack is a set of
software tools that helps you to create
your own cloud infrastructure it is open
source and a lot of companies are
contributing on to open set so these are
some of the few companies that have been
contributing code to OpenStack it has a
very huge community and Center this open
source it is said that open source
technologies are actually going to be
the future of cloud computing so
OpenStack is the only open source thing
available in the market right now that
helps you to create your own cloud and
you can set up either a public cloud or
a private cloud with OpenStack so this
enables you to do a lot of things so in
today's tutorial we'll be learning about
how it enables networking service any
questions about OpenStack
no questions so now let us take a look
at the OpenStack architecture and let us
try to see where does Neutron actually
fits in so this is the OpenStack
architecture so this over here Keystone
is the identity service this implements
authentication of users and
authorization of a particular user this
checks the credential of a particular
user and checks what other services that
user is authorized to use so horizon is
the dashboard so with horizon you can
actually have an overview of everything
you can have an overview of the
computing resources that you are using
so that you can see and know what this
is the compute service this is where all
the instances get launched beyond since
the image service Swift is for storage
this is particularly for object storage
nutron this is what we are going to be
learning today this is the networking
service the neutron enables all the
different services to communicate with
one another
cinder is also for storage but this is a
pluggable kind of storage which is known
as block storage so heat is required
when let's say that you have to set up
different regions and you want to
orchestrate and manage those different
regions together so this is when you use
heat for orchestrations ceilometer is
used for billing purposes to have an
overview of what services you are using
for how much time you are using so this
can come in handy when you are a cloud
provider to actually build your
customers depending upon the usage or
services that they consumed and also if
you just want to see and you want to
monitor the services that you've been
using so you can you see low meter for
that also so this is the overall
OpenStack architecture
any questions
you can ask me questions whenever you
have any doubts even if you start
thinking about this particular side and
don't understand anything even though I
have jumped on to a different topic you
can still ask me that's okay
so in the meantime I'll move on right
now so now let us take a look at
OpenStack Neutron so this is the
networking service of OpenStack and it
provides you with network as a service
which is known as mass so with Neutron
your instances can connect to a network
you can define networks using OpenStack
Neutron and neutron was actually not the
name when it was initially created it
was known as quantum and this service
was actually released during the Folsom
release and then it was known as quantum
and in the Havana release the name
changed into Neutron and this was due to
some kind of a trademark conflict so
they changed the name from quantum to
Neutron but the question is that why did
they ever introduce this networking
service because already for the
instances and the VMS there was nova
compute right there was certain amount
of problems there were layer to boundary
limitations and there were VLAN
limitations also because they were using
the 802.1 queue standard which actually
allowed the VLANs to name from just one
to four thousand ninety four four zero
nine four so you can only have limited
amount of VLANs so that's why to avoid
all of this to solve all of this problem
open side Neutron was introduced and
this was actually a standalone core
project and it was created only because
they wanted a completely separated
software-defined networking stack for
the OpenStack ecosystem and over here
you can see this is how Neutron is laid
out so there is an API there is the
Neutron Network you can connect so it
can listen to different ports you can
define ports to which it will listen to
and every request will come the neutron
router and security group
so what are security groups they are
actually just a named collection of
network access rules that are used to
limit the types of traffic that has
access to the instances so you can
define different security group you can
define different ports in the security
groups to the one which will listen to
so you can see this architecture and
generally we actually use 422 to get all
those API requests and the Neutron API
does that it gets all kind of API
requests and it routes them to different
components like plug-in agents that
Neutron has so this is just a brief
introduction to Neutron any questions
still in your mind
okay so the network service in horizon
which is the dashboard that I just told
you so it looks something like this
so you can find the network tab over
here and you can actually visualize the
network topology that you've created you
can create networks over here so you can
clear out errs also so we'll be doing
that in a while so this is how it is
going to actually look like now let us
take a look at some of the Neutron
features so the first thing is that
Neutron is scalable since I told you
with Nova compute there were scalability
limitations since Neutron is now a
standalone service which is used for
networking it has actually enabled
scalability because in Neutron you can
define nodes so there will be a neutron
networking node deployed within our
modular framework and there are three
agents that actually run they're called
the plug-in agent and that's the
specific plug-in based on the provider
hardware or even the software and there
is also a layer 3 agent and a DHCP agent
in order to deploy IP and DHCP services
into the area to a neutron you can
actually create thousands of nodes
it is API driven now all of the services
actually communicate with Neutron with
API request this an API request the
neutron API gets the request and it
performs all the different types and it
also sends messages through APs
so even communicating with different
services altogether has become very easy
it is pluggable it has the ability to
logically separate provisioning and
tenant networks and I'll tell you that
Neutron actually come with handy plugins
so it already has different plugins for
Cisco open V switch which is actually
compatible with everyone and the last
feature is that it provides you with a
very rich topology because when you use
horizon and you go to the networking
section you can see that it is very easy
to visualize it you can understand and
get a whole picture of your entire
network topology at once and you can
also edit the store
turn off your network topology while you
are visualizing it so these are the
features of Neutron so now let us
understand Neutron in a better way let
us create networks let us create VMs and
assign networks to those VMs so let's
get started so this is what our network
layout is going to look like we're going
to have two networks this is one network
and this is another network so there are
VMs connected to this network and there
will be other viens created to the
another the second network but you can
see right now that these two networks
are not connected together right so
these two VMs can communicate with each
other blue one can communicate with blue
to red one can communicate with the red
two but red and blue cannot communicate
with each other since the network are
not connected so I'll tell you how to
connect different networks how to create
different networks right now so I have
an open stack setup ready in my system
so I'll just go there and I'll show you
how to do that so this is my OpenStack
dashboard so in front of you is the
brief overview of the resources that I
have used such as showing that I have
used four volumes maybe because of the
instances previous instances that I
created earlier there are no instances
launched right now zero V CPUs used I
have not used any Ram so none of the
instances because there aren't any
instances so I haven't used any of the
floating IP so there is one security
group defined so the first thing I'm
going to do is create networks so I'll
go to the network tab over here click on
networks
and I'm going to click this button over
here create Network so you have to
provide a network name for it let me
just call it
Loonette make sure that you click this
checkbox create subnet because you're
going to create instances and I'm going
to create two instances which is going
to be assigned to blue net so I'll click
on next
so subnet name let it be blue SN so for
net you also have to provide with the
network address
and there it is this is how you create
Network so I'm going to go ahead and
create another network so I'm going to
name it redneck
so the network address is something like
192 point one sixty eight point two dot
zero slash the CIDR notation so you can
keep the gateway IP empty for now and
click on next
don't bother about filling out these
just go ahead and click on create
so there it is so I've got the blue net
and the red net that I have created just
now and this is my public net which was
already defined so these are the
networks that I have so I'm going to go
ahead and create instances now so for
that I'll go to compute over here go to
instances and click on launch instance
so the first instance I'll call it blue
the availability zone will be Nova and
I'm going to launch two instances so
I'll increase the count to two click on
next so you have to select a boots or so
I'm going to boot my instance from an
image so the image is selected and here
are the images that are available in my
glance repository so there is the cirrus
image so I'm going to go ahead and
select that now click on next and you
have to choose flavors now so I'm going
to go ahead and click on em one tiny so
this will have one V cpu 512mb of ram
total this size would be 1gb root disk
is 1 GB so I'm going to go ahead and
create 2m one tiny images now you have
to go to networks and assign network to
the VMS so I'm going to assign the blue
net that we have just created select
that and click on launch instance
there it is the two instances are
launched so similarly I'm going to
create two more instances naming red and
I'm going to assign it to the red
Network so let's go ahead and do it so
the instance name would be red again I'm
going to launch two instances click on
next boot from image I'm going to use
the same syros image
and I'm going to use the same flavor as
well now for network I'm going to assign
the red net and click on launch instance
so these are the four instances that we
have just launched so blue 1 and blue 2
are assigned to the blue Network and red
one and red to our sign to the red
Network so these are the IP addresses of
the instances that we launched so I'll
just go ahead and I will try to ping
these instances from blue one so click
on blue one
go to console
so login so the username is Cyril's
password is given to you so there it is
so I'll try to ping blue so this is the
console of blue one so I'm going to go
ahead and try to ping blue two from blue
one
so the IP address of blue two is
one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot
one dot eight
and you can see it is able to reach blue
one
now let's try to ping red one from blue
one
a dress of red one is one ninety two dot
one sixty eight dot 2.11 now you can see
that it is unable to ping red one why is
that because these two networks are not
connected together let me show you the
network topology now so that you can
understand it go to networks and click
on network topology so you can see this
is the blue net and I have got two
instances blue one and blue two and this
is my red Network we have got two
instances red one and red two if you
want to see the graph click on toggle
labels so you can see that blue net and
red net are not connected together so
this VM cannot ping any of these two VMs
because they are not connected even they
are not connected to the public network
as well so in order to make that
connection what we need to do is we need
to add a router so we'll go to the
routers tab over here click on that
click on create router
so name your router's I'm just going to
name it
router1 so don't worry about the other
options here the admin state is already
up so go ahead and create this router so
the router one was successfully created
now let us go back to the network
topology and let us check what changes
actually happened so now you can see
that there is a router but it is not
connected to any of the networks so for
that you need to go to routers
so if you want to connect to networks
together we use your router and in the
router we need to add interfaces so
click on the router over here go to
interfaces select this button over here
add interface
you have to select a subnet at first I'm
going to select the blue net so this is
optional you can leave it blank and
click on submit similarly I'm going to
add one more interface to connect the
red Network select the red Network now
click on submit
go back to the network topology to see
what changes actually took place you can
see now that the router has connected
the red network and the blue network
together so now let us go back to our VM
and try to ping red to from blue one
which was unsuccessful before to go to
compute instances so this is a console
of blue one so now let us try to ping
red one from here so you remember the IP
address it was 192 dot 168 2.11 this is
red one we're trying to ping red one now
and you can see it is successful it is
because we have connected these two
networks using the router now let's go
back to the network topology again you
can see that these two networks are not
connected to the public network yet so
in order to do that we go back again to
the router
go ahead and add one more interface
select the public net this time and
click on submit
topology again you can see that the
router is connected to the public
network now so now if you want to access
any of those virtual machines from any
other source from outside your cloud
infrastructure you have to assign
floating IDs to each of the VMS so let's
go back to the instances so go to the
option over here and you can find this
option associate floating ip's so click
on that
and click on allocate IP
click on associate
the floating eye bees are nothing but
these are unique ideas given to each of
the VMS in a network so that anyone can
access them so go ahead and click on
associate so if you see that ports there
are no ports available need to go and
add rules so let me show you how to do
that before assigning floating IPs
so go to access and security
so click on this button over here manage
rules click on add rule and in the port
section here add 22 and click on add
after adding the rule you can go back to
routers and click on select gateway you
have to select a network and select the
public network and click on submit and
you can see a gate where interface has
been added
if we go to network topology
you can see that all the three networks
the public blue and the red are
connected via the router so now I can go
ahead and associate floating IDs to each
of your VMs
so go to instances
so now we'll go ahead and associate
floating IDs to each of my events so
click on the associate floating IP
option select an IP address click on any
of that for to be associated this is red
too so let it be red to and click on
associate this is the floating IP that
has been associated to red to and
similarly you can associate floating
ip's to the other three VMs as well now
with the help of floating IP I'll be
able to access red to from an external
Network as well and similarly after
assigning floating I piece to the other
three VMs I'll be able to access them to
software besides floating IP you can
connect to the public internet so there
is the outbound traffic going to the
public network and you can also receive
inbound traffic as well to your
instances so this is how you can use
Neutron for networking to connect your
instances that you have created in your
OpenStack infrastructure to the public
network for any questions guys no
questions so this was all about Neutron
so brief summary of what we have learned
today so we have learned what is
OpenStack and the OpenStack architecture
to find out where Neutron actually fits
in we have learned about OpenStack
Neutron and how it enables networking as
a service in OpenStack we have created
networks and associates floating IPs so
that we can also remotely access the VMS
or the instances that we created in Nova
so this is what we learn today so thank
