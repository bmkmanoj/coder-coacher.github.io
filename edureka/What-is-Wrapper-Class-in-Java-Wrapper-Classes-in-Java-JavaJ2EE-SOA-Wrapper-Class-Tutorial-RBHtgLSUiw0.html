class
you
you
you
k-kenny list what are the primitive data
types in Java
there are eight primitive data types in
Java
can you tell me what are the primitive
data types kindly participate so that
you will get the maximum benefit what do
we you know you you type in not a
problem I'm not here to evaluate you I'm
here to help you okay thank you there
are eight primitive data types okay
basically there are three kind of it is
data types okay
in integer
the first one is byte then then int then
long okay in terms in terms of float you
have float then you have character then
you have okay now let's look at what is
the wrapper class wrapper classes you
have a class for every primitive data
type okay for int I have integer so that
means if there are many situations like
connection classes or knowledge you will
be learning in the next class okay
yeah you'll be learning the collections
in the next class
you
so the collection classes will take only
objects okay it will not take primitive
datatypes in that case what you have to
do is you have to use a wrapper classes
okay so
you
have to use the wrapper classes wrapper
class is a simple class for a primitive
data type for every primitive data type
you have one wrapper class okay for
every primitive data type you have an
upper class so if the object like if
some functionality does not take
primitive data type it takes only
objects because it is implementing
object-oriented programming then you can
use the make wrapper class for a
primitive data type like I'll tell you
how exactly to use okay okay why wrapper
classes since Java is object oriented
programming language sometimes it is
required to send object instead of a
primitive data type in this case there
are the classes um check is used that's
what I said for example in collections
like ArrayList you will learn about
these collections little later in the
module okay
collection classes can only store
objects here primitive data type can be
used in integer or character data is to
be stored in collections then if
corresponding objects are required
hence wrapper classes are created see
the collection classes like our earliest
vector hash table hash map preset okay
hash set all these vector properties all
these collection classes right it can
store only object it cannot store
primitive data type right because it's
object-oriented programming so if you
want to store primitive data type how do
you resolve this problem for every
primitive data type there is a
corresponding class which is created if
it is in integer float care character
right I will show you in a while like
you know how what are the primitive data
types John takes a laptop from you India
to us there he finds the battery
charging things are different he will
have to find an adapter which works for
us a laptops blood points he will use an
adapter that will change that will
charge the laptop here the adapter is
like an upper class so your
you're taking an adapter which sits like
in between with the plug point as well
as the plug okay so the wrapper classes
like the between the collection class as
well as the primitive data type if you
look at John means Jack in a coffee shop
John Jack wants John's classmate Jack
was John's classmate in college hi John
how are you do you remember me I'm Jack
your friend from college that's a
conversation between them John says hi
jack
I'm good it's nice to see you after all
these years
what are you doing this dish there Jack
sees
you
I'm a programmer I'm working as a
programmer with X's on I have managed to
learn Java what about you
for that response I'm working as a
senior programmer and trailer with
confuse I I just got a promotion and
everything is great then Jack says then
I think you're the right person to help
me I've got a project on wrapper classes
I'm not aware of it can you help me out
yeah sure that's what John responds then
John explains jack about the wrapper
classes take an example of this
chocolate the manufacturer wraps the
chocolate with foil or paper to prevent
it from dust the consumer takes the
chocolate removes and close the rapper
rapper and then eats chocolate it's
wrapped by a wrapper right you just
throw the wrapper take the chocolate
okay a wrapper class wraps a data type
and gives it in an object appearance
okay
this object can be used wherever the
data type is required as an object the
wrapper classes has methods to unwrap
the object and return the data type
so basically wrapper classes are perhaps
the data type okay now let's look at
what are the different kind of wrapping
classes okay
as you mentioned like these are all the
primitive data types might short int
long float double character here each of
java 8 primitive data types has a class
dedicated to it these are known as
wrapper classes because they wrap the
primitive datatype into an object of
this class right so and so how exactly
you wrap the data into the wrapper class
you
you
you
you
you
you
can you please look at this portion of
the program and can tell me what's
happening on here only this bush when
you run this program it prints for T so
it is integer I equal to define you are
directly assigning time you're printing
the value of I which is 10 then like you
know you're defining a primitive
datatype y equal to 40 you're assigning
Y to the I so that means that the data
is being assigned to an object you're
printing I so which is you're printing
the object I which is 40 gets printed
after 10 what he gets printed the
variable I that is another Cano is
assigned 198 came so why I as I into y
so Y gets printed 190 so like it prints
1040 and one night
see here 10:41 19th out actually so Java
1.7 onwards there is some stage okay 1.8
using will be changed he will not be a
signed integer object directly like this
okay
so what you have to do is integer i/o be
equal to MU integer okay system I will
be when you print like this will be will
he break like this then gets printed you
cannot assign directly from 1.7 1.8
onwards right so here then gets printed
and you want to assign from an object to
a primitive datatype what you should do
let's say int I variable okay then I
will say i underscore OB you are get in
value okay so you have to get the
integer value then I variable so it will
print 10 10 and 10
okay this is how you have to use from
1.7 1.8 onwards you cannot assign
directly this feature has been removed
from 1.7 onwards
okay 1.8 so you have to allocate memory
using new that answers your question
okay
is a wrapper classes clear for you
before we move on to the next topic okay
another classes is that for every
primitive data type you have a
corresponding class why exactly do you
need because couple of objects like
collection objects will store only
objects because Java is a programming
object-oriented programming right I hear
s from only five people we have any
other in the class can we have some
response from everyone so that I
understand that you understood the
concept of wrapper class before we move
on okay thank you so much for responding
right till now we have covered the
threading okay what is it thread how to
create a thread what are the advantages
of its length and what is that method 1
method what are the different the stages
of a thread that is a new star a table
running at all then we look at the
wrapper classes
you look good Java dot lag also now
let's move on with other ok few features
of wrapper classes we can use various
class methods converting integer to
string and also there are a lot of
methods in built methods are available
this is one of the way to store the
primitive datatype into an object write
the value of is available in all a
wrapper classes to get the value of
given data into the wrapper class
datatype it's the same program you have
an integer integer object okay then
you're printing printing printing the
integer object then you cannot think
that it is an object to a string also
that is also possible
just you I use int value so it written
the int value you say it too strict it
converts the object list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
