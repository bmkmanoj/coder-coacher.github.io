presenting this Android injury questions
in behalf of a dareka I've been with a
dareka for a while and I do trained on
Android programs ad Google certified
Android programs and this happens to be
the most sort of - the subject of the IT
and the google has promised about 3
million jobs down the line that's about
in next 2 years
no guys have about two decades of
experience in IT and prominently I
started off with the telecommunications
and then I moved on to Symbian I was
there for about five years in Symbian
and then I moved on to Android and I've
been with Android read from the day the
Android has started and I've been
growing with Android alright so all of
you want the job and all of you're
curious to know what would be the
interview and what is that I am going to
be grilled with and what is that I have
in shelves now in the session we're in a
completely cover the Android right from
the first chapter to the last chapter
that what we normally conducted a dareka
and here I'm going to just I'll be
walking you through the various
questions that what you're going to face
in your interviews and how to answer it
and if you really want to go deep into
it and in fact I will be highlighting
all those places and definitely it
Eureka is offering you a beautiful
course and there is what you call it as
the ad program and after that you can
take up the Google examinations then
Google examinations is something that it
is going to put you all in limelight and
as of now if you take the Google
examinations you will be the first
person order or what will be 100 guy and
you still have lot of reward and you
have lot of opportunities and the world
is looking at you all right guys let us
start off with the interview questions
so let us go and see what exactly the
Android has it and shell for us now let
us take a look at this market and the
salary trends normally we already
interested in what kind of a market is
it and what exactly is happening in the
market and
what is the kind of strategy that we all
will get no we have some information for
you from Gardner and those guys the
Gardner that what you all see here at
the bottom right corner of the screen
and these are the guys that they in fact
they keep upgrading the information
about the IT industry and they will give
you 100% accurate information about the
IT industry and you can trust them 100%
now here as y'all can see in a nutshell
you can very easily understand we have
different operating systems just under
the header operating system we have
Android iOS others and total now if you
look into Android the market share is
about a 6.1 percent and I was is 13.7
though the iPhone is fancy and people
they really want to have that iPhone but
the Android has taken or the iPhone and
we are in 86.1% the other phones is
taking of the share of 0.2 that sums up
to 100% so obviously the Android is
doing really good in the market and most
of the phone this is almost touching
about 90% most of the phone that what
people are using today is Android and a
lot of researches on and a lot of new
stuff is coming into Android Google is
bringing mind-blowing characteristics
and features in Android and you're going
to be one of those to be with no you're
going to be with a bandwagon and you'll
be celebrating with Google's if when you
take up this examinations and courses
and all that so let's get going with
this and this is just to get you an
information of where exactly you stand
and what exactly is Android and what
kind of percentage it is holding in the
market and as I told you Google as
promised about three million jobs the
next two years and that is what it is
and almost everyone will get the job and
that is where the industry is heading
towards now all of you would be
interested with the salary trends and
and Android you can expect about two
lakh eighty three thousand five hundred
sixty-six per annum all right now let me
share my experience with you this is not
just that I've got a guy working for the
and he is working on Android and NDK and
all that stuff and he has got about
three to four years of experience and he
is getting this to like 83 566 monthly
not per annum and he is getting it for
one month so guys please it depends on
the qualities and characteristics that
word you hold by end of the day and that
is what determines your standard and you
know salary so there is no dearth to it
and this is a ballpark figure that what
has been stated here as well as in India
as well as in US it years it 117
thousand 564 random and this is what it
such as you in US and this is just a
ballpark figure and the source is indeed
calm and you can make much better than
what has been stated here now comes the
most awaited stuffs of this particular
day is the interview questions nowadays
it's fairly simple
no it just about how much of passion
that you have towards Android and how
much are you in love with Android and
what is that you really want to do don't
worry about the job and if you are
looking at it with a passion if you are
looking at it with a low and if you say
yes I know all this stuff I know little
more than this then 100% you have a job
on hand and you need not even have to
think about it no the question arises
what is Android know you guys I just
want to make it very brief I don't want
to tell you the story of who founded
Android and how Google took over Android
and that is not the concept that what we
are looking at we are jumping straight
into the stuff now as you all can see
couple of points here Android initially
it is not the operating system slowly it
evolved as an operating system and this
operating system is you're more powerful
than Windows and compared to any of the
other operating system because this is
almost like writing a kind of assembly
language program in a very less memory
in a very less space that you have
to write an amazing and beautiful
program and there is what it is all
about and there is various the operating
system predominantly gave me to the
picture and they got in the Android
activity stack and framework and so on
so forth and so the Android became an
operating system by end of the day and
by the time that brought Android as an
operating system earlier they're using a
generic editor and ID called as Eclipse
now the Google disown Eclipse that's
about two years ago and I brought in
Android studio and that makes everything
complete now the phone is prominently
been designed for touch screen okay and
most of the phone earlier days we used
to think about the keypads and touch
screen know today as of today almost
every phone that you buy in the market
let it be the cheap phone or let it be
an expensive one it all has that touch
screen now there is an important point
that what you have to look at is the
Android is open source now there are two
ways of installing Android normally the
Veda to install Android there is a
limited version that what you are trying
to install now you can install Android
open source that is a complete source
code is available for you
and it is at your perusal and you can
dig into it and you can go you can study
how exactly everything is working and
the complete source Android source is
open and you all have it at your
fingertips and if you want to do
anything creative more than what Android
is already doing and we can take up the
open source and we can start taking up
your codes into it right and the
complete code has been written in Java
and most of us we jump into Java because
Java is very user friendly and very
simple and a very interesting language
and we all want Java high and Android it
is having Java as the base so you need
not have to learn 100% of Java even if
you know the core Java this about 40% of
Java and you're good to go with Android
and it is all been written in Java now
if you try to look at what exactly lies
underneath now the complaint android
framework is based upon the LTS the
Linux kernel long-term support now all
the code has been scooped from the Linux
now don't get excited
wow it is going to be the process it is
going to be the memory it is going to be
the surge and so on so forth now what
they have done have scooped up
everything from Linux and have remodeled
the process the memory and everything to
the way the Android looks it meaning
they have to make it very concise right
so they've been using what exactly
Android needs only that their business
cooked and they're modified and they're
using it in the applications so this is
what it is all about Android and this is
how it goes now let us try to look at
the features of Android so you're even a
kid knows most of it right so we have
the user interface now here you have the
UI and UX and normally most of you when
you're working on Android you guys are
going to work on the UI there is a user
interface and now you have the messaging
architecture which has been brought into
Android and you have got the various
source of messaging it has been brought
into Android we have the web browsers
now web browsers or the regular browsers
that what you normally see in your Java
even that has been brought into Android
so when you guys look at the web
browsers those are not the native
Android code it has been plucked from
the Java and normally when you write the
Android applications we all start
looking at a code as the native code and
normally when you come to the web
browsers and we normally say a big no to
it because it can use a lot of memory
lot of space and it is a bit sluggish so
we really don't recommend for an Android
program to use the web browsers and we
have many different ways of avoiding
this and writing the native applications
now when it comes to the connectivity
this diagram reminds you what kind of
connectivity your phone can have now you
have the Bluetooth you have USB you have
Wi-Fi you have Wi-Fi direct and these
are the basic connectivity is that what
we can talk about right then we have the
multi-touch now you guys would have
played the game that instead of just
touching on one place you can touch on
two three areas then your phone can
identify the multi-touch and it has got
the multitasking now do not ask me is
that a process or what is it what
exactly is the multitasking and how it
is working now Android in turn has lot
of threads working and Android in turn
has got something called as a services
and services constantly it works like a
process in the background memory and
that is where the androids stands for
the multitasking multitasking the
Android has the time slicing concept
also in thread and Android Android
health services to the services in turn
will be running all the time in the
background so that's how it got the name
of multitasking here at multi-language
now when you graze write an application
just for India that will not really work
though you may want to the people may
want to write they may want to buy the
product your application in Japan in
China and in France so they expect they
language the native language and the
Android supports the local that is
called as the multi language you can set
it up with any language the user wants
or if you want to create your own new
language yes the Android will also allow
you to create a new language and you can
even bring it up into your phone then
when it comes to storage now Android
obviously as you all can see the first
thing that we all can see is what is my
RAM size and what is my SD card size and
so on so forth so obviously the SD card
happens to be the storage now we have
two kind of storage one is the internal
storage and one the other one is the
external storage the external storage
happens to be the SD card the internal
storage happens to be the full memory so
part from that we have got shared
preferences we have got SQLite
as what is available for to to call it
as storage and this for concludes your
storage there is a there is your
internal
and there is SD card shared preferences
and your escalate all the put together
you can call it as storage now we have
Android Beam this is nothing but your
near phone communications there is the
NFC and android supports the NFC and the
in fact NFC also is taking up a lot of
new turns and twists and - they're
making it more efficient than they are
trying to bring in lot most of where the
NFC and there is what you call it as the
Android Beam now let's get to the
architecture now whatever that we have
seen so far is very frivolous and those
things were very obvious that what
exactly the Android is and when you go
for the serious introduced people are
really not interested in whatever you
have looked at so first now let us get
to the thick of it and let us try to
understand what exactly is the Android
architecture no guys this is the diagram
that what you all have looked into now
it is just not the diagram it is just
not the punishment that what are going
to go through now this in turn will
decide what you are going to be by end
of the day whether you are going to be
the UI designer whether you're going to
be the Android application level
programmer or will you be writing the
NDK applications this green block did
what you all see here the libraries it's
all been written where the NDK or if you
have the urge to be a device driver
programmer or if you have the urge to do
anything onto the board you're right
here in the Linux kernel and now you
have you can opt for any of those
verticals it can be applications it can
be your NDK or it can be the driver or
it can be a hardware guy who's sitting
on top of this bolts now this is what
Android is auto for you so let us look
into this diagram in a very simple way I
don't want to complicate this stuff in
fact I can go on giving
talking about it for half an hour and I
can tell you what exactly is all about
let me tell you the complete story in
about two minutes now normally when we
take up the stack diagram they come from
the bottom so normally when you write
applications you know
you're sitting there here at the
application level so let us try to
understand this diagram right from the
bottom now any of the companies let me
take any of the healthcare companies and
if they want to use the Android into the
devices they convert the phone into the
healthcare devices and they take up the
Linux whatever is available in Android
so whatever else that they want they
scoop from Linux they recompile the
complete Linux and they will try to put
it onto the device of what they are
using now that is how they mount the
linux onto their devices just by doing
so you are bringing in the display
driver you are bringing in the camera
you're bringing in the memory of how it
has to work and you're bringing in the
most important thing is the
inter-process communications now this
inter process communication is something
that it lets to different application to
talk know as you all have understood
that Android in turn works on a sandbox
every application works on the sandbox
now if you want to start communicating
between two different applications then
you have to bring in the IP sees and
eight years and all that and then the
binders and so on so forth into the
picture and that is where the IPC's is
going to comment and then comes the
power management now the power
management has been treated as the most
important component in Android now your
whenever you write your application it
is based on the time and space
complexity the more your time you take
the more your space you take obviously
the more the power you take so how
exactly to reduce the power and how
exactly to bring in the schedulers how
to bring in the job schedulers and how
to have your program tagged along to the
powered management of the job schedulers
and how to execute all that they have
been working on with the power
management and this happens to be the
most interesting part of your complete
framework and people are doing a lot of
research on databases then we have the
audio drivers and whenever you listen to
a song now mp3 mp4 and all that and
those are called as the codecs and know
this drivers has been installed here at
the hardware level and the library
turn we'll start using the collects and
the library in turn will start spooling
it will start pulling the data from your
correct and it will play the songs or
your video or whatever so the library
can stream and it can spool it can do
all such things with this audio drivers
now we have the Wi-Fi driver we have the
camera driver and so on so forth now let
us hold on to one of the drivers that is
a camera and I will be talking about
more about it to relate the other blocks
and how exactly it is being linked now
whatever you have seen here it is all
about the device reference and it is all
about the hardware now when it comes to
the library now we have the library
files it is normally called as dot a so
files dot s books files all the library
files and we have the surface manager
now when you want to display an image or
when you want to play video it happens
to be on top of the surface manager and
when you want to record a video
obviously you'll be using the OpenGL
now this OpenGL you have to have your 3d
this thing in it and your phone and
without which the OpenGL will not work
right so the camera in turn is going to
use the OpenGL the OpenGL in turn will
allow you to have all the 3d recordings
and so on so forth and even this 3d
chipset is a must for you to have it on
your phone to use the OpenGL and when
you come to this SSL and it is all about
the 2d that what you are looking at and
also you guys can see the WebKit this in
turn will help you to run your Chrome
and your Safari and all such things
using this WebKit escalate predominantly
all of you know this this in turn will
carry the complete escalate database and
that happens to be a part of your
Android the framework now we will have
the runtime now in fact we are going to
go deeper into the runtime as we start
moving into this interview questions
this I'll be talking about the code
libraries I will be talking more about
the dalvik virtual machine guys please
hang on as we start going further down
I'll be talking more about the dalvik
virtual machine
now comes the application framework and
these guys are the managers without
which you cannot write an apk you cannot
write an Android application now if at
all if your application has to work the
application framework manager has to be
active now for example if you receive a
call that is happening at the low level
that is happening at the Linux kernel
and you have to receive your iOS and
then somebody has to go up all the way
to the application and say that you have
a call now when there is a call the
library in turn will spool the
information that this a call it tells
the telephony manager that is a call
telephony manager in turn will penetrate
through the application layers and they
tells that hey guys you have a call take
it and you will be receiving the call
and when the call is done and when you
are done with a call you are going to
talk back to the telephony manager and
this in turn will go - with the help of
the library and it will go to the Linux
kernel now guys between the library and
Linux kernel you also see a layer called
as the hardware abstraction layer that
stays in form of the glue to communicate
between the driver and the library all
right so that's how the communications
will take place now for example being in
the application level you want to take a
photograph and you just press on the
click button on the camera which happens
to be your software now at that point of
time now the framework manager in turn
will get to understand what exactly that
you want to do and it carries the
information all the way to the library
and from the library it carries
information all the way to the camera
driver and it says hey somebody has
clicked on the button ready to take a
picture and that is how right from the
application level you come to the
framework you come to the libraries and
then you talk to the camera very
similarly you're here the managers that
what you can see here is activity
manager activity manager is the manager
which in turn keeps track of all the
applications all the applications will
come under the activity manager to know
which application is working and the
life cycle and so on so forth and we
have the windows manager that intern
will take care of your screen the
rectangle and your applications the UI
and
so first we have the content providers
this in turn will help to shade the data
from your sandbox to the other
applications and we have the package
manager packet manager is a guy who
keeps track of all the running
applications in your emulator or in your
phone now who has to know about it the
packet manager will know how many
applications were running omni
applications are suspended omni
applications has got permissions to it
and so on so forth
lot of information has been attracted by
the package manager right without packet
manager your applications cannot work
now as I told you briefly the telephony
manager in turn will tell you what call
is coming in what is the number from
which tower the call has come in and the
durations and so on so forth everything
has been taken care of and the network
speed all that has been taken care of by
the telephony manager so as your
resource manager location manager and
notification manager location manager
now predominantly the Google Maps it
when you all look at it and that deals
with the location manager all right guys
so that is how all the managers and it
is just not this managers we've got lot
more managers which has been rigged into
the android framework and this managers
constantly they create a wrapper on top
of the application and as they monitor
the application and they keep helping
the application with the right resources
so that is how your application works at
this particular list there is at the
application level all right so this is
at a very high level now you guys when
you sign up for the Android course and
most of you will be sitting up here at
the application layer and you'll be
writing the program now when you sign up
for a course on NDK that is the native
development kit and then it happens to
be the C and C++ program and you guys
will be sitting here in this green box
and you'll be writing your program and
that in turn will have a close
relationship with the hardware and with
a Linux kernel and then you guys will be
connecting your application through the
application framework and that so the
application will get connected and to
your main applications now this is what
exactly happens with your architecture
and normally the
we call it as the framework also all
right so that's about your Android
architecture and you can call it as
framework or this can be called as the
Android stack also right now comes the
various versions in Android now Android
they have been bent upon the name of the
desserts now instead of calling it as
the regularly we call it as a version 11
12 13 so on so forth they call all the
versions by the name of the dessert like
the donut so here you all can see how it
has been written now you all can see
this is one point zero and one point one
and that is the second one is pointing
to one point one and the third one is
pointing to the cupcake and fourth one
is pointing to the donut and fifth is to
the hecklers six is to the fryer and
seven is gingerbread and eight is honey
cook guys I just came through everything
I didn't even talk about it
because as of now till eight the phones
are not existing if at all if it is
existing the older of iconic phones and
that is less than one percent of the
phones so nobody wants to write the
application who is going to buy for less
than one person so we are really not
interested in writing any applications
till honeycomb when you take up the Ice
Cream Sandwich and when you normally
it's they start from jelly bean and
KitKat yeah you and this is Ice Cream
Sandwich also is welcome and you can
start writing applications from 4.0
there is Ice Cream Sandwich jelly bean
and so on now Ice Cream Sandwich jelly
bean KitKat lollipop
now this four version as of now is the
major versions and lot of people they're
using more than 75% of the industry of
the users they're depending on Ice Cream
Sandwich jelly bean lollipop and KitKat
and so many of them they're using this
versions as of now and if you say that
am getting excited let me go to nugget
let me go - oh now less than one percent
they're using the Nugget and go so stick
to this and this is all the versioning
will work and when you since your
have had the experience of reading
applications and you have seen at the
compilation time when you when you click
on lollipop for compiling and you would
have seen how many percent of the users
of this to work on it now as you all can
see we have various versions now from
Ice Cream Sandwich to jelly bean it is
four point zero to four point one and
from four point one to four point four
is your KitKat now whenever they change
the version obviously the hardware to
will change now the new hardware will be
released into the market and obviously
when the new hardware is released in the
market when you're writing a software
when you are using the lollipop API no
it cannot it is not downward compatible
we cannot take it on to honeycomb or we
cannot think about try to execute your
application instead because it is
completely dependent on hardware and
that is what you guys have to look at
and that's about your various versions
of Android now if you take a marshmallow
if you take nugget you have you still it
is still buggy so not many people have
put their hands of snow and to nugget it
may take event to have the perfect
version now comes an activity what
exactly is an activity now normally when
you guys write an application in Android
the extension is called as apk the file
extension is called as an apk and it is
also called as your application is also
called as an activity now let us take a
look at the activity what exactly is
activity now guys as I go on explaining
to not come to the conclusion that I am
only talking and I am reading this
slides out for you now I'll be taking
you right into the Android studio to
experience a couple of things and
whenever you feat an Android studio it
stays in your mind forever so I'd be
taking you into the code and I will be
showing you the code and I'll also be
explaining you what exactly it is and
what it means to you now when you all
see the screen you all can see this this
looks more like an application for you
now there are two important things it
has been rigged into this particular
screen now let's take a look what
exactly is that now an activity is the
window representation of any application
in Android now you see a beautiful
screen right now the question that is
this a UI or is it an activity is what
would be the first question now my
answer is whatever you are seeing here
is normally called as the UI now
whatever you're seeing beneath this
whatever that cannot be seen is what you
call it as an activity and UI is sitting
on top of the activity the activity is
the core application that is that in
turn is going to render the information
from here to the server and so on so
forth now here as V so activity is a
window representation of an application
in Android it serves as an entry point
for user interaction the user has Yi
they have to say something so the
activity takes it and meaning the UI
takes it and it gives it to the activity
to perform the action to do whatever it
has to do with your user name and
password now each activity has a layout
file where you can place your UI now
whenever we talk about the activity
whenever you guys create an activity now
you all would have seen activity main
underscore XML or main underscore
activity dot XML that XML happens to be
the UI now every activity that you
create has an XML and in your XML you
can design the screen so that it becomes
the UI and activity will become one now
when you have an application when you
create a project you can create as many
activities you want but guys to remember
when you have about 10 activities in
your application one activity happens to
be the launcher activity the rest of it
happens to be the default activities
beginning when in Java you write public
static main in list that is a program
it's called as a launching program and
in Android you will have a launcher -
when you go to the manifest or XML
you guys in fact I'll be showing you
that also down the line and that is
where you guys can see dot main
interaction and dot launcher in your
category and that application will be
the launcher the other nine applications
will be the default activity meaning
that those activities in turn is going
to help the launcher in profiling lot of
informations to it now let us take a
brief look about the activity and what
exactly is the UI and activity let me go
to my studio now for that I have to just
minimize this revising and I am right
there in the street don't worry about
the code now we are trying to understand
what exactly is an activity now you all
can see that you created a class called
is the main activity here and this is
the main activity while creating the
project now you would have seen the main
activity and activity main dot XML both
came automatically for you now activity
main dot XML is where you have the UI
this is a user interface guide this is
all your the first application screen
will look like and this is what is your
UI the UI sits on top of this main
activity if you ask me how it's very
simple now you need not have to worry
about this line now I can put entire
thing in a remark you need not have to
worry about it now all that you see here
is setcontentview now to set content
view you are calling resource that means
you are coming here to resource and you
called layout and you came here to the
layout and you gave the name activity
main now this is a file name so whatever
however the file has to be shown has to
be represented that will be represented
by the set content view now what exactly
is that you are trying to see here is
your we are bringing in the view or I
can say UI UI in our
activity now this is what it is and this
is where you all have seen the activity
and you all can see your UI now as I
told you that you can have many
activities you know what I am doing I'm
just going to new and let me create one
more activity that let me call that as
the blank activity there is empty
activity let me click on this now other
activity I am just going to call it as
other activity now you all can see the
layout name the layout name is the
activity other know this is the UI for
the other activity that what I have
created let me say finished now I
created now you all can see two
activities no I told you one activity is
the launcher activity and all the other
activities happens to be the default
activity and also the main activity is
being related with your activity main
now let me click on this it says hello
world now other activity now let me go
to this hello world to the text and all
you can do is just copy this right here
in your other activity now instead of
hello world let me call this as
activity now this is a screen that what
are you guys are designing and when I
click on this it says the other activity
now the other activity is related to the
other activity as you all can see it is
a setcontentview and the content you all
can see is the other activity it holds
the other activity now the other
activity happens to be the default
activity as I told you let us go to the
madness is quickly and see what it is
now the first activity is the main
activity that you all can see here and I
told you the action area your you can
see the main here at the end now the
category that is called as the launcher
at the end you all can see the launcher
now the launching when you have your
project with about 20 different
activities no you may want to know who
is the launcher so just come to the
manifest and you can check the activity
whichever the activity has got the main
and launcher and this is the launching
activity you can come to a conclusion
now getting back to the other activity
now it's fairly simple
now this guys will not have you will
have the intent filters you can bring in
an intent filter here and here I can say
dot other activity now here I can say
dot default
right so I can bring in the default here
so that is how you can have all the
other activities you see the activity
name in action and you will get to see
something called as a default so this
activity is or not the launching
applications so just to keep it simple
now when you don't see anything here now
by default it is called as the default
activity the any other activity that
what the compiler is going to or what
your Android ID is going to create
everything is going to be the default
activities by default now the other
activity is the default activity that's
please to remember this and that is how
it happens let me move on to my slide
now we saw an activity is the window
representation of any application and
Android it serves as an entry point to
the user interaction now because you
have to give the user name and password
each activity has a layout file where
you can place your UI right now I have
shown you what exactly is your and how
the UI can be brought on top of your
application an application can have
different activities I have shown you
how many default activities that you can
have in your applications so that's
about your activity now comes the most
interesting and the important aspect of
the Android that happens to be the
activity life cycle now you have to
understand something here
whatever the applications that you have
cooperated in your phone all the
applications are working or three of the
applications would have killed because
the Android does not have much of
resource so it would have deleted few of
your applications now you don't have
anything called as an execute or you
don't have anything call doesn't delete
now after installing all the
applications will live in your phone
there is something that what you have to
remember and I am going to build upon
this as you start producing for the Dom
now when you start looking at the
activity lifecycle now you click on your
application let me say that you're
clicking on the gallery now that
activity is launched meaning you have
copied your compiled it and you have
launched your gallery application onto
the emulator
or onto the phone now the very minute
the gallery application is going to come
up meaning you are starting your
application it calls the function called
as on create this happens to be a kind
of constructor for your Android
applications
now when I say constructors what rings
in your mind is the Constructors cannot
be called repeatedly the constructor
will be called only once when the object
is coming into the scope and that is
what exactly happens in your activity
where the activity is coming up for the
first time the constructor is getting
called then comes to unstart now this
after on create the control will come to
unstart where in your activity is
getting ready to start now as of now I
don't want to talk more about it and
this I will come back and I will tell
you the meaning of unstart in a minute
from now now the control comes to on
create it goes to one start and it goes
to on resume right now you will be
curious to know what exactly is resume
I'm going to come to it now comes the
activity and it is running your activity
is running now guys what you did you
clicked on the gallery now the gallery
is running now I did not talk about the
started resume event it is in hospital
I'm going to come back to it now the
activity is running as a snow now
imagine a call is going to come in now
the call has the highest priority in
your phone right now
when the call is coming and you cannot
hold on to the gallery the gallery will
go away and you have to take the call at
that point of time the gallery that what
you have been working on is will go to
on pause mode whenever other application
comes up on top of the stack that means
when it is stringing up when it is
coming up or you would have gone and
clicked on whatsapp or you have gone and
clicked on Facebook now as that pod
esker and the gallery will go in the
background not only they call it can be
any of the other applications the
gallery will go into the background
that means it is going to say on pause
right the application is going into the
calls mode now when the application is
going into the pause mode guys do
remember the activity is that what you
are trying to run you are running the
activity with a space with the time and
space complexity and you have lot of
problem with the memory and you don't
have the Android does not have primitive
memory to give to all the applications
generously so at that point of time all
the variables that what is being related
to the activity that what has been
running at that point of time and it is
going to get quelled it is going to get
destroyed so to avoid that the very
minute the control comes to unpause it
becomes your job to store the value into
the shed preferences or into any of the
local variables and that is what you
guys will be doing in on pulse all right
now when you want to resume now after
pause you want to resume now how this
can happen now let me say on top of your
activity a dialog box came in dialog box
is not a complete application no
momentarily a dialog box is coming and
at that point of time your application
can go to on pause and when the dialog
box goes away from your application the
control can go to on resume and your
application can resume and this is where
I told you I will come back to it now in
such situations the dialog box is away
and your you're going to come to resume
and you're going to start your work and
that is a momentary disturbance at work
you have noticed now a call is coming in
now when a call comes in the control
will go over the on pulse that means
your application has to be paused and
eventually your application also should
be stopped the very minute you all can
see the stop here that means you are
going to lose all the data that which
has been held with the variables in your
application that is what exactly is
going to happen when it comes to
unstruck now you guys can prepare
yourself and on pulser a non-stop to
store to save all the variables and
shared preferences or with your local
variables then comes to on Z start that
means when your application when you are
done with a call
the control will come to restart and the
control will go to start now when a
control goes to start now it is Europe
option to have to bring all the values
back in your own start now let me say in
oncreate
your you guys are going to declare
variables like integer I is equal to 0 K
is equal to 0 by starting you wanted
those variables to start from 10 say I
is equal to 10 and K is equal to 10 so
whenever your application comes to the
start mode you want to start from that
and that is what is going to happen here
and it retrieves or whatever the value
that you would have stored and in your
shed preferences and you will be
retrieving it here and on star and on
set and it comes to on resume and again
your activity will start running because
you gave all the values back to it so
that you will not feel the activity lost
the control the activity is almost able
to die and it came back into action all
those things you cannot make out here
but literally that is the scenario that
what you have gone through right here
now when the apps with higher priority
needs memory now your application has
gone to the stop mode meaning you have
been watching the gallery after that you
clicked on Facebook then you move on to
whatsapp then you move on to so many
other applications you forgot the
gallery itself often it for a week you
don't even remember the gallery you
don't care for it because somebody said
hey this picture is good and you watched
at and after that you don't care for it
so that gallery has been there in your
memory for a week and then the Android
realizes that this application has not
been used for a while now at that point
of time the Android in turn will clear
the resources now that is when the app
process will get killed that means your
gallery is no more it is dead now then
the user navigates to the uncreate
activity that means the gallery is gone
and you're off to rice creating a new
program whenever the new program is
coming up obviously you guys are in your
oncreate alright guys so this is how and
this is what it is all about the life
cycle of your application let us go
quickly take a look how this works
now we do have the last interesting
stuff that happens to be on destroy now
whenever you guys click on the back
button now the back button meaning you
don't want that application that's what
you mean when you say I don't want the
application you're designing the
application that is when the ondestroy
gets called
now when the ondestroy gets called now
if you want to bring back your
application all over again going and
clicking on your icon now your
application has to start all over again
from oncreate when the application is
dead it has to start from the beginning
meaning only in two situations the one
create will work whenever you press the
back button the application is destroyed
so when you want to bring back the
application it has to work from on
create or your application has not been
used for a long time the Android killed
it
now whether you want to bring it back it
has to come through on create and this
is all the oncreate only in this two
cases the oncreate will come into the
picture or when you are running the
application for the first time right so
you can have it as three different
scenarios run it for the first time you
will go through on create when the
memory is when Android is struggling for
memory it has deleted your application
and when it has to come in all over
again it will go to on create alright so
then you have clicked on the back button
and when you want the application back
it will start from on create these are
the three cases that you guys will be on
to on create write so on destroy means
it is activity shut down so there is
before I'm on to intense let me walk you
through a brief code of what exactly you
guys have understood till now let us see
let us take a quick recap of what you
get is a blunt now guys you know all
this now I am NOT teaching you how to
write the application and how to write
on start on resume on puss and when you
bring in when you start on create I told
you this is a constructor and now
uncreate is going to be here and you
have seen on cert on resume on pause on
stop on destroy everything is right this
now you know what let me compile this
code to see what exactly is going to
happen now our application
is running now imagine some other
application has to come up not now in
the situation now let me bring in this
now let me click on this rectangle now
you see so many applications were
already there alright now let me click
on the browser now when I click on the
browser you all can see the Google
application right here when the Google
browser came up obviously your
application has taken the backseat that
means your application has completely
gone out of focus now let us go back to
this program now let me minimize this so
that we can have this guy here now in
this case you all can see that you're in
unpause and you're in on stock that
means your application your application
came into the pause mode and your
application came into the stop mode now
your application is this in the back
burner
no if you leave it like this for a long
time the Android if at all if the
Android needs the memory need this space
then the Android can even destroy your
application or if you want your
application to be back by clicking on
this you can see your application back
and let me bring my application back
here you should be seeing your
application right here let's prepare for
Android guys watch me clicking on this
now when I click on this now obviously
you know it is not going to call no as
of know you're in on posi non-stop no it
is not going to call on create alright
now I just click y'all can see it called
on resume right it just called on start
and it called on resume and it came back
to your application now let me click on
the back button this one now obviously
this has to call your own destroy now
watch your application went out of focus
and here if you see in the logcat y'all
can see that it is called on destroyed
alright now again I am going to click on
this rectangle and I am going to bring
this application back when I click on
this application evidently you all
should see on create start and
because after on destroy your
application has to come up all over
again so at that point of time the
application is going to start fresh
right from uncreate let me click on this
y'all can see you are calling on create
on start and on resume guys that's it
and this is about your activity life
cycle now let me go back to my
powerpoint yeah so it's the time for us
to understand what our intents now most
of you would have been used in tents
most of you would have used in tends to
the depth and few of you would have used
in tents to a very shallow level now to
understand the intent intent happens to
be the backbone for your Android and
this intense is originated from the
kernel it is not that you are just
trying to call an activity using an
intent there are lots of things that
what you have to look at when it comes
to intense now let us take a brief look
on intense now when you guys think about
an intent
you always think oh to call the second
activity being in the first activity if
I have to call the second activity I
have to use an intent obviously this is
what will ring in your mind now first
activity click me it takes you to the
second activity and it says you are in
the second activity now that is one of
the ways that the intent is used but
that's not all an intent is the
messaging object you can use to request
an action from other app component now
guys do remember whenever you start
working on the activity an activity is
also called as a component and I am
going to down the line I will be
explaining why it is a component it and
how it has been looked as a component
now the most important thing is when we
talk about the components as you all can
see here and intent as a messaging
object you can use to request an action
from others app component now when we
talk about a component here you can see
the highlights here you can see activity
service and broadcast now you may get a
oh my god by the start activity is a
component now when I say start service G
I agree it's a component because it's
the process it runs in the background so
it can be called as a component send
broadcast can be called as a component
because I'm broadcasting a message that
is what measuring in your mind guys do
remember what you have learnt is when
you guys create an activity you guys
have created an activity the nameless
activity and we called it as the
component within now if you want to
write a calculator now the calculator is
of no use for you and you want your
calculator to be a component so any of
the other applications which is there in
your phone should be able to spring up
and use the calculator and that is how
your activity can be called as a
component because in the activity you
have written a calculator which can be
used by any of the other applications
just instead of just using it by your
own self
now methods are used to deliver intense
to different component now whenever you
call you're going to call the components
as start activity start service and
start broadcast yes please do note that
you have something called as a context
dot start activity now in the interviews
and this is going to be a vital question
that they're going to ask you why is
that you call it as context now all if
you'd ever understood context please oh
it's like at this point as this dot
start activity guys it is just not about
this pointer this is a world by itself
and this is ways they will hold you for
ransom in the interview and you have to
have a very good knowledge and an
in-depth knowledge about the context
using the context at what time you are
using the context and why context now
down the line I will be explaining all
these things to please hold on till then
now how do you use how do you call from
one activity how do you call the other
activity as it's fairly simple now when
you click on a button the second
activity can be called using the intent
is it right all the few would have seen
that now let me quickly take you to the
code render will show you probably what
is that you guys will be doing now here
you are not going to click on any button
now
let me just say intent intent now this
is how you are going to use an intent
now I'm just going to call it as an
intent now here I'm going to call this
as this now you all should know the
meaning of this it is very important
sometimes we also write main activity
dot this and then you're going to call
the other activity dot class right so
that is how you guys are trying to fire
the other activity and you're going to
call start activity and you're going to
call you're going to give your intent
right now this is how you are calling
right from being here in this object and
you are trying to call the other
activity and this is where you're
calling start activity of intent now
guys I told you this intent happens to
be the binder and this in turn comes
from the kernel and this in turn binds
your subjectivity to the other activity
and you have got lot of stuff that what
you can look at it at the latest state
and about the intent now as of now this
is all the intent is going to work now
when I run this program you will not see
the main activity you are going to see
that you have landed in the other
activity and there is what you guys all
out to see now look at this y'all can
see that you're in the other activity
because I called my intent right here
guys this is what you have learnt as of
now this plainly about an intent all
right so there are three components
important components activity
service and broadcast though they may
ask you a question how many important
components are there in your Android no
incidentally when we talk about intent
there is also a subtle difference to
this we also have something called as
the content providers and the content
providers are not there in this diagram
because that happens to be it is even
more complicated it is even more
powerful than intent and the content
provider in turn indirectly uses a
binder to it and there are actually
there are four components that is
activity service broadcast content
Reuters and this is what it is all about
when it comes to this
now when it come to the intent now be
also how to call the start activity hand
we also hope you edit it up in the other
activity that is one way of calling the
intent now then I will in fact the
official you later I will be taking you
through how to start a service and that
also is an intent I'll very soon your
receipt and you will understand how to
call service and how to call the
broadcast now it's almost the same way
that you guys are going to call now
whatever that you have seen here so far
now this happens to be the explicit
intent no we are moving on to the
implicit intent what exactly is that now
in the previous case what did you all do
you said intent main activity dot this
comma other activity dot class that
means you knew the name of the other
activity to call but when you do not
know the name I want to call an activity
and I don't know the name of the
activity now the activity has to do
something now that is when you we use
the implicit intent now let us take a
look at the implicit intent now implicit
intent is when the target component is
not defined in the intent and the
Android system has to evaluate the
registered components based on the
intent data now many of your activities
in turn would have been imbibed by
intent action view know which activity
has to help you which activity has to
give a service to you it all depends on
the data that what you are given in this
you are a person now if the data matches
right hand side your activity now your
activity is going to come up and your
activity is going to run now at the same
time now if you have five activities
that is been imbibing action view and at
that point of time whenever you are
running the program you guys are going
to see the five activities but when you
click on you a specific application if
that application can deal with this
pulsus www is a record at Ko and your
application will be called and this is
how the implicit intent in turn is some
other program
which is sitting inside the packet
manager and then you run an Intendant
when you call intended action view this
in turn will go as the packet manager
how many of you with you has action view
then the packet manager says hey five
applications has the characteristics
called as the action called as the
action you and what do you want me to do
with it and then you are trying to pass
the URL puzzle of it or a color cook
then the packet managers in turn will
pass this ad recorder go to all the five
applications whichever the application
can handle it is handle it so that that
is when you guys can call it as a
component you are not going to call it
as an activity or just as an application
now without even knowing your
application name and you passed the I
mean you gave the URI passes the data
your application was able to catch the
ten your application was able to execute
it now let's take a brief look at this
particular point now all that I will do
here is let me see if we can copy and I
will just go here and the instead of
this I am just going to oh yeah the
entire line I've got it right so let me
paste it here now the URA I have to
resolve this errors like this and we
have the intent right in the previous
case you called with the mainactivity
comma the other activity dot class that
is very clear and very specific kind
your targeted at it and it said okay
call him and hit it called no we in our
application the other activity cannot do
this job now we don't even know which
application we are calling and who is
going to render this work for us right
now we are going to request the packet
manager now whoever can do it please let
them do it now that is how you are going
to call this particular intent now let
me run this program
watch what happens now
all right guys can you see that you are
able to load the ADA rekha portal here
and that is what happens who did this
for you nobody knows it is not your
application and that is why we call an
application as a component and your
application end of the day your
application has to be a kind of service
droid er anybody can use your
applications to get the work done guys
this is a very interesting concept and
we train for almost about to us just on
the intent and how to write this
characteristics and all that in a de
Rica so if you want to know more about
it and if you want to go really really
deep into it to the level of your
framework and if you want to write the
intense please think about signing up
with Erica and you're going to get the
best end of the day right so this is
what it is now let me quickly go back to
the PowerPoint now what it is called as
the most important thing that you guys
should remember in the interview they're
going to ask you what is an implicit
intent what is an explicit intent those
words are confusing though when it is an
implicit intent the previous program
intent here new intent of main activity
door dis comma other activity dot class
start activity that happens to be the
explicit intent now the implicit intent
is the action and you are giving the URI
pause whenever you give the action view
action call action dial it can be any
action and then the you are a positive
proprietary - that is what you call it
as the implicit intent please do
remember this guys and this question is
there for sure 100% that they will ask
you this question now once again we are
there with explicit intent now in the
previous example that I just took you
through and I showed you how to write
the explicit intent meaning I told you
there are two ways that is main activity
dot this and other activity dot class
then I started the activity but whereas
in this case it is just the same you are
trying to see here the lake's
sentient but you are also trying to give
the value to put extra the put extra in
intended put extra work acts as the key
value pair and you are giving the key
there is a value 1 and the value is this
is activity - the key is value to the
this value - for activity - and this is
the values that what you are trying to
give it to the Internet and you are
starting the activity now this values is
what would be transported to the
activity - so this two sentences that
can be retrieved in activity 2 with the
help of the key so that you guys should
know the value 1 and value 2 to retrieve
the keys now when we practically talk
about the explicit intent it is just
about this 2 lines and they may ask you
a question how is that you can transport
how is that you can pass a value there
are two ways one is you can use put
extra and the other way around is you
can use bundled trips to the value from
one activity to the other activity now
what is statement explicit intent is
when an application defines the target
component directly in the intent now but
it is now the target component is
activity to load class is directly been
given here the start activity that's
about it and this is what is called as
the explicit intent now again you have
seen this earlier just go back in the
video and go to the previous program and
you have already seen this now that's
the difference between the implicit and
explicit implicit is action mu and you
are a passes where you give explicit is
you're giving the target class directly
because you know him and you are asking
him to come up and that is what is your
implicit intent now the a turn of an
interesting question what are the tools
plays in Android SDK no you have the
Android emulator now the emulator is the
the the one that what you have seen so
far I've been running all the
applications in my emulator and that is
what is your Android emulator now
let me show you that emulator all over
again for you now this guy will be
hiding here and when I bring this
emulator here now this while creating
this emulator now we cannot afford to
buy five different phones to test the
product I cannot buy three inch phone
seven inch phone a tablet and a TV and
this and that and all the to compile the
product you know what I can create so
many emulators and I can start testing
my applications on my emulator that is
what I can do so this in turn will cut
the cost of buying the phone secondly
the emulator the Android emulator that
what you guys are seeing here is
typically a phone now whenever you are
trying to bring up the emulator it takes
all the time the phone takes to come up
and this is working exactly like a phone
it starts right from the board Support
Package and it comes up all the way and
it displays the content on the screen
and it's truly a phone do not come to
the conclusion that it's just a
rectangle where or it is just a view I'm
displaying my outputs no this is truly a
phone that you guys are using the phone
that's when when you all started
creating the emulator you define the
memory size you define the screen size
you said whether you wanted a Nexus
phone you said what is that you wanted
all that you define and you product the
emulator on the screen right that's what
is your Android emulator now comes the
DDMS that happens to be the dalvik debug
monitoring services this is what happens
to be the DDMS no guys the DDMS happens
to be a very vital part of your
development now whenever you complete
the program and when your program is
ready to be rolled out and it has to go
through the hardness test and that is
where the DDMS will come into the
picture now let me briefly show you what
exactly is a DDMS is all about now let
me go back to mat now let me pick some
other applications just for the heck of
it
now let me take one shared preferences
application you know yeah so that I can
give you a demo for the DDMS trip
I'm just trying to load one of the
shared preferences application as I told
you all the shared preferences in turn
uses the internal memory that is a file
system of your Android and if you want
to watch that internal memory now you'll
have to open up your DDMS right so let
me open that application now this is
application now still the process is on
now all that we do in this code is we
are going to enter the login and
password the login and password is
stored in the file system right that
happens to be the internal memory and
that happens to be the secured memory
nobody can go see what is there is a
memory because it comes into the sandbox
alright now let us see how that works
here in the meantime let me compile this
before I explain the code or before I
take you to the code
now here in the shade preferences you
guys have given the file name as login
ID eureka alright now you are going to
create the shed preferences in login ID
rekha
now whatever is the username and
password that you guys are going to type
in it will be stored in the file system
that is in login area that can be
watched
using your DDMS and that is what we are
out to do now
now let us give a couple of seconds for
him to finish compiling so I told you
the shade Preferences comes in form of
the internal storage the SD card is the
external storage no we are going to see
the internal storage with the help of
our DDMS now when you all get to let me
click on Android studio and I will go to
tools alright so again we are back to
the code and you all can see a shared
preferences application and your login
it is asking me for the login now let me
say I will click here and let me type in
Satya
and the password I'm going to give Eddie
Rekha all right now I will say login
that says at the end
Eddie records logged in now this
information is stored inside the shade
preferences now then happens to be the
internal storage in your file right now
how do I see that where do I see that
now all we have to do is we have to go
get our DDMS so I'm just going to go to
tune but you have to understand
something here we always end up this
DDMS Android device monitors and your
application this two guys or rivals when
this application is running your DDMS
will not work you have to have either of
this on at any point of time so now I am
going to turn my Android device monitor
on now this is where the DDMS is going
to come in alright so we have the
application now here the packet name is
example cog layout I have given now you
all can see this as example cogniat
now one of the characteristics that I am
trying to bring in here and this is what
is your DDMS and this is all the DDMS
looks and here is this we can do we can
check the heap of your application or we
can check the threads of your
application and I can start profiling I
can start method profiling and I can
check like very exactly your program is
sluggish know this is what is called as
the profiling now this in turn will
start recording your application as it
runs and it starts telling you very
exactly your application is sluggish and
very exactly your application is good
and so on so forth all those information
it gets it for you and that is where you
do the method profiling and we can do
the trace view analysis and a lot of
stuff can be done in DDMS now as we
start going further down and I'm going
to bring you back into those
explanations no I just wanted to show
you what kind of tools the android
supports now one of the most powerful
and the most important tool happens to
be this DDMS now by clicking on the file
system though click on
the data now we are getting to the
internal storage click on the data again
you click on the data now this is where
all the files that is available in the
emulator in different sand boxes have
been shown to you now we need to get to
example cog layout this is all calm now
we have example called layout and then I
can see the shared preferences now y'all
can see the login ID Rica dot XML right
now this is what is present inside the
shared preferences and if you can see
the icon here it says pull file from the
device I can pull this file out now
login ID recorded XML now I just want to
show it in my let me say documents login
login ID recorded XML I've just stored
it in documents now I am saving it know
being in my file I can open I can go to
my documents
let me go to my documents and then we
all know it is login
Eydie record xml let me click on this
and you all can see that I typed Satya
and I typed a Drakkar as the password no
you all can see this year and this is a
secured information that what you all
have stored it in your file system and
that is what is your DDMS and there is
one of the activities that what we all
can see and we saw how to pull the data
out of the file system and only you can
do it because you're the owner of the
application no one else can lay their
hands on to this and this is how you can
pull the data and you can see what data
is present in your file system now this
is one of the characteristics of your
DDMS now we have got lot more to talk a
lot more to discuss as we start
progressing as we start going further
down I'm going to explain this to you
now as us now what is that you guys have
seen is what is the Android emulator we
have seen then the DBMS the dalvik debug
monitoring system is what we have seen
at a very high level
now comes the a apt happens to be the
Android asset packaging tool guys now
the apk that what you all have seen is
being made out of this Android asset
packaging tool and this happens to be
one of the tools which is available in
your build folder and whenever the apk
is created and the apk is created all
the files the jar files and all that it
has been zipped and has been put in to
the dot apk with the help of this
Android asset packaging tool so this
happens to be the default tool and you
may not have to do much with this
particular default tool and if you go to
the build folder and you guys will get
to see this apt all right now comes the
other important thing that happens to be
the ADB that happens to be the Android
debug bridge
now this ADP happens to be the Android
debug bridge now
whatever we do we do with the help of
the IDE to compile the program and to
put the program into the emulator and we
when two DDMS and we pull the file out
of the DMS all that work or and lot many
things can be done with the help of the
Android debug bridge without the ID no
this is what can be done so further down
in fact we're going to talk more about
the Android debug bridge at that point
of time I'm going to show you how to use
couple of functionalities in via this
ADB okay now in this session you guys
have learnt about debut later about the
DDMS about the apt and the adb now what
exactly is the Android runtime no off to
the runtime you guys will hit that a apt
right the packaging stuff okay now let
us take a look at the runtime now it's
fairly simple now Android runtime has
the dalvik virtual machine and core Java
libraries in Java you all saw the Java
Virtual Machine and Android you guys
ought to see the dalvik virtual machine
right now
DVM is optimized for low processing
power and low memory environments
now the dalvik virtual machine is meant
to run on this smaller devices with a
very little memory and very little
powers that is nothing but your mobile
application right and that is where the
DVM will come handy and that is where
you're going to see it predominantly
you're going to see a difference between
the java virtual machine and then the
dalvik virtual machine now unlike Java
Virtual Machine the dalvik much virtual
mission doesn't run the dot class files
now the dot class files is just the
files that what has been created by Java
and it stops right there and no
henceforth the dot class files has been
converted instead of dot class files the
dalvik virtual machine will be using the
Dex file right now it uses the Dex files
now it really started the Dex file
started coming into the mushrooming up
from the prior two point two now take
Orton lot of other interesting
characters into the deck Dex file that
is the text file you understood what
exactly it is right low processing power
and the low memory environments and the
DVM that is where the DVM comes in and
the DVM in turn will create the text
files and Dex file in turn has got
something called as the JIT called as
the just-in-time now when it comes to
the just-in-time no that's really very
interesting when your program takes
about three minutes to compile after
that you would have added two more lines
to your source code when you compile it
is take milliseconds and your program is
ready to go but if you try to do so in
others operating system environment if
you recompile and you take three minutes
all over again but in Java it doesn't it
compiles only that small little tiny
bits of code that what you have modified
and your application will run and that
is what is called as the just-in-time
now Android 2.2 Froyo brought trace
based just-in-time
application into dalvik optimizing the
execution of the applications and
dynamically compiling frequently
executed short segments of their
bytecode into native mission code right
then the short segments the three lines
that what you have added it compares
only that it adds up to the bytecode and
it brings it on to the mission and that
way it sim masks ibly it improve the
speed of your
compiling now here y'all can see the
diagram Java source code Java compiler
Java bytecode Java bytecode and finally
it turns out to be the java virtual
machine now when you look at it from the
Android perception Java source code Java
compiler Java bytecode and then comes
the the Java C till here the dot class
is there into the picture because you
all have seen the other activity had the
dot class in it
after that the Dex intern will take over
and then the dalvik bytecode comes into
the picture then the dalvik executable
and then the dalvik virtual machine will
come into the picture
after this the AAPT will come into the
picture and it packages everything into
the dot APK file and
that's what it is all about when it
comes to the run time now again what is
your DDMS now we are going to go little
more deeper into the DDMS that what we
saw previously it stands for the dalvik
debug monitor server it gives the wide
array of debugging features one is the
port forwarding services guys this is
very interesting and this has got
something to do in depth for example
your your connecting one of the
healthcare devices into the phone now
the healthcare devices in turn brings
the data through the serial port and the
data has to be forwarded to your foot
now that port is a different port and
the port that what you are using on your
phone is a different port and that is
when you guys will be using something
called as the port forwarding services
meaning you can transfer from one port
to the other port and you are telling
your program that hey look from this for
take all the data and use it on the
other port meaning from the computer
take the data from that port and use it
on your Android phone right on this
particular port guys there are two ways
of looking at it one is using the ADB
you can do the port forwarding or by
using writing the NDK programs and you
guys can start tweaking the data from
the port that way the data is coming
from it can be spooled and it can be
read into a file so after that from the
file you can transfer the data you can
forward the port data on to the other
port which is there on your phone now
this is the two different ways that we
can use for the port forwarding so now
let me quickly take you to the
developer.android.com just in case if
you have any doubts like this now that
is the ultimate guide for you now let me
want to the Android debug bridge now I
am an ADB and as I scroll down now you
guys will get to see the port forwarding
right here nobody is if you want to go
really deep into it all these things is
stitched into the course and you guys
will be learning how to write the
applications and how to do how to rig it
up professionally that is what you guys
are going to learn and since this is
been an entry question and I am just
taking you through this and I'm just
enlightening you what exactly is the
port forwarding no guys please take a
look no this is where it is now you have
the tcp/ip protocol and the port for the
tcp/ip protocol is presumed as six one
zero zero from your computer and that
port you want to forward it on to the
seven one zero zero on to your emulator
your emulator port happens to be or the
device code happens to be 7 1 0 0 and
your computer put happens to be this and
you want to transfer the data from your
on a forward this port to the other port
and this is what you mean now you know
what you can just copy this and you go
to the emulator if you are using the Mac
it is terminal if you are using your
Windows operating system it is going to
be your command and all that I am going
to do is just copied this and press
return and it's true it works
beautifully and you all can see and
there is no error cropped up and you
forward it the port 6 1 0 0 to the place
of 7 1 0 0 and this is what it means to
you but going deep it's a different
world altogether and there are two ways
as I told you using NDK we can retrieve
the data from port 6 1 0 0 and we can
push it to the port 7 1 0 0 or using adb
we can do that that that's quite a bit
of jog and the professionals the the
companies like healthcare companies and
you a lot of billing companies who are
the people who use the serial
communications or tcp/ip communications
and all that and they use this port
forwarding very commonly and it is a
must for you all to know the meaning of
the port forwarding to be a good
programmer now let me go back know we
have the screen capture on the device
now when you are running your
application now you want to know what
exactly
happening at the emulator when your
application is running so at that point
of time you may want to capture the
screen no let me see well how is that it
is possible now let me take you back to
the DDMS because it's already there and
here you all can see the camera and you
all can see as of now we have logged in
to this screen that is the layout and
you all can see the Satya and the ADA
records right there and let me click on
my camera right now this guy is going to
capture y'all can see it captured the
image now let me reduce the size of the
screen now as we scroll down you all can
see now this is what it does now you all
can see here for GH 0 8 and there is an
image that what has been captured and if
you save this gets saved on to see look
at this this is the device image that
what has been captured and this can be
stored onto the document file and the in
form of a PNG and that is what it is and
this is how it allows you to take this
screen when you're executing your
program so the DDMS now this is where
you saw how to capture the screen right
in your DDMS and there is one of the
option what your DDMS is giving you that
is all about the screen capture on the
device you also how to do it
now comes the thread and heap
information now when you are running
your application by default your Android
application has a thread in it and the
default it uses the heap obviously now
how do you track it how do you get to
see the threads and how do you know how
the thread is running and the behaviors
and how do you check on that now let me
take you through the DDMS all over again
and show you how that works now here
I've clicked on my example application
now I told you that I can by clicking on
the heap this is update heap I clicked
on the heap you can see this green bin
here and this happens to be the thread
and update rates when I click you all
can see the thread and I have I have
roped in the thread and the heap into my
profiling
now here so far you have been looking at
your file explorer now you can check on
your threads now how your application
has been working all that information is
present here on your threads and you can
also check the heap now the heap
information called garbage collector now
this is the heap information that what
you all can see here and if you guys are
interested in knowing more and you're
always welcome to sign in with ADA raker
and this is not a simple stuff if if the
things that have been simpler I'd have
told you how it works and what it is all
about but this needs lot of time for you
guys to understand what it is right now
comes your method profiling now I
stopped the method profiling the row
where I turned quite some time back now
here you can see a small window hiding
here now this is the beauty of Android
now when I told you your application has
to go through the hardness test and this
is where your application is landed and
no because in our application we hardly
have said hello world
no nothing is happening now this
rectangle that what you guys can see
here and this is ways it does all the
method profiling because our application
does not have anything and here you will
get to see lot of blocks this colors
that what you are seeing here the blue
green red when all that those colors you
will see chunk of blocks and every color
will mean very exactly responding to
your program the bigger the chunk your
program is bad that means you have
you'll have a lag in the code and your
program is not really doing good and
that is what you guys will get to
understand here now
I just want to take you through the demo
because I'm not taking you through any
of the proper applications just because
the applications that what we have been
using through that itself I did this
profile tracing and I'm just trying to
show you what exactly is going to happen
and how it is going to happen and that's
about it guys that's about the profile
tracing and as I told you all this in
turn will consume a lot of time for you
guys to learn and easily I would say
a person with about 2 years of
experience you will put his hands into
all this stuff right so this is
available for you as soon as you sign a
pretty raker maybe in the sixth or
seventh session you guys will be working
on all this now you saw how to check on
thread and EEP and also I gave you the
profiling which is not right here
then comes the logcat now the logcat is
a very important stuff in your
application
now here the logcat is this at the
bottom left corner of the screen i can
click on that and this log cat in turn
will show it will take you through the
application and it will show you the
vivid behavior of your application where
the errors are coming and where it is
doing good and all the traces and all
everything the PID and t ID and the tag
of your application everything gets
displayed here in your log right so
that's about the log cat and you will
get the application traces just in case
if you go wrong you will get to know
very exactly you've gone wrong just in
case if you want to have a tag if you
want to trace your application the log
cat is going to help you and this is
where you all can see the log cat in
your DMS now it is not about log cat
like where you see the log cat and DDMS
is what is the question now incoming
call and SMS spoofing now how do you
know that you have an SMS or you want to
pretend as though you're going to send
an SMS to somebody else now there are
two ways now I am just roping in my
emulator no I'm going to click on the
three dots when I click on the three
dots you all can see it is about the
location now you see the latitude and
longitude and I can spoof the
information meaning I produced it and by
clicking on send this information will
be sent to one of the emulators this is
what you call it as spoofing now because
you're working on the emulator emulator
cannot really get the locations or it
cannot get the cellular information or
the battery or the phone now look at
this this is ways you are trying to send
a message SMS message to
your emulator this is what you call it
as spoofing now can you all see this now
you received it right so y'all can see
the negative suite now this is what your
received this is what you call it as the
message spoofing but guys watch the
difference now the people he says that
is indeed EMS but I am showing you the
location spoofing cellular battery phone
spoofing everything right at the
emulator now earlier it used to be in
DDMS and the DDMS is not supporting this
information anymore inside the DDMS and
they have given all this stuff to the
emulators and by clicking the three dots
right at the emulator and this
informations or this things is available
in emulator please do not go back to
DDMS for all this stuff just to confuse
you they may ask you in DDMS take me to
DDMS then show me the SMS or location
spoofing now in DDMS it is not dead it
is as simple as such and you have to
come here and you can check on all this
stuff
alright so let me close this and let me
push this guy back and let me go back to
my slides now let us see where we are
now
guys you all saw the SMS proofing and
you all saw the location data spoofing
there is a latitude and longitude also
can be spooked in your emulator itself
and this too cannot be seen on the
emulators anymore sorry on the DDMS
anymore and this you can see it right on
your emulator alright now what exactly
is the meaning of the file folder and
the app like explain briefly about the
important file and folder when you
create a new app now all if you know
that when you create an act this is what
you guys will get to see out of which
when you see this app you will see this
man assistant there you will get to see
the manifest file in Java you all will
see the app file income example I XI dot
by applications days you guys are going
to see the apps whatever the apps that
you're going to write and really
click on the zero you're going to see
main activity application right here now
this Android test and Android the other
small little thing that what you are
trying to see here this is for testing
like you guys are going to learn about
the espresso test and unit test and all
that and that testing is going to come
in this two particular packages and as
of now the app app comes in the Java and
under the first package it describes the
fundamental character of the app and
defines each of its components right now
getting bad sorry this app is all about
the manifest his talking but now getting
back to the Java this contains the dot
Java source file of your project by
default it includes main activity dot
Java source file now here in the Java in
this first package you're going to have
the main activity source file in the act
all everything related to the main
systems all been stormed meaning the app
in the manifest that whatever the
information that you guys see under the
app is the fingerprint of your
application and that's what is stored in
manifest under Java the file that
whatever the file main activity that
what you have created is what has been
stored here and in resource it is a
directory for files the defines your app
user interface now in resource if you
want to put all the pictures it can go
into drawable and the buttons icons
pictures it can go into equipment to
load that onto the various devices and
various sizes to devices and in layout
you guys can have your UI and in values
you can have your strings dimensions and
Lucas and all that is going to go there
into it now comes the greatest Clips now
this happens to be the auto-generated
file right you are not going to do
anything there and it is automatically
been generated now that in turn will
have the various build versions compiler
versions and SDK versions and the tons
of other stuff like the flavors true God
and lot many things and we don't have
the libraries anymore and Android and
those are the dependency
is that what you will see in form of
dependencies you will see libraries and
greatest all the stuffs will come into
greatest no greater is just not one Lane
it cannot be explained in about five
minutes and you guys have to grow the
graded right from day one till you
complete the course and throw the
greatest has been taught to you and how
to use and how to implement your own
stuff and all that has been taught to
you and the greater happens to be a very
important property of your of your
applications so that's how you guys can
look into this important files and
folders when you create a new app now
what exactly is the manifest no I told
you guys that the manifest file is where
your fingerprint of your application is
stored now let's take a look at the
manifest now in fact I walked you
through the manifest when I open my
application
now the manifest file provides essential
information about your app to Android
system the system must have before it
can run know for example what exactly is
the main activity here no it is going to
tell your Android that hey the main
activity happens to be the launcher and
he is the launcher and he is a key guy
is going to run now what kind of an icon
that you want to have when the
application is is installed in the
emulator on the phone now in the mid map
you would have put a nice butterfly and
you may say hey that the butterfly is
the icon that I want out my company icon
is that I want to pull in and what do
you want to call your application as and
so on so forth all these informations
has been bundled up in the manifest no
whatever the information that you have
in the manifest is being controlled up
by your package manager now if you have
10 applications in your emulator or on
your phone you will have 10 manifest
files all the manifest files has been
stored and it has been taken care of by
the packet manager and packet managers
is responsible to take care of all the
applications what is running in your
Android no comes the exception no guy is
all if you know the meaning you know the
meaning of executions and you have seen
how to create X
in Java and you know most of it but in
Android we to have exceptions in Android
even when you're using sleep now you
have to raise the try and catch flock
right even that in turn will generate an
exception so as you have a lot of
exceptions being generated out of which
you guys can find the infinite exception
now when you have the layouts like
constraint layout relative layouts of
whichever the layout and if you give a
typo for the textview just say te XT be
AE forget the W this and it while
inflating it finds that as an errors and
it gives you the inflate errors at that
point of thing very similarly you have
surface orders resource exception now
just in case I may teach you all this
but just in case if you want to figure
out how exactly this works to you now
it's very simple now copy this and don't
go to Google okay now that's what most
of you will do but I don't want you to
do that please go to
developer.android.com and just paste
this right here and this is when you
guys are going to get the right
information now surface out of resource
exception now what exactly is that it is
already there exception thrown when
canvas couldn't be locked canvas
rectangle or when surface texture could
not successfully be allocated right now
the canvas has to be locked for many
reasons right when you are trying to
render an image you don't want something
else to happen on top of that surface so
you want a lock and just in case if you
are not able to lock or or if anything
if you're goofing up at that particular
point now it will give you the exception
thrown that when the canvas cannot be
locked and that is what you call it as
the surface out of resource exception
now very similarly you have surface
holder badge surface type exception
right so now guys this is the authority
for you right so just
put that right here and you have your
answers and you guys have learned how to
use the developer studio also at this
point of time now you need not even have
to click here it says okay there's
nothing much now it is again the same
exception that is thrown from lock
canvas when called and surface those
type of surface type pushed buffers
right so the same almost a similar kind
that you all can see here let me go back
now comes the window manager now I told
you about the window manager now he
manages this frame he manages your
applications he manages the view of your
applications and so on so forth right so
that's what it is now this error now
it's very difficult to remember the
exceptions it is not just about the four
exceptions there are hundreds of
exceptions for you and but the most
important exception the people who tend
to ask because these are the elementary
stuff that what you'll be working on so
you have to know about this now
exception that is thrown when trying to
add view those whose window manager
layoutparams token is invalid now that
is when when you are trying to add the
view when the tokens are invalid and
there is when the view cannot be managed
by the window manager and then it says
the bad token exception right so this is
a filler of your exceptions and that is
how the exceptions are occurred now name
the dialog box which are supported in
Android guys this is fairly simple
now you have the other dialog now the
other dialog is something like this that
what you are seeing here to the right
it's a simple dialogue it comes with the
ok and cancel buttons it's a white
dialogue nothing so fancy about it and
progress dialog now we have two
dialogues one is the spinner that is a
circle will be in front of you all the
time showing the progress or a bar in
turn will show the progress and there is
what is the progress dialogue in
progress dialogue we have spinner and
the bar now date picker and time picker
dialogue or the dialogues which has
already been created now let me show you
how to get that and how it looks now let
me stay
any of the resources I'll just go to lay
out and let me go to one of this file
and let me say I just want that time
picker now I just say time picker wrap
content wrap content and that's about it
now when you click on the design y'all
can see the time picker dialog now this
is all the time picker dialog will look
like now you can drag when you integrate
your code when you drag the hand of 8 to
12 and the time will change to 12
o'clock right and that is what you can
extract and we can it can be displayed
on your code and this is how the time
picker dialog will look like now comes
to the date picker it's fairly simple
I'll just type in the date right there
and you all can see the date picker and
under this view guys are going to see
the calendar you can see the date and by
clicking on that and you can extract the
date what the user has opted for right
so that's about your date picker and the
time picker dialog you have seen other
dialog is similar progress you already
have seen date in time picker is what
you have seen just now
now comes at another question is very
interesting what are the cool building
blocks of Android now guys you have
already seen this initially I told you
activity as a component service as a
component broadcast receiver as a
component but I told you the subtle
difference with all this in the content
providers and though an activity is a
screen represented of any application in
Android each activity has layout file
where you can place your UI now there
are two ways of looking at it one is
just as an activity now the other one is
in form of a component that is where the
implicit and explicit intent came into
the picture
now when it has been looked in form of a
component the intent will come into the
picture and your binders will come into
the picture and that is where it is one
of the building blocks in your Android
and it can do lot more than that now in
Android we are not going to look at an
application as
just like a java application as the UA
and an application now we are going to
see every activity in form of a
component because it is going to be
independent and it is not going to do
anything for itself it can of course do
something for it so it own cells and it
doesn't turn the activity in turn can
cater for somebody else like your
calculator like in any of the
applications you can write inside the
activity when it can serve as others now
content Reuters as I told you already
that in turn can share the data among
the sandboxes now when you have five
different applications running on your
application running on your emulator all
the five different applications were
using five different sandboxes no I want
to use one application data everywhere
for example let me say contacts contacts
when they write they would have written
the contact application they would have
stored all the data and form of SQLite
now when you have to when you get the
data out of SQLite and when it can when
it has to be used by others we have to
bring in the wrapper called as the
content provider and top of SQLite and
that is how the content provider in turn
can take the data from one of the
sandbox and it can be given to others
then there is ways we use use the
content holders as a wrapper on top of
your application right to take the data
hand due to others no service service is
a component that runs in the background
to perform the long-running operations
now guys you may have a doubt that oh
can I write a thread that can do
downloading job from the server no the
answer is no because when the
application guides the thread also will
die say employs the service so that when
the application dies the service will
not die so service and can do a better
long-running operations without
interacting with the user even works if
application is destroyed
so even if the activity is destroyed the
service will go on working and it will
download the data and it finishes the
work and then Israel it has been
prominently being called as one of the
important components then comes the
broadcast receivers this in turn can
receive the data from any others
hardware
equipments or from the other
applications from a different sandbox
can send a broadcast to all the
applications which is there in your
device so in broadcast you have local
broadcast you have remote broadcast you
have ordered broadcast yes the local
broadcast being in the project sending
the messages among your activity is the
local broadcast remote broadcast as
broadcasting among all the applications
which is present in your emulator
ordered broadcast is when you receive in
what orders that you want to receive the
messages know I want to be the first
person to receive the message now after
receiving the message I can even abandon
the broadcast itself or I can ask the
other guy also to see the message as the
second person so that way you can
declare the ordered broadcast and that
is how the broadcast works and this is
the four important components that what
you guys can see in Android no guys it
is not that whatever you are hearing now
and that is always going to happen now
when the companies are working more
deeper in services they're going to
drive you crazy they're going to take
you deep into the services now here we
are trying to give you the highlight of
what is war tent we are making you feel
very comfortable with a contents and
stuff and you will be able to talk your
way through but if you want to go really
really deeper
no you have to take up a course you have
to take it up with some authorized
people so like a dareka so that you're
going to get the complete stuff and
you'll be made perfect and you will be
taught everything in detail right now
just one example now the content
providers I told you the SQLite on top
of escalate the wrapper there's a
Content Reuter content provider can
start giving the data
others now Google has started a new
searching feature in Android now the
Google intern will not really search
through the web pages the Google intern
can come into the Play Store and it can
search through all your applications
when Google is searching through your
applications if your applications has
been made shareable and your application
has a content order now Google intern
can come right into your application it
can pick the data and it can go give it
to the world so that way you can start
sharing your applications and you can
have having in fact we can incorporate a
search option on top of your content
providers and the Google intern can come
all the way to the Play Store it can
come through the search it can go to the
content Reuters and it can pull the data
out and it can give to the user so there
are lot of other creative stuff that
what we can do so do not treat just
content Reuters is content provider
services so this so this has got lot
many things to do with ADL and
components and all that broadcast
receivers to has got lot many stuff know
what you guys are seeing here is just
about the high level scenario right now
comes the content provider now this is
escalate database the app database that
what you are trying to see here now
there is wrapped up with another zapper
now what you see here the query insert
update delete now all this comes into
the frame work called as a content
provider now the content provider acts
as a frame on top of your SQLite now the
other application can query the content
provider the content provider will read
the data gives it to the other
application right now this application
can be a search application the way that
you all search on your phone on top you
will see a Google search right now when
you search this it is said the data
externally in your phone and it can also
search the data internally at that point
of time it can come through the
searchable activity it can come to the
content providers and it can go to the
SQLite it can pick the data and give it
back to the main app or even it can give
this back to the Google also there is
all more layers or
can create on top of the resent that is
how interesting your components are now
we have seen service but what is this
service in Android now it's a background
process even if the application dies
your service is going to run and guess
what it is no the local service is
accessed within the application now
within the application you can have a
service but you can have a service in
the remote applications also the service
is accessed remotely from the other
applications running on the same device
now in this case we have to bring in the
a IDs that happens to be the Android
interface definition language to share
the data between two different sandboxes
now the a deal will be vehement and it
will do all the job for you now it says
hey this is all we can extend the
service and you can implement the
program the most important thing that
what you have to understand here is when
the service dies your application will
not die the service will go on running
now please do understand the service
happens to be a part of Android but your
main activity dies but the service is
still on there is an unbelievable stuff
right now let us quickly go take a look
at the code and see how that works
now let me come back to the file let me
open up one of the applications in a
Drako
yeah let me use the
here players so that would be really
very interesting for you so that you all
can listen to the song see in fact it
service can be the location provider
also like the Google map now when you
are on Google map you are listening to
the song also and whenever it happens to
be the turns that you want to take and
the Google map it in turn will start
talking to you take a right turn at the
circle but the song will go the volume
will be reduced and then the Google map
comes up and says take the right take
the left and go around the circle and so
on so forth that means your service is
still on is it so that is how the
service works so service works as the
background process and even if your main
activity dies the service works no guys
you'll remember that when I press the
back button here
obviously your main activity will die
but you will go on listening to the song
your song is not going to die so if you
all can see just about it a small
application that I have just written
using two lines now let me open it and I
will show you how to activate a service
now here you all can see start service
inside that you are firing an intent in
intent you are giving this this happens
to be the main activity toward isn't
media player or your class now this is
ways you saw the activity can be called
using the intent so start service talk
service can be called using the intent
and even the broadcast can be called
using the intent any way the content
provider uses the intent and binder and
that so this is or the most powerful
components in Android this is the four
powerful components and Android now let
me start service this application is
called a service media player basic so
this is a kind of slow song gradually he
takes off video all can listen to it now
all right you're listening to the song
is it know what happens when I click on
the back button no I told you very
clearly your application will close
definitely your main activity will close
the service happens to be a part of main
activity if there is a case the service
also should close isn't it now let me
click on this
so did your song stop no right so it is
on it is the services on your activity
is no more your activity is dead but
your service is on and you are still
able to listen to this song yet so when
you are listening to the song whenever
you come out of this song and work on
the other application you can still
listen to the song this is how it works
now if you want to go back go back get
your application back right so I stopped
the service so that I brought the
application back then let us come back
to on create it started the application
all over and when I clicked on the stop
service now you enter this main activity
and then you enter this stop place and
it went and told the service you stopped
it now and it stops so somebody has to
start the service and somebody has to
stop the service or there are ways that
the service can stop by itself and this
is how you guys have taken a brief look
on the service right so that's about
your service now this is a very
interesting question what are the
different types of services let's see
what is it first comes the handler
service no guys you are trying to avoid
the a IDL that happens to be the Android
interface definition language and you
are trying to avoid that and you are
trying to communicate between two
different processes in the sandbox
without the ADL but using the handlers
the advantage and disadvantage the
handler service in turn can deal with
only one MB of data you cannot send as
much of data as you want into the other
process you can deal only with one MB of
data
the handler services will work on the
thread and it is a synchronous no only
one thread you can execute you cannot
bring in multiple thread into the
handler services now one thread has to
talk to the other thread no this can be
like a single chat application not a
group chat now you can talk to me you
can give send me a text and I can send
you a text you can send me a small
picture I will be sending you a small
picture
this is the kind of work your handler
cells can do then comes the intent
service now the intent service is more
or less like your synchronous calls that
means if you want to download a
photograph from the server or a movie
and you tell your program to download
the movie from the server it downloads
the movie and the service stops by
itself and there is what you call it as
the intent service now we have the third
one as the service and this happens to
be the most powerful service now when
you start the service there is no end to
it and it goes on and on and on for days
together if you want to know the way
that we went in and we stopped the
service that so you have to go in and we
have to stop the service now this like
it can be the intent service or the
service this in turn can support the ADL
also wherein you can bring in the
function so that it can start talking
between the different process and that
is all the ADL comes into the picture
and this is how the services or late and
this is all the services works and at a
very high level but we have got lot many
important things to understand and to
know about the services depending on the
experience in the intensity the people
may ask more questions like how to write
a plug-in and how to how to make the
remote services to understand with each
other hand and how to make that to
communicate and so on so forth the
people mask and that happens to be a
kind of advanced questions and all that
is there is a part of your course and
that happens to be the integral part of
your course with a Drakkar so guys we
have just seen the different types of
services so far know comes given more
interesting question what is the souls
and a thread went into can work for a
long time why not the service but we
have a problem
when a thread works for a long time the
choreographer intern will start throwing
an error it says hey you have been
working for too long and you're holding
the parent thread on a ransom and you
cannot do that so you have to spawn the
other child thread whenever your
application dies that said the fit two
will die and that is where the thread
lines into the trouble now
go quickly take a look at the
differences now when you all see the
thread since I already started talking
about it let me explain this to you a
thread is a concurrent unit of execution
that means it is a time slicing it gets
1/4 of a millisecond to execute the task
after that the operating system snatches
the control from the thread that gives
it to the second thread and the state
works in form of the round-robin concept
right ready fold all components of the
same application run in the same process
and thread called as the main thread
that is where the thread gets loaded
that is where you guys have to spawn a
child's rate then you can have as many
childhoods that you want but when your
application does all the threads will
die do you remember that is where there
is what is the disadvantage that you
will see in threads it is killed when an
application is killed know Google has
brought in a beautiful concept called as
the handlers and loopers into the
Android thread sorry it is not
JavaScript into the Android threads now
the handlers and loopers are not a part
of Java and that happens to be a part of
your Android and very interesting
concept and using this V guys can start
building the messaging architecture
between the objects like we can even say
how the objects in turn can talk with
the other objects how an object in turn
can deal with lot of multiple objects
and all those things can be dealt with
the handlers and Lupus in android
it is not Java please do remember Google
has brought in handlers and loopers into
Android threads now coming to the
surfaces now when there is a lag
executing the program and the
choreographer and when the Android
emulator will start throwing an Ian or
Android not responding error and all
that and that is when we have to take it
tur and we have to think about the
services how to write the program in a
better way so that is when forcefully
you guys will be moved on to services
now services is like an activity but as
no interface right now
is a part of the activity but servicing
in turn will go on its own and it cannot
talk and there is no interface to the
activity that we have to build on our
own using the handles in looper all we
can talk from service to a thread or to
the activity using your broadcast
broadcast is not a good idea but using
the handlers and loop as you can talk
and there are many ways to talk between
the service and activity now service is
not a separate process now it works in
the background until the service or
someone else explicitly this stop it now
service happens to be a part of your
activity please do remember that's where
it has been highlighted and it is said
that the service is not a separate
process so this is not kills when
application is skilled you saw an
example right now right so you'll have
been hearing the song even when I came
out of the application it exposes some
of its functionality to the other
applications by calling bind service now
the bind service is a beautiful concept
in your content providers it's a
beautiful concept when you have to talk
between two different processes the bend
service will come into the picture and
this happens to be the property of
kernel and that in turn throughout
android framework the bind services and
intents are used let's take a look at
the fragment let us see what a fragment
is all about now it's fairly easy to
understand like when you all created an
application and activity had in UI but
fragment is different from the way that
you have seen the activity in UI now
first the fragment is part of an
activity no fragment is not a different
program or it is not a different element
it happens to be a part of the activity
if the activity dies the fragment is
activity pauses the fragment pauses and
it's so on so forth so the fragment
happens to be a part of activity you can
combine multiple fragments in a single
activity now when I talk about the
fragment now I can call a fragment as
many different slices of the screen now
you can see in the second example
second UI you can see two different
blocks right one is the header and body
kind of a thing now in a new eye I can
have two different blocks or I can have
five or six or ten different blocks and
that is how the fragment I have designed
now you can combine multiple fragments
in a single activity which helps us to
display multiple screen and reuse the
fragment in multiple activities now the
fragments you can add you can delete you
can change you can do all that
now when the orientation changes you
need not have to bring in another UI you
can rescale the fragment and you can
replace the fragment on the screen and
you can fill the screen up and you can
start using it so that you will not be
calling the UI so the fragment happens
to be very possible compared to the
regular activity in your programming and
you can do a lot of stuff using
fragments now what is the difference
between the fragment and activity I told
you the fragment and activity is one
when the activity is created the
fragment also becomes a part of it
activity is typically a single focused
application that a user can perform such
as dial a number take a picture send a
mail via map etc just just a single
application now when you are using the
dialer something else cannot happen now
by creating the fragment now you can
divide the screen into many different
pieces within if you want to see a
message like a banner data now I can
have a screen where in constantly my
shares information will be scrolling on
the screen even if the call comes in or
even if I am on the map right so that
way you can create fragment and
simultaneously all the fragments can
work together or it is up to you how do
you want to use it fragment is a modular
section of an activity with its own life
cycle and input events right because it
has his own life cycle the way that you
have seen the activity and which can be
added or removed now the fragment also
has the bundle and it can store the
information and bundle the way that you
have seen an activity or you can add the
fragment you can remove the fragment
that what you have created and also
fragment lifecycle is directly affected
by the host of activity lifecycle as I
told you
when activity pauses fragment pauses and
activity is destroyed fragment is
destroyed and so on so forth
now comes the apk now guys it's very
simple you all have seen how the dalvik
virtual machine comes into the picture
now when you come to the bottom of the
diagram the apk is generated it is as
simple as such though apk stands for
android packaging kit Android packaging
kit is compressed with the classes you
ice support your assets and manifests
all these files are compressed into a
single file which is called as the apk
that is a bTW right now there is the
Android packaging kit that is what you
have seen earlier and it is again it has
been explained to you now this is a
beautiful question know will Android
support any other language other than
Java now guys you already have the
answer do you remember the green block
that what I have been talking about that
is the NDK NDK supports your C and C++
NDK in turn can talk to the kernel your
java cannot talk to the kernel right
that's what you guys have learnt that's
what it is yes Android app can be
developed in C and C++ it should be used
with the NDK Android NDK that happens to
be the native development kit so while
installing Android you guys have to
install the native development kit too
and Android SDK software development kit
no both has to be installed to run your
applications so when you want to talk to
the hardware's like you want to talk to
the camera driver like you want to zoom
in you want to zoom out and you want to
do such stuff now you have to write an
indicate program that NDK files intern
is called as a dotted so files in that
intern will talk to the hardware and
eventually the dot ISO file will talk to
the application managers the application
managers will take the data all the way
up to the application level and it has
been given to you and that is where the
NDK comes into the picture right now
please do remember NDK is not a part of
your Android course and NDK is a
different animal by itself and that
happens to be a different book that
happens to be a different course that
what you
to take it up no is the content provider
like already you have seen the content
Reuter now you've got little more
initials let us see what a content
provider is all about now content
providers manage access to the structure
set of data it is a standard interface
that connects data and one process with
code running in the other process this
is what I told you guys earlier now when
you have the data and one process that
can be shared by the other process
you asked me can you show me what
exactly the content providers in the
emulator or in the phone no guys please
take a look at your contacts contacts is
eventually it's an SQLite database the
content provider has come on top of it
as a wrapper now the contacts can be
used by any of the other applications
which is running on your phone or the
emulator so as your calendar so as your
SMS all this is or the content providers
now if you write your application to
store all the movie information and data
and all that what do you do with that
information you would love to share it
with others right so bring in a content
provider that way you can start sharing
it to others and everybody can start
accessing your data updating the data
and they can do all that now they
encapsulate the data and provide
mechanisms for defining the data
security now the data what is going to
go out of your sandbox is going to be a
very secured way now you can the people
they can sign they can use the
permissions they can have permissions to
use all that security can come on top of
this content providers content providers
are used to share data between different
applications obviously you know that now
it is implemented as a subclass of
content or older players and must
implement a standard set of API that
enable another application to perform
the transactions now you guys are going
to extend the content provider by
extending the content provider you saw
in the diagram that you have on create
and there are four different functions
that what you have seen and all the
functions has been overridden
automatically that is implementable
function comes in and you have to
implement those functions in form of the
wrapper please take a look at the
diagram once again
now let us take a look at the singleton
now the meaning of singleton itself says
it all
that means an object is going to create
a single instance now let me give you an
example now you have a server or a login
no you only login by typing in your
username and password or you under login
by speech recognition or you under login
by Facebook or by Google or Burlington
now all that you do is on the single
object when a guy is trying to login
through the various sources you don't
want to create many objects now you want
to create a single object now however
you come in you have to come in through
one single entry that is what you call
it as the single instance now the other
example could be you have a city bank 1
million people in a day they want to
enter the city bank they will access the
data and resources in city bank so that
you practically cannot create 1 million
objects to let 1 million people enter
the city bank now there is where we
create a single instance where in all
everybody will get only one handle
through that the 1 million people it is
only one object is created through that
1 million people can walk into that
particular object and there is a whole
idea of creating a single object now
here how exactly that we can do this now
it's fairly simple now we have to stop
multiple people creating multiple
objects so all that you do is put the
constructor into the private area when
you put the constructor into the private
area now people cannot create the object
then create an instance variable a
static instance function the user can
access the function even without
creating the object and if the object is
not created they're going to create an
object being in that static function
called as a get instance or what they
will do is the object is created they
will written the same instance back to
the user
no guys if you have a question on this
it is fairly simple for you to take a
look now let me briefly show you
how to get to that now let me take one
of the examples and here I'll
right-click and let me go to you and let
me go to other yeah it's right here
singleton so it is before the activity
you will get to see the singleton and I
am just clicking on it and I will call
this a city bank
I'm just going to call this Citibank
single tap and it creates a complete
class for me now you all can see the
most important thing is you have created
a static function called as the Citibank
and then you are constructing an object
alright now here you have the get
instance now when the user is trying to
use the get instance you are returning
our instance alright so what is that you
are trying to do you're creating the
object here once and whenever the people
calls you are returning our instance now
here your main please do remember you
have made this is what I told you
you have made the constructor as the
trivet when it is straight nobody can
create an object now the people can
access this object of little get
instance so when they call the get
instance and you always written our
instance what has already been created
and now let 1 million people call you
will be returning the same address or
encode again and I have simplified it
and this is what is the meaning of
singleton and this is all you guys are
going to use the single term all right a
singleton class is a class which can
create only an object that can be shared
by all other classes ok that is your
singleton now what is the difference
between file class activity in Android
this is fairly simple guys now file is
the file is a chunk of arbitrary
information or resource for storing
information class you know the meaning
of class it is a compiled form of Java
file Android uses a class file to
produce the executable apk dot class
intern gets converted to apk this is
typically the Java class and that gets
converted to the apk for the execution
purpose now when it comes to activity
this is already been explained to you
and activity is comparable to frame
window in GOI now in your regular Java
when you go to the frame window a place
and all the tend to that screen it can
be compared to a toolkit it is not a
file or F file type it is just a class
that can be executed Android for loading
your elements on you now in fact you
need not even have to take
the difference or you need not even have
to compare yourself with a frame window
geo and all that and I have made it very
clear to you about the activity now the
difference between activity and UI Ouray
happens to be a part of the activity the
activity in turn will inflate the UI so
that the screen will become visible for
you and activity as such does all the
background job after bringing up the UI
element on the screen now that's about
your file plans and activity this
happens to be a very simple question now
what is it dalek virtual mission now
this in fact we have been discussing
over and over again
because you're going to get questions on
this and you already has answer that
make is the name of Android virtual
mission you guys know about it the
dollar question mission is an
interpreter only virtual mission that
executes files and dalvik executables
format this is dot Dex format now you
guys know how the dot clash gets
converted and all that you have seen in
the earlier stages the virtual mission
is register based and can run classes
compiled by Java language compiler that
have been altered into the native format
using the Dex tools now whatever that
you are trying to see here is already
been explained to you and there is what
is a Dalek and now the dalvik library
intern is envisioned to provide a family
a development base for the user
programming the java standard edition
but is really expected for needle small
mobile devices case do you remember that
I told you that dalvik is going to help
you to run the application all the small
mobile devices when you have the memory
constrained space constraint processor
constraints and all that and that is
where the DM will come handy and that is
where your applications is going to work
and whatever that you guys are seeing
here and the question 28 has already
been dealt with the previously what is
the significance of dick science now
x-files is dalvik executable files we
just zipped into a single apk file on
the device now the apk file that what
you see is
nothing as in the next file it has been
zipped it has been put into it with the
help of your a apt that I've already
told you right now text file can be
created by translating compiling
applications written in Java and Dex
file is a format that is optimized for
effective storage and memory
mathematical execution now this is
something like a worldwide in the new
bottle
now the next is a format that is
optimized for effective storage and
memory mapable executions no I told you
the Dex file is prominent it has been
used the smaller Gators then when you
have the memory problem space problem
process a problem in all that and it is
very efficient in executing in the small
environment so the small devices and
this way we bring in the experts so it
is almost a repeat now comes an
interesting stuff called as the toast
and this happens to be the most easiest
question that what can ever be asked now
all that you do is you to print a
notification for a couple of minutes we
bring in the toast now when you set the
alarm now the toast in turn will pop up
and it says hey you're going to have say
dollar room and you're going to wake me
up by after 8:00 else no that is what
the toes says and that is where we use
the toast toast is normally used to
display the short messages and it comes
up on the screen and it vanishes
now notification automatically fades in
and fades out not except in section
events so there is absolutely no
interactions and it just comes for about
few milliseconds and it says that you're
going to sleep for 8 hours and it just
vanishes now the syntax is this you say
toast dot so the very minute your type
toast everything will come up for you
now let me let me show you this so it
will be more easier for you to
understand now I presume that you guys
have already written a program now here
let me say just before this well say
toast
now let me call this that test thing
comes in here and let me call my desk
and here I will say
Ingle turn created now what it does is
this in turn will be shown this message
singleton created will be shown forego
two milliseconds at the bottom of the
screen somewhere here and it vanishes by
itself
so that it does not have any control the
user cannot click on any key or if they
cannot controller they cannot do much on
this particular toast and it is
predominantly used to display the short
term messages now but it is not
exemptions what are exceptions in
Android now we have already dealt with
this now we saw in fact I took you all
to developer.android.com I showed you
what is the inflate what are the
exceptions I explained the meaning of
exceptions in Java I told you even the
sleep has an exception will have the try
throw block on top of it very similarly
we have various exceptions which is
running in Android or a switch just
because this are the most commonly used
exceptions now I have please refer back
and all these exceptions have been
explained to you what is the use of
webview in android now there are two
ways of looking at it
one is if you want to bring in the a
drake of portals right into your android
without even writing a single line of
code or without even trying to spend too
much of time we can use the web you
objects now practically speaking this
video is a part of java it is not the
native on androids if that's what I told
you earlier and you are bringing it and
and this in turn can slow down your
system and it's not a real good idea to
bring in the webview because completely
this happens to be the Java library but
this in turn will make your life more
easier now previews of you that displays
the web page inside your application all
right now if you want to scroll back if
you want to go back to the previous page
next page home page it supports all such
features and characteristics here and in
order to add web you to your application
you have to add webview now this view
has to be added in your layout to your
xml layout file so let's
quickly take a look now how this in turn
will look like let me go to one of the
activities here now all that you do is
you just type in web you that's it and
content end that's about it and this is
what is your web you and probably you
may give a hand you here and I'm going
to call this rip you and this is how you
are going to declare the verb you to use
the web view
okay that's what is that you guys are
seeing here in order to write web you to
your applications you have to add web
you element to your XML layout file
that's all that you do and about four
lines of code that you can bring in the
complete a Drakkar portal onto android
right so that's more easier and it is
more a simpler but at the same time it
is slow so guys this is the most
important thing 100% they would ask you
about the context in android what
exactly is the context in android now
initially when we started we had
something called as gate context even
trait is this but this is slightly
phased out and we the Android they
stopped using it instead they got in
this pointer and get activity now this
pointer happens to be the addresses
object
imbibed with the UID and get activity
also it is the same thing so that it
very clearly gets the address of the the
current activity that is what your get
activity will do but when we look in to
get base context this is a kind of
dangerous proposition like you have you
guys have to know where to use it now
you simply cannot say in toast get base
context of a hello you're here no that
is really wrong now get base context in
turn is going to reflect on what you are
using now guys if you remember if you go
back to the previous lines four
components of Android you also context
dot start activity context dot start
service context dot start broadcast now
when you look at the start activity
service broadcast content provider and
all that
written type is context though we do
have something called as the rapper that
is called as the context rapper now
whatever returns is all the context type
context object now to tell you honestly
the context class happens to be an
abstract class now this in turn in turn
can written the numerous context now if
you are in service it is it in the
service context if you are in activity
to read in the activity context if you
are in broadcast receivers the in
broadcast receivers the context all
controlled and it sends that context
back to you know guys you have to be
really very careful you should know what
is that you are getting onto your hands
and that is very important to deal with
your applications so please do not
consider the gate based context as this
pointer of your object and it may be
confusing now you may feel all the for
is nothing but at this point or it is
absolutely wrong now the gate based
context in turn is very dynamic when
your application is running depending on
the situations in circumstances and
whatever the objects that you are
dealing with and that is the address
that what it is holding on to now
holding on to that address also is very
dangerous because the component that
what you're holding on to may die or
that in turn may live for a longer time
now that in turn will not allow your
application to be garbage collected and
these are the problems when this is the
memory leaks that can happen so be aware
and be very careful when you are using
gate based context now the other way to
find out more is go to
developer.android.com and you will get
tons of information and Dusan bones
about the gate based context now in
application context now for an activity
the parent happens to be the application
now the application does not follow the
activity life cycle when the activity
dies the application will not die so
thats a safe heaven for the programmers
wherein they would love to keep all the
shared preferences data in your
applications now
so because application will not die your
variables will not
a right so guys please do not you should
not inflate your views when you are at
the time of inflating the views please
do not use the application context to
inflate the views now if you do so now
the views in turn will be held by the
application forever
the views cannot be garbage collected so
that is where we call it as the memory
leak and you have to know so this gate
context gate based context gate
application context happens to be a very
crucial part of your Android programming
and you have to take a call on it and
you have to know what exactly it is even
before you use it right so it is this is
our the crucial stuff and this is what
it means to you now the storage methods
in Android now guys they have already
checked on this I told you about the
shared preferences that happens to be
the internal storage shared preferences
store provide primitive data and key
value pairs and in fact I already told
you I took you to the read EMS and I
have shown you where the data is stored
now whenever you want to give the data
it is for username give the key called
as username the value will be whatever
the user types in for the password the
key is password the value whatever the
user types in and that is all it takes
that is all the shared preferences works
with the help of the key value pair now
internal storage we have already dealt
stored private data onto the device
memory now guys I have given showed you
what exactly is the device memory in
your DDMS and that happens to be the
file system and that happens to be the
secured place that where you can store
your data nobody can sneak into it
because it comes into the sandbox
external storage happens to be so public
data on a shade external storage
that means on to the SD card you're
storing the data now SQLite database
stored in the przemek database it is
stored in the private database and it is
also being pushed into the device memory
like the way the place that where you
also the folder shade preferences very
similarly it will create a folder called
as a database and it is stored you
escalate database right there now can
you deploy the jar and Android which
package is supported by it guys please
do remember that jar file took its own
death that's about two years ago and
when we all used to work on the eclipse
of the Eclipse we don't use the jar
files anymore in Android studio in
Android studio we use the dependencies
the libraries and form of dependencies
now no Android does not support Josh
deployments applications are packed into
Android package dot apk using Android
now Asset packaging tools and then
deployed onto the Android platform no
guys do remember jar files are gone and
dead long ago but few of the
applications like your Dropbox they are
still using jar files they may ask you a
question can you point out where Android
studio is using the jar file which
application in Android studio is using
the jar file now you can easily say in
the Dropbox you have to go to the
library you have to copy the two jar
files into it even before you compile
your code and that is where they're
using the outdated stuff and they don't
consider the jar files anymore in
Android studio so don't worry about it
don't try to even go deeper into it now
what are containers now containers or
the objet holds object and widgets
together depending on which specific
items or needed and in what particular
arrangement
that is wanted that means you would
rather call the containers
relativelayout constrained layouts
percentage library as same now all these
guys in turn will help you to call the
route layout and they in turn will help
you to arrange the widgets right in that
particular containers now containers may
hold label field button or even child
containers as example now that is what
it is all about containers if you have
seen the linear layout you all have
learned how to create the child in the
linear layout right so we can create any
number of child
said the child you can create any number
of widget and that is what is called as
the containers now can you change the
name of an application after its
deployment it's a big no we cannot
change the name of the application
because it comes to the package and with
so many other properties so by changing
you may have to refactor the complete
project so the answer is a big note wait
do not do not do that now define Android
application resource files now when you
are creating the application resource we
all went to layout and saw values you
roughly saw and you came back now in
animator you can have all the animations
and animators and anime and all the
colour tables can be declared inside the
color and drawable this is where we can
have all your bitmaps images and all
that mid map you can have various sizes
of images now when you are trying to
implement when you are trying to deploy
your code onto tab now you need a
different size of bitmaps now the same
application when it has to go onto three
inch device the bitmap has to change
into the smallest of the bitmaps
and then if you are using it on 7-inch
phone the size has to vary if you are
using it on TV it has to vary now the
various sizes of your button or the
screen all the widgets you are going to
put it in mipmap depending on the device
that what you use it is it will map on
to it by itself
now XML now this XML file is yet another
interesting thing now it is XML can be
used in for many different reasons
and it is just for example when you are
writing your search application now to
define the property of search
application we have to define it in the
XML file so we have to create a folder
called as XML and we have to put
everything into it now in layout you
know all the UIs will come in here and
end values you know what exactly you saw
you saw the dimensions and all that and
where you can pad the screen or we can
set the values of you know what kind of
padding you want and what kind of
the padding you want on top or bottom or
right or left of the screen and things
like that and menus wait you are going
to bring in the menu related stuff and
draw is ways you are going to create a
folder now you can have the consolidated
data like a novel and if you want to
convert that into the local it is a good
idea to bring it and draw or if you want
to bring in a if you don't have a song
to be stored it can be stored in the
rock folder and it can be used so as
your asset now what is what is the
importance of the emulators in android
in fact we discussed about this in the
beginning itself now the emulator lets
you play around an interface that acts
as it were an actual device now I told
you very clearly it is not a rectangle
it is a phone by itself and it starts
the way the phone starts and it brings
up the application and all the
characteristics is involved when you
create an emulator that is going to be
the phone now for testing purposes you
can create five different emulator five
different sizes five different stuff you
can create and you can test your
applications on it now it is the best
way to test your applications by having
many emulators how an escape characters
used as attribute guys this is Java
question though escaped characters or
presided by double black slash for
examples if you want to write /n you
have to write slash slash n for slash
feed tab slash slash T and so on right
it is just about the double backslash
now what is it indicate now any K
happens to be a very important part of
your development this happens to be the
native development kit and in this NDK
stands for the native development kit
and you normally get to write your C and
C++ code the dot is so library to
communicate with your kernel and after
that it's supposed in the data and it
gives it back to the application
managers or it gives it back to the
application and that is how it builds a
bridge between the application and the
kernel now broadcast receivers
now this receivers in
turn can listen to the system-level
events for example a call is coming in
the broadcast receiver knows that I call
is coming in and they are not able to
handle the call the broadcast receiver
knows or when when an SMS comes in the
broadcast receiver knows about it or if
you are writing a health care device and
if it has to pump the data if this that
has to broadcast the data to your
application and you'll have a broadcast
receiver right in your application and
that will be listening to the devices
now that is what it is and even the
second line he says that you will be
listening to the events like incoming
call SMS or from any of the other
hardware that is what is your broadcast
now broad conceive will helps in
responding to broadcast messages from
the other application or from the system
now as I told you it can be a different
device even that in turn can broadcast a
message to you and a remote message and
you guys can receive it now
predominantly broadcast receivers will
help globally now you can listen to the
broadcast which has been broadcasted by
any application now when you broadcast
all the other application can listen to
what you have been broadcasting no that
is where it helps and anybody can listen
to you now in fact previously I told you
how many types of broadcasts are
available all that I have already
mentioned and to use the broadcast you
have to extend the broadcast receiver
just by using this extend broadcast
receiver you're going to get an
implementable function called as on
receive write inside this function you
guys can bring in your intent or you can
check now here got context and intent no
guys please note this is the context
that what I was talking about now when
you're in this environment the meaning
of this context is different so be
careful know this is it's a controlled
inside the controlled environment where
you say context this is not your this
pointer please to remember and using the
intent you can check from whom I am
receiving the broadcast right and if you
don't check that and you have to be
careful even a virus will be creeping
into your application so that it's
always it's a good practice
where the intent now who is sending me
the broadcast and then go ahead about it
right so that's the best way to use the
broadcast now what are the security
measures which has been taken in Android
and what makes the Android secure now
first of all all of you know the Android
application is a sandbox that is
popularly and allowed a low limited
access to the information there is very
private to the sense private and
sensitive for the user now I told you as
I told you the sandbox information
cannot be used by or seen by the other
applications whether the sandbox so that
itself is very secured and then you can
also set the permission on top of your
program and when the user is trying to
use your application they have to use
the same permission to use your
application right now and also you have
the encryption scenario for all your
messages now whatever that you are
trying to send between the applications
it has all been scripted so it is very
safe you need not have to worry about it
right so even when you are trying to
send the SMS or whatsapp or whatever it
is it is all secured because it is all
been cryptid and at the same time the
agreement you use it on everything has
been taken care of then apart from that
you have something called as the
enterprise security that happens to be
the device policies now if you use this
enterprise security you can even control
every variable the other application
uses because this device policies in
turn is going to come and forms a
wrapper on top of your application the
security application can watch at every
point of time what exactly is happening
in your application even if you want to
use a variable the super has to give
meaning the device policy has to
authenticate only after the device
policy gives a permission to you your
application will start working and that
is how the device policy has come in
informal way security for the enterprise
applications and secondly as I told you
the file system is very safe in secured
but people have hacked
now that shatters your thought isn't it
and to hold on to it and to secure the
filesystem now the cipher they have come
up with the crippling scenario and we
can use the cipher that happens with the
third-party library and you can clip the
complete data what you have is a file
system or your SQLite now as I told you
earlier about the adb now it's called as
the Android debug bridge and what it
stands for now whatever you guys do an
ID can be dealt at the command prompt
using the adb now a BB stands for
Android debug bridge and it's a command
line tool that is used to communicate
with the emulator instance and no in
fact I can give you some simple examples
when it comes to ADB now I can ask for
ADB device note you have the emulator 5
5 5 for device and this is the emulator
that what you are running on and it says
hey this is the device and you can use
the ADB port forwarding no watch I can
just ring in the ADB port forwarding
here and you can use the ADB port
forwarding and you can use the ADB to
install package to uninstall package and
to watch the logcat no I can say adb let
me say log cat right now look at this
this is all the log cat information that
what you guys are able to see here now
if you want to it is also possible for
you to pipe the log cat information into
a folder
all right so I'll say anyway logcat now
I can also type the entire thing to
logcat dot txt now everything goes right
there into the locket folder and that is
how you can pipe it now like this the
adb can used for numerous purpose and
you can completely avoid your ID when it
comes to AD and everything sorry adb
everything can be done via the adb now
the adb in turn will deal with a client
in silver which runs on your development
mission you can invoke client from shell
by using adb comment another adb tools
such as DDMS are also created by adb
clients now as i told you whatever you
guys do in ID it can be invoked by the
adb comments now guys please visit your
developer.android.com and you will get
to see tens of adb comments write this
and you simply copy that onto the
terminals and it works the way you want
now the server which runs in the
background process on your development
mission the sir manages to communicate
between the client area bitumen and
running emulator on the device now guys
when we practically look at Android now
Android intern has got two different
variations one happens to be the client
and server now server is a very thin
line and it is a bridge that what it is
trying to connect your hardware with the
client in between the server is running
now whenever the server collapses now
the client also will collapse that is
when we will get to use the adb called
as a kill server and will will call adb
start server to bring up the store once
if you are able to bring up the server
this in turn will recreate the bridge
between the client and the hardware and
that is where the server comes into the
picture and the server in turn 80 bits
that is a daemon process that is going
to run on your emulator on your device
alright so the new monitor runs just a
meaning of the daemon which runs the
background process on each emulator
device instances right so once the very
minute the d1 dies now you are the
client dies so in between the server has
to build up
now how do we pass the data from one
activity to the other activity guys it
is very simple we use something called a
sponger now the bundle works in form of
the key value pairs now if we say b dot
put string you want to put the data in
form of put string and this email that
what you guys are seeing here it happens
to be the key and ABC and XYZ comm is
the value now this is how you put the
data into the bundle so after that
whatever the intent that you have
created that you have formed in the
beginning you are calling that instant I
you are calling put extras and you're
just trying to put the bundle into it
and that is all you are going to make
the bundle as a part of the intent after
that you are going to call startactivity
of intent and that in turn will fire the
other activity and this data is sent to
the other activity and this is how the
bundles can be used now the orientation
in Android is very simple the landscape
or the portrait like when you tilt the
phone the data and the phone changes the
way that you make it as landscape or
portrait or whatever it is and there is
what we call it as orientation
orientation helps to represent the
layout in row or column values are set
either to horizontal or vertical like
the way you rotate your phone the
orientation changes okay it can it can
be set using set orientation now the set
orientation in turn will let you set the
orientation dynamically now what
database is used in Android this is a
very good question how does it differ
from client server database management
system now guys you all would have
looked into Oracle now the Oracle the
server the definition of servers is very
different in Oracle's and here in
Android it is a very lightweight
database which has been created by
escalate escalate as open source
relational database and escalate engine
is server less now it has got nothing to
do with the server list service like the
Oracle the server less transactional and
self-contained now it is an independent
SQLite as
also in your Android stack escalate was
a part of it instead of typical
client-server relationship of most
database management system the escalate
engine is integrally linked to the
application it has been built in to the
Android no it is not different it is not
a third-party library now library can
also be called dynamic and makes use a
simple function calls that reduce
latency in database right they are
trying to bring in the maximum speed
into the escalate and they are trying to
get the best out of it but just to keep
you informed
Oracle is facing out desk alight and
they're coming up with the others better
database now what exactly is sensor can
you list all the four types that what
normally we use it in sensor is what it
is all about now let us take a quick
look now when we use the sensor manager
now the sensor manager intern will
return what kind of sensors are
available with your device now take that
sensor that class creates an instance of
a specific sensor providing method that
allow you to determine its capabilities
now when you have a compass what the
compass can do it gives the capability
here or when you have the accelerometer
what it can do it gives the capabilities
here then we have another class called
as a sensor event now this class
provides information on sensor event by
creating sensor event object now what it
can do because it told you like when it
is extra meter what it can do when it is
composite what it can do the qualities
and behaviors will change now to that
what you guys can do is you can add the
sensor event listeners just by adding
the sensor event listeners whenever the
direction changes in compass and it
reports the sensor event listener saying
that the compass is changed and the
event listener in turn will show you
where exactly the north is and Salters
in your compass and the resort books so
we have various sensors available in the
sensor manager and all the sensors has
the same functionality to use
using this you'll get to know how the
sensors will work this is fairly simple
now almost we are getting to the end of
the session
what exactly is in us that means Android
not responding in fact we started off
discussing when we started off with
trades and services now this in turn
happens when the activities main thread
has got too much of work to perform
there is when the NR is populated and
Rizwan it throws the NR now to avoid the
NR to avoid NR an application should
perform lengthy database or networking
operation in the separate threads now
guys I told you even if it doesn't a
separate thread the choreographer in
turn will start doing an errors now
there is wait we have to shift this on
to the services now it can be passed on
to the intent services now when it can
be passed on to the intent service as I
told you this intent services is
something that it takes up the job and
it goes on executing the drug once if
the job is executed it stops by itself
but the other service will run forever
is not stop unless and until you ask the
souls to stop
alright so that's about it when it comes
to the A&amp;amp;R now what is a IDN this is the
Android interface definition language
now the ADL intern is going to create an
interface that interface will be used by
the processor a and process B so that
interface will create a bridge between
the process in process B so that you can
start sending the data from one process
to the other process and that is what is
your ideal now what are the data types
supported by ideal meaning what I can
pass from one process to the other
process I can pass the string list map
character sequence and then the native
relatives like integer long character
boolean all this can be passed on to the
this is the data types what your ADL
supports apart from the data type you
can you have a possibility that you can
still pulse
the objects also and this is what it is
all about with the area all right guys
we have come through the entire set of
questions and almost we have covered
about 50 questions for you guys and I
hope that this session was quite useful
for you quite informative for you and
this is going to come handy when you
take a pure examinations or when you
take a pure interview guys do not stop
here and try to gather more and try to
learn more and you will be the best and
you will be the most wanted programmer
by the corporates as I told you that the
three billion programmer race is on and
you are going to be the best and you're
going to get the best and if you prepare
yourself with all these questions thank
you so much for your time and thank you
for all the patients we've already hired
till now and let me call it a day let me
end this session hope you all have
enjoyed this session and it is going to
come handy for yours and thank you so
much for everything and take care I hope
you enjoyed listening to this video
