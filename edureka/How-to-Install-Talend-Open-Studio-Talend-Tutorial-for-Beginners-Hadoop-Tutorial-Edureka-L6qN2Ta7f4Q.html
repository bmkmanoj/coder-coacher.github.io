you should know other product where you
are going to work day in day out they
look at it in Los Altos California and
they also are presence across the globe
now they are having a very rich client
base big names like you know you have
orange you have Tulsa reason here I was
reading that HP also started using them
then you have city band they have a very
good rich number of client base in the
last two three years and what products
they have to offer as I have seen talent
open studio for data integration and
open studio for big data and they also
have the same software button Enterprise
Edition which is a licensed product in
terms of features in terms of you can
feel there is not a significant marginal
difference but it made in terms of
positive a usage or coverage every usage
there is the vendors customer base for
this product set is estimated to be more
than 3000 company but you would have
much to know that only in 2008 this
download the way we were downloading the
software now this downward was close to
over 1 million and in 2012 this profit
total 20 million download and over 3500
claimed so imagine in 2012 if there was
a 20 million download you imagine 2015
what would be in the number
they are pretty popular in the market
now and their emerging is one of the
competitor and strong Medtronic
competition to the proven technologies
of the market leaders like informatica
datastage ab initio and because of their
additional offering of this hot product
of big data they're really going with
the killing you know speed in the market
these days
all right now.they you might be you know
wondering this software that we were
downloading it doesn't have any expiry
date and how does it go
talent open studio is distributed under
the you know apache a community which is
a open source community and the that
licensing launched in october 2006 and
the talent open studio its previous name
well right now
talans flagship product which is talent
open studio is the most open innovative
and the powerful data integration
solution and the market as of now today
and talent open studio provides the
advanced capabilities as i was saying a
study that dramatically improved the
productivity of data integration job
design and proven scalability to ensure
optimal execution now their offerings
are very specific to market needs and
their job is in there now data
integrated management which is the
obviously the sexiest job as for the
future predictions now this is water is
really making and really going to make
the learning during this curriculum of
thirty hours really rewarding for you i
mean just for out of curiosity if you
ever think of how the job market in
tallinn or in big data area just go and
search few of the top class website and
then you come to know how the vendors
are shifting their guns from the
traditional proven bit members to render
striped and people are aware and
enterprises are very curious to you
Stanley now the only challenge is
they're not getting ready resourceful
because Alan is first of all
once you know it you will feel it easy
but it's not very easy to to learn by
its own because there are so much
twisting time in the places so once you
know it then you would feel like oh my
god this is just a cakewalk and then
once you're once you're back then big
data is a in your equal so I am pretty
sure by the end of this curriculum up to
the certification after the project work
I'm pretty sure you guys will really do
well yeah okay now we as we discussed
yesterday very quickly why talent
obviously it's free one of the primary
reason that you can install it you can
do your hands on any point of time you
want from your personal computer you can
trust me we have developed product as I
was explaining yesterday right guys one
of you sharing one of my project level
experience we have develop we have also
started developing applications using
tag and open studio for data integration
it's it's free it's open source software
talents open source products in open
architecture it creates a unmatched
flexibility so you know you can resolve
the integration challenges your way now
talent reduces the learning curve and
lowers the barrier to adoption or for
data integration data profiling big data
application integration and more now
another key area where why because this
zero footprint architecture dramatically
simplifies the deployment manageability
and maximizes the scalability and now
what they say the vendor has to say one
of the popular and one of the leading
you know brand in the market assess its
customers and take full advantage of
groups in its scalability and all of the
vendor solutions targeted for deployment
management - friend monitoring and
system maintenance so that's I think we
yesterday have discussed enough on we
justification for why and
believe you guys already on the same
page as with me that why learning talent
which makes a lot of sense and that took
talent on big data is the most logical
decision for anyone who would be telling
anything on the data world and that's
that's that's their core competencies
talents core competences they start
there they're very basic foundation is
the focus on the data integration then
they they starts setting up their stone
with top-level
data quality and master data management
to manage the data governance they
second please again building stones on
top of their foundation to build the
pyramid the will the success pyramid on
which their line and they are having a
cherry on the eyes having that native
Purdue solutions with that with the
other features of the talents so now as
we were discussing a study data
integration that the combination of big
data makes it so appealing and
irresistible and so on one of the most
demanding technology in the market these
days that's one of my favorite slide so
they have everything on their period if
you see starting from the integration it
a quality master data management
enterprise service bus business process
management talent is at the center and
they have most of the technology
revolving around the central end but the
sign center let me tell you I always
keep on telling this to UK and let me
tell you that if you learn talent for
data integration very seriously
you would excel in all of the other
areas we talent for Big Data be the
talent for data quality talent for
master data management it really doesn't
matter
all right so okay now coming back and
catch up or not little bit on the
installation design as I was saying the
prerequisite is in terms of the
installation side you need at least a
3gb of RAM but the recommended is 4gb
okay and minimum this pays to store all
your job get your execution etc etcetera
you need at least 3 GB plus I believe
these are the minimum requirement that
you anyways we'll be meeting they are
not on a very high side you need of
course the Java JRE JDK on your machine
that is one of the primary requirement
to make an open studio for data
integration up and running because as
per the architecture is concerned and
open studio is based on a Java basics
click based platform now environment
variable configuration if that does not
happen without automatic setup of the
Java part then you need to ensure if you
go to your start you guys can do this as
we are going through this line and guide
you so that you know that what alaria
things have already been set up those
who have already downloaded please go to
your command prompt please go to the
command mode on your windows type on the
start type CMD and you get your command
mode then just type Java space hyphen
version and quickly let me know in the
chat window or the questions window what
versions you guys are getting then this
is the pre because it is in terms of the
compatible web browser this is a it's
not hard and fast it has to be there but
these are the standard recommendation by
the talent so obviously it is better we
adhere them the comfortable web browser
our Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox
Internet Explorer and the compatible
database Armani sequel as I in the
instruction sheet also I have asked you
to download the my sequel Community
Edition 5.5 towards the end of this
class also I will just give you a very
quick mo one or two minutes how do you
download and how do you install
and there is nothing you just need to go
okay next next next that's it now
in terms of operating system Microsoft
Windows 7
whether it is 32-bit 64-bit they say
that 64-bit they have certified that the
Oracle Java 6 which is 1.7 or 1.6 Theory
JDK is supported so it is better we
follow the recommended practice and this
is how you download and install ok get
the archive file from the download
section of the talent website once the
download is complete if there is no it
depends actually 5.3 the versions which
were coming 5.4 n before they used to
have archive files used to we have to
unzip it and archive it and then we have
to execute it but these days what they
are doing they are giving all that a Exe
file they are only giving one exe file
so the moment when you will double click
this X file
anyone of you who have already managed
to download just go to your talent open
studio later integration by part 6 Exe
file which which is downloaded and
double click on your shins so you will
see that the download has started and it
will prompt you that where you want to
set your software just set it in C Drive
under a folder name of folder or talent
that's it next and you don't need to do
anything else and there will be a
progress bar which will go on for 2 to 3
minutes ok so you guys can start doing
that ok and if there is any issue then
we will come back to this slide ok
because these a few of the things that I
have experimented out of my experience
and I have seen that if those are the
issues then we come back and we fix
this okay
I'll quickly show you what I was talking
about and someone is having some
question so we can download we can also
you have 11 that have a serious
malicious if you can manage to make or
at a 11 database and any you know climb
to like toward or sequel developer up
and running in your machine then know
how no issues
so any anything either on my sequel or
Oracle but just so that we we all will
be in same page I recommend to use my
secret because anyways it's very easy to
you first of all it's free - it will
work back but if you still have no
record no issues but I would not
recommend anyone to go beyond these two
database because MySQL Oracle is widely
accepted and used and most of the people
are because we also need to respect the
tone in the pitch of the class so I will
not recommend any other database but
from my sequel in Oracle or our handsome
so as of now in their website they are
having five point five and five point
six Community Edition so if you can
download - 6 also no issues that's fine
C Java space hyphen version you see in
my machine comes with 1.7 I recommend
all of you if someone is already showing
1.8 then the moment you execute the
talent opens your data integration then
after that your person will
automatically I believe get downgraded
in case the version will not now you get
1.8 1.7 automatically then still we can
go to our website and we can download
the Java JRE jdk 1.7 so no problem once
you do this come
then what we are going to do where you
go and verify that everything is
perfectly fine there is an environmental
variable as I was saying you need to go
you need to check right click on your
start start and then go right click on
your my computer my computer properties
go to advanced system settings go to
environmental variables and then check
whether your java home has been set to
your JRE seven and bin folder or not in
keen that is not there go to a variable
called path and ideally your path should
have extension to your java day needed
again when you install and your java
gets executed automatically the path
comes here right so and most importantly
you need to have admin privileges on
your machine to have this you know
tested and if it is not there to have a
change so if you guys are working on
some machines where you do not have
admin privileges you need your admin to
set up this path on behalf of you if it
is not already set ok yeah now for
vishal since you are having issues on
anyone who is having Java JRE jdk 1.8
for those people we will just quickly go
into the talent folder and 5.6 all right
I believe you can see with Java
somewhere here is anything I think I
have it somewhere but what you can do I
think then if we want that you can
simply go to go be Java 1.7 download as
I said you will get redirected to the
Baraka website open up this is for all
the people who are still having issues
yeah
so that gets executed but otherwise what
you can do is you can override the
version I am there someone after you do
that can you do a command command in
command line can you test your Java -
version 1 version are you getting and
what I'm showing on screen is for all
the people who are having the 1.8 issue
and if you want to use 1.7 still it
shows 1.8 ok so you are just trying to
refer to that batch file but I would
store I would not recommend that kind of
approach woman I understand yeah you can
skip the island Forge window yes is that
you can skip it not required now as soon
as I think this one also I have already
explained this particular window how do
we set up a project ok need to create a
connection before logging into Thailand
Open Studio ki d QP D but here we do not
have because it's open source edition
for enterprise you need to have a user I
can password now as soon as you get this
window this particular window here ok
you need to take on the create ok create
the new project you have already created
the project in training underscore new
Rica and then once you have that project
created you get this pop-up window and
then you need to select that project and
you need to open ok make sense
so until there
we all have been there now this is
typically now we'll spend few minutes on
this window and I'll explain you what is
what now if you want you guys can take a
note okay because this is primarily a
single window architecture kind of you
know software or kind of - okay for
another 5-10 minutes I am NOT going to
look at the question answered window
okay so you have to excuse me in that
because I am going to explain you this I
will leave the pen value the spotlight
you see on your left where I highlighted
it in pink color this is basically
called your repository or project window
all right
is your repository in project window I
have taken up the screenshot when I was
working on talent death integration for
5.3 so don't get confused we are using -
6 X all right so what you see under here
is a positive light and what you see
here is local then what you see is the
project which we had just created now
how it works let me explain it from the
project point of view you guys would
have by now
understood that as soon as we need to
access the actual talent software we
need to have some kind of project in
place right now imagine project is a
top-level
umbrella ok and any jobs or any of any
modules or anything that we create
within talent has to be part of has to
be part of under some project so project
is as far as any module within talent is
concerned project is a top level
hierarchy ok now on the project you get
most of the thing done and within
project we get multiple jobs which is
here and this is a open studio version
so our connection is local so what we
have installed what we have installed is
and so what we have installed is
actually the standalone machine
installed
so what say for example Isaac is doing a
swimmin would not be able to see so say
for example what mission is doing money
should not be able to see what the pion
is doing Roger would not be able to see
right so that is how this independent
installation books imagine if it would
have been an Enterprise Edition which is
a licensed one then whatever you know
all the people who report to the same
project or who have been given the or
who have been assigned the privileges
under the same project then the only
difference between enterprise and open
studio is all the jobs that all the
developers develop under the same
project everyone has access to each
other's job and anything that developer
one saves developer two can see
developer 3 Comics developed one can see
any of vice versa right so that is one
of the difference between enterprise and
open studio enterprise comes along with
a SVN repository where you can do check
in and check out like we typically save
the jobs and the other developers also
have access who is under the same
project but in a standalone machine
installation which we have downloaded
for our hands on all everything is my
local so that is the reason the
connection is local here but then you
will actually work on the projects or
for the tribes if they are using the
Enterprise Edition then you will see
that this connection is actually a
remote instead of local it will be
removed all right
now what project we have created that
will appear under that particular
connection under the repository now what
is the repository repository is nothing
but anything and everything
they do and we create here that gets
saved under the depository
so imagine repository is nothing but a
back end table or back end database
where most of the thing that we do here
gets recorded so that later it can use
or it can be retrieve it can be run so
deposited is like the central hub where
everything gets captured and gets
reported that is basically a
architecture in which most of the ETL -
in the industry work and n is not
exception all right so now you
understood what is a project project it
is at a top level of what you call
hierarchy within the open studio or most
of the thing what we do in the data
integration or in the big data has to
link to some kind of project now what is
a workspace workspace is an area at a
dedicated area under under the under the
åland open studio installation where
whenever you create a new project most
of the project data gets saved and then
workspace folder it's like a dedicated
part where most of our entities get
saved if you create n number of projects
also all this project will be falling in
the workspace
say for example I just show you quickly
the folder that I am having if you see
my installation which is in my C Drive
Talon and then I created a folder but I
hand open studio 5 point 6 and then
Maryland open studio it have like has
automatically it has created this folder
because the executable
the same name and now if you see one
folder or workspace I think by now you
guys already have
whoever has downloaded and installed you
can already have what space folder if I
go to my workspace folder I can see all
my project which I had created this
project this project this project I have
painting it Erica for on the project and
if I go and check most of it then I get
all the metadata of the jobs on metadata
of the project so as of now this should
be good enough to understand how the
project works how the workspace works
all right and what you see on the left
window as I say is all the navigation
and control that gives for creation so
the very first thing that you see is
called business bottle okay what does
business model do it's almost similar to
just to give you a look and feel it is
almost similar to the kind of thing that
Vizio does or Microsoft PowerPoint does
it's like graphically representing
something so that which you can import
in your high-level design document
during your retail job design or low
level design document or you want to
represent it to your higher management
or to your reporting manager or to the
business engagement manager who they
don't need to know the technicalities of
the job in this form in this form in
trend they do not need to know I will
make up the question guys you keep on
popping up your question while I was
explaining ok so what I was saying your
business side doesn't need to know what
happens within the job they are more
interested to know at high level what
actually how things have been designed
okay so that is where the business model
come into picture you know and drag and
drop but it's actually not a job it's
just a representation in bezels on it
exist a representation graphical
representation we normally prone to
spend too much time on business model
because we actually have another job
another job design so business model has
been given for that purpose now the real
fun that we do the real excitement it
under job design okay now John design we
actually build the job and we can create
different folders say for example under
one project of the project in which you
are working
it has different event area so for
example that is a pricing area that is a
revenue model area that is a filling
area so different frame area need to
develop this into frame job so what we
do is we create different different
folder and under this folder with
develop the jobs okay so the under job
design only we spend most of the time
creating the talent jobs then what you
see on your left is called context
context we will cover in module six
context is nothing but how to be
parameter X context is four
parameterization parameterization in the
sense we assign some high level
variables or high level parameters
rather than hard coding any values
within talent it's a very important area
very exciting area that is the area
which makes the migration of the code
from development to the production also
very smoothly and everything anything
can be parameterize on that context
after context what you see is good under
code even though we don't recommend too
much but still if there are scenarios
where you cannot who you cannot fulfill
your requirement using the talon
transformation or the component then
talon also gives advanced features like
creating the code and developing
routines routines are nothing but
reusable piece of Java coding so if
anything which you are not able to
achieve using the data transformation or
800-plus connectors tool then we can
write reusable piece of small small code
and we can call this course from our job
so for the timing that understanding
that explanation should be good enough
now on the secret gambling we can call
the sequel scripts we can call the
sequel scripts and under the metadata is
a very important term under metadata we
saved most of the metadata which we
create normally to read and write in two
different source and target system okay
metadata means data about data
now who can now for a time being because
there are no important topics on the
left on the documentation recycle bin
there is nothing anything you delete
within this repository comes to the
recycle bin so you have to clear from
the recycle bin similar to like bingos
remember again most of the windows
shortcut also works in Ln it's a very
easy to use tool ok now I want to know
if any some of you are already having
prior knowledge of metadata what is it
what is the definition about data about
data use a layman's term knowledge these
guys here are technical people so what
exactly defines the metadata what is it
it's nothing but metadata is nothing but
from the database point of view if you
try to you know imagine or try to
understand what is metadata from the
enemy's point of view if I want to store
my data in a table without creating the
table can I store my data room
but I can't store my data so this table
creation is not metadata but once I
execute the create table statement this
physical skeletal structure of this
table which got created which says each
and individual free level information in
the sense what is a data type or many
columns what is the field length all
this information in short all the
information which has to be in place in
order to access or read or data whether
it is in terms of file whether it is in
terms of table doesn't matter so
anything any information which is
required in order to read source data it
is nothing but that skeletal structure
which complements the actual magnitude
of the data if I am having five fields
coming in a source file then I need a
five field structure already ready which
is going to complement this incoming
file so immediately if I mean my
metadata doesn't match with my fine I
cannot read this file as simple as that
okay so most of you have got it most of
you have understood what is a metadata
now we will do more exercise we will
come to know you get to look you
understood you understand more on the
metadata so we have covered what is a
project we have covered what is the
workspace you have covered what is a
metadata and now we will cover I am just
covering all this as part of our healthy
discussion and then very shortly when we
will do our hands-on today we will get
to know that all of these concepts in
one
okay now the next concept that come into
picture
the next concept which comes into
picture is yeah we covered project we
have covered folks pay for your core
metadata now what is propagation before
we could go and see what is the
propagation and any of you have any
prior knowledge of what is what is
propagation any clues any guess
remember case the mood you answer the
better you score in a class and that's
how the class also becomes very
interactive
okay swimmin says passing on the
information to downstream very nice
attempts woman you are almost there
thank you anyone else
anyone else wants to try what is a
propagation
yeah sure that says it means to
propagate column details between stages
very nice again very close sure that
someone says similar to datatype changes
yeah
the earlier answer is more close when
passing on information to downstream
these are again guys see this these are
all the answers are all coming up on the
glass which is which is very nice
yesterday I said it is to propagate the
column details between stages anyone
else
what does propagation so let to datatype
changes
that's it okay propagation is nothing
but a information syncing here kind of
yes someone yes very nice thank you
propagation guys is nothing but how does
the information flow from one particular
component or one particular place within
a job to the other component or to the
other area or other end of the job
because if the information on the
metadata or the information that is
required from one component to the other
component doesn't flow
it doesn't propagate from one area to
the other then establishing the data
flow establishing the metadata flow or
establishing the relation becomes very
difficult so it is nothing but flow of
the information flow of the metadata
from one point to other that is called
propagation this is a very important
concept in Tallin and this is also one
of the important feature which helps us
connecting from one room to the other in
and makes our job successful and this is
also a area which will give us hard time
if you don't understand real concept of
propagation so we are all good you
understand the concept of propagation
now what is next is linking linking is
nothing but establishing a connection
between one component to the other
component okay so that is what linking
is nothing but linking helps us
propagating the information from one
point to other if you see if you go back
to the slide before this
now what is linking here linking is
nothing but the arrow that you see from
the first component to the second
component this is a sample job okay
again the linking is nothing but what
you see from the first component to the
second component this is called linking
now hang on now what is propagation
propagation is nothing but when the
information is coming out from this
particular transformation to this
particular transformation propagation is
nothing but how this information which
is present over here are more most
importantly the metadata which is
present here is getting propagated into
the metadata which is required by the
next component that is called
propagation and physically connecting
one component to the other is called
linking okay so this is a very basic
cool concept using which we can develop
the job all right clear so far so good
any questions guys before we start you
know working out on our first job and we
will get most of our queries or most of
our concerns and rest over there okay
I have a question from Muslimin in
enterprise software does the repository
is stored on all the user's machine or
in a centralized location no it doesn't
get stored in all the machines what
happens in enterprise is someone it's
like a typical client-server
architecture the server will be lying
somewhere maybe on your clients
or maybe somewhere centralized on some
machine and then all the developers who
work they will be connecting using the
trend nothing but your standalone
installation only when you will link to
that repository so it's like from
repository to the developers it's like
one-to-many relation from the developers
to the repository
it's like many do one yeah that's clear
is ok that is how the Enterprise Edition
works and anything that developer one
works out those changes gets captured
within the repository yes it's stored in
a database so the backend when we
install the enterprise we I then have to
give any selection of any database to
the repository either we can do it in my
sequel or Oracle or any preferred
database with a plain
it basically captures all the events or
what happens within the repository that
is happening day to day in the talent
all right so so far any questions on
hello so far any questions on what is
the project
what is the workspace what is a link
what does a propagation yeah you're
welcome
so and quickly guys I mean yesterday I
just you know I just slipped out of my
mind to ask you get I need if I can ask
all of you to give a little on the chat
window I can see all of your question if
I can get a very small you know
expertise or the technical area you
belong and what experience you have in
these areas very shortly each and every
one of you so that when we proceed with
our class we know you know how to how to
pitch and tone each and every one of you
because
to make sure that all of us are in sync
if some people already know some concept
I cannot just skip it or if some people
they do not know and I know the concept
I also cannot skip it so I have to
maintain a harmony in the class so if I
can get quick answers from all of you
about your technical background or if
you are pressure also just right that
you are starting up that's fine I just
want to know a little bit of background
young
yeah thanks money yeah such a very nice
dotnet I'm a sequel pl/sql money can
then ESB BPM very nice money Kangin you
have many things to take away from this
class already the pion bi assignments
very nice
ETL data management's one Isaac DW h bi
informatica very nice very nice very
good between do informatic are very nice
we are very complementary kind of
audience here datastage ET yeshua
they're very nice so all of you who have
little bit or maybe on the data
management on the DI or on the ETL or on
the VHA you would always you will always
see that curiosity on your mind to
compare and see how things work on this
tool and how things work on the other
technology or other tool can it do this
is this doable in this tool can it take
a challenge so that is what is going to
make this class very curious very
interesting very learning data power
mechanism very nice Vishal says ten
years in data warehousing data
conversion very good so he had a very
healthy kind of audience very healthy
audience who are were from data minute
background so I am pretty sure you'd be
immensely impressed with the
capabilities of this tool we have people
who not believe it affected a Britisher
would be immensely impressed with how
easy how you know with the ease this
tool handles the Big Data idea but fake
you fine and thank you thank you guys
for writing it down for me and I would
also like to remind you that by the end
of each class when you end your go to
meeting you you get a feedback you get
us a survey which is not even going to
take two or three seconds of yours so I
would recommend you guys can fill that
up
which makes our you know our feedback
and we improves day by day if any area
where we would be lacking we definitely
try to improve it and if you can do that
might end of each modules on dating then
out out really appreciate that
now let's Megan says is a pressure in
this area very good very good so we are
having a balanced balanced audience here
some they're experts in data management
some they know a little bit of big data
some are experts on ETL some experts in
business intelligence so we are having a
very very interesting mix of audience
over here all right so that is what we
will do is we'll quickly take a
five-minute break if that is what you
want or else we will just continue now
for another 15 minutes and then we will
take a break it's up to you guys break
please wait please oh my god looks like
regression waiting for the break alright
now I understand three hours is a
rigorous and it is again let me tell you
guys it is again going to be rigorous
from today onwards because putting on
words very less Theory more hands-on
okay so now onwards in fact from now
this moment itself almost it's all going
to be less slide and we are going to
spend more and more quality time on the
data integration in Big Data area window
and yes before we take this five-minute
break
can I yeah installation complete very
nice is a very good good job
how about two we shall have you
downloaded your 1.7 I hope you would
have resolved your Java era by now so
you guys take advantage yes very nice
very good so we have a full house of for
data integration now we don't have any
challenges now I would also urge you
back after today's class please utilize
this week to download Ellen for Big Data
virtual machine Hortonworks
and my sequel 5.5 or 5.6 community
edition because these things they
consume time and I would recommend that
we should utilize our classroom session
for more hands-on and less clarification
on the installation because you guys are
already experts you have spent quality
time on the ID side so you know how how
things work so I have a new is given the
instruction so in case anyone of you not
be able to find any kind of software I'm
going to ask these guys to upload them
into some FTP server enter data and they
are going to share the link with all of
you so that if you are not able to still
get it because everything is open-source
what we are going to use in our
classroom it's free of us then down up
but still if some of you have issues
finding out the software and I am going
to request this guy they are going to
list down all the software in one place
and you can download it from there
