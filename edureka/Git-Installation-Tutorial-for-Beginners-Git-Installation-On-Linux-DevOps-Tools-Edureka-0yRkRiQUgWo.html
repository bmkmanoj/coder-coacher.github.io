Rekha today we will learn how to install
gate on a st. OS machine but before we
go ahead we need to install the software
that get depends on these dependencies
are all available in default Center West
repository so let us proceed with that
I'll type sudo yum group install
development tools and here we go it is
asking for password
press why in the meantime let me tell
you about the development tools it is a
predefined bundle of software that can
be installed at once instead of having
to install each application separately
the development tools will allow you to
build and compile software from source
code
so it is done now let us clear our
terminal and now I'm going to proceed
with the second command and here we go
is asking for password press y
let us clear our thermal so now we are
done with the prerequisites so we can
proceed towards gate installation to
install git
there's a command sudo yum install gate
but this command will install gate
version 1.7 by default but there are
newer versions of get available so I'm
going to install those newer versions
for that I use W gate command so let us
first install W gate tool sudo yum
install W gate and here we go now press
Y so we are successfully installed W get
tuned let me clear my terminal now I'm
going to use this W get command to
download a specific version of kit all
right so I have to first copy the link
of the version of get that I want to
install so let me show you where I'll
get that link I've already opened it in
my browser you can see you can use this
particular link and I will use get to
point seven point to this version I'm
going to use you can select any version
that you want alright so just right
click copy the link location go back to
the terminal and just paste it here we
go so it is
now let me show you where it is
downloaded in my machine here it is good
two point seven point two tar.gz let us
go back to the terminal now
now once the download is complete we
will extract the file from the
downloaded guitar file for that we will
use tar command let me first clear the
terminal now I will type the command tar
- zxf get to Toro GZ and here we go so
now let me show you the extracted file
here it is get two point seven point two
the extracted file now we'll go back to
the terminal and let us change the
directory to get so for that I'll type
change directory get - two point seven
point two and here we go since we are in
the source folder now now we can begin
the source build process alright so for
that I'm going to use a Chabad called
make call figure let me clear
terminan and now I'm going to tie the
second command and here we go
this configure script is responsible for
getting ready to build the software on
your specific system it makes sure all
the dependencies for the rest of the
build and install process are available
so let me clear my terminal now so now
that the software is built and ready to
run the files can be copied to their
final destination for that I'll use a
command sudo make install here we go
this make install command will copy the
build program and its libraries and
documentation to the correct location
let me clear the terminal now to check
the version of get that we have
installed will use a command get - -
version here we go so it is a correct
version that is two point seven point
two now before we go ahead we need to
submit some information about ourselves
so that commit messages will be
generated with the correct information
attached we need to provide name and
email address that we would like to have
embedded into our commits for that we
will use the command that I will type
let me first clear it it is kit config
- - global user dot name and your name
here we go for the email ID I'll type
git config - - global user dot email and
your email ID here we go now to confirm
that these configurations are added
successfully I'll use a command get god
fake - - list so username is sourabh and
email ids all about the rate at Eureka
core which is absolutely which is
absolutely correct
all right so now what we need to do is
we need to generate a SSH key SSH is a
secure protocol uses a primary means of
connecting to Linux servers remotely
alright so let me first clear my
terminal now I'm going to type the
command to generate the SSH key which is
SSH - keygen - T RSA I 54 0 96
see and your email address here we go
enter file in which to save the key so
if I just press ENTER it will go to the
default location so let us do that
enter passphrase so if I want it to be
empty so I will just press enter enter
the same pass phrase again so now we
have generated the SSH key now there is
a program called SSH agent that runs the
duration of a local login session stores
unencrypted keys in memory and
communicates with SSH clients using a
UNIX domain socket so it is very
important to ensure that this SSH agent
is enabled so let us enable it here we
go so we have done that successfully now
we need to add this SSH key to the SSH
agent so let's proceed with that here we
go so we have done that
Fillie now we need to add this SSH key
to our github account alright so for
that I will use this cat command this
cat command will actually read the key
and it will display it on the terminal
so let me show you so this is the SSH
key that I've store
about so now what we need to do is we
need to just copy this SSH key and we
need to go to the official github
website
so let us google github I will go to
their official website over here I need
to sign in first so I'll use my login
credentials after this what you need to
do is you need to go to settings over
here click on settings and on the left
hand side there's an option called SSH
and GPG keys just click on it
and you can see there is an option where
my cursor is pointing new SSH key let us
click on it and we need to add a title
over here so you can type any title you
want I'll just type in Eureka and over
here I'll paste the key that I've copied
from my terminal finally we need to add
this SSH key so I'll just proceed with
that let us see what happens now as you
can see the key has been created but now
what we need to do is we need to test
this key for that I'll go back to my
terminal let me clear it first now to
test this SSH key
we'll use a command SSH - capital T get
a date github.com here we go
press yes so now let us go back to the
website and see what change has happened
just refresh this link as you can see
the color of this key has changed to
green that means we have successfully
tested the SSH key now we'll look at
some of the most commonly used
operations performed on gate that is
push and pull operation let me first
clear my terminal for that I will first
create a folder and I will name it as
gate - repo you can name it anything
that you want and I'll keep it empty
I'll go back to my terminal and I
changed my directory to that gate super
here we go
so now I have entered the gate report
directory now I need to initialize it
first so for that I use the command get
I in it so it has been initialized
successfully now to allow github to hold
our files we need a Caban git remote add
origin let me first clear my terminal
now to allow github to hold our files we
need a command that I will just type git
remote add origin and the SSH link let
me show you from where you will get this
ssh link first we need to create a
repository so is an option called new
repository will go there will give a
repository name i'll just name it as
eddie Rekha - 0 1 and I'll initialize
this repository with a readme and
finally create a repository you can add
a description as well if you want over
here that you can see that Eddie Rekha 0
1 repository has been created with a
readme file in it the SSH link that I
was talking about you can find it from
here clone or download just click on it
here is a link just copy go back to the
terminal and just paste it here and here
we go so now we'll perform the pull
operation alright so when we have
successfully performed the pull
operation this read B file over here
will be copied to our git repository the
local git repository but I want to add
this thing when you're doing it for the
first time you need to always pull files
from the github account to your local
git repository and then you can proceed
towards pushing your files from git
repository to the github account I hope
I'm clear so let us now perform the git
pull operation so I'll type the command
for it get pull origin
master here we go now let us go to get
rapport and see whether the readme file
is there or not as you can see we have
successfully performed the pull
operation the readme file is present
over here now we need to perform the
push operation for that I'll go back to
the terminal and what I need to do is I
need to create a file in this git repo
alright and I can just name it as EDD
Eureka and I will right here welcome to
edu Rekha save it close it and go back
to the terminal now over here we need to
add this file that I've just created
that is Eddie Rekha so for that we have
a command git add and the file name
which is Adi Rekha in this case here we
go so now what we need to do is we need
to commit changes so for that I'll use a
command get commit - M and the message
you want to display I'll just type first
commit here we go
so let me clear my terminal laughs now
we will perform the push operation so
when we are successfully perform the
pull operation this ad Rekha file will
appear in the github account which I
have created over here so it will be
present here so let us see if that
happens or not so we'll type the command
for it git push origin master here we go
so let us go to my github account and
check whether it has been added or not
I'll refresh this link as you can see
Eddy Rekha file has been added over here
and this is what I actually wrote
welcome to Eddy Rekha so now we have
successfully performed push as well as
pull operation thank you for watching
