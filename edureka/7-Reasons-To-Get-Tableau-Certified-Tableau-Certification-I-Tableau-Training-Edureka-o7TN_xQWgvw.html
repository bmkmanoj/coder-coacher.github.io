Eddie Rica and today's video is on seven
reasons to get Tablo certified there are
numerous BI tools currently in the
market in this video I will be telling
you why Tablo is the best and why should
you choose it as your business
intelligence tool for data visualization
reason number one the connectivity
options Tablo has to offer you the
reason Tablo stands out from all its bi
peers because of its wide range of
connectivity options it can connect to
any data that you can possibly care
about starting from spreadsheets
databases and even big data you can
access data warehouses cloud
applications like Salesforce and even
connect to a cloud database like Amazon
redshift it also has a WDC which is
known as the web data connector that can
pull APs directly from the web in order
to connect to any desired data source
reason number two big data with tableau
in the world of prevailing Big Data
Hadoop is the platform of choice for
many organizations that store wrangle
and analyze rapidly growing unstructured
data which is Big Data and tableau
empowers business users to quickly and
easily find valuable insights in their
vast Hadoop data sets
usually raw transactional data are
stored in hive database in a Hadoop
platform let me show you how you can
connect tableau to your hive database
I'm using a virtual machine I have set
up my Hadoop environment in a virtual
machine so all I'll do is I'll go to my
hive folder
and now I will just start the hive
server script
and there it goes after that just go to
tableau Connect option and just search
for your Hadoop distribution platform
that you are using I'm choosing cloud
era Hadoop all you have to do is provide
the IP address of your server choose the
port as 10,000 type is hive server -
since I'm connecting this with hive
server - if there is no authentication
process then you can select no
authentication but I am authenticating
using the username so I've provided my
username over here you might have to
install an ODBC connector for cloud era
in order to connect a blow to your hive
and after installing you can check over
here that you have the hive connector or
not and here it is if it's not added you
can add it from the options over here
after filling the server name the port
number and your authentication process
just click on sign in and there it is
you have connected to your hive data
source and if you're using a virtual
machine like me make sure that you have
got your firewall disabled as well
number three the Gartner's Magic
Quadrant tableau is known as the leader
of BI tools and it has been crowned the
best by none other than the IT research
firm Gartner and it's tableaus 5th year
as a leader in the Gartner's Magic
Quadrant Gartner has yet again announced
habló as the best bi tool among major
competitors like click Microsoft s ap
IBM Salesforce and many others and it
holds quite a big chunk of the market as
well
reason number 4 job opportunities and
salary not only there is a great demand
for tableau experts there are huge
rewards on the offer as well if we go
unpopular job portals like indeed.com
you can see tons of job postings over
here
tableau professionals are also getting
the best salaries in the industry as
well with an average of 91 thousand
dollars per year and it can go as high
as up to 185-thousand dollars and there
are tons of other jobs too that require
tableau as a major skill as well reason
number five it's amazing features like
storytelling and forecasting tableau
represents data like no one else with
its features like storytelling one can
even connect to the data personally and
understand the depth of analysis you can
also use tableau for forecasting as well
let me show you a little example I'm
connecting to the sample superstore data
set that tableau comes with the fields
in tableau are divided as dimensions and
measures measures are usually numbers
and dimensions are usually text
attributes let's just drag and drop
fields over here in the column and the
row shelf
the visualization I have right now shows
that sales trend for a particular year
if you want to forecast just go to
analysis click on forecast and show
forecast forecasting and tableau uses a
technique known as exponential smoothing
for castle golems try to find the
regular pattern and measures that can be
continued in the future you can even
describe your forecast to and there are
tons of other forecasting options as
well reason number six it is very easy
to learn despite of all its amazing
features it is very easy to implement
with its simple drag-and-drop feature
tableau makes everything very very easy
you want to find out the highest selling
products there you go you just drag
fields over here and there you have it
you can also sort it in ascending or
descending order as you like now let's
see which are the most profitable
products the color bar over here shows
orange is for negative profit or loss
and darker the blue the more of the
profit and here we can easily visualize
that phones is the most profitable
selling item in the superstore it is
that easy to find out with tableau
reason number seven the future of
tableau natural language processing and
search machine learning enabled data
prep and more are the kinds of things
tableau is geeking out on recently
tableau has also released tableau server
for Linux as well it is molding itself
with the new technologies to enable
futuristic approaches to view data it is
going to launch a hybrid data
connectivity for the cloud with this
tableau will have a new live query agent
that will act as a secure tunnel to
on-premises data data behind the
firewall is easier to access and analyze
with tableau online tableau SAS managed
service it will be generating smart
recommendations as well tableau
demonstrated future plans to add new
machine learning recommendation engine
to its platform and this algorithms will
surface recommendations for
waagh books data sources that are
trusted there are new upcoming
collaboration capabilities to help user
collaborate with each other and monitor
the metrics they care about enabling
self-service data skill there are new
data governance capabilities as well
with this enterprise's will soon govern
their self-service analytics
environments at scale with new
functionality in tableau server to
certify data sources easily conduct
impact analysis on sources and workbooks
and promote content and write workflows
with just simple drag-and-drop gestures
it is going to take a next leap in
analytics as well
tableau continues to invest in making
analytics easier for everyone
for example natural language processing
will bring new ways to interact with
data through human language it is going
to launch the project maistro' tableau
is expanding its product portfolio
beyond visual analytics to include
self-service data preparation tableau
has announced a brand new data prep
product which is codenamed as project
maestra and with project maistro' it
