up for today we're in will be talking
about the Android development course
that is offered by Ed Erica so before I
begin with the course let me just brief
you about its complete entire course and
how the work goes on so what we'll be
doing is we'll be having life sessions
every weekend and we'll be talking about
the various concepts of Android
application development when we talk
about Android app and grant application
development what we'll be doing is we'll
be conducting live online classes every
particular class that you receive or
just you are a part of it right will be
recorded in your LMS for example what
you do is you miss out on a particular
session and you just want to gain back
the concepts that were taught in a
particular session so that particular
recording will be available in here LMS
accounts pause the classes what you'll
be having is you'll be having a 24/7
support that is anytime you feel like
asking a query what do you need to do is
you need to raise a ticket and it will
be available or responding back to all
the queries of yours in the LMS you'll
also find a module wise quiz section so
that everything that is being taught is
also being related to with the help of a
quiz so you all need to answer back to
the to the quiz questions that have
available output up in the LMS accounts
for you then we'll be also working on a
project so this complete entire course
the major objective of this entire
courses to make you all be competent
enough to create a project all by
yourself all right so that is the
outcome of this course that you'll be
able or you'll be competent enough that
you'll be able to create a project all
by yourself then we'll also be providing
you these certificates that goes on with
this course so for example you have
successfully completed this course you
have created your project we have
accepted your project then you'll be
getting a certification out of this
course as well so let's first of all
talk about what is it what is Android
right so the person that you see here on
the left of your screen is Andy Rubin so
he is the co-founder of Android Inc that
is nowadays more than 1 million Android
devices are using right so it doesn't
breeding system that was offered to us
by Andy Rubin and every day more than 1
million new Android devices are
activated so it's a huge user base that
we are talking about in terms of user
acceptance so the larger the user base
the more is the demand for the operators
or say for the providers of services to
these devices so that is where we step
in we as Android developers are the ones
who are actually catering to the needs
of all the daily users by creating
various business enterprise applications
to serve the various business needs of
the industry let's also talk about what
exactly is the ecosystem that this
particular thing works on are the
android framework works on so there is a
wide variety of devices manufacturers
that make use of android framework in
order to customize their own needs for
example if I talk about Samson
right Samsung might be creating or
leveraging some of the ABI and that are
available onto the android framework and
may build up a few of the
functionalities that they feel like
building up on the APS that are
available as a good component to the
enjoyed framework Google everyone knows
Android is powered by Google so they are
the main producers of the Android
software then we have the consumers as
what we say the target user base so the
consumers are the ones that derive the
need for using the operating system the
more benefits that they get out of the
operating system the more consumers will
be attracted towards the operating
system then we have the application
development houses let's come to the
point now I say if I'm building up or
say I'm buying an Android device what I
necessarily mean is or what my thinking
would be is that I need to have a lot of
applications that serve my need if you
talk about the Android Play Store it has
got n number of applications that you
can think of so that is the reason why
Android has supremacy our over the other
operating systems just because it has
got a very sizable
I would say the art store the App Store
is something that you people can look
into and find any any application that
you feel may be serving your purpose so
we as Android application developers are
the ones who actually create those
applications and that is where we step
in this also immense opportunity in
terms of freelancing projects in Android
application I'll tell you few things
majorly the Android application projects
are not that large in size all right so
what happens is that freelancing
projects are easy to read on the with
respect to the Android application
development program and also you can
create them in a sizable portion safe
within a span of three months or four
months you'll be able to create an
Android application all by yourself the
data is where the freelancers also step
in and get the projects out of the
companies and also work as a part-time
basis however apart from the freelancers
also the Android system is also working
on in terms of the improbability also so
there's a huge demand for Android
developers professionals on a regular
basis also in the industry Android also
provides you the framework also provides
you app monetization so when we talk
about if for example what I want to do
is I want to create an application for
myself right I see an idea I want to
create an application and I have created
the idea of the application but if I
make it paid that'ss if I make my
application to be downloaded as a paid
version then what I need to do is I need
to have the user base decreases just
because my application is now available
as a paid category and most of the users
might not be downloading the application
but Android also the Play Store also
gives you monetization you might have
seen how many of you have seen the
applications wherein you see a few ads
going on anytime you're connected onto
the Internet I'll wait for your
responses back on in the chat window how
many of you have seen that the
applications getting some advertisements
going on when you click on an
advertisement it opens up a page and
everyone right
I need some responsiveness from the
batch here everyone it's it's not only
on YouTube and Facebook Sandeep it's on
any number of applications that you
download under the free category apart
from few applications like the whatsapp
and everything right it's like it's a
part of monetization that we people do
we integrate an AdMob SDK that will
create or say a runtime what it will do
is it will create keep on adding the
monetization ad with advertisements it's
more so a pay-per-click concept wherever
wherever the user clicks on the AG
adjustment you just get some money out
of it into your app for example you are
having a developer come you have created
an application you have also played it
blaze monetization inside your
application using the AdMob SDK once the
application gets uploaded onto the Play
Store there's a download count that goes
on for the application depending on how
much downloads you have for your
application what you do get is you get
money out of it the money percentage
depends on the category of downloads
that your application goes into right so
if your application is the top 50
grossing applications the money money
that you get out of the app monetization
is a lot larger and if your application
is somewhere in the back stack what will
happen is up monitor ization would be
giving you some results out of it right
so that is how the monetization works so
if you have only created an application
and you just want to monetize it that
way you can also do it I believe
everything that you get will be credited
to your account and then you can
actually get the PayPal account on
questions but everyone here one of the
building blocks of an Android
application is anywhere anyone aware
about these let's test your knowledge
now since you have all join in into the
webinar let's see how much prepare you
are for the webinar anyone who can
answer me back what are the various
building blocks of an Android
application so I'll be covering this up
but if you all if anyone of you knows
about it I will be more glad to know
about it
if if you do not know just respond back
with an N so that I can just move ahead
all right all right so meat all right
brain then we'll be talking about so
what I'll be doing is I'm explaining you
every single concept that we talked
about in terms of the building blocks of
an android application I'll talk about
an activity lifecycle right when I talk
about an activity lifecycle what are
necessarily meanors every single screen
that you see on an Android device as a
part of an application is called an
activity everyone right then we'll be
also talking about how the android
framework handles the hardware which how
the applications can run in the
background and do the network download
then we'll be talking about multiple
apps that access the shared resources
when I talk about this shared resources
let me give you some insight into it
when I say shared resources you people
might have seen images you people might
have seen the contacts you people might
have seen the messages they call logs
right they are they are actually a part
of the device memory these are not
something that are related to our
application or say n number of
applications that the user has installed
so how the android framework deals with
it is it gives you access to these
system resources per application basis
so average every application that you
install or download that requests for
images will be downloading or requesting
for images from this central repository
of data that is called content providers
you will be talking in more detail when
we'll covering it up it's first of all
talk about the introduction right what
exactly is an android framework and how
we make use of our leverage different
framework in order to build our native
applications so let's talk about Android
the Android is an open software platform
which completes which consists of or
comprises of a complete stack
which includes the operating system the
middleware and all the applications that
the user installs order the device what
is the mode what is the programming
language that we use in order to write
these programs that is Java right let me
also tell you or brief you about this
course what you'll be doing is you'll be
able to create native Android
applications host you complete this
course as I told you will be covering up
a project pause the completion of the
entire course duration the project will
be a native application that you can
create by yourself
post it on to the Google Play Store and
get the monetization working for it all
right
how has Android evolved right so the
very first version of the Android
operating system that was launched in
the market was 1.5 right and I started
working on Android application
development since version 1.6 right so
I'm having an experience of around six
years into Android application
development and have been working on
Android since they donate version and
now what we have done is we have reached
the employed KitKat version 4.4 right so
it has been a long journey and a very
quick one so if you all know now
majority of the devices that you see in
the market are running on android
framework right so there are two market
leaders one is Android one is iOS right
and Android is far more in terms of the
user base as compared to the iOS user
base so the more the user base the
greater the opportunities for the
application developers so you can see
that now what exactly is the percentage
of what version is available in the
market so if you talk about Froyo it had
only 0.7 0.7 percentage of the
distribution then you had gingerbread
which was thirteen point six
similarly the ICS that was ten point six
now if you take a look at KitKat what
you can see is that it is you're burning
around 20% of the distribution that goes
on with the operating system so that is
a high percentage
right so if I talk about 20% running on
KitKat that means it's like 1/5 of my
user base is making use of the KitKat as
an operating system let's talk about the
components the components behind any
android app that you might create one
component i have already talked about
which is an activity so everything that
you see on an android application screen
is a part of an activity if you people
can relate to other programming
languages let me talk about an activity
as a form in the.net perspective right
so everyone just remember that an
activity is very much like a form that
has got a few set of user interfaces
that the user interacts with if you talk
about a facebook application the
facebook application also has got an
activity where the user sees the news
feeds the user sees the friend requests
and everything right so I hope the
activity component of the Android
application is clear to everyone any
doubts any questions you can respond
back onto the chat window let's then
talk about the intense if I talk about
the intense what I necessarily mean is
that the intense are the action
initiators I told you something that if
I want to have a query or access to all
the images that are housed on to the
device the intents are the one that
helped me in doing that it's more so the
action initiators that I have for
example I want to say okay I have screen
one I have screen - all right so mean
has asked me a very good question here
what software we need to develop the app
if you take a look from me I've already
got it opened up for you right so this
is an Eclipse environment but with the
ADT bundled plugin can you see that Java
ADT it's more so an eclipse software
with the ADT plug-in installed into it
that will be making use of in order to
develop our applications you can see
that this is my workspace right so
whatever I will be creating will be
creating as a part of my workspace
Sumeet any doubts any questions you can
respond back then we talked about
intents right so I told you the intents
are the action initiators for example I
say I have to launch screen one right
which has to be launched from screen 2
and I can do a weisswurst I can say its
launch screen 2 from screen 1 so what I
need to do is I need to have an action
initiation done that action initiation
is the part of the intent then we have
another component which we call as
service has anyone taken a look at a
call recording application any call
recording application has anyone taken
and look at it if anyone knows about it
no Sameer all right Sameer has asked me
a question here can we use a dream we
were on TV for app the blueprint
actually they are majorly done are used
for C++ programming Cemile and how what
we are doing is we are doing a Java
development so we'll be making use of
NetBeans or we'll be making use of the
Android studio or we'll be making use of
the Android ADT bundle so that is how we
will be doing the app development it's
just that the Dreamweaver are the Vivi
does not support this kind of
development Cindy sameen
sorry let's talk about a service all
right I say what I want to do is I want
to have the user call recorded anytime
the user's receives a call I want my
application to have the call recording
done in the background right app
accelerator is for cross application
development Terrell all right when we
talk about say us a call being received
what I want to do is I want to record
the call in the background whenever we
talked about anything that runs in the
background that does not have a user
interface then I'll be having a service
component working for it that will do
they recording for me in the background
so any black background work that I need
to do I'll be making user
a service for it moving on we have
another component which we call as a
content provider I told you about the
content provider a little in brief that
has images the sms's the car logs the
calling the history everything is a part
of his systems resources dollars
unnatural Android devices resources so
what the Android device does is it does
not allow me access to the database of
these applications for example the call
logs the contacts the messages it does
not allow me access to their database
what it does is it keeps a layer in
between the layer is called the content
provider when I talk about a layer as
the content provider what I necessarily
mean here is that the layer of the
content provider is just assuming right
that any application can make use of the
content provider so it does not bind the
database to any application however the
layer binding has the application with
it it's more so I'll just give it to you
it's more so a layer in between activity
or my application understands or just
works with the layer the layer works
with the database the database responds
back to that layer and my layer just
responds back to my application so it is
that kind of a work that is done with
the help of the content providers moving
on we have a broadcast receiver right
question for everyone how do I get to
know that I have got an alarm that needs
to be wrong how do I get to know
whenever I'm traveling my time zone has
changed anyone who can think about it
they are actually a system events
whenever I plug in the charger right I
get to know my battery has not started
charging so they are actually a receiver
pattern that is as soon as an even
happens as soon as an event happens what
happens is my application gets notified
this particular event has taken place so
these are like the broadcast receivers
that's correct
it's more so at event that has been kept
by the system right and whenever the
even happens my system gets notified
that this particular event has happened
so that is how we take care of the
broadcast receivers let's move on see an
activity I told you every stream that
you see on an Android device is an
activity and you can see that and relate
to it with the help of a Facebook
application example let's talk us about
the life cycle of an activity if you
talk about there's a screen right
there's a screen but that screen has got
a various callbacks I'll tell you an
example I'm actually taking a look at a
screen however I'm looking at when when
I'm looking at the screen what I do is I
do get a phone bar phone call right I do
get a phone call I disconnect the phone
and what happens is I'm still at the
same stream right everyone just respond
back to the query that I have asked you
I have an application up and running I
get a phone call I finish up the phone
call again take him back to the activity
that I was looking at is that correct
I'll wait for your responses back on the
chat window what happens is that in
droid is a device right and we have
limited memory limited CPU it's not as
good as a laptop that is running on an
i5 it's not good it's it's not as good
as it right so what we need to do is we
need to make use of the resources
judiciously when I say making use of the
resources judiciously what I necessarily
mean is that I need to handle the
various callbacks in order to let these
losses be allocated and let the
resources be de-allocated select me
take a few use case scenarios where and
my activity might enter in what state
whenever I create an activity we'll be
talking about when we will be covering
this course more in detail I go on to on
create on start on restore on the zoom
my activity starts running I get a call
right my activity gets into the pause
mode as as long as we call is going on
what should happen to the system
resources should they still be occupied
or should they be released question for
everyone if I'm making use of a system
resource alright I'm making use of some
services I'm making use of some activity
components buttons images should they be
released
should they be still occupied what you
say is still occupied Sandeep say is
released I would say virtually they
should still be occupied however they
should not be performing any functioning
is that correct I say they still should
be occupied but not performing any work
is that's correct
right so what I do is whenever I get a
call my activity goes into the positive
as the call is in progress the activity
is stopped that is I'm not performing
any work under it I finish up the call I
again call on resume and I go on the
activity again starts running anyone
having any doubts any questions
understanding the use case of the
activity getting stopped I'll wait for
your responses I'll give you another use
case I say I have the application up and
running and what I have done is I have
pressed the home button of the device
when the home button gets pressed what
happens does my application do any work
when I have placed my application in the
background does my application do any
work first of all what it will first of
all go into the apostate
then it will also go into this top state
take a look at this top state as
something wherein I'm not seeing the
activity on screen just understand it
like this anytime the activity is not
being seen on the screen it has stopped
is that is this example correct clear to
everyone now let's take a look at an
example where an I am launching an
activity I'm launching my application I
do P best the hardware back button I say
the I press the hardware back button
when I press the hardware but back
button what happens the activity goes
off I'll wait for you to respond back
whenever I press the hardware back
button the activity goes off in this
case what will happen is virtual first
call will be done to the apostate second
call will be done to the stop state and
third call will be done to the destroyed
State because now I as a user have
manually destroyed this application any
doubts any questions I'll wait for your
responses back out of the chat window
moving on the third component the
intents as I said you can think of
intense as a work and an object for
example you want to call from within
your application you want to play a
music file from within your application
this is all something that is governed
with the help of the intents if we also
tell you we are just covering a brief
about all these components then we'll be
covering on the actual development
you'll get to know a lot more in detail
about these components right moving on
switching between activities as I said
one of the primary objectives of intent
is also to initiate one activity from
another by services
first of all can everyone take a look at
the lifecycle of the service it has got
starting running destroyed no pause can
everyone see that it has it does not
have a pause State in the lifecycle
anyone who can answer me back why a
service does not have a phosphate so I
have already answered it back to you
anyone who wants to try up why a service
does not have a positive whenever I talk
about a service right do doesn't service
have a user interface does the service
have a user interface since it does not
have a user interface what do we what it
will do if I go in if it goes into the
pod state the reason the service does
not have a user interface there is no
requirement of a pause kit since the
user is not interacting with the surface
it keeps doing its work in the
background so even if it is stopped it
can only have two states one is on one
is off right since the user does not
interact with it no pause state here
everyone any doubts any questions here
let's also talk about what are the types
of services right there are actually two
types of services that we make use of
one is bound one is unbound a bound
service is something that is activated
or initiated with the help of an
activity and is in the memory only till
the time the activity is up however the
unbound services something that is
associated with an entire application
and will be up till the time the
application is alive and a use case I
have around 20 screens within my
application and I can have a service
running on only two screens from within
my application
this is an example of a bound service I
have 20 screens in my application and I
want my service to be running respective
of the activity that I have in my
application that is an example of an
unbound service an example keeps running
in the background requests or new looks
for the news feeds by difference or
notifications that you get about the
friend requests condon providers you can
see that the layer I was talking about
my app in practice with the content
providers the content providers
ultimately interacts with the database
perform operations like waiting up
deletion insertion and the updation then
the broadcast receivers as I said and as
a system broadcast so what happens is
first of all I need to register my
intents to observe for a broadcast as
soon as the observer gets the observance
done it gets a notification when the
intent occurs an example alarm that
wakes up or rings the device when the
stipulated time is reached is triggered
with the help of a broadcast receiver
right anyone having any doubts any
questions can respond back on the chat
window moving on now you know about what
is an activity
what are intense what is a service what
are content providers
what are broadcast receivers anyone who
does not have understanding of above
concepts or the concepts that I have
just talked about can respond back on in
the chat window let's talk about an
activity or just when I talk about an
activity it is more so a screen that the
user interacts with so if I'm creating
an application and my application has
got 20 screens
that's interact with the user so I'll
say call them pretty activities now the
activities need to be triggered one from
the another one right one two two two
two three and so on that action of
initiating an activity from one activity
to another is the one that is taken care
of by the intense Roger
let me know if activity and intents are
clear then we'll move on to services
right talking about services anything
that does not have a user interface and
keeps running in the background it keeps
running in the background and once it's
process gets over it will notify the
user interface that I have downloaded
this data and now what do you want to do
is you want to show up on the user
interface this data alright
Turin has a question here activity
starts and unmount service to listen for
broadcast receiver that's correct that's
how we update the UI Turin has asked me
activity starts and unone service to
listen for our broadcast receiver and
whenever the broadcast receiver is
received all right what we can do is we
can start an activity or we can also
update the UI third right for example I
have downloaded some data what I can do
is I can update the data on to it then
we have content providers a central
repository of the data which where which
our application may look up to then we
have the broadcast receivers as I said a
broadcast receiver is a dormant receiver
that only observes for anything that is
being received everyone knows what are
the building blocks life cycle how the
hand Hardware events are being handled
the background jobs the multiple apps
access share your souls that is the
content providers anyone having any
doubts any questions understanding this
can let me know on the chat window
moving on let's talk about the job trend
as I said there's this huge demand for
full-time employment also about from the
finance opportunities that we people
have as Android developers and you can
see that the theorist always arrives for
Android application development with
professionals this growth is in
percentage right its global it's global
Sundeep its global and well however how
whatever the road could be right the
country that we are and we have the verb
in it right
and let's talk about some achievements
what do they are there it is just that
we haven't mentioned it right they are
also a demand for I let me tell you was
it all right
the demand for iOS 10 the Android
application developers us I'll quite be
safe right
it is just that iOS have got a lesser
user base as compared to the enjoyed the
users all right so that is the only
difference between what is he I said
it's the same in terms of ratio it is
the same demand for iOS and Android
remains the same but let me tell you
something
iris is running in a closed environment
which is not the case with Android so
there's huge scope for improvement in
Android that is not there on the iOS yes
that's correct that's what I said when I
talked about the user base version but a
necessary element is the number of
devices that are available to use for
the users all right let's talk about
what we have achieved with the help of
the America program that we have done
right this is one of the most popular
application that me our student may wish
has created right she is she was a
student from Kashmir and she has just
see this dial Kashmir application she
was a part of our program and then she
created an application dial Kashmir
which was actually a part of a newspaper
agency or say a newspaper headline that
was created right so you can see here
that and everyone whosoever is just
watching this tutorial or watching this
video you can also be coming here and
you can also get noticed in the in the
industry that we are talking about right
a very good application which gives you
all the informations about the ad rack
attractions education fire services and
everything that you feel like asking in
custody right then we have few other
applications the PNR status the
