Navy verse is purely a probability issue
it's purely a problems issue and it
works with the theorem called the base
theorem and the probability always
it would be the number of occurrences
there would be a total number of
occurrences okay so always the majority
of problems all solved with the
probability theorem because it is a
crude method as well the probability
theorem is a crude method so for example
there is a conversation which has three
there is a person travels in a train and
he was speaking was the person
co-passenger in the plane so morning he
does not know whether he was speaking to
a woman or a man so that's a question
whether it is a woman or man
so the probability can be 50% of the
passenger travel this woman and 50% of
the travel 500 men so the probability
can be 50 men and 50 moment so then
there is an another circuiting answers
is I think the person I was speaking as
a long act so out of all the passengers
who traveled the train the probability
of having a longer would be the woman so
the outcome of the person is I was
speaking to a woman so that's the
probability so majority of wait age is
given okay so that is depends upon the
number of occurrences divided by total
number of occurrences how much
probability comes will go by that out of
okay that is called probability theorem
for example in a dice so what is the
probability of getting you the three so
number of times you throw the dice
divided by total number of sites
available so based on that you clear
whether the probability of likelihood
proud is also called as likelihood to
get the three or not
okay so with that understanding we
proceed with an examples to know in
detail without Navy bias classification
is applied okay here we have the rest
and greens and if you look at here we
have an hour of rates and number of
greens or the greens as a IIST number
when compared to the rate okay now what
happens in this case so have a green and
red
similarly I ever read and a number of
dreams going to be 40 and number of red
is going to be 20 out of it if I get a
new object I want to classify whether
the object will be red or green so that
is my question so how do you calculate
if an object comes at the knee or how do
you clock calculate whether that class
label can be red or green so there is
two thumb rules we have to find out one
is called pre or probability and one
more is called posterior probability two
things we have to find out so the first
one will be finding out the prior
probability the prior probability for
green will be the number of green
objects divided by the total number of
objects number of green divided by the
total number of objects similarly for
red number of red give a total number of
object so that will get prior
probability will be 40/60 similarly the
prior probability for red will be 20/60
okay so if I carry any doubt on this
first we are calculating the prior
probability where probability will be 40
divided by 64 grade and 20 divided by 64
data you need that you know we can stir
shift to either London because the next
thing is going you opinion after we find
out no changes we know I have to
classify the white object which is
available in the a near to red and the
green
so now what happens once the object is
present there is a circle which is drawn
so which is called the vicinity of X
okay with unity of X surrounding the X
what all the objects will be present
here it's avail to like a centroid
calculations we are surrounding this
object find out the nearest distance
object which is nearer to the class
labels near to the castle's labels so
this will be found out by the distance
between this distance between this
distance between this so based on that
it will draw a within T of X circle so
which encompasses the number of red and
number of green objects so this will be
done internally by the icons number okay
so after we are finding out the prior
probability we have to calculate the
likelihood of occurrences the likelihood
of occurrences will be given number of
green in the vicinity of X similarly
number of red in the vicinity of n
divided by total number of green and
total number of friends so which will be
number of green will be one and number
of red would be 3 so 1 divided by 40 and
2 3 divided by 20 so that is called the
likelihood the likelihood of a class
label can be red or clan v3 will be
determined by the nearest distance or
nearest objects available within the
range of X X is what we are going to
predict so now we got the likelihood so
then once we get the likelihood we would
like to calculate the posterior
probability always the posterior
probability will be the prior
probability into likelihood so we
calculated the probability will be 4 by
that is 40 divided by 60 and 1 divided
by 44 agree and similarly 20 divided by
60 and
3 divided by 20 so we got 1 divided by
60 and 1 divided by 20 so once we take
the probability of this
1/60 point zero one six similarly one
David Wade point zero five so since the
probability of having read this I here
when compared to the probability of
green so we classify X as a rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
