gives us a clearer understanding of
concepts that would normally blur the
lines between what is what and what is
not my name is aria an alpha mighty Rika
and I welcome you to today's session
where we will be comparing the two most
promising blockchain platforms aetherium
and hyper ledger I'm going to compare
aetherium and hyper ledger on the basis
of following parameters these parameters
include Network type crypto currency
consensus mechanism smart contracts
language of development and maintenance
now Before we jump to comparing them let
me brief you a little bit on both the
platform's so to begin with etherium is
a decentralized platform that enables
business logic to be implemented on the
blockchain with the aid of smart
contracts these contracts are executed
on a decentralized computer called the
etherium virtual machine which lies at
the heart of the etherium architecture
the developers at etherium have always
advertised themselves as the future of
the internet and a lot of people seem to
agree too with its simple and
generalized protocols an easy to non
scripting language aetherium has become
a platform thriving with use cases of
decentralized applications for example
crypto Kitty's latarian the roulette and
many more moving on to hyper ledger many
people seem to be really confused as to
what hyper ledger is well hyper ledger
is an open source project under the
Linux Foundation the hyper ledger
project has various frameworks under its
license like fabric aroma and indeed to
name a few
all these frameworks enable developers
to provide blockchain based solutions
for industrial and business-related
problems I have another video on this
playlist where I think I've done a
pretty decent job at explaining what
hyper ledger is you guys should
definitely check that out now there are
brief to you all about our two
contesting teams today let's begin
comparing them starting off with Network
types well there are three different
types of blockchain networks
public private and consortium public
block chains are accessible by everybody
with access to the Internet these
networks need every ladder to run
consensus to validate every transaction
that occurs on the network private
blockchains are much more different they
are only accessible by a limited number
of participants as the name clearly
suggests they may or may not even have a
cryptocurrency involved with the network
as the network is made to tender to very
specific needs a consortium blockchain
also known as a permission blockchain is
pretty similar to a private blockchain
aside from its limited accessibility
it also has levels of permission levied
on the network by leveraging trust in
our case a theorem is a public
blockchain network if you have a
computer and an internet connection you
can very well participate in the
etherium network this also means that if
you order to execute some secret
transaction that you are really ashamed
of it will be visible by everybody else
on the network and thus your secret
doesn't really remain a secret anymore
hyper ledger on the other hand is a
consortium blockchain it was developed
in such a way that you could execute
those really embarrassing transactions
in complete privacy and confidentiality
talking about cryptocurrencies aetherium
has its network specific coin called
ether ether is mainly used to pay for
transactions and to buy gas which is in
turn used to pay for the computations
committed on the evm new ethers are
mined by miners who in turn validate the
committed transactions
- ledger has no such specific coin -
Asha gives the developers the freedom to
implement blockchain technology however
they want for their business with this
said if a business beams it necessary
that they need token or a coin for their
purposes they can always implement one
talking about consensus mechanism
aetherium uses a proof-of-work mechanism
for its consensus in a proof-of-work
based algorithm a hash function is used
to create conditions under which a
single participant is permitted to
announce their conclusion about the
submitted information and then those
conclusions can be verified by all other
people in the system false conclusions
are prevented by parameters of the hash
function which ensure that false
information will fail to compute in an
acceptable manner in the etherium system
the participants who publicly verify the
transaction on behalf of the entire
network are rewarded for their
participation with newly created ether
on the other hand
Pelageya allows developers to choose
whether they require a consensus
mechanism at all when they do choose to
offer a consensus mechanism an algorithm
called practical Byzantine fault
tolerance is used which is also used in
other popular blockchain platforms like
ripple and Stella very roughly without
explaining the whole algorithm what ppfd
does is as follows each node on the
network maintains an internal state
regarding ongoing specific information
or status of the network when the node
receives a message they use the message
in conjunction with the internal state
to run a computation this computation in
return helps the node to arrive at a
decision regarding the validity of the
message after reaching its individual
decision about the message it shares it
with all other nodes in the network a
consensus decision is determined based
on the total decision submitted by all
the nodes the key difference between
proof-of-work and PB FD is that in
proof-of-work only one node rather the
first node to solve the problem shouts
out the answer unlike pbft which
requires all the participating nodes in
the consensus to return a decision
moving on to smart contracts if helium
and hyper ledger both allow business
logic to be implemented with the aid of
smart contracts aetherium smart
contracts are generally written in
aetherium specific scripting languages
like solitaire or serpent - logic
contracts on the other hand are written
in chain code aside from that to run
smart contracts on aetherium computation
fee must be paid in the form of gas on
the topic of language that each platform
is written in aetherium uses a
combination of golang and python while
hypo ledger uses a combination of : and
Java helium as a platform is maintained
by the etherium developer community
while hyper ledger comes under the linux
foundation so much like other linux
projects people from all over the world
can help pipe eliezer get developed as a
project now that we know the differences
of both the platforms let's go through a
use case of both of them for aetherium
I'm going to show you all how voting can
be made completely transparent the voter
will submit his information to an
identity verifier
running on etherium with the help of
smart contracts after the identity has
been verified a token
is generated with the water will enter
into the ballot interface this token is
unique and solves the problem of double
voting in today's world the voter cast
his vote and the sport is registered in
a block on the blockchain network thus
maintaining transparency and integrity
of the voting system aetherium is
preferred here as a platform over high
polish
due to its public nature which is
integral for voting for our high pool as
a use case I'll be explaining a truck
racing scenario so that pharmacist knows
where as medicines are being
manufactured for Quality Assurance
purposes it is important to note that
there is no need for it to be public as
that would mean revealing confidential
applications between the pharmacist and
the manufacturers every change in the
medicines location storage type etc are
stored on the blockchain these can also
be automated with the help of Internet
of Things sensors in this way the
pharmacist and the patient both can
verify the origin of the product and
quality is assured a very similar
business model is being used under the
name hyper ledger saw tool to track
fishers after harvest till the time they
served on the table at a restaurant
coming to the point of which platform is
the best I personally don't think there
is any best per se as implementations of
each platform should be according to the
specified business models in my opinion
in the new future most
business-to-business franchisee or b2b
franchisee will be run on hyper ledger
as they need to execute confidential
obligations without passing everything
through a central authority on the other
hand aetherium will rule the world of
business to customer or b2c Enterprise
due to its global reach and public
nature that's it from me today guys I
hope you all learned something today
about these two platforms goodbye
I hope you have enjoyed listening to
this video please be kind enough to like
it and you can comment any of your
doubts and queries and we will reply
them at the earliest do look out for
