everyone wants to understand what
exactly is data mining are now there are
different terms or different ways of
using data mining specifically here I
would I would say from all the
experience that I have had data mining
is is more about processing or or
studying data in various dimensions to
put it simply if you were to solve the
business problem if they can be n member
of ways of looking at it for example if
you were to look at a hug or what are
the factors that drive sales now Saints
can be a function of price that is lower
the price higher is the sales sales can
also be a function of advertising or
that is higher that vertising higher is
the sales signals can also be a function
of the geography for example in certain
geographies certain types of categories
are are sold much more than another type
so there are various ways of their
biggest factors that can affect sales
which is and data mining is mostly about
understanding what are the biggest
factors that influence our business
problem are in the example that I have
told you it was sales while the use case
of the business might differ from from
case to case for example in the
e-commerce industry we might be
interested about let's say a bitch
product is the customer is most likely
to get interested in or let's say in the
financial services industry is going to
be about better we should give a credit
card to a given customer based on all
the characteristics that we ask the
customer for example is based on his
income based on the his job profile
based on what are the other loans that
he has and so on so so data mining is
all about understanding what are all the
various factors that influence the
factor that we are interested in field
sales p
the FBI decision of whether to a to
expect in the credit card or not so it's
so to put it succinctly it's going to be
about it's the process of finding
correlations or patterns among the
various dimensions of looking at a data
or you can also say that data mining is
the process of finding useful
information for example while you can
still say well you know that price is is
an important factor there might be other
factors that are also correlated with
with six for example let's say the price
of egg in India is is probably
correlated very well with with the
sensex of some other country while these
two are highly correlated they probably
are not related at all so so that's
that's one other process that are that's
where the useful information from the
data comes into picture while we know
that when theta they are still
correlated it might not be the case that
it is useful for us now coming to what
exactly is data in data mining it can be
any facts for example sales was a number
now it can be a text to for example sex
of the person male or female it's a
Class A it's let's say a simple pattern
saying whether he is a male or the
person is a female or so so data can
exist either in numerical form or in
textual form now once we have the
numbers or text the processing are
identifying the patterns associations
are within the data that's what gives us
the information that is what are the
correlations that we see it in data to
so basically converting data into
information and with information
converting it into it into knowledge for
example are based on all the information
that we have learned from our data what
what can we say about the future trends
or for example
or in the use case that is presented
here are pains in offseason for example
or in let's say in an offseason we might
as well discount discount our plots or
discount on boobs so that we clear of
our inventory and that sort of knowledge
comes from the fact that they in a
particular season sales are low which we
obtained by looking at all the numbers
or let's say the sales numbers and then
gain the information about what is the
seasonality of six so i think we are at
the end of the slide we have any
questions here should I think I I seem
to questions in here so so basically
it's pretty much around using data
convert it into information and then
converting the information into
knowledge which which is the traditional
cycle of data mining and there are many
tools that that we can use data mining
or rather we can use many tools in doing
data mining our is one of the major
tools that we use or we'll go ahead with
with a small huge case at the end of the
session moving ahead now one of the
questions that you might be interested
in is by business analytics is getting
popular these days think of a scenario
in this way be are in 2015 are let's go
back and think of two thousand and think
of what was existing at that time in the
year 2000 most of the work was done
manually oh that is a paper paper-based
the paper-based work and let's think of
a financial services system where let's
say a bank has to give get the customer
has to take a decision of whether to
give a loan or not in two thousand given
the givers not a lot of data stored in
databases
there was nothing much that are to an
extent there was not a lot that bank and
look into historically and say what all
those segments which are doing good with
respect alone versus water both which
are doing back come 2015 they'd has been
quite some changes be it because of
reduced cost of storing data or be
because of more means of storing data or
acquiring data and also the cost of
processing data has gone down
drastically starting a since since back
then now and that's where the advantage
or that's where analytics comes into
picture now that we have more ability to
store more ability to process data or
there is a obviously more ability to
gain more information than what we use
to gain earlier and from that
information came some insights or film
the knowledge and and that's how
business analytics has as the demand for
business analytics rather has gone up
tremendously over three years and this
slide is a is a very brief overview of
what what are the various stages of
analytics of data mining it all starts
with the use case that the business
gifts continuing with the same example
that I gave the credit card whether a
financial services company should extend
a credit card to a given customer of not
typically the business use cases would
be like that once the business use case
was given that's when the analyst or or
the data analytics person would
understand what are the various factors
that drive the decision of whether to
give the customer credit card or not the
moment he understands the Vegas bastard
then he goes on into understanding what
are the various data that are available
in his hand once
understand what are the data that are
available he granted he takes those data
typically either through an APL manager
or some other database that is stored
internally and then he prepares the data
that is thus some pre-processing beat
normalization or be capping and flooring
the variables and so on and then he goes
on to define the use case that is better
to extend or he goes on to look at the
historical patterns that is look at the
historical credit card offers and see
which are those offers that went bad
versus not and then builds a model out
of it and then test that model in an out
of period that is to an extent validates
that model that he has built by by
taking a fresh set of data and then the
model gets into deployment phase i think
it was quite some for load that i have
shared over the last two slides okay so
going ahead what is our so our reserve
is basically a programming language I
would say a programming language that is
used for statistical analysis and and it
is basically a data analysis software
that is it is a supporter of all the
business and little analysis that we do
now why do we mean odd why we already
have exel might be the next question and
and the advantages of our over X 0 vs
are so let's say if we were to do some
an actor so let's think of a simple
scenario where one is asked to do or
work on data set which has maybe let's
say 10 million ropes and XL obviously
cannot handle that many number of rows
because of one the size limitation and
to excel does not have the support to do
the analysis of data for example all the
simple analysis like let's say plotting
a scatterplot are plotting let's say a
bar check all those visual
representations are daily neck so while
our comes up with some powerful
functions that help us in the data
analysis for example let's say we have a
set of data and we want to predict or we
want to classify it in a certain way it
is not possible in Excel while it is
possible in part and that's where the
major major use case of art comes in
over X oh yeah so coming to what are the
characteristics of our it's it's
effective and and fast in handling data
and and storing it think of it this way
let's say you have an excel at it 60 mb
in size it's going to be tough to to
work in Excel because of because of the
size while it's much easier in our to
work on data sets that are as huge as
let's say to move to gb in a normal
nation now the advantage the other
advantages of our is that there are a
bunch of operators to do different types
of calculations for example the modulus
operator the percentile operator so on
for for various types of data and the
variety of tools but let's say data
analysis beat let's say soup any sort of
machine learning or business
intelligence and visualization it
pressing it it facilitates for data
analysis let's say using graphs are in
and displays it either within the window
or it can print a PDF or any format of
your interest and store it in your
machine now basically our is a language
that was built as a successful for the
another language that was coded way back
in nineteen seventies and that was named
s and to give you the major advantage of
our it is the open source package
where anyone can contribute to and which
if the if at all they think that the
package would be useful to the gender of
users of our they can contribute it to a
repository named cran and and and any
normal person like myself and you can
use that package if if he thinks that
the package would be useful to him
a simple example for a data
visualization in our could be like let's
say if we were to plot the marks of a
certain place will be able to plot that
mac and this is how the output of that
particular line of codes in art looks
like and for example that we can also
plot the heat maps of a certain location
in in this case yeah this this heat map
here plots the locations of all the
traffic signals in in a city which are
all these dotted lines and and we can
see the for example there are no traffic
lights here while we can see a traffic
light here and so on so basically any
sort of data visualization or can can be
represented within our with this let me
take a couple of questions on on if you
have any ship I think some question
which says do we need to have
domain-specific knowledge to be a good
business for data mining and to an
extent it helps to have a business
domain knowledge while it helps it is
not necessary that uber has a business
knowledge excels in data analytics to an
extent it is going to be a partnership
of both having a knowledge of domain
expertise as well as having gas
analytics expertise and the way I look
at it in the industry is in this way
typically most of the business analytics
persons they talk with the people who
are on field who understand the business
gain insights from them and then develop
further insights from what I have
whatever they have inferred from the
on-field persons should I see another
question named what exactly is mushroom
learning we have a separate slide
about it very go through it later
why is it called or are I think it yeah
that's an interesting question and to an
extent it possibly is going to be around
our is the letter that comes before yes
and and and I think that's where the
inventors might have said yeah this is
better than a bit and s so we are going
to slam it as are very simply like C and
C++ this knowledge of sequel help in
learning or or visit a different
programming skill knowledge of these two
are completely unrelated so so it's not
going to be a necessary condition to
know our our is similar to visual basic
RC know our is completely different now
comes the question of what exactly is
machine learning to put it simply just
from the basic terms of it machine
learning is is something where we learn
or understand more about the patterns by
giving the data to a machine and and the
mission gives us the output and from the
output we learn about what exactly does
the data have that's that's the most
simple way of looking at what machine
learning is now there are two types of
learnings either supervised learning or
unsupervised learning to put it simply
supervised learning is a case where we
know what we are trying to predict or
what we are trying to understand
unsupervised learning is something where
we don't know what we are trying to
learn but we are trying to categorize
the data in one of the other way I would
I would rather put it in in this way for
supervised learning I would I can
probably give you an example here
supervised learning is one where you
keep the historical data of your
customers saying the customer have a bad
experience or not a one or zero so it's
basically going to be a binary decision
whether he had a bad experience or a
good experience or not a bad experience
and that one or zero will then be
drained on a on a specific set of
features that is all the factors that
drive that bad experience and then try
to predict for a future event whether us
whether a customer will have a good or a
bad experience an unsupervised learning
is one where we group the sets of data
to understand what are the different
categories of the data that is to put it
simply it is called as cluster analysis
where we group the data into different
dimensions of clusters to understand
what are the various types of clusters
that we are working with
moving further the various types of
algorithms that are used in a supervised
learning would be something like let's
say nine naive Bayes or support vector
machines random forests or decision
trees while in unsupervised learning
which is mostly about clustering the
data it could be either a k-means
clustering fuzzy clustering hierarchical
clustering gaussian mixture models and
self-organizing maps and so on ah having
said that most of the types of learning
that we do in the industry at least in
the financial and e-commerce industries
that I have seen are going to be
supervised learning of understanding
water or are trying to predict whether
certain event will happen or not and we
traditionally use something called as
random forests or logistic regression to
build a supervised learning and critic
future okay the algorithms that we have
gone through so far in this one will
briefly touch upon this algorithms in
this course and and possibly not a lot
given that this is mostly about how do
we build a business how do we run
business analytics models using up this
post is primarily going to focus on
business analytics and mark and our and
and not a lot into algorithms coming so
getting back we'll go further and try to
understand what a deficiency is a
decision tree is is nothing but a set of
nodes I would I would encourage you to
look at it this way so think of it this
way this the blue part which is the
route could be any business question or
could be any question rather for example
would sales be high or low and then this
road here branches out saying okay if if
a certain factor is is is a certain
factor present or not if these present
then it goes further if it
is not present then it goes here and
then says and then looks at some other
factors and finally nsaid the leaf or
terminal node now how do next question
is how do we go ahead and build a
decision tree or we'll have a practical
use case and a practical scenario de no
demonstration in a couple of minutes
now coming to the algorithms of basic
decision tree induction by getting into
the algorithms I would rather put it
very simply and encourage you to think
of it in this way now let's say I would
yeah and now let's say you have a
business question in mind whether you
have to give a credit card up through
approval for a customer or not now we
look at all the various factors that
that can potentially come into picture
maybe the customers students for our
maybe the customers total loans
outstanding loans maybe the customers I
would say whether he wants a property or
not and so on what the decision tree
then does is it looks at the particular
variable that distinguishes the maximum
with respect to whether we can approve
or not for example think of it this way
if a customer has a signal score of
let's say less than 500 then
historically we might have seen that
they would have a very they might have
had a high default rate and this she
will score comes as the first node that
we had seen here and it says whether
civil score is is high or not so let's
say you keep the Civil score is low then
it ends and says okay don't give up loan
to the loan to the person but if the
Civil score is high then it goes ahead
and test let's say thus this customer
have an outstanding load or not if this
customer has an outstanding loan
possibly you can say okay don't give up
don't give a credit card to him or if it
does not have a loan then it goes ahead
then says okay that's he own a property
or not if he wants a property you can
probably go and give a given approval to
this candle if not then it will not give
the fan
known to be scanned it so a typical
decision tree process both works in this
way it looks at the first node which
which splits the most or which
eliminates most of the candidates and
then goes further and looks at the
second node which eliminates most of the
Catholics and then goes to the third
node and so on till it reaches a certain
point where where the web there is no
other way of eliminating the eliminating
pinga variables
for example are in this one let's say we
have a an example on decision tree and
we are trying to predict if someone a
per-student would be interested to to
buy a computer or not and the way we
have coded it in in our systems is in
this way given a certain set of
characteristics for example age is less
than or equal to 30 income is high and
if he is not a student and his credit
rating affair he does not buy it
computer and and many of the records
like this and then let's say if we have
this training data set then we build up
a predictor or a decision tree which
tries to predict a buys computer or not
based on all these four factors and then
it gives a decision to you very much
like the one that we have seen here this
will see a case study but people going
to the case study let me see if we have
any questions I think you will get both
the video and BBT / difference and
they're generally are located in the LMS
section LMS portal log of your once you
login to the website you should be able
to locate the video and so on
sure who is going to prepare the
training data the training data is is
going to be prepared by the business
analyst and himself if you remember we
talked about gathering the data and in a
typical analytics core analytic cycle
the business is going to come up with a
logic saying I want to understand what
are those types of customers who would
be interested in buying the computer and
then the analyst goes ahead then figures
out which of the variables of the data
that he has in hand and then builds a
model lot of it so so the endless
himself is going to fetch the data
there any difference between random
forest and decision tree but that's a
good question but that's something that
will be recovered much much later odd
that as much as that is more advanced to
answer succinctly a random forest is a
is an extended version of decision tree
they possibly hundreds and thousands of
decision trees are combined to form a
single random post how can we use a
decision tree in case in situations
where we need to use recursive logic
that to be an extent is one of the
limitations of of decision trees but it
does not solve the problem or basically
it's an np-hard problem to solve while
we try to optimize on one of the
variables it might always be a point
that the first variable might not be
achieving the global minimum of what we
are trying to achieve but the second
variable might but that's a limitation
of decision tree and that limitation is
covered by given by logistic regression
as well as a little random forest and
and to an extent that is one of the
reasons why decision tree is not used in
the industry real time or or even in
predictions as frequently as let's say
logistic regression or a random forest
by decision drink is is the most
simplest technique but the first
technique to be learnt to understand the
next techniques of machine learning sure
so let's think of it this way let's say
we have the data set of a company or
where we have ten variables of that
particular company and 400 records about
those ten variables let's say the ten
variables are sales computer price
income advertising population price
shelf location at stores age education
art
and whether it is us or not but it
simply
the data looks like this you have sales
here and and all the other variables
listed in one or the other way and
getting back to one of the questions
that one of the audience has asked does
our work on both structured and
unstructured data if you look at it this
way to an extent this is a this is a
structured data because there are not
many are there not many levels or not
many distinct values of Sherlock the
distinct values are going to be around
five food or medium and urban is yes or
no while they are not numerical in
nature so still will be able to work on
both numerical as well as non-numerical
that is unstructured data to an extinct
now coming back to the data bit let's
say a cloth manufacturing company is
interested to know about the segment or
attributes that cause high scenes that
ease our Nets we have the sales which we
are trying to understand here based on
based on nine other variables that we
already have so so the question is given
the line variables or how do the nine
variables look like in a place where
sales are high and this is one of the
easier use cases of decision tree where
we can simply explain the groups or
segments where sales at our high to our
audience so that they can understand it
intuitively to an extent in order to do
that well build a decision tree on our
target variable which is sales and when
we convert it into a categorical
variable which is high ceilings or not
and all other variables will be
independent in our analysis and but that
will wave or with the demo
and the demo to an extent or rather than
the typical code that you work in our
looks like this for example this line
here you give where that particular
company data file is located and then
you read that particular file into a
into your data frame will where we call
it as company and the sport data and
then we we see how the data looks like
for example if you look at it here
if you just want to look at the top
three rows of company and the school
data how the data looks like it is
either going to look like this basically
what are all the variables and and so if
you remember they were ten variables
that that we saw in the previous slide
going further
yeah just to show you how the data what
are the other variables that we can look
at for example I will just run this data
for you so that you can understand how
the peeper
here I have loaded that particular file
into our avionics and it looks like this
basically the sales and the nine other
variables that we are looking at and if
you just want to look at porter to be
debated calling names names off is a
function that will give you the bottom
names and then you can do quite a few
data exploration to understand how the
data looks like and it could pretty much
look like this for example in this one
if you just want to look at so given
that the first stance that we are trying
to do is whether high sales are going to
happen in a certain category or not we
have to understand what is the range of
sales and in this demo the range is
looking from zero to 16 point 27 so the
range of sales is and then we will also
look at given that we know range is a
misleading indicator because it gives
the outlier of the extreme values will
also make it how the percentile values
looking and so if you look at sales the
50th percentile number is possibly going
to look like 7.49 the 25th percentile is
5.38 and the 75th is 9.32 so so
basically anything that has a sales
value of greater than 7.49 we can
potentially classify it as high sales
and less than seven point four lines we
can potentially classified as low stakes
and did it quite a few cubed data
normalization and preprocessing that
that we can do using our and given that
it sir it's an introductory course I
would rather give you the flavor of how
the output looks like and the output of
of doing all the analysis is going to
look like this in the demo that we are
seeing here so basically the first
factor that came into picture in in
classifying a category as high sales or
not is if the shelf location is good
or rather if the shunt location is bad
then in most cases sales are low but if
the shelf location is good then it takes
quite a few other parameters into
consideration let's say if shelf
location is good and price is less than
twice is greater than 1 42 then sales
are going to be low while if shelf
location is third price is less than 1
42 then we are potentially again going
to look at ok here is price still less
than K 86.5 that is is priced between
86.5 and 142 that is fit we are trying
to predict or we are trying to classify
a certain segment as I said or not
basically we are looking at shelf
location here price here and and then
deciding on on whether certain
categories have low price or low sales
or high seats for example price less
than 1 42 we are saying that it will
have high sales given certain conditions
while price greater than 1 42 will
definitely have low sales now coming
back with of certain conditions here if
price is less than 80 6.5 or we are
saying that it is definitely going to
have high sales by if the price is
greater than 80 6.5 but still less than
the 142 number that here you can get
here then it checks whether advertising
was less than 6.5 or not if advertising
was less than sales are low but if it is
greater then it goes further and tries
to understand what are the H categories
are bared up since at high and watered
the competitive prices when are been
since at a high so basically it gives
out a tree or or other to put it simply
a decision tree where for each of the
segments it will say whether Saints at
high or not and and that's how a very
simple decision tree is built
I to put it simply it's going to be as
simple as running is our running up a a
small code like this all the tree that
all the decision nodes that you see
there that you saw earlier are based on
running this simple line in our session
I think you should be able to get the
output for this use case the LMS section
of the website our fonts little bit
larger are you should be able to do that
but anyway you'll have the coordinated
so given that we have only five minutes
but left of the session I'll quickly
wrap up the session attica someone has
the very pertinent question on what is
the difference between data analysis
data mining big data analysis etc these
are some terms that that are used
extensively in the industry right now
but to a business user it's mostly about
understanding the business use case
taking data that will answer the
business use case and going about
solving it that's how i would i would
feel that's how i would see the whole
space of business analytics and there is
not a lot of difference between let's
say data analysis business analysis and
big data analysis they are all about
doing analysis on the data be numeric or
textual and drawing inferences from that
and providing the knowledge to the
end-users topics of the course are
basically you will be able to understand
and it is basically divided into 12
modules or and each of the module covers
a distinct part of business analytics
using harsh and first module is going to
be about understanding what of the
various use cases of business analytics
i have touched briefly touched upon a
couple of use cases in e-commerce as
well as financial services but you would
be able to understand a lot more use
cases in this particular module a second
module is more about having a hands-on
training on our programming ah module 3
is more about the various ways of
manipulating data I remember someone
asked around how do you handle missing
values and so on those are the types of
problems that will be covering in module
3 module 4 is more about how do you
import different types of data or the
different import techniques in our for
example you can import a CSV file or a
text file or a sass file and so on beat
any type of file in in many types of
files rather into our module 5 covers
exploratory data analysis which is more
about this which is more about
