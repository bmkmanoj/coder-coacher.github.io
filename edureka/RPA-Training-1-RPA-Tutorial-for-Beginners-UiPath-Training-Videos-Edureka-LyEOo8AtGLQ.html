I welcome you all to this course on
robotic process automation using
uipath so you'll be learning all about
RPE and how you can use it or implement
it in the UI power tool so let's start
on with the session which is module 1
which he says robotic process automation
concepts and see what all it has in
store for us so let's move on to the
objectives to see what all you will be
learning today we will start this
session by first discussing how can you
differentiate between automation and RPA
and then move on to discuss the key RP
concepts which are there and then see
how RP works using examples and then
also understand the different work rules
which can be handled in rpm so what kind
of applications you can develop what
kind of applications you can automate an
RPA you'll be learning all about that
over here
then we will see how applications are
handled in RP a which is basically how
applications that well obtain are PA the
different development methodologies the
exception handling part everything would
be covered in this topic and then
towards the end we will look at radius
RP tools which are available in the
market and see how can choose one or how
you can choose the best tool according
to your requirement so guys this is our
agenda for the session let's move on and
start with the first topic of today's
discussion which is differentiating
between RP a from automation so to
understand this let's take the example
of a calculator so earlier when
calculators were not there and if you
want to do calculations you used to do
it manually but as in men time
progressed and we understood the power
of math we needed complex calculations
and these calculations had to be precise
because these were applied calculations
in processes that we did every day and
so with that also increased the want for
precision so these calculations should
have been calculated precisely and also
at the same time they should be
calculated in the minimum time possible
so this was a problem when calculators
won out there that there was a problem
of accuracy and there was a problem of
speed as well
to solve this problem in 1966 Texas
Instruments came up with the first
pocket calculator which automated
calculations so your automated
calculations from now you don't have to
solve them on paper all of that can be
done by our calculator all you have to
do is feed in the values in the
calculator and the calculator will give
you an answer instantly so this was a
task which was automated by inventing a
technology called calculator moving
forward guys now the way to use that
calculator was that you had to fill in
the values and it will be calculated by
the calculator but the problem was that
it had to be done manually now as time
progressed as we came up with the
solution for easy automated calculations
or easy calculations of complex problems
then came the problem of feeding them
inside the calculator right so we came
up with big formulas or big equations
which had to be solved and feeding it
inside the calculator took time as well
so we advanced and he said okay so this
is again more time we needed even less
are trying to get the calculations done
and this is where you have to understand
that we could not help because we needed
a human to enter the values right we
cannot automate this task of doing so
because what we are thinking is what we
have to enter but then came our P so
what our P does is whatever calculations
or whatever equation you give it it will
automatically feed it inside the
calculator just as a human would have
done so it knows the buttons of the
calculator it knows which button to
press when and can feed in your equation
inside the calculator automatically so
basically if you want to take away the
difference between automation LaPierre
automation was the invention of a new
technology to automate calculations but
when you talk about RP hey guys so RP a
is not a new invention which is there
for every technology it will be the same
invention but it will not change the
underlying technology for example if you
were to talk about calculator calculator
will not change if you automate the task
of feeding the values into the
calculator because all you're doing is
you're using the calc
later the same way you were doing it
before but now instead of humans your RP
a bot is entering the values so it has
not changed the underlying technology it
is a layer which is applied over the
existing technology to automate tasks so
this is the basic difference between
automation and up here now these are the
basics that you are to take away from
this example let's take these examples
or take these basics in mind and try to
understand one more example which will
make a pace or basics more strong so
let's take use case two now if you were
to talk about your sched - it's a
real-world scenario wherein we talk
about a company which is called Volvo so
Volvo is an automobile company so they
produce automobiles and in their company
they had a process which had implemented
rp8 and this process was for invoice
generation or invoice processing so this
had implemented RP n let's see what are
the problems they faced and how they
implemented RP this is what we are going
to understand using this example Volvo
had this process where in the useful
processor invoices using this way so
there was this administrator who used to
get all the invoices by mail and by the
subject lines of these mails the
administrator used to segregate or use
to categorize these invoices for
different departments for example this
could be your accounts department this
could be a child apartment this could be
our IT department so for all these
departments your administrators job was
to categorize invoices and send them the
invoices now for example your Accounts
Department invoices comes here now these
invoices had to be processed further and
for those we had workers now what was
the job of the workers the workers used
to get the invoices from the mail so
these invoices were basically a digital
print of the physical invoice 'iz which
are there so they were basically a copy
or basically an image of the invoices
which were generated and these were
inside the mail so these images could
not be read by a computer because these
images are images right so images cannot
be read by a computer so we needed human
force over here so this is the process
now since it involved humans
there were a lot of invoices which are
to be processed it was very
time-consuming and since the humans were
involved it was bound to have mistakes
now because of these two problems
Volvo as a whole company it affected
their overall performance because even
if a small process is there in the
pipeline and that small process is
taking more time and it making mistakes
it effects the whole pipeline alright so
it basically had an impact across the
organization and this basically this one
thing had to be solved so let's see how
we solve them
so what Volvo did was so they remove the
administrator person from there and
automated that system so it automated
the part of categorizing the invoices
based on the subject lines of the mail
which has the invoices because as
technology advanced they got to know ok
so there is this technology where in the
computers can read the subjects of the
mail and then can decide which category
it will go into so this was good they
installed an automation system which
used to categorize invoices and now the
only manual part which was left was for
the processing part wherein they would
read the invoices and maybe copy the
things of pick up the things which were
needed and pasted it in sign and Excel
files this could be the processing that
they were doing it so this was still
manual because no computer could read an
image now fast forward a few years you
might be thinking that we talked about
today's technology why is this invoice
processing still man and why it could
not be automated so the answer to that
is that they didn't have our PA back
then so a Volvo now came to know about
our PA and they implemented our PA in
the manual process where this image
could be read and change into text and
the text could be stored inside an excel
file so this was something that Volvo
came up with and they implemented it now
a very good question that you guys might
be wondering right now is why didn't
they automate this process why this
process called
RPE and why isn't it called automation
so the difference is guys that when you
are automating something you're
basically creating a software or
basically creating a program you
which you can do so but when we talk
about our PA like I said you don't have
to create any new technology you don't
have to create any new program it's a
simpler way to automate in which you
won't be coding anything you'll be doing
the same exact things that the humans
were doing but you would be teaching it
the same things to a part so this is
what our PA technology is so if I want
to talk about the invoices since this is
the kind of invoice which is coming in
if I wanted the automation to read this
particular image I would have to
implement a technology called OCR
and implement it inside the code so that
the port becomes capable of reading
images and then I'd have to tell the
code to actually open excel file show
the files over there which is a very
long process all right so this
automation could have taken a lot of
time but if we talk about RPE with RPE
the thing is it's very simple you don't
need any coding you just have to drag
and drop you have to just tell your
computer or your board click on start
click on Microsoft Excel go inside the
Rexel and paste everything what is there
in the clipboard and you could have
pasted everything that you needed from
your invoice in the clipboard earlier
and the best part is that why we
implemented it here is that our PA new
OCR so there was no need of creating a
software program it's correctly is eat
it open the excel file is stored it over
there and then do the stuff because
everything can be done in a very simple
manner using IPA this was fantastic
now again the same side where we will be
comparing automation and rp8 so the
thing was that when you were using
automation the task of automating became
very simple because when you were using
automation you could only automate the
part where in if is reading the means
from the subject lines you could not
automate the part where in images came
into place but using RPA you could leave
the images as well because you had the
OCR technology with you which could be
implemented very easy this was the
reason that our PA was implemented on
the worker side moving forward now you
might be wondering we have been saying
that our PA is this and our being that
but what exactly is our fear what is the
exact definition for rpm
so RPE is basically an acronym for
robotic process automation what is
robotic any entity which is able to
mimic human actions is known as robotic
then comes process of what is the
process sequence of steps which could
result in a meaningful activity for
example the process of making tea
involves you to just pour in boiling
water put some tea leaves inside it and
then put milk so these three steps led
to the making of tea all right so this
becomes the process of making tea and
hence the word process and then you have
the word called automation which
basically means without human
intervention anything that you are doing
without any humans intervention is known
as automation so if you want to combine
these three words they basically mean
mimicking human behavior to do sequence
of steps without human intervention is
termed as RPA and this is the exact
definition of rp8
this is how you should perceive up here
that it does some tasks mimicking the
human behavior meaning you tell the
computer how to do it and the computer
does it on its own then to do a sequence
of steps without the human telling it
again ok here you are wrong because it
will do the exact same steps that you
thought it would so this is what RPI is
guys moving forward now let's talk about
the benefits of rpm we understood that
our PA is this but what are the benefits
of using my PA and why not to create a
program which could automate it why will
we use the RPI technology so we use the
RPI technology because of these reasons
so first of all our PA systems mimic
human behavior with no change to the
existing infrastructure which basically
means like you could relate it with the
calculator example that the existing
infrastructure the existing technology
that we have we are not changing it we
are not even touching it we can do
everything on that calculator as a human
was doing using RPF without changing the
calculators technology which is awesome
which was not before so if you want to
automate this using calculator if you
are simply automate the process of
calculations
feeling in the values in the calculator
you will have to interact with the code
basics of your calculator so that you
could feed in the values through a
computer but that is not what is
required now because we have IPA then it
does not integrate with the underlying
surface of same thing which I just said
so if the calculator software is not
something that will be interacting with
will be only interacting with the UI
part of the calculator we are not
bothered with how the software is
interacting with the internal components
of the calculator will be just
interacting with the UI which is very
simple which is just like what a human
would have done and this is the power of
IPA this is how it is different than
automation then since you are not
involved in any of the complexities of
the underlying software you're not
involved with coding so if the solutions
can be developed very fast because there
is no time that you have to waste in
thinking how you will do it the way you
do it if you want to click somewhere
just tell our way to click there it is
that simple and hence the developing
these solutions became very fast also
the implementation costs are less
because now when your RPE can do
whatever task your human could do you
don't need that human worker anymore so
the implementation cost is very less
because you don't have to maintain a
human anymore who only works for 8 hours
so this system that you're designing can
work for 24/7 without even getting tired
and without making any mistakes so this
is a win-win situation you're not paying
a bot and also at the same time your
board is doing more work for you with
accuracy so these are the benefits of
our PA guys moving forward let's see
these are the things that I said please
don't consider me an expert let's talk
about a company let's talk about hoozy
search such as Mackenzie so Mackenzie
recently gave a statement which said it
will have an enormous impact of five to
seven trillion dollars by the year 2025
which is a statement go by guys this is
like epic if you were to think about it
I feel scared and you should too because
I think our technology or our jobs
might get lost to rpm
the other statement which Mackenzie said
was it will touch more than 230 million
knowledge workers there is almost nine
percent of the global workforce now the
way you can perceive the statement is
like this that it does not mean that the
jobs of 230 million knowledge workers
would be lost it can be perceived as is
that maybe the job that you're doing
today will be a whole lot different in
the coming 10 or 15 years because
whatever task you are doing today which
was maybe repetitive can all be done by
our PA so your job profile would ask you
to do things which are not something
which can be done by rpm so your job
profiles will change the way you work
today will change and this is how it
will touch more than 230 million
knowledge workers so this is what
experts have to say now let's move on
and discuss how our PA actually works so
let's see our PA in action let's see how
our PA would fit in a job which is
happening today so let's talk about a
job called the data entry job so this is
a basic or a normal data entry employee
whose daily job is to aggregate data
from different sources and put them
inside an excel file so this is his job
every day he would go to different
sources he would take out the data and
they would aggregate them inside one
file so that it becomes easier to see
now this job can be done by a bot as
well because it is repetitive right you
can tell a computer to do the same
things again and again using rpm so the
bot or the RP a technology will actually
replace the data entry employee to do
the same tasks not only in a lesser time
but also with efficiency and accuracy so
this is a particular use case or this is
a particular kind of job which will
actually be replaced by RP in the coming
years now let's talk about another
example which we can implement in which
you can actually see our pube work in
the real wide world so let's talk about
a problem first so we will solve that
problem using rpm now say you have a
requirement wherein you want to see the
product name and the product prices for
a particular brand for example I need
all the phones of Apple
to be listed along with their price now
if you want to think about how you could
do this manually the way to do that
would be to go on different e-commerce
websites and see their name and prices
and get them inside an excel file and
there are like 60 65 phones this will
almost take you like an hour to do maybe
if you take one phone in one minute to
think you're not but I think it will
take you more than that because you have
to go to that e-commerce website and you
have to copy the data from there and
paste this and come back to the
e-commerce website maybe go to the next
page second page didn't have again a
list of 20-25 products again do it so
what we're going to do is we are going
to solve this problem I'm going to show
you how this actually happens in rpm and
you will be able to compare the time
that it is going to take to lists around
60 to 65 phones and say under a minute
and also at the same time it will save
it inside an excel file and also mail me
the same thing so the way we will be
designing this or the way the task is
divided into categories is like this so
first it will identify the elements so
if you were to implement it an RPA first
you have to tell RPM or you have to tell
your bot which elements to pick so it
will first identify the elements and
then we will define a structure how do
you structure these elements inside the
file that we want then we define the
structure then we create the result file
so whatever structure that we have came
up with we have to store it inside a
file so we specify the output file that
we want the results in the once you are
done with all these three things we run
the automation board could do the things
again and again so this is a task that
we are going to automate today using rpm
so first of all let's expand all these
steps and see what is required in
creating this kind of project so first
like I said you have to identify the
elements so you will go to the
e-commerce website you will search the
phone brand and you will see which
elements should choose or which elements
to copy for the appear project for your
RPA implementation then you will define
a structure all right so you choose
these many elements now how to structure
them it becomes easier manner so if you
have to take our example you will see
you want to call him for name and you
want to call him for price so once you
have the
the structure you will move on and say
okay so this structure has now to be
stored inside this particular file so
this is where you will be doing that and
towards the end you will implement or
able to run this whole thing or these
steps that you have aggregated through
above so this is what we are going to do
now let me quickly show you the
application that I've designed in your
eye path which will do the exact same
things that I just told you so let me go
to my uipath studio which is here so
this is the application that I've
designed today I'm just going to show
you how it actually works so basically
what it'll do is for taking in the input
it will basically read an email from my
inbox so let me send myself an email
with the search term that I want to be
worked on so I'll send myself an email
which says say I want all the lists of
phones from Apple so I will type in
iPhone and i will send myself this email
so if i refresh it now you can see i
have a meal with the subject line iphone
now i will go back to my application and
i'll simply run it so let's see what
will happen now so now i've configured
my application to actually go to an
e-commerce website called Flipkart its
reach trip card it is picking up all the
phones it is going on each page to see
okay I have these many phones here these
many phones here and these many phones
here taking up the values storing it
inside a variable which is basically the
structure that we talked about inside
that variable I haven't defined the
structure this is the structure that I
want Rafael Superion and then that
variable once it's finished taking the
data its extracting the data that
variable is actually implemented inside
an excel file that excel file is
actually mailed back to me so this was
really cool this is the power of our PA
and I think I took around 10 or 15
minutes to design this application so
let me go back to my main to see I've
got an email back from the rpi bot which
says query let me open this email and
the bot has attached me a file so let's
open this file and as you can see it has
listed down all the iPhones which it
could find on that particular website
with the URL and along with their price
so it has given you all the prices and
it extracted around 45 phones which is
impressive so if I already extract this
information this would have easily taken
me around what it was depending on the
speed and also storing it inside an
excel file and yeah it mailed me as well
so this is completely awesome that this
can be done through our peer so let me
come back to our slides to see what we
have next all right so we have
successfully seen how are they works in
real life let's move on to discuss now
you might be wondering this was one type
of application that I could develop but
what are the different type of workloads
which can be handled in a via which
could be automated using rpms let's see
that so these are the type of workloads
which could be automated now a guy is
the first kind of workload is the
repetitive kind of workload so like the
data and field employees or so his job
was to repeatedly do things the exact
same manner for every task these kind of
tasks or these kind of automations can
be implemented and RP r can be designed
in RP it to be done very easily then we
have scaleable tasks so whenever we have
to scale something for example you have
to scale your server for scaling your
server your hard to follow a particular
steps these steps can be told to RP 8 to
do this particular way and it will
implement it in its own software and do
it for you whenever you require the
other kind of tasks which can be done is
wherein you learn by doing it I trade
for example as humans when we do a
particular task again and again we learn
it to do it better we learn how to do it
in a smarter way
that same thing can be done by a RP as
well so it can find efficient ways to do
a particular task by learning I created
B so this is also a feature that you
have an RP and these type of workloads
can also be handled in the RP a to
moving forward these three workloads
that we just discussed are actually
handled by three type of words now you
might be wondering what are what's so
what are nothing but the agents which
are working the system for example right
now what happened was I clicked on run
some entity went into my email it
actually saw ok this is the first unread
email that I have it took the subject
line out of my email and then went to
flipkart.com searched it over there
got the results copied the extracted
information saved it inside the excel
file went again to my email and mailed
me back so this is all done by an entity
and this is what a bottle is a bot is
basically the entity which is running
the program for you so like I said bots
are software programs that mimic the
behavior of a human whatever you'll be
specifying inside the project is what is
going to be executed by the body but
automate routine tasks and eliminate
inefficiency so like I said all the
repetitive tasks that you want to do can
be done by the bots in the way that you
have specified without any inefficiency
it will never get tired it will work
24/7 for you so there is no scope for
inefficiency and also when you talk
about but there are basically three type
of bots which are there an RPA so let's
understand these three type of watch two
type of bots which have been defined
actually are actually used for different
kind of uploads of a different kind of
tasks so for example the first bot which
is the task board is used for
applications wherein you are doing
automation for front-end so whenever you
are executing an application which
involves the front-end your job will be
done by the task board also whenever
there is repetition or there are
rule-based tasks they will also be done
by Gospels and tasks bots are basically
something which will be implemented more
than the other let's see well what are
the other two boards so the second type
of board is a metal pot what is a meta
bot a meta bot is basically which is
based on the properties where your
implementation is being carried out
now when I say properties what I
basically mean is for example I went to
a website called flip CARICOM if
tomorrow the UI for flip card outcome
changes my cash bot will fail because I
have told my dashboard to exactly go to
this particular element click it or go
to this particular element and do so but
what if all those elements change in
that case might ask what will fail and
that is where my meta what will
so my meta what is works differently
than at a sport which is defined on the
basis of properties and mostly if
applications are changed but time it
will have no effect on my automation
that I'm trying to do so this is the job
for my meta but and then I have my IQ
board for the so we discussed there are
workloads wherein we learn hydrated Lea
right so for all those kind of workloads
we have the IQ board which continuously
learns and enhances the process
automation so it will find smarter ways
of doing a particular task and it also
manages fuzzy rules and processes
unstructured data whenever you are
dealing with input which you have no
control on it can also help you to sort
those kind of inputs the high q-- board
now you might be thinking where are
these boards actually used inside the
tool so inside the tool guys there is no
specific section which will say what
kind of board if you want to implement
but it all depends on the kind of
projects that you are creating but in
any kind of project if you see that this
particular task is happening that is
actually being done by the your IQ bot
or Empire meta bot or by your task board
so what you should take from what we
have just discussed is that these three
kind of tasks are also possible to not
be a like if you I just did for Flipkart
right I did an automation process from
Flipkart then one of you might ask me
that what if the UI changes so I have an
answer for that by saying ok then I can
create a project in meta bot which will
actually cover that disadvantaged
variant my you I will change my
automation must have to be created again
now we have discussed the kind of
workloads which are possible or which
can be created or which can be automated
in our PA let's see what are the
different ways you can deploy an
application and up here so when you
deploy applications in a Vega is there
are basically two ways that application
can actually run so these two ways are
basically you can either create a front
office robot or you can create a back
office reward now what is the basic
difference between them is the way they
are triggered so when we talk about
front office robot it is an attendant
bot which executes this automation on
the user's local workstation so it
always needs a human trigger that
I ran my project nobody else around I
don't know other entity which was
automated ran my project so I will
always need a human touch to start my
project or the other way it could be is
the way that I can execute this
particular task is then I can save at 3
p.m.
run this particular project that is also
a wait so if I'm trying to execute my
application of my application has been
designed in such a way that it will be
executed like this these kind of
applications would be termed as front
office robots because you need a human
to execute them right they are not
executing on their own
you still need human to actually work
around with them but when we talk about
back office robots guys so you don't
need the human trigger in this so these
kind of robots can actually work from
directions given by a server for example
I say that whenever an email comes in
trigger my project so if I were to
implement this kind of automation in the
current project that I just discussed
with you then in that case it would be
termed as a back office robot because in
that case you're not doing a human
trigger your project is running on your
own by the instructions from the server
telling me that an email is come please
execute this particular project for me
now even if you are having a back office
robot that does not mean that it cannot
execute through a human trigger or
through by scheduling it can also do
that but a front office robot will never
be able to do so why are we discussing
this is because when you talk about
uipath guys the community edition that
you guys will be practicing on will only
be focused on front of a shop words for
back office robots you have to actually
buy the license or you have to buy the
software and then you will be able to
create those kind of applications so
this is the reason I just explained you
what are the different ways to deploy an
RP and this is also something you should
know moving forward let's look at some
application examples which can be easily
implemented and are clear so you can
automate application releases through RP
you can also automate networking you can
automate logging and troubleshooting and
also automate monitoring through IP and
there are again a lot of use cases which
can be automated using RPF whenever we
those traits that the task is repetitive
or the task is a scalability problem it
has something to do with doing it more
efficient now let's see how applications
can be developed in rpm so there is a
particular methodology which you can
follow to develop applications in rpm
when you are trying to create a complex
project because that helps or that is
followed in businesses may never get
there creating applications so RPF
follows a structured stage wise
implementation approach this is
something which you have to keep in mind
whenever you're creating applications
you have to try to make it as structured
as possible so that you don't miss out
on anything because it gives our RP a
solution a structured frame and the
harpy development methodologies has
basically four distinctive stages so
there are four stages that you have to
keep in mind whenever you're creating a
project in our PA so these four stages
are the things which every project goes
through even if you realize it or not so
let's see what are these four stages so
these are the four stages guys you first
have to SS then you have to approve then
you design and then you implement that
are followed to actually create an
application in our PA so first we have
to assess what other requirements so say
you're creating an RTI application for a
customer so the first thing that you
will be asking your customers is what do
you want so you will be assessing their
requirements you'll be taking the
requirements down and you'll be saying
okay so this is what has to be automated
then comes a proof so in approve what
happens is you come up with a list of
requirements you say okay these are the
things which can be automated and these
are not are you sure you want to get
these done in your project so this was
taking an approval so this approval
could be from your manager it could be
from the customers that you're dealing
with then comes design wherein you'll be
designing your project so once you are
sure okay so this is the thing that you
have to go forward build you go on to
design your project inside our PA and
towards the end you implement it role in
the implementation stage it could be
either a front of a server or it could
be a package so this is the development
methodology there are peer follows let's
look at each stage one by one so like I
said the first stage is where you will
be taking
requirements from your user whenever we
are taking or whenever we are including
the requirements these are the four
things that you have to basically take
care of you have to take care of the
schedule so which task has to be done
first and which has to be done data for
example you say okay so this is the
thing that the user wants but this
process should be done first in the
application and this particular task
should be done later because the second
might have a dependency on the first and
also you take into importance what is
more important whatever is more
important you do it first so that should
be the first thing on your list and the
daily life usage so whatever requirement
that your customer is giving you you
also have to take in account how you
will be able to implement it inside your
app your projects you should be seeing
okay so this is the kind of format that
he wants in the output you should have a
clear picture in mind how is this
particular format be given to the
customer so for giving it to the
customers obviously it has to pass
through something it has to pass through
a variable and therefore you have to
think about a data type which will be
able to handle that kind of output and
also the Department which is related to
so what kind of project it is this is
our Accounts Department project is it
and I HR department project so all of
these comes under asses so once you have
assessed your requirements the next
stage is to edit approved so it starts
with an approval of the process which is
to be automated right so you scheduled
everything you took your requirements
according to the importance and then you
come up with the plan now you have to
get it approved you have to get the plan
approved to actually go on and create
that project so before coming to that
approval you're assessing stage has to
go through thorough investigation and
the documentation so when I say
documentation basically whatever you're
trying to create will have a document
attached to it so that whenever somebody
is trying to understand your project or
is trying to understand how your project
works he has to go and read something
and that something is what documentation
and so you also have to create a
documentation and the stage ends with a
business case being presented to the
management team so like I said you will
either present it to your manager saying
ok so this is what my project is going
to do these are the requirements and
this is what I'm going to create is it
ok so this could be either customer
facing or it could be like managerial
facing if you are in a big company now
after the report is thorough with the
process it has to go through that you
have designed in your program it will
also go through a series of tests where
then you can say okay this process can
be done in a more efficient way so you
will program or you will design your
project in a more smarter way so that
the robot can do some tasks more easily
or it could be done in a better way and
it stage ends by testing the robot so
you test if they are getting the correct
output or not and everything once you're
getting the correct output and all of
the other points are addressed you move
to the next stage which is the
implementation part so once you have
assessed the requirements you have
approved the requirements you have
created your project now comes the
implementation path now when you come to
the implementation part this is
basically testing but on a whole
different level now you will be actually
deploying your robot in a live
environment in which is created inside
your development team and you will see
how the behavior of the robot how the
robot behaves to different kind of
inputs and if there are things which you
think are some things which are not
going according to what the user wants
you will have to program it again so
this is a whole cycle in the end of
which you get a complete ended product
so like I said so if you were to recap
in the s stage you took the requirements
from the customer in the approve stage
you scheduled the requirements you put
them down according to importance and
then you get an approval from your
management team and from your customers
once you have an approval comes the
design stage where you actually design
your project and you test your project
locally and during the implementation
stage you deploy your project enable
life of working environment and see how
the robot responds to different kind of
inputs and if there are any problems or
if there are any outputs which the
customer doesn't want you will handle
them this you end the development stage
and you get a finished product so this
is how a typical RP application will be
developed in a company or it could be
the way you will create your RP
application
now I mentioned there might be some
errors in the work environment there
might be some errors and you'll be
testing your robot so how to handle
these errors or how to handle these
exceptions is what we're going to talk
now so let's see how we handle
exceptions encountered in rpm so let's
see what are exceptions for the
exceptions arise when dealing with the
software program and should be handled
properly so it could be something like
your output is coming correctly but
there are some things which are coming
along with the output so how do you
handle these exceptions or how to handle
these errors the success of exception
handling depends on how well it is
implemented during development
alright so if you have structured your
program or if you have done everything
correctly during the development phase
your exception handling becomes very
easy you basically will not get any
exception when you're trying to test it
in your work environment and also they
accepted in handling is very important
because if exceptions are left unhandled
it could impair the RPA functionality
because then in the live environment if
the exception you didn't see that
exception coming that exception was not
something which was taken into account
when you were testing a robot and
suddenly when the exception comes when
you are actually working or when you are
given their customer the product it
actually you know just crashes ass off
and your customers for whatever he was
supposed to do with that our peer tool
comes to a halt so that also is a
problem so you should be very careful
when you're actually testing a robot to
handle all the exceptions which might
arise from your project it ensure that
problems can be automatically resolved
or easily identifiable so you can also
design your project in such a way that
whenever an error comes now there could
be a lot of errors you cannot assess
everything but you can also tell your
program to actually if there is an error
get yourself out from the data in a very
graceful way for example you're using
Chrome right now if you're using Chrome
and you're working in the middle it
suddenly drops off it suddenly closes
you will not know what exactly happened
but instead what chrome does is it
handles this kind of problem very
smartly what it does is it says your
Chrome is not responding and you might
have to restarted so then you don't feel
that the crew
has crashed you feel okay my Chrome not
able to handle the problem that I just
gave it and you think okay maybe it's a
system problem which actually it is but
you cannot say that Chrome there was a
problem with the Chrome software because
chrome got through that error very
gracefully so this was an exception that
you ran out of memory so how will chrome
handle that so when you have these kind
of problems you have to handle these
problems
and the way to handle them is using
exception handling now what are the
exception types that can arise when
you're using rpm so there are two types
of exceptions that you can get so one
type of exception could be a business
exception or it could be a system
exception for example what I just told
you that your computer ran out of memory
there is a system exception the other
kind of exceptions are business
exception so let's see what a business
exceptions first so business exceptions
occur when established rules are broken
so if you have said that inside my
company this is the way things happen
and you're like okay so this is the way
things happen now you will design your
pod to work that way but tomorrow your
business process changes but your tool
or ERP abort was programmed to work in
the previous rule so he will still work
that way and that is when a business
exception actually comes in or this is
where a business exception actually
occurs for example you created a bot for
online payment and say before when you
got your board created from your RP
developer you said ok transactions more
than 20 thousand should not be accepted
so that was the maximum tag say that he
gave to your board so you told about
whenever there are transaction of enemy
there is a situation the transaction is
requiring amount which is more than
twenty thousand dollars decline the
transaction so now inside the company
you come for the rule okay so from now
on we will also be accepting payments
which are above twenty thousand dollars
in that case when you will try your
bought to automate the task that bot
will not be able to do so because there
is no problem with the board there is no
problem with the system the problem is
with the rules that we defined before
and the rules that you have defined now
it becomes a business exception because
the framework that you build your bot
around has now changed so their bot has
to believe
program to select it and be able to if
you were talked about this example take
extractions which I'm more than when he
those donors then comes system errors
the system errors are nothing but
technical errors that a system mind
encounter well so these are not error
that are found in your program but on
the system on which it is being
implemented so one problem caused that
every system can have is it runs out of
space or it runs out of memory so what
should you have bought to in these kind
of situations so this you can define an
exception handling unless these kind of
errors you have to actually take care
when you're designing your applications
now we have discussed exception handling
we have discussed how applications are
developed we discussed what RB is the
last part which is very much important
in any kind of application that you're
creating is security so what is security
now how is it can be handled in rpm when
you talk about security guys so let's
talk about how secure is Rp right now so
configuring business automation carries
a risk of exporting security flaws or
committing human errors so there is a
risk of you know exploiting securities
if your configuration is not correct
because when you're automating basically
I've given all your credentials inside a
particular variable so this variable
could be exploited by a hacker or by
someone who's trying to gain access to
your system so you have to be very
careful whenever you are automating a
business process which involves
credentials so are peer tools provide
the means to limit user action based on
rules so the user actions can be
restricted by creating rules now water
rules we are going to discuss in a few
moments but if you cannot control your
variables because variables can be
accessed by anyone if they have the
access to it but what if you cut down
that access whatever you say that users
don't even have the access to X is
available only ARP developer will have
the access to the variables in that case
you actually secure your application
from external entities now what are
these role-based access that I am just
telling you so role based access allows
an organization to maintain access
privileges in the team so this person
can only access this part of the program
this person can access only
this part of the program so this is what
role-based accesses and this basically
restricts any unauthorized roles which
are trying to access your program so if
particular person is not authorized to
basically take part or print to
basically use a particular module of a
program he will not be able to do so
because of role based access what is
role based access let's discuss that now
so role based access basically means it
is a method of regulating access to a
computer or network resources based on
the roles of individual users with an
intent for example I have a company
account so my company account can be
given the edit changes right so if
there's a file I can edit that find
other person his name is maybe Tyler he
can only view that fine same is the case
with Sebastian Sebastian maybe can
create and delete a file so you might be
wondering what is the difference between
this role and this road so Sebastian can
create and delete a file but I can only
edit the already created fence this is
the difference between Jake and
Sebastian
whereas Tyler can do neither of the two
we can only view a file which is already
existing in the system so you are giving
access to different users and these
users have basically been given roles
that you have the view role on you can
only view a file you can only create or
delete files or you can only edit the
files this is what role based access
basically means now accusing rule-based
access so how does role based access
actually work so it involves a built in
privilege system so basically you have
an administrator who says ok a developer
gets access to the database of the
company so if there's a tester he
doesn't get access to the database he
just gets the access to the program code
the source code which is there in the
program there could be a third person
who is basically a manager who will be
reviewing your programs he he doesn't
get the access to the source code he
doesn't get the access to the database
he will be only seeing your program run
right so he gets the view right so the
view rule of your program this is how
role based access work all is defined
using an administrator now better use
role based you basically use roadways
whenever
you're granting access to environment so
your program will work in an environment
your program is itself an environment
there will be different people will be
interact with the program user could
interact with the program right and
Belapur could interact with the program
a manager could interact with the
program so all these people will have
different views the same program and all
of that is possible using role based
access the next thing is called their
Active Directory Integration which
basically helps you to manage
credentials so for example me say I have
an account in the company so that's a
different thing that which a role will
be assigned to my account but for
logging into my accounts there should be
a particular protocol there should be a
way to log into my account and these
things are managed basically by the
Active Directory so it is a
functionality that centralizes
credential management says there will be
only one place where my all my
credentials will ship and I can get my
credentials from over there so this was
what Active Directory is all about you
can create and restrict user roasts
and entities to align with company's
policies using the same act of directly
so that role based tasks of the role
based access that we were talking about
these access are actually given through
Active Directory program right so you
will have the credentials over here you
would also have the roles over here so
you can use the Active Directory to give
access to your users who are there in
the company and this is what the Active
Directory is actually used for so Active
Directory can also be implemented with
your RK tool so active directory is not
something which is a part of at me it is
a separate entity but why are we
discussing it here is because it can be
used with our pyramid can be easily
integrated with any Rp tool and then can
be used to provide roles to different
users who are trying to use your program
now if we discussed about the RPO
technology right so we know what our p
is we know how we can create
applications we know the security aspect
not yet but our key is the technology
which can be implemented using tools
right so our P itself is not a tool you
implement our P using tools such as
uipath such as blue prisms at our
automation anywhere so let us first see
you
what are the different tools available
on market to implement the rpi
technology so these are the different
tools guys you have automation anywhere
you have blue prism you have UI path you
have both fusion and then you also have
pega so along these there are a whole
lot of different tools which are
available in the market now you might be
wondering which tool to use how will you
decide which tool to use there is a
checklist which you can follow to
actually choose a tool you can see which
technology that particular tool is built
on so that you can relate it with your
requirements that your user has given
for example UI path is constructed on
the VB or the dotnet technology so you
can assess the technology and you can
see ok this is the tool that I can use
then also you should take into account
management how you can manage your
automations in your company when I talk
about management this basically plays a
role whenever you have around 10 or 15
systems or five or six systems which
have a different kind of automations
which are running on them and you have
to manage all these tools or you have to
manage all these computers which are
learning automation using a particular
central server
so this is where management comes in so
you can see which tool is more easier to
manage or which tool creates my job
easier or makes my job easier to manage
the different automations which are
running in the company then comes the
part where in you will also be looking
at the interface how easy the tool is to
use so if I were to learn or if I were
to train my employer so you use a system
or how easy would it be is what
interface talks about and then the
security aspect so whatever tool that
you're trying to use is it following the
security compliance given by security
organizations right so that basically
tells you if you're creating
applications in that attitude how secure
with that application be right that is
the security aspect of your tool and
what tools will relearn we will learn
the UI path tool which is a free tool
which has been provided by the UI path
company and when I say free the
community edition is free for them you
can also buy the pro version for it by
buying the license but since we are
learning the community edition will
suffice for us and that is what we are
going to use so with this I
