inherit properties from one class into
another class for example you are having
a Honda car and there is one more
company that is providing fog lights so
now what Honda can do Honda can buy
those fog lights from that company and
can install in their car so basically
fog lights were not dear functionality
it is North dear manufacturing they are
buying it or they are inheriting it from
or they are outsourcing it from another
company so this is called inheritance
same way we can do in programming
languages that use object-oriented
concepts in which we can inherit
properties from other classes into our
class and that parentcolor that class
from which we inherit the properties or
functions that becomes a parent class
and the class that extends that parent
class becomes the child class now if
honda gives us the fog light another
company BMW can also buy fog lights from
the same company so the the same way a
class a parent class can be inherited by
multiple subclasses or child classes it
is not restricted to a single class it
doesn't means it is not a case that if a
class has inherited a parent class
another class will not be able to
inherit it this is not the case it will
be able to inherit so this is basically
called multi-level inheritance and
multiple inheritance concepts that will
discuss later and moreover a single
class can inherit properties from
multiple classes
for example it is having for example
Honda car buys fog light from one
company and back mirror Viper from
another company so it is buying two
different proper products for two
different companies the same way in
object oriented class a child class can
inherit properties from more than one
class this is called multiple
inheritance that we will discuss later
so here let's have some characteristics
or properties of an inherited class
child class automatically inherits all
the member variables and functions of
the parent class if we extend a class or
inherited parent class through a child
class so old of parent functions and
variables can be used by child class
automatically by default we can also
define our own member variables and
member functions in the child class even
child class will have its own members
this means that some of the properties I
am buying from outside and rest of the
properties I am building so let's see an
example for the same
you
you
let's have an example that will make you
clear
so let's have a period class called pen
and
let's this parent class is having these
methods set price and kickbacks let's we
having one more class that is called or
here open
so in here open I'm having a function or
first of all I'll be having a variable
dollar manufacture or manufacturer so
I'm creating a function get manufacturer
it is giving me the pen is in the
fractured by
this manufacturer
so here you can see here open is having
a single function that is get
manufacturer pen is having set price and
get price now I want to create object of
here open but I want to call these
functions means functions of pen class
so here what I have to do I have to
extend 10 class here so now if I extend
if I create object of 0 pen rather than
10 class I can use this function to call
the color i can use this object to call
the function of pen class because set
price is not a function of here open
class it is a function of pen class but
if I have inherited extended the here
open class with pen class I can call its
function
and there something wrong
ok
no I don't think any this is missing
what is the issue
let me check wife we are getting the
sexual
I don't think white is giving an issue
nothing saying something wrong here
where is given
there's the one thing
copy this class and we create oh no I am
getting a fool
okay let's extend it external and class
okay now it seems fine doesn't know what
was the issue so here you can see I have
created object of hero pen and I'm
calling function for and class so now
you can see functions of pen class are
called by the object of here open class
so what I have done I have extended hero
pan with pen class now i can use
functions of pen class by calling the
object of Hierophant class so this is
called inheritance I have inherited from
parties of pen class by here open class
and moreover it is having its own
function that is get manufacturer so
again I can give dollar obj hero pan
manufacturer value I can give the
manufacturer value as hero and here i
can call obj hero n can get manufacturer
I will print it and you will see this ok
ok because it's a constructor function
so while creating object
you are just giving it
ok
so here you will see the ghost of Penn
is 20 that is from the pen class and the
cost of the pen is meant manufacture of
the pen is this so the manufacturer of
the pen is hero the coast of the palace
20 so this first is being printed from
Penn class word this is from here open
class so a child class can call
functions of its parent class as well as
it can call functions from its own class
so this is called inheritance I think
this is clear to everybody now
ok
anybody else handout
apart from this earth anybody else is
having doubt if any let me know
shall we move ahead then
yes so midget can we move ahead okay
fine so it was inheritance I have
explained you same thing you can see in
this example price color type these are
properties of pen and here we are
extending pencil pencil class again
extending pen it is having its own
method set manufacturer get manufacturer
but this pencil can go functions or
variables from this pen class like it
can set the value of fries it can set
the value of color here I had also i can
do one thing so this price can be set
from means not only the functions but
the variables of parent class can also
be manipulated by the child class so
here if we want to change this price
dollar price and if we use this prize
inside rather than coast example I'm
using dollar this price so i have
created the object of here open but what
I can do dollar obj hero pen price equal
to 30
now you can see the cost of the pen is
30 now price is a variable of pen class
but I'm accessing it with the object of
here open class I'm changing it and this
is taking making its effect to the pen
class so this way the child class can
manipulate the variables member
variables and member functions both of
the period class so this is a key in the
example showing you the same thing pen
is having its own variables its own
methods and pencil class is having its
own method variables but pencil can
access the methods and variables of
period class here pencil also contains
price color writing color and type so we
are inheriting the pen class 2 pencil
each pencil can have the same
functionalities add as a pen can have a
pencil will have a prize it will be
having color it will it will rights in
some color and it will be having a type
so rather than writing pencil same guy
same for her features for the pencil
class again we are simply extending it
from other class so inheritance simply
gives us the power to reuse a code if we
have already written a class that
performs some particular functionalities
then rather than writing the same
functionalities for another class we can
simply inherit that class for example we
can create a parent class car and Honda
car BMW car or ol can fetch or extend
that parent car class and use its
functionalities
