this eighth video of a regazzi and your
course for beginners in this video we're
gonna talk about services now in the
previous video we discussed about how to
go ahead and implement forms in angular
there we majorly discussed two types of
form that angular provides one was your
reactive form and the other one was
completely even forms so without doing
any further delay or without wasting any
time let's go ahead and understand what
essentially is an angular service so
basically services allow you to separate
your concerns or you can say that to
extract all those common functionalities
that is there in your component and put
it in a separate class so all those
functionalities like data parsing data
access logging logic your tax calculator
for any website what you do is you put
all those functionality in a separate
class and then you provide that class to
all those places wherever it is required
this helps you to reduce the code
redundancy so instead of writing the
same logic again and again in all those
places now you have put that in a common
place that are called as services and
finally you inject those services in all
those components or all those directives
even in other services as well as per
the requirement so overall you can say
that services provides you three
benefits the first one is it makes your
codebase more modular it provides you
the code separation by separating the
common logic into a separate class and
also it makes your application easy to
maintain now in order to provide a
service whenever you have created a
service which will be essentially a
class and then you will be using a dread
injectable decorator so as to tell
angular that this particular class is a
service in order to inject that service
or in order to provide that service to
any other components or all other places
when your application you use a process
called as dependency injection so let's
go ahead and understand what is the
dependency injection and how does it
work along with services now suppose I
have n number of services in my angular
application and I want a particular
service to be injected on a
particular component in our case let's
say the service to which is essentially
a search logic so in that service class
I have put some search logic which I
want to implement in a certain component
so for that what I will do I'll be using
a concept called as a dependency
injection that will allow me to create a
new instance of that service class along
with its required dependencies and
finally use all those logic or all those
methods that has been defined in that
service class for example your search
logic in the component wherever I am
injecting that particular service to so
enough of theory guys so far you would
have learned a few things like the
service allows you to put all those
codes that is common in general for
various components and then you finally
use it in all those places so let's go
ahead and understand how does it works
actually so we will go ahead and open my
text editor here I'm gonna run my
project and by ng serve command which is
an NG CLI command so if you're watching
this video for the first time I would
recommend you to go ahead and follow the
second video of this series which will
be on your angular installation and
project structure so that you can have a
better understanding about what ng CLI
is and how to create a new project or
new angular project now I'll go to my
browser localhost 4200 and he'll is my
application up and running now what I
will do I will be creating a very simple
demo so that you can understand the
benefits of services and how to use
service class or how to create a service
class and use it in your application so
I'm going to go ahead with a new
terminal and I'm going to create a
component in GT component and I'll name
it as a list so basically I'll be
displaying a list of items or you can
say the grocery lists are using this
component and the items that I'll be
retrieving for this cross her list will
happen using my service class so
basically I am creating a service class
for data access logic so I'm going to go
ahead with ng Chi service so this is the
command ng command for generating a
service where G stands for generate so
ng generate service then you provide the
name of your service class file link so
gonna go ahead with data and by default
it will append dot service to your file
name so as to distinguish it with other
files that is there in your project
structure now if I go to my source
folder inside my app where all my code
resides you can see that I have my
treated all service thought TS file
created by my ng CLI similarly if I go
to my list component I can see that that
list component is over here that I have
created just now all right now as I have
told I want to display a grocery list so
I'm going to go ahead and create an area
which will be a string array so I'm
gonna say item received all right so
I'll be receiving these items from my
service class which will be of type
string and it will be an array for now
let's initialize it with no value that's
why I have put an empty single quotes so
this a no value were there now I want to
face the data that will be there in my
service class and I want to put it
inside this items received property that
I have just created I'm gonna create a
method called as get items from service
class alright and here what I want is I
want to use my this items received
and I want to retrieve the data for my
service class so I'll say to do later
alright so for now let's just do this
and we'll do the remaining codes later
on now let's go ahead with our service
class here I'm going to go ahead and
create an array so I'm going to go it
with an array called as items which will
be of type string do an array and let's
initialize it with a few items I'm going
to go it with butter bread and then
let's say salt all right now I'm going
to create a method over here which will
be accessed by my list component this
method will be responsible for sending
the data to my list component so I'm
going to go ahead and create a method
called get items all right which will be
returning a string array that we have
just created that items array so I'm
going to go ahead with string and then I
want to return my list dot items that's
it all right now in order to access the
method that we have defined in our data
or service class which is this method
and therefore access this items array
what we do is we follow a procedure
called as dependency injections so let's
go and understand how we use dependency
injection and how we provide a service
to a particular component so I'm going
to go ahead and import that service
class first all right from great added
service now in order to tell angular
that I have a particular data service
class whose instance will be created at
the moment this particular list
component is being created and finally I
will use that instance to access the
methods that I have to find over there
what you do is you register the service
to your providers array so I'm going to
add one more field in my metadata
providers the field is called as
providers and here and one of go ahead
and put my service class name that is
data service now this providers as I
told earlier it will create an instance
of that later service class now in order
to refer that instance that has been
created of that data service class so
basically we will be using a proper
tea and we will be using that property
as a reference to that data service
class or the instance of tech data
service class so I'll go ahead and
create a property named Stata service
you can name whatever you want you can
go it with some random name as well and
then which will be of type 8 a service
so this is what dependency injection is
now using this data service property I
can access all those methods that is
there but all those business logic that
has been defined in my data service
class now for example the method that
I'm interested in for now is to retrieve
the area that I have created over there
so that will be your kit items method so
I will go ahead with this stored data
service dot if you put over here the dot
you can see the intelligence working on
and it is showing you all those methods
that has been defined in your data
service class so one of the methods is
get items and the property is items I'm
going to go ahead and use my cat items
over here which will return an array if
you remember so you can see that this is
the method that we are accessing which
is returning our items array all right
now let's go ahead with our HTML or the
template of list component where we'll
be displaying our Crossrail list so here
I am going to create an unordered list
with an ally tag and here I am going to
use something called as ng for directive
so basically it will iterate over the
area and it will fetch each of the item
that is there in our array which will be
displaying as a list so I'll say let
item which is a looping variable on
which each of the element that is there
in our area will be store and our array
is item received all right and then I'm
going to interpolate this item so as to
display it the value of that particular
rule looping variable now let's go ahead
and add some bootstrap class which will
be list group and this group item all
right now
function to be executed in order to
retrieve the data so what I will do I
will find this particular method to a
button so I'm going to go ahead and
create a button and I will name it as
show list and then find the click event
so whenever this button has been clicked
it will execute that function which is
get items from service class and then
finally this list will be shown over
there so let's go ahead and check out
our application yeah nothing is
happening over here basically we forgot
to add the selector type which is a very
common mistake so you have to nest the
component that you have created in your
app component which is the first
component to be loaded which I have told
numerous of times so I'm going to use my
selector tied so as to load my component
list component and now if I click on
this button you can see we have three
element being loaded over here now
initially it is showing one of the empty
element because we initialize that
particular property item received array
with an empty value so that's why you
are having an empty element being shown
as a list now similarly you can add
other functionalities as well you can
add functionality for adding new item
let's go ahead and do that so that's
what your services to us so basically
we'll put all your common logic for data
parsing or for data access or service
logic alford sorting any data you put
all those common functionalities into
your service class and then finally you
provide that service to the component or
to all those components wherever it is
required now let's go ahead and add a
form so we learn about form in the last
video itself we don't need this because
we are not making any xhr requests in
general whenever you will be using
services you will be using it with HTTP
methods I will show you how to use all
those in the last video of this series
where I will be integrating firebase
with third of our angular application
and there I'll be using HTTP methods
extensively so I'll show you how to go
ahead and work around with your STP
methods you'll get post put method
delete method and use it in your service
and finally provided in all those
components so you will learn it over
there so basically we will be building a
full-fledged application in that
particular video now what I want is I
want a div tag over here alright and
then I want an input and next thing i
want is pardon which will be of type
submit' alright now I'll name this input
as item name and what it does it
basically if you do not provide any
variable or any property that is their
inner component it uses this name
attribute as a key and assigns the value
whatever value that you will be entering
in this input field so I'll show you
what I'm trying to say so basically all
this has been discussed in our previous
video so let me give you a recap so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead with
item name all right I'll say value and
let me convert it JSON all right there
is one more thing missing let's add add
item all right now as you can see I am
getting an error because it's saying
cannot treat the property value of
undefined so we haven't defined the
template variable for our form so let's
go ahead and do that as well so I'm
going to go ahead with the hash tag form
and I'm going to use something called as
NG directive okay so it's very simple
what I am doing is am gonna refer this
form with a variable template variable
called as frm what form and how I'm
going to use it I'm gonna use a
directive a built-in directive called as
ng form that allows me to assign a
template variable for accessing all
those values in my form so that's what
the idea is over here now I'll say form
thought I come name dot value now what I
need is I need to add ng model as well
so that you can find a model with the
form or associate a model with the form
and that model will be used to log out
the values which is there or which has
been entered to our form so here we are
using two things so the first one is ng
form what it does it allows you to
associate frm the template variable so
as to refer to our form the second thing
that way you'll be using is called as ng
model which is again at
which allows you to bind all the value
that has been entered on your form with
a model or any property that is there in
your component class so let me show you
what I'm trying to say over here so I'm
gonna go ahead with ng model all right
now for using ng model you need to
import a certain model called as forms
modules you need to go ahead in your
route model that is your app court model
and here you need to import a certain
model called earth forms module from add
thread angular slash forms all right and
they need to put it inside your imports
area that's it now what will happen over
here is this NG model will find the
value that we will enter as an input to
this name attribute which is item name
which we can see whatever we are
entering so what I am going to do is
basically I am going to interpolate the
value of this name attribute that has
been assigned by our ng model so if I
write anything over here we're getting
an error over here let's go ahead and
okay I'm sorry I just did a mistake
basically we were referring to someone
defined so basically we need to access
the value of form inside that we need to
access the key item name which is a name
attribute and now it will work so as you
can see we are having an empty input
over here so as soon as I enter
something you can see that that
particular thing is being displayed over
here or interpolated or just below your
input bar so that's how I can access
this particular value or whatever value
that has been hindered on this input
element so let's remove it for now now
what I want is basically I want to go
ahead and use something called as ng
submit so whenever I submit just form I
want to get the access of all those
fighters that is there in my form which
is a way simple a single input element
and I'm gonna push it inside that array
that is there inside my data service
class so I'm gonna go ahead and do a
method called as add new item alright
and I'm going to pass this template form
variable and call as frm so that I can
access to all those
value of this particular form all right
I'll go to my list component and here
what I'll do is create a new method I
create a new method so I'll go to my
component let me create a new method
called as add new item and I'm gonna go
ahead with an argument as type any so
this is what your typescript provides to
you if so whenever you are not sure
about the type of what argument you're
passing you can go ahead and use any as
your type now what I want is I want to
call a method from my data service class
all right which I'll be doing later on
so let's go ahead and create our
function first so I'll create a method
called as add item okay basically it
will be receiving an item so I'm gonna
say it as new item and then I'm gonna
add it to this thought items torque push
and I will pass this new item as an
argument now this new item will be
pushed inside my array now I want to
return the updated area as a new item
has been added so I'm going to go ahead
and return this as well that's it now
I'll go back to my list component and
Here I am gonna use that method that
I've defined over my service class so if
I now do this you can see that I have
that function over there or method over
there that I have defined just now
called as our atom now I'm going to pass
form dot value dot item name right you
can console it out as well console dot
log form dot log dot right um name
alright now let's check out whether it
works or not so let's add few styling as
well so for example I'm gonna go ahead
and add bootstrap class called as button
button success and here let me make it
as class button button primary
I think yes met mistake that's why in
the button was not appearing clearly now
if I go ahead and click on show list we
are having these three items in our list
that you have to find in our service
class now I'm going to add a new item
called let's say egg we are having an
error item name is not defined so maybe
I have done some error okay
let's try it again now it's working so
basically there was an error in my
console dot log function where I put
form dot log and noise so here how it
has worked so now you can go ahead and
do fubar as well add any number of items
you want now you can go ahead and
implement delete functionalities as well
as update functionalities using these
code base as I have already discussed
all those concept acts will be used for
creating this functionalities and trust
me guys it is very easy to do so the
best way to learn angular is to code and
implement things work around a simple
simple examples you will get errors
sometimes it will be difficult to
understand few things but in those cases
just refer to the official documentation
which is very well-written and
everything has been well explained over
there else comment on our videos where
he can provide you with the absolution
and help you further so as to learn
angular now one more thing that I want
to add over here is so what we did over
here is that basically we wanted our
data service class to be provided in
this particular component only if you
want your service class to be accessible
by all those components that is there in
your application so for that what you
can do is instead of providing it in a
particular component go ahead and
provide it inside your abcott module or
your food model so that it can be
accessed throughout the application so
I'm going to go ahead and do that
and also I'll be copying this import
statement because it is not recognizing
it and hence it is done okay so there
was some padding issues now it is done
now if I check my application again I'm
having an error in Turners okay uh oh
it's working fine not
now if I go ahead and check out whether
it is working or not
it's working perfectly fine and let's
add sweets over here you can see it's
working can I add candy it's working so
basically if you want some of your
services to be accessible throughout the
application or you have the
accessibility as app white accessibility
then you go ahead and put it inside your
providers array or register your service
in the providers array in your root
module else you put it inside the
component wherever you want to inject it
into so that's it guys that was all
about services so we have learned what
is a dependency injection how to inject
a service and what is the purpose of
having service in angular application so
I hope this video was informative for
you in case of any question or any doubt
you can code and ask those queries in
the comment section below so we'll meet
you in the next video where I'll be
creating a crud application where we'll
be again using services extensively so
as to create a new data that insert a
new data to your database for deleting a
data for retrieving a data or for
updating any data that is already there
in your database so we learn all about
that in the next video so we'll see you
in the next video till then have fun bye
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
and you can comment any of your doubts
and queries and we will reply to them at
the earliest do look out for more videos
in our playlist and subscribe to our
Erica channel to learn more happy
