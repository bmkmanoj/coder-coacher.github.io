webinar which is a child way with
pmi-acp myself shitty Singla i am almost
11 years of industry experience in
software development in testing and i am
into agile of coaching and consulting
from almost two years now i am a scaled
agile certified practitioner and
consultant and also agile testing
certified curve insulted i have been
involved in too many agile
transformations and coaching
consignments along with my work
experience with something is like
emphasis and safe yet so the basic end
to end of that as me as a shoemaker team
decided have jotted down for this
webinar is we will try to understand
what is pmi-acp why do you need pmi-acp
how is it different from other
certifications available in the market
and having said that you would want why
do you need to be neat to have pmi-acp
certification as a widely you need to
move towards a child how is a child
different from other models right and
briefly we'll look into the exam and
certification process or PMI as well
okay so i'm sure most of you would have
heard about TMI TMI is not a PMI is
project management institute which
offers various other certifications like
TMP a PM business in a project of
business analysis risk management
renewal management there are subtle
other certifications as well and PM
pmi-acp is one certification through by
PMI which is totally aligned around
agile principles tools and practices so
if we if if you have to compare this
certification from the MP a PMP on a
broader level talks about core project
management tools techniques what are the
mythologies that should be used for
project management in nutshell
pmi-acp is only focused around a child
to do PMP you do not need to be part of
a software industry or IT industry PMP
can be done by anybody who is managing
some kind of project but if you want to
do a CP it is only for software or
industry's software industry people and
PMP is a very a PMP will give you a
broad information on project management
and a broader area okay so this is how
pmi-acp and complete differ so in case
if you have doubts on how which
certification to go for either PMP or
ACP I hope this will answer it will
clarify that so ACP is only for those
folks who are focused more around
interacting with teams on a daily basis
who are well clients or what companies
are moving towards a chime authorities
but PMP is for those people who worker
who are who are a you know just who are
dealing with project management and I do
not interact there we are their focus is
more around the big picture of delivery
of the project it could be either tech
domain either technology or maybe it is
not even when they feel that it has to
be a software industry now if I talk
about a pmi-acp exam to earn dense
pmi-acp exam or to appear for pmi-acp
exam you need to have 24 pdus PD use is
nothing but a professional development
unit where one video is equal to one art
of up off of professional activity or
maybe some kind of a learning activity
so achieve to appear for this
examination you need to have 24 PD use
which are given to you by a Jamaica if
you attend pmi-acp course find them okay
so this is a kind of a mandatory
training that you need to undergo if you
are appearing for pmi-acp this
certification is valid for three years
and to renew the certification you need
30 videos so you these PD use can be
attained by any webinars which are
conducted by p.m. PMI or maybe
self-study that you do through some
projects that you were working on our
and there are sir there are certain
other web or maybe you are attending
some conferences on a giant so this is
how you aren't videos you need to
register with PMI and you need to submit
the video information and PMI goes that
approves that right so while preparing
for this examination as I mentioned this
is a this is this certification training
is kind of a mandatory thing to appear
for there are certain other reference
materials which are recommended by PMI
there are 11 books which are recommended
by PMI but i do not recommend reading
all the 11 books to just to clear the
exam one not two books is more than
sufficient but just in case if you want
to read those books you can I mean any
time go and bring them from a knowledge
point of view here okay there was this
question how is pmi-acp different from
other agile certifications like SCM or
CSM they have a couple of people who
wanted to know that so pmi-acp so okay
so this ACP is a broader umbrella
whereas other certification which we
talked about like SCM or CSM both are
focused on enjoy whereas ACP of a sip is
a broader umbrella SCM ncsm are
completely focused on scrum whereas ACP
talks about complete agile so when I say
complete agile agile is a bigger
umbrella under which there are certain
different mythologies which can be used
to execute the project which are scrum
lean XP DSD em TV DVD you know these are
the various different mythologies which
can be used and scrum being one of them
the
other certifications like SCM and CSM
just talked about scrum where they will
not talk about clean they will not talk
about conv they will not talk about XP
whereas in pmi-acp you get to know about
everything so if you ask me if you are
pmi-acp you are fit to work in any of
the mythologies you want to work on but
if you are CSM certified or SCM
certified you just have it for knowledge
on a basic scrum with origin but you are
not aware about conv an expiry so I
always recommend my you know my
colleagues my peers or maybe my students
to go for pmi-acp obviously because it
will give you more broader information
and it will help you it will touch base
every aspect of a child okay so having
said that we have been talking about
agile certifications from XP but one
thing is that we need to understand why
do we need a jive ok so I will ask you
to please use your chat window again and
if possible please let me know why do
you think we need edge I why does a
traditional waterfall model fail why do
we why why there is so much a buzz about
edge I all room why everybody wants to
learn agile and every company wants to
move towards which I what are your
thoughts on it he is use a chat window
and if you can just briefly describe me
I would love to hear those answers yes
there are agile helps you have a quikr
Isaac execution agile is a very useful
for project projects who are volatile in
nature or maybe they have ever changing
requirements the requirements are not
stable very well said yes they need
upgrade very true so as as you all guys
mentioned agile is more suitable for
projects who are long-term and
very volatile requirements there could
be asked in a scenario where the client
wants to start a project but at this
early stage he might not have a very
clear information on why he wants to
what what is his ankle in this case you
would always go for agile agile is best
suited for this these kind of projects
because a jive in long run lets you
accommodate changes since you are not
working on a big bang approach you are
not working on all the requirements in
one go you are working in context in
which you're working in small chunks you
are you you can implement change very
easily but having said that does not
mean that waterfall has completely faded
out right waterfall has its own benefits
and is most beneficial when projects are
stable and are short-term right so we
are I am NOT here to propagate that
waterfall has failed or I am NOT agile
propagator but the idea is that
collaboration and change in requirements
should be acceptable ok so I to just to
rehydrate use waterfall model where the
projects are short term and you have a
clear vision on what needs to be
delivered and with the requirements and
static whereas in agile the requirements
would not be static they would be
dynamic they would be volatile in nature
and it would be most suitable if
projects or long-term because when you
are working on a project for a big
bigger duration for more than a year or
maybe more than signal the chain chances
of technological changes may be sleep
market demands might change and you
would want you might have to introduce a
change in your requirement right so in
this case agile would be best suited in
short term but project which is like two
to three months project a technological
change or a market demands there are
very less chances of having that changes
hence waterfall model will work for you
okay so to demonstrate that to an end to
elaborate more on that there is another
term terminology which is called cone of
uncertainty so it says that the
estimates which are done at the initial
level okay are are not very close to the
real finger they might change a four
times back than the actual estimates so
generally what happens in the legacy
system in the legacy method when you are
doing any kind of estimates right they
are done at a planning phase or Romania
pre-planning fails most of the team
members are not involved in just for
impact point of a kind maybe priest
Phills team or beers are involved and
they have very limited information with
them they do not know how the system
would progress and they give the
estimates which are very unrealistic
there could be a case which are where
they are far away to list maybe you need
two days to come now fix something and
they estimated it to be harmed day or
maybe there would be so much padding in
those estimates the client started start
losing money but in agile we say that
implementation of agile mythology
flattens this cone of uncertainty okay
so when I say as I flattens the cone of
uncertainty it means that the estimates
are very realistic we are we are not
doing any pending or maybe all the
estimates are not less how so what we do
is in agile we never works in work on
assumptions right so if we have a huge
requirement they are called a pic so we
do not estimate other requirements at an
epic level which are at a very high
level so just to justify I am creating a
website which is something similar to
knock or calm or any job seeking portal
and I want to implement the search
functionality on that right the
implementation of a search
functionalities are very
high level requirement it can have
multiple things under it it would need
it can have keyword search it can have
wildcard search again depending upon the
persona depending upon the kind of
person who is doing the search the
functionality might differ so if I am a
job seeker my search would be around the
job listings right if I'm an HR my
research would be around the resumes I
would also want to download my resume is
right if i'm an admin of a website my
search would be more around maybe user
profiles maybe around the content which
is probably getting published on website
so under search functionality search
sometimes it's a very broad high level
category so my requirements would all my
estimation will never be focused on the
search functionality so we do not
estimate till that time we have clear
information until that time we do not go
down to a user story level so epics are
further broken down into feature and
then into user stories a user story is
nothing where my requirement is defined
on the basis of a pro Sona and I have
acceptance criteria against it right so
a typical user story for this search
functionality could be as a HR admin I
want to implement a search functionality
where I could also download a resume it
as a job seeker I want to have a keyword
search which helps me look for a which
provides me maybe a more granular or may
more refined search results for that
particular job as a job seeker I want to
do a search based on the location so
that i can see all the jobs which are
available for that particular location
so this is a typical user story so my
estimates in form of ours only occur at
a task level which is like if I am if I
am working on a user story like as
as a job seeker I would want to
implement a search functionality based
on the location I would have certain
tasks associated with user stories like
creation of test case implementation of
a functionality execution of test cases
for these are my tasks so my estimates
in ours would be at a task level above
that at us from epic to user story level
my estimations would be based on the
story points which will define the
complexity of a story okay so if a user
stories some stories at eight points and
another user stories X 4 points so I can
rough or I had a high level a user story
with four points we take half the time
of user stories of eight points okay so
in this way that since we are not
estimating it at an epic level we do not
we keep for you know we break the
requirement and we only estimate till
the time we do not have a clear idea
will do not have complete information
around it we do not estimates so which
India which brings in the correct
estimates and which it makes the
estimates more clear which reduces the
chances of having a blurb you know your
estimates bleeding right or maybe
estimates were so tight that teams ended
up stretching themselves here does that
make sense if you have any questions at
this point of time please ask I think
there is a confusion this ACP as I
mentioned this ACP certification will
talk about the complete age I area it is
I did not mean if I if I sounded like
that I did not mean that this ACP
certification is only for large projects
no all I meant was this ACP
certification will cover the complete
aspects of agile whereas other
certifications just focus on scrum part
of it is if you
in touch with all the exiled mythologies
which are you know present within agile
and agile in nutshell is more useful for
projects which are long-term or which do
not have very clear requirements or do
not have very clear vision yes edge of a
Kaiser registered education provided
provider for pmi-acp certification if
you guys are interested i will ask
support team to get in touch with you
probably after this webinar is over you
will get an email from supporting for
the feedback and for the registration as
well since I a case if your interest
rate means you will destroy yourself for
same you can use that and it's an online
training which we provide any other
question of agile concept as such why do
you need a jail in any question on core
or our cone of uncertainty okay so now
having said that that agile helps you
and after the changes which are coming
up in the requirements health agile
helps you adapt all the changes which
are there in agile we the estimates are
really close to what the actual ask
effort would be ending agile we do not
work in Big Bang way and you know what
do you think would be the benefits of
agile right I'm sure you would have seen
when you're working in a traditional
model most of the time we are working on
a requirements which are not even used
right so if I have to quote another
example probably a working on an ERP
system and for a erp system taxation
could be very important requirement
first integration of taxation in
july-august time period would be of a
real effort wasted because this is
something you might not be using it
right till februari or march you would
read that system when when you are in
February or much so it makes more sense
to implement a functionality in time
period of july august or sep tember
something which are going to use in the
member and december right so this this
is something taxation is something which
can be deferred for some time because
you are not going to use in the fourth
febrile right so in agile are since the
requirements which we are picking in
small chunks and pieces are prioritized
by the customer you have a regular
collaboration with your customers we
talk to your customers on the daily
basis or on a regular basis and you take
a priority and you paint the input from
your customers it helps reduce waste
because something which is of not which
is not no use at current situation or
current time frame ism and it has been
created is a waste right and since the
prioritization is happening and the
practice a shin could be based on the
cost factor or maybe on the meat market
need right so and you're creating only
those things which you need currently
you are in a way you are increasing the
speed to market an increase in the ROI
as well okay another is improved
decision making why how does it edge i
will pin improve decision-making in
there Giles everything the decisions are
not just restricted to the higher level
in agile with propagate that any
decision which is taken has to be a team
effort as well has to involve has to
have team involvement right so when
everybody in the team is involved in the
decision maker decision-making you make
sure that every aspect of a project is
taken care of maybe if only our
developers are involved in making a
decision making there could be some
aspect of QA which guest gets mixed
missed sorry so when it is a complete
team decision it helps and have it
taking them better decisions
improved confidence since we are saying
that agile completely focuses on
collaboration it makes sure that
everybody in team is rated as equal we
give them ownership to do their own work
we do not believe in command kind of a
relationship with the colleagues and
maybe with the junior junior profile so
we give that ownership to make their own
decisions which in turn will help
improve them were all of the team and
again once the moral is good that they
would trust and safety and good quality
of product is imperative right one of
the questions which I have at this point
of time is how do you selected you in a
July whether you need XP whether you
need con man whether you need early so
whenever so I in interest of time with
whenever we select an agile mythology
that leads to be worth win to win
assessment kind of a thing so based on
those assessments that we do we decide
which mythology to go for so for example
agile XP could be used for those teams
which one into hardcore development and
into product development explain would
be best fit for those things because XP
gives you the eye lens for you know
programming for production support con
man is best suitable because of the con
man gives you a task foot kind of you
know task what kind of a thing which
helps you speed up the movement and
since in production sport you have SLS
defines account one could be you so
there are other assessment criterias
which we have and based on those who
decide which mythology to work on okay
any other question so once if you guys
are interested in you know taking the
pmi-acp certification from a jew baker
educator support team will get in touch
with the right thing for
the ER attending they also offer some
kind of a discount and you can just go
you're going roll yourself so these
batches happen every weekend every two
hours every weekend and it's a 16 are
soft or 24 hours of training and it
happens every weekend the 42 was and you
can just enroll yourself once your
training is complete you would get a
certification of completion of training
from a Eureka and will which will you
show you another 24 of pd use which are
must for appearing for the exam and
while do you take the training I keep
guiding you on how to register for the
free for Pierre mind how to appear for
then Sam and when is the best time to
start reading books so this is how it
will be okay and once you are from your
application has been accepted you appear
for the exam this is the kind of a
certificate which you see on the screen
that you you would get Gareth there is
no marks which are mentioned here it
would be they'll just pass or fail so
generally 265 / side but yes this disc
are the current and tram pattern which
is there is only applicable to 15th of
July most fifteenth of July there is the
expected change in exam pattern which
obviously would would be introduced my
age Rico as well so there is expected
change in pattern by a pmi-acp which
will go on till I think September right
so if we enter the pilot phase and we go
on till sep tember so this is how it is
in case if you want to go for a cert
training and you want to appear for a
certification either it has to be before
15th of july and even if you pray the
training now and you are not able to
appear for the certification there will
be a follow-up class with you guys to
introduce me with the new exam pattern
by eureka and which will be free of cost
any other question as of now we have no
information that how what is the change
in process it is just the examination
pattern which is going to change so
overall ACP process of I think would
remain same there would be no change as
such there it would be more of an exam
pattern change cranbourne does not
differ from a giant and balances subset
of agile basically so agile provides the
guidelines for can burn as well any
other question okay so apart from what I
mentioned about this edgy rocker class
so if you will just think for you would
get to exam materials right so you would
get access to the LMS learning
management system which we have all the
presentations in the study material it
also has more Dale Weise quizzes and
themed mock tests based on the current
exam pattern of this at least are these
mock tests would change as we get
information on new exam pattern plus you
would get access to 24 by 7 or technical
support and access to this elements
would be valid for lifetime so even if
you decide to give both give the exam
later you would still this success would
be valid throughout okay so this is all
about it okay so as it says all people
who attended the webinar now are
eligible for I think thirty five percent
discount itself but i am not sure if
this discount is still valid but i
thinka you can talk to it support in for
more details on that obviously you would
get a complete information post the
class in an email okay any other
question before we close for the webinar
okay so thanks guys for your time just
