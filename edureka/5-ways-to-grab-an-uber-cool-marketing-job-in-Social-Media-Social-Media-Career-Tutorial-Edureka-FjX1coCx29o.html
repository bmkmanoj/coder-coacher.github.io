five years to grab a new job in social
media marketing we are so let me
introduce myself my name is amin share
food dean i am a digital marketing
junkie I am a graduate from a new school
of business pastor in 2010 I have spent
the last 10 years purely in marketing
and dedicated to marketing and i think
and i am architour as well so now this
will happen once i pastored of isb i
started as a publisher of network ad
network head and then moved on to upon
management in retargeting consulted on a
lot of startups for their initial
reaching their audience efforts and
sometimes realized that ok this is the
future and what happened by chance is
going to be the carrier for me and for
most of you i'm assuming because you're
here on the phone so i got a bunch of
the awesome lot of people have
acknowledged that they are clearing me
this is great news so here is how we are
going to run this up there is the
questions box so any time during the
session feel free to just put in any
question there if it's appropriate at
that moment i will go ahead and answer
it or i'll keep it till the end of the
session but I promise you no question
will go unanswered so with that and no
for the delay we shall get started okay
so the topic itself is so I'm assuming
since I mentioned social media i
mentioned marketing i mentioned job
there is a lot of context already like i
am assuming that you guys understand
which part of the ecosystem you are in
but the idea is so that we get started
and we proceed in the direction to see
how do I land up in the sweet spot of
sweet spot of social media marketing now
I have been asked by Nathan be if there
will be any video unfortunately I am
there won't be any video to pure audio
session and there will be a deck that
will be running through if I was one of
your celebrities then definitely s i
would of put on video and then survived
by that I'm not there yet so now kindly
pardon me and we shall stick with the
presentation and the audio bit yeah okay
so here we go all right so what are we
going to do today is objectives right so
we want to understand what are we high
paying jobs available in social media
marketing that is definitely one of the
main objectives that we have set today
um awesome while we wait I have a
question that has come in is is there
any technical requirement to do social
media marketing fantastic news there is
no technical requirement and as you will
realize as we go through the day it's
purely a field of marketing I have
started myself as an electrical engineer
and I moved on to do telecom engineering
and I couldn't survive more than eight
months in it so that's where my
technical carib ended so don't think
that I need to understand some coding or
I need to understand something on the
tech side for me to be able to do social
media marketing but what is required is
what we'll be discussing but here's the
deal if there is a specific section
called social social media applications
which kind of sits on the layer of
audience now for you to be able to build
social applications obviously one you
need a concept to you need an initiative
three you need to understand engagement
but for you to be able to do that you
don't need to do it yourself like you
don't need to understand that this is
the way I should go to get or make that
happen you can always once you come up
with a concept you can outsource it and
get it done so yes as a clear no you
don't need any technical requirement to
get started to you know perform social
media marketing on behalf of any brand
or agency or as an independent
consultant okay so I'm guessing that
people have come back and I'm assuming
is all set so let's move back to the leg
so the objective for today I'm laying
out is so how should we or what first we
have to understand what are the high
paying jobs that are available right now
without knowing them you don't know what
to hit or what the target so first we
understand what the high-paying jobs are
then we go to understand
what the skill sets are required then as
yourself you will figure out what are
these what are the gaps that are there
between the jobs and the skill sets and
yourself be aware of what's happening
and we just take a deep dive to see how
exactly we land the job now another
question is coming during that time is I
don't know much about media marketing
how long do you recommend it takes to
learn the basics all right so I can I'm
of all people i think i am the most
qualified to answer the question because
i started exactly as you right and when
i started i would not understand what an
impression mean what what ads mean what
do people pay for or what kind of media
buying is possible this is where I
started and today i am doing this course
so it is purely logic driven people can
master this in like an R or they can
master it in ages so what defines the
mastering of social media marketing or
in general media marketing is not just
knowing the basics his son is knowing
the basics understanding the science
behind it understanding the art behind
it and then going step forward to create
engagements so that's where so learning
this is easy applying this and adding
your own niche on top of fit is the
journey that you will have in media
marketing hope that's clear but feel
free to kind of come back on any open
doubts that we made her right so before
we proceed first I have to give you the
bad news the bad news is you all of you
who have had any kind of background in
marketing or no background in marketing
no matter what roles or jobs you come
from here is a statement that you will
remember that I made during the time of
this webinar all of you will be replaced
exactly two years if you continue doing
what you're doing today and you can
quote me on this just don't kind of
badmouth me
that happens but please be thankful that
I'm telling you ahead of time everybody
especially who is aspiring to be
marketing or who's already in marketing
or who's doing other jobs that is
connected with in terms of cust customer
or consumer facing any of you who have
been building truckloads of experience
all this while you will be replaced by
people who can do those jobs in a web
format who can do the jobs in a more
automated format which means you need to
rediscover rethink and we establish
yourself as to what you would become in
this field of reaching audiences because
that's the future where the money is
that's the future where advertisers will
head towards and that's the future where
audience is going to be okay so here is
the bad news right so I am told you
clearly that you will be replaced in two
years Eli okay dude thank you very much
for telling me that what happens now
what do i do right and for you to
understand where to get started just
let's take one little peek at how
Internet has affected our life right
internet is affected our life for that
for us to understand the impact of it I
am just borrowing a chart from V social
where they have told this is the
penetration of Internet as percentage of
the total population how do you read
this if i look at canada 93% of the
users are online if I look at India
nineteen percent of the users of online
but the trend is towards reaching
saturation the trend is towards having
access to the internet across the globe
there is no change towards it the growth
is tremendous what was seen as a hundred
million users in India they came two
hundred is becoming touching 350
predominantly all driven by mobile
internet usage but all you have to keep
in mind is for now there is no big thing
I've said so far is that infant
penetration is reaching saturation and
all developing countries will reach
saturation
it much sooner than any projections that
out there so this is what you need to
keep in mind tomorrow anyone talks you
know you have to first stop the language
which is hey this is the penetration of
the internet which means this is a
medium that people are going and
remember this is percentage of the total
population so there is an upward trend
there is a very fast enough adoption of
this so you know for a fact that people
are getting online much faster than ever
okay now knowing this what can we say
next the penetration of social media as
compared to the usage of the internet
and the population now don't you see a
similar trend that the approach that
people are falling towards getting
online is being followed by people being
on social media right now for you to
understand media in the simplest sense
obviously the first form of media was
the print poster that was put up on the
walls in the yesteryears why because
market is thought there are a lot of
people walking on the road they can see
this poster that's on the wall they can
understand more about the brand or a
service okay then came your radio then
came TV then came any medium that you
know as part of advertising that
wherever people are there but remember
this this is a very simple thing but it
goes a long way in understanding media
buying wherever people are there there
is spoke there is opportunity for
marketing and advertisers are ready to
pay that medium that money no matter how
much to get awareness about the product
or service so now you can get an idea
why people spend on advertising on a TV
why because all of us are watching TV
then why people are spending on
newspaper advertisers of putting huge
ads or newspapers or how do you think
they make sense of it because and
newspaper sells the same match space
back to advertisers saying that hey you
know what I got so much viewership of
the population in tyrone cities which
means if you advertise with me I give
you that reach fantastic very simple
equation then whatever has said so far
in terms of penetration of
internet odds percentage of population
and penetration of social medias
percentage of the internet and the
population do you see what is happening
here right what is happening here
exactly is this because that option has
hit so huge because the number of users
the number of eyeballs the volume of
audience that has come on both these
channels has kind of surpassed any kind
of known media in such an extent in
terms of growth you will see that
suddenly advertisers don't have to go to
any other medium to spend money because
they can spend all that money these
channels where the people are there
where the audience is there I said it
that's the golden word audience so the
golden word I need to tell you today is
audience to give you a good example the
what the number of volume of money that
is spent is about thousand eight hundred
crores in Indian advertising in online
and all of this is to attract this
twenty percent penetration population
that comes to a cost of 200 rupees per
person which means tomorrow if you own a
property that has thousand users you
actually can clean 200 in two thousand
in theory as the per year as the as the
work as the value of the audience you
own so now you understand where the
whole concept of audience is kicking in
and why is why I am a directly jumping
into social media without even
discussing anything else because number
one rate of adoption number two the
volume of audience and number three time
spent on it I just have a quick question
popping out I'm just going to quickly
say so you mean another 2 25 years it
will be only the digital medium will be
left what you know I love especially
when someone asks a question like this
where the answers in the question itself
I in fact the person who is asked this
question has been a little generous to
say do 25 years trust me we are going to
see much soon other five years I have
been telling within
one to two years the percentage of
budgets that will be occupied by digital
medium and when I say digital medium
Here I am going to give you a bonus
inside that how a predominant percentage
of this digital medium spend will be on
social media and how predominant
percentage of the total spend on
marketing will be on digital medium so
and you have the numbers right in front
of you so if you are not in the thick of
things if you are not in the middle of
these things then suddenly all of this
has happened way too soon you wouldn't
even know what hit you and it's too late
to get started in this field of social
media marketing right so while for the
name / sayin I'm saying it's a social
media marketing but for me when I take
marketing this is where my money will go
okay so having said that here is the new
age Pied Piper right the new age Pied
Piper for me is the social media
channels which is obviously bringing in
all the audience we just saw the numbers
we just saw the figures that everybody
is hitting there now who will follow the
audience if if audience is going and
spending most of the day's time in a
certain medium who's going to follow
them the brands because brands want I
also brands won't awareness brand want
influence they want to develop an
interest created desire bring in action
and if brands are able to follow the
audience then who will fall the brand's
the agencies who survived because of
these brands agencies who can create
those stories who can execute campaigns
who can build advertising in its truest
sense and if all of this action is
happening you could also be in the thick
of this action if you realize this exact
ecosystem yeah only difference between
the actual pie pepper in this case the
piper the previous Pied Piper basically
got a great lost and this one is not
going to be this one is your road to eat
to be in the thick of action as early as
it can get and there is no better time
than now when everyone is still figuring
this space out where the knowledge is
much lesser than the growth this
particular channel is good right so
remember
this today first so far your takeaway
should be this anyone talks so about
this you have to put your head strong
and set boss let's not talk crap all the
money is heading towards this channel
why because of the penetration these
channels have in the digital medium and
because of the penetration digital
medium has in terms of the eyeballs of
the users period there is no second
thoughts about this you can say and if
you want to be smarter odd numbers about
penetration put numbers about population
code numbers about marketing spins port
numbers about increase in terms of
budgeting spends quarter-on-quarter on
1.1 ok I have another question which is
come in which is how can we improve our
brand for freshers I'm assuming the
question is as individuals how can we
build a brand for ourselves who's that
correct is that the question that was
asked yeah he confirmed if I understood
the question right perfect so the beauty
of this channel is the experience
doesn't matter there is nothing called
fresh air here there is nothing but five
years experience here so everyone starts
equal why because a person does has ten
years of marketing experience doesn't
mean that the person understands social
media marketing channels right which
means a person who's apparently called a
fresher is both of you start on the same
plane so what sets you guys apart what
sets you apart is the way you can
understand what these channels are what
you can do with it the way if it pitch
an idea forward the way you can sell
yourself that this way I can engage
users better than anyone you could talk
ok and I'm going to to you I'm going to
tell you just that in the next three
four slides where what is that we are
looking at in terms of opportunities the
next question that comes up is still if
you talk about percentage of employed
penetration and brutal NBR do you think
digital would really work fantastic
question I love people when they bring
questions about rural India here is an
interesting fact the percentage
penetration
google india is surpassing percentage
penetration in urban in terms of growth
so you are reaching rural india which
advertisers and brands have been trying
to battle using mass media all this
while and living on sample statistical
measurements is suddenly going to get so
much smarter and suddenly they have
access to people right at the point of
location the opportunities immense
marketers are today battling what we
call a supply chain networks on the on
the on the ground because they are using
existing networks to tap them and get
products of course but today you have
opening a new communication channel why
because of cheaper mobile cheaper data
availability cheaper connections why do
you think that you'd run net neutrality
became a big deal because they didn't
want to sabotage or corporatize this
whole deal they wanted easy and free
access for people to ensure
connectivity's first and now you know
when people have connectivity what do
they do first they want to jump onto
social media and now you know if people
are on social media it's in there is no
more rural urban or how do i reach rural
highway route urban that's not the
question the decoder phase followed by
another question is how can we make or
social via post as effective to drive
more traffic it is beyond the scope of
this webinar unfortunately but obviously
it's a valid question i will see if i
have time at the end of the webinar to
given some tips as a follow up it is
only usage of social media for chit
chatting and nothing else i believe
everyone has a consumer including me see
social media is nothing but hey i send
messages I post pictures I get likes
right and this is I'm not blaming you
for this this is what we are expected to
understand this is what you are expected
to know as an end user but we are not
talking about end users here we are
talking about the marketing
opportunities the same reason why
advertising works on social media
marketing is because end users have to
know need this much they are expending
day in day out on this medium and that's
all the appetizers need they need
eyeballs
don't need you to perform marketing
efforts as an end user but V as people
of social media marketers are going to
tap in on this group and understand in
between this chitchat in between this
posting in between this content how do I
make a dent that's the idea so don't
mistake between you know end user
behavior and marketers behavior
appreciate it alright so now that you
know what the opportunity is you have to
first find a calling red we have to
accept first agree that this is the
space to be and how do I get started
what can set me up as a platform to
start learning and move forward and
ensure that i am an acceptable
professional in this ecosystem right so
i call it breaking social because it it
literally means reinventing yourself re
looking as a person okay i'm sorry to
kind of put you in some kind of you know
i'm just going to make a statement which
sperm people may agree or not agree to
social media marketing as such is an
extension of you as a person i don't
know how many of you understand or know
the 1984 Apple ad where Steve Jobs we're
kind of was very famous for this
particular Apple at where he talks about
you know there are you know we are not
talking about the regulars we are
talking about the ones who are going to
make a difference so who or who have
little twist in their head who want to
do things differently who are creative
meant of mine are would just want to do
things differently so if you're the
person who believes in regular routines
who believes in doing things as usual as
normal social media marketing the at
least the cool opportunities may not be
necessarily for you but if you are the
person who has been the maverick who has
been down cast who has beamed the
different person always amongst appears
man tossed me hook or crook luck or by
know left your bladder
please just take the bandwagon and keep
moving so think about this very hard
before you put a step into this because
as I said if you are not it's a complete
extension of you and if you are not that
person that I am projecting as a
requirement there are other
opportunities within social media
marketing which will survive you in the
ecosystem but not necessarily those over
cool opportunities okay okay so the
first choice you need to make when's
your introduced to social media
marketing and its opportunities is do
you want to go the science way or do you
want to go the art with okay when I say
the signs way obviously there is science
involved which just means learning the
you know the nuts and bolts the bare
bones of how these things work and
mastering them and when you're talking
the art way you are doing completely on
audience engagement you're completely
understanding human behavioral aspects
you are playing you're picking yourself
now as an end user as an end consumer
one Lee to come back and shake up the
wood okay at a broad level understand
that you have a choice to make when it
comes to social media marketing that is
do you go signs do you go art personally
each one of you make an understanding of
what do you personally connect with okay
right if you are going the signs wait
here is the typical in Tara you know
growth curve in terms of opportunities
learning and in terms of money so if you
see obviously that y axes the the x axis
is money and the dimensional axis is
nothing but you're progressing to be a
person as you go forward what do you
start with what you start with this
first at the simple stage is a channel
level you know you understand all the
known channels there's Facebook this
filter this pinterest is ready there is
blogs there is what others there is
channels like exploding like crazy so at
the beginning what you do you just
become channel o experts where you
understand how a certain channel works
what happens within the channel okay so
this is the way p
track you understand the ecosystem this
is the content this is what advertisers
pay for etc fair enough you can survive
you can ensure that you have a decent
carrier people need these guys to be
part of the bigger team okay now once
you understand channel what we progress
to you become the campaign expert now
once you understand channel you
understand what kind of campaigns for
people who are not used to media
marketing campaigns of nothing but it's
a combination of you know setting of
creative setting up of organic as well
as paid channels to what uses finally
react to so if you look at any channel
that you today use you will see
sponsored ads you would see initiatives
contest that all that just the mere
act of running and executing campaigns
or channels is step two where you just
know how to set up a campaign nothing
else you just know how I said number
camping people tell you this was what
you do get started okay now here you go
one step ahead now that you know
understand channel you understand what
campaigns are now you get into the field
call optimization which is you look at
campaigns you've been looking at calvins
all this while you suddenly realize that
oh this is working this is not working
how do I use my experience of my channel
knowledge and my campaign knowledge to
better results which comes from the
process of optimization optimization is
somewhere in the mid level if you reach
this part it's actually good because you
really go into the nuts and bolts of the
system and you it this is where sign
starts really okay you done optimization
for so long so you know what needs to
change each time to work and what
becomes better as a result of it you
enter the world of analytics which is
hot cakes this is where the money really
starts pouring right analytics cannot
come right from scratch you need to go
through this process you reach the word
analytics you draw your own three books
you have your experiential theories you
use upon what has been proven in market
you fill it back in your regular deal of
things suddenly you are analytics expert
where
you know anything and everything to
improve any metric that's defined by its
ok so you man a master channel campaign
optimization analytics you just thought
you were ready not yet now you suddenly
become the demi boss which is called
reaching the strategy level at a
strategy level you are able to combine
your collective experience of channel
knowledge setting up campaigns
optimization and building now fix
framework I really at this stage you
will have a team working for you each of
the onion in each of these functions and
you just set the direction and you have
the depth enough to set the direction
this is ideally where you're pitching
you don't start pitching to the client
yet this is where you be given the pitch
you've been awarded the pipeline but you
lay down the strategy that for six
months this is how life is going to work
and over the period of time when you
have done this time in and time mode
obviously you land up as the boss and if
you think that this timeline to becoming
the boss is yours together you are wrong
and this is exactly where things get
interesting if you see most of the new
social media experts are all young
people only because they have more
exposure on the ground than traditional
seasonal marketers so it is a brilliant
journey this is ideally where you have
collective strategist working across
accounts building analytics frameworks
giving reporting setting up optimization
parameters coming up with the social
media action plan convincing brands and
agencies of pitches that you have that
time you will reach a point where you
don't know what to do a number of money
you getting ok I have a question of does
the real social media marketing could be
achieved by advertising and social media
through camp it's brilliant question
because everyone today has this
misconception that if you are doing
advertise if you're doing social media
marketing it means doing advertising
social media marketing is not
advertising social media marketing means
engaging your audience engaging
audiences of
function of two parts which is organic
and paid the portion which is paid media
is analogues to advertising but not
equal into advertising unfortunately the
scope lets me kind of stopped because I
am so connected to this topic I can just
spend the next start talking about this
but to answer your question just social
media marketing cannot be achieved by
pure advertising sorry bad news yeah
okay so now we've gone the science way
you see this is the way you can reach
where the money is and you know
opportunities existing each of these
verticals okay so you can directly jump
in the middle but you will be left
behind this is the evolution process but
this is where the money is in each
vertical progressing towards the right
fine if you want to go the art way what
are the options that we have if you go
to art way the starting point is simple
you start with creatives if you start
with coming up with creatives that
people react to remember at this point
you're not expected to do any kind of
campaign strategy or what it is the
overall plan of thing you're given a
brief you are coming up with interesting
creatives that suits different channels
that exist in social media okay number
one okay now that you understand PAP you
keep doing creative with time you
realize oh this is the type of content
that people are reacting to now suddenly
you're not talking at a creative level
you are talking about collective
creatives coming as part of the original
content so you're slowly progressing
towards the content the beauty about the
art way is money actually starts coming
in from the content it's a predominantly
because content drives the world of
social media marketing and the web
itself so if you so the progression from
creative the content takes time but if
you hit the point that itself you have
some real good opportunity starting to
show up where they just want interesting
content to engage people okay now you do
point then deleted of time what do you
hit you hit initiatives initiatives is
nothing but how do you put together
different types of content for different
output expected from audiences at this
point in time you will be able to answer
that
it advertises come and say hey I want to
be able to get this from when you said
what should i do you come up with
multiple initiatives each collection of
content and each internal collection of
creatives okay now you've gone ahead you
know kind of mastered initiative finally
you land up in something what i call
this engagement engagement is so easy to
say but it's the most difficult to
achieve if you reach this point you are
again the demigoddess in terms of art
where now you can exactly say even
before the start of anything while
during the pitch made to Atlantic sub
hey this is the way I see engagement
happening and this is what I will do to
drive the engagement that expected and
as you do multiple engagements you
become the real deal where you are able
to go across clients send customized the
engagement driven by initiatives
collection of content as a multitude of
creatives Wow so as five steps to land
here is the suggestion that i have in as
the webinar comes up the first thing is
always do not if you are really really
starting then yes go choose a particular
path see if you are able to see yourself
interested and creating something new or
making a dent there proceed in a
sequential approach if you already have
some context target the hybrid approach
see how you can mix up experience in
building you know content and
initiatives on one side on the other
side you're building campaigning and
analogies this is the hype so you should
build your blocks in a very hybrid way
so that you each client is different one
client expects more on the science one
Klein mix with more on that your hybrid
approach will make you the person to go
after I have the question which says can
you please suggest as the best ways how
they engage audience for a social media
channels and drive traffic to a landing
page i would love to man trust me this
is what i do as part of the entire
training exercise as i said the scope
does not literally allow me to start
talking about you
know how to actually because it's it's
it's a complete modules put together to
kind of master the art of engaging
audience and landing people in the tough
learning traffic on your landing page
because what you're talking about is the
awareness stage of the ADA funnel which
is what social media is predominantly
used for so unfortunately I have to let
that go but hang in there maybe you get
something from what we have right right
so first is the hybrid approach second
is do not stick to saying that hey I
know how to perform ABC things on
specific channels that's not going to
take you far become an engagement expert
how do you build become an engagement
expert become the consumer yourself see
what pushes you to consume content see
what attracted you see what kind of
social objects that do brands use that
has been able to attract you as an end
user one Lee by collective monitoring
listening and putting this part of your
bigger bag of tricks will you slowly end
towards an engagement expert so if you
think that oh I know this channel in and
out trust me you perish sooner than
today because channels continuously keep
changing much quicker than in sell
yourself before you sell your plan I
know I'm quite person where earlier in
the session asked me about how do we
sell our surface pressures dude so here
is what I say us as you begin your
journey in one of these two directions
that I kind of showed you once you
attain a certain level no matter what it
is you could be a level-1 level-2
level-3 you need to first clearly put
forward what you have become more a
period of time after that only people
are willing to listen to your plans
otherwise there will be no credibility
to the plan that you put forward as a
pitch to a plane so ensure that what are
you mastered during the point see what
is your niche that you can achieve oh
I've been told that I can't be heard I'm
just going to do a quick check can
people hear me okay so I have
confirmation that i can be heard that is
good so you people get I get scared
sometimes when you know I am in the
middle of things and people tell me that
I can't
that I feel really bad that oh that
thing just went lost or anyway thanks
for confirming that you guys can hear me
so sell yourself before you sell your
plan it important that you sell yourself
as a person if you're becoming an
independent consultant or as a social
media marketing expert within the
company hour as part of the agency wait
the fourth is basically this is a very
important tip the product when I mean
product here it means the different
channels that we're talking about they
keep going through enhancement in terms
of what they can offer the platform that
came up two years three years back is
very different from what it is today
today we're talking about retargeting
you talking about customized custom
audiences we are talking about lookalike
audiences we are talking about extended
email targeting from social media it's
crazy and until and unless you actually
understand what is enhancements are you
won't be able to sell that as part of
selling your pitch so please keep track
of product enhancements that will help
you push forward and kind of make
yourself look attractive in front of the
fish and finally if all goes bad I would
obviously kind of push you to come and
come on both the ad raker raker is
offering the social media marketing poor
so it's this webinar is brought to you
by Erika and I hope I was able to give
you some perspective before you guys to
get started it's definitely know you
know affiliate task it just
understanding that there is an
opportunity and coming forward and
grabbing it and figuring your very
appalling is finding the skills of gaps
with what opportunities in each of these
verticals that we discuss and eventually
trashing it and trust me when the moon
which is already happening but when the
boom happens you will be the most ready
person than any other person out there
in the market so thank you very much for
attendance I would take questions for
the next five minutes and if you guys
are cool then this webinar will be
published later in a three acres page
and as well as it reoccurs list of
assets so here is the first question
could you suggest the best social we
just turn the key man I
I whenever I'm asked like a question
that requires an answer four hours of
training I unfortunately feel bad that i
am not able to answer that but in terms
of the best social media strategy in a
single line would be get in the right
mix of engagement through organic
content and organic channel effects and
then top it off with paid marketing you
that is the strategy that is always work
why do I say that because people tend to
do paid marketing to start up things
with and they fail bad so that is an
interesting thing that I can tell you is
part of social strategy is there any
trick which you can share through which
we can increase awareness and engagement
okay as quick tricks I can tell you is
anything that pushes people to submit
their own content user-generated content
initiatives that pushes people to
participate and also a concept called
arterial marketing where I reach my
brands through extended brands of the
Stargate audience that I have these two
tricks are bound to work so if you have
some thought you can definitely try it
out there how can it take control of my
brand online to social media marketing
brand control through social media
marketing is UniFirst first thing I
would like to tell you never use the
word control when it comes to social
media marketing because social media
marketing is not about control it's
about coexistence it's about sharing
it's about coexisting and key by
creating a brand voice and a brand
character so don't lose sight of that
the only way if at all you should be on
top of everything is having a social
audit putting a social policy in process
and getting in all the components of it
on a timely chick what about if someone
is good in both signs are not like I'm
an engineer and ad filmmaker or so my
scope and social marketing dude you are
the guy everyone's been looking for
Chuck everything else get on board soon
how much experience does it take up to
reach analytics please advise i am
marketing in with so much experience in
product marketing and BTL can you
suggest a product carry its carrier
pathway one should choose ok since
you already have a marketing experience
you understand the ecosystem what
changes is only the medium which means
at this point in time what are questions
that you are trying to answer through
traditional medium for BTL as for
product marketing you have to reinvent
yourself how you can achieve the same
using the channels that you have so the
path I would take if I were you again
this is very personal it depends on what
you are as a person so I would choose is
first understanding how each of these
channels can help me to do the functions
that have been doing before then I would
follow it up with what can i bring
things differently to the plate is it by
coming up with and coming up with a nice
analytics framework coming up with the
new content strategy or coming up with
an overall content plant is what is
going to give me the change that I look
once you have that you can craft your
profile in such a way that you enable
new edge brands who need product
marketing efforts and you have cracked
in fact your question has such an
insight that it paves way for a path
that you can decide by yourself how can
I get engagement for hospital plan I'm
extremely sorry this is a it's it's it's
very detailed answer for specific to a
client industry but engagement
definitely has a form and path so
anything that would attract your target
audience in terms of how do you
understand that you understand your
target audience is associated to what
other brands so you go watch the other
brands what they are doing to engage
people that's a good starting point what
is the average post reach to page likes
do you see in general post reach to page
like wow this is an interesting question
so post reach is the number of people
who have seen a certain and/or post and
page likes is a conversion metrics okay
in typical digital medium conversion
percentage ranges from one person to
four percent however post reach to page
likes is a different body colleges it's
a different conversion metric what I'm
talking about actual business goal
conversion so it ranges anywhere from
twenty to forty percent which have seen
I personally executed for three startups
where I've being able to ramp
hooked up to like 50,000 likes or forty
thousand tweets within a short period of
time so my impression to conversion
ratio in terms of page likes was pretty
high somewhere touching about sixty-five
percent but I would not I would not
suggest that because social media
marketing is not about generating volume
pissed about generating quality okay how
can you help me building a brand you do
building a brand is nothing but talking
about awareness in the entire ADA funnel
so if you understand what happens in
terms of what contributions what
contributes to breeding awareness in the
entire sales funnel you can answer the
question yourself i promise you that
there are seven hundred plus social
media platforms which one is right for a
company page this is exactly a flame of
that we go through the course which is
it is not about choosing top five or top
10 channels and ensuring that i do
something that every brand has its own
set of channels that work for it so one
step is towards identifying what is the
right set of channels this is part of
the social media action plan that is fed
by the goals that you arrive with
alongside the client there is a question
matrix that you answer which understands
or put specific on how they call it
which puts the questions in relevant
context and once you're able to arrive
at this go to translate into action
plans then you find out where your
target audiences and you be surprised
sometimes you will not find them the
regular channels that people are
explicit okay is it advisable to learn
digital and social media courses or one
needs to learn it on hand experience oh
sorry what is this again is it advisable
to learn digital and social media
courses or one needs to learn it on hand
experience while working all right I'll
give you very honest answer this is like
someone asking me is it advice for me to
go and learn a gmat or a cap in your
class you go for us that you know some
kind of a training program or should I
learn it at home there are many toppers
who are they're both learned at home and
done it but what enrolling in a course
gives you structure what and rolling in
a course gives you discipline towards
learning something and getting started
in fact that is the
because I and the third pic is
collective learning from an audience
group that you're a part of okay this
would be the last question I will be
taking how is social media content
marketing different from social media
marketing social media content marketing
is part of social media marketing so
it's a subset so I wouldn't say it's
different it's a subset of it which of
these will give a higher pace at PPC or
Facebook Ads you are entering a very
interesting analytics field which I call
as attribution in attribution there is
something called what we followed today
in web measurement is called lost click
method of measurement in last click
method of measurement PPC scores higher
than anything else because it is
considered as the channel that fed to a
sale or a conversion happening so web
measurement masters tended where
measurement masters tend to increase how
they call it increase the credit given
to PPC that's how you will see PPC is
being spent a lot on but in the field of
attribution all channels have compared
equal in terms of what introduce the
brand what let me create in a desired
action think of the last purchase you
did online you will realize what I'm
saying right now it's not the last
search you didn't meant that led to the
purchase is the display that came before
that is the review that you read in a
block it's the social media page that
you went and saw all of this contributed
but today is not given credit for a
conversion how much weight age will you
give to social content marketing to paid
marketing okay remember content is not
free so when you say social content
marketing to paid marketing for me it's
the same because it takes money to
create content and it takes money to do
paid marketing so both go hand in hand
all right so with that thank you guys
thank you very much for spending time
with me and I really appreciate it and
please pass on your feedback or any type
of questions in the common forums you
will definitely find me roaming around
there and come and catch you guys all
the best Oh of this person someone who's
being throwing in a lot of same question
I'll anyway I am saying that I think I
answered this there are 700
the social media platforms which one is
right for a company page I told you
choosing the set of channels that work
for a particular brand or service is
part of the social media of marketing
journey okay choosing doesn't mean
choosing the top I or the bottom fight
it starts with defining what the
objectives are using the client it
starts with further restraining these
goals into an action plan an action plan
defines what should be expected from
your target audience and based on the
expectation i connect it with what can
each channel can give me as output I
arrived at my final set then I put to
the other what should be the final you
know strategy content plan content
calendar all of this parts sorry I can't
share any of my personal details here
but you can always look me up on a
locker under the social media marketing
course for facebook automation there are
a lot of content dissemination tools and
third party analytics tools I keep an
eye on all these when it comes to
Facebook automation and that's the
extent facebook allows automation as
well perfect guys thank you very much
for spending time with me and I hope you
had some value to derive from today
appreciate it and see you soon good luck
