stopped him right let me give a brief
introduction about myself my name is
Laura and I have been have been working
in IT industry for over a decade right
now I have worked on various tools
technologies etc I would just name it
and out of work on it the databases we
informatic are the big data the whole
ecosystem of big data be it fight and be
it that movie it just name it and I
would have worked
Atlas little bit on something or the
other
name it Java C C++ so I have worked on
variety of tools and technologies so far
in my more than a decade long experience
so I will be walking you through and
also to give you a better I have worked
in very big MNC to start up to to MNC
again to start up again so I've worked
on a variety of places okay so my
intention today is to walk you through
web scrapping using Python I'm not sure
if many of you understand Piketon so I
would give a brief introduction about
Python before I get started okay and
just to give you a disclaimer guys okay
even before I I go on there right I'm
not sure how many of you understand
Python but you know just to give you a
brief background of work python thank
you boo boo T Python isn't extremely
easy language okay and I'm not sure how
many of you read the economic times or
even you know websites where whether
it's given that you know how the world
is moving I mean what are the
technologies that people are using I was
just reading about this article very
recently in economic times wherein it
says that most of us Indian right the
technologists from India most of them
are still hung up with dotnet and Java
and C and C++
right whereas the whole world has moved
beyond that to fight them if you if you
look at the trajectory of Python usage
world over just in u.s. itself not a
long ago just open et just Google for et
on on technology radical technology and
you'll be able to see that just it came
a couple of days back when it says that
the uses of item was low around the very
low around five to ten years back and as
of today peyten
is being used aggressively by 25% of the
programmers which means to say that the
25% of coding right now happens on
Python whereas in a dotnet is maybe 5 6
% Java is Java used to be a large
java.net fix it except I used to be a
lot which has come down significantly
and it just to start trust me guys
everyone starting from a programmer to
an analyst to a data scientist define
Python very easy now easy and and very
very very powerful it's my favorite
language at it now personally I just
love it everything or fight them so nor
does that python is an object-oriented
programming language who'd have thought
that Python is approve object-oriented
programming language all of us normally
tend to think that Python is a scripting
language that's a misnomer you know and
you know that's what people think it's a
scripting language it might be like cell
scripting or bad scripting or any kind
of scripting right but no using Python
you can develop websites okay using
Python you can write server-side you can
serve right client client-side programs
you can write any logic you can write
machine learning algorithms you can do
big data programming you can do whatever
you want to do and the biggest advantage
of Python over every other programming
language is that you know Python is very
sensitive about memory usage in any
programming for that matter right let's
say you define an integer variable right
let's say you define an integer variable
it see what
happens as soon as you define an integer
video and two bytes of memory are
allocated to that variable when they say
in Thai two bytes of memory are
allocated to that variable right and
then if you say MJ in K its to two bikes
at some point in time you know if you
continue to you know assign variables or
if you continue to create variables in
Thai in Jane cake etc if you have let's
say only two GB memory at some point in
time you'll run out of memory with
Python you don't have to worry about
that and there are certain ways in
Python everything is taken care of you
will never run out of memory even if
your memory is excuse me
even if your memories 2gb and you want
to process 10 GB of data you will be
able to do that imagine you doing that
in what Oracle no you cannot do it Java
you cannot do it C C++ no you cannot do
it you know but in Python you'll be able
to do it I'm not just saying for the
heck of it it's actually a fact it's a
matter of the fact and you know I'm
going to show you some beautiful
examples wherein you will be inspired to
Python okay okay anyone of you
understand you know guys just feel free
to type in everything that you want okay
there is no right or wrong answer you
just type in what you understand web
scrapping I'll show you something okay I
will show you continue to type guys I am
tv.com slightly is completely okay now
movies how about the rest guys no idea
need to learn from basics excellence you
can that that's okay right now okay
no problem how many of you okay
forget about web scrapping how many of
you have heard about
I am tv.com that's easy right I'm sure
all of you say you have heard about IMDB
that come yeah this there you go sir
come yep you the yes I absolutely Kieran
scrapping is a kind of extracting data
from various web sources yes third
absolutely you heard about it right sir
ah yes you have ear heard Sanjay yeah
word so what I do normally if I have to
let's say I want to see some movie I
will not use the term download over here
that's that's illegal downloading from
all those torrent exit traps but then of
course I can download it from next
Netflix etc okay let's say I want to see
some kind of I want to rent a movie and
then the first thing I do is I go and
read the review of that movie and I am
fiba.com write all of all of us do that
and if you have not done that you can do
the test well right right now later
wherever you want
now the problem is just listen to my
problem statement if the problem is I
want and I am traveling and I want to I
am traveling for a week's time to some
unknown to be more pleased okay when I
would have no access to Internet no
access to anything I want my solitude
over there
but then I also want to ensure that I am
NOT boarding the place I am going into
the remotest corner of let's say world
during the research I want to stay there
in solitude but I want to carry a bunch
of movies which are really good so that
if I get bored I think watch them now I
go to imdb.com and you know I want to
see and I am a kind of rom-com kind of
person so I want to see romantic comedy
or I'm just a comedy person I and I just
want to see comedy movie right
I start searching for this on imdb.com
and I feel like there's too many tabs
over here that's too many I don't I
don't know how to view it again so I
think that let me rent 50 movies and let
me see the top 50 movies which are
available in imdb.com so what I do is
like a simple code okay this is a yeah
you know this is a URL for imdb.com with
all those search except tracks for the
year 2005 to 2014
you see most Vortech feature film
released from 2005 to 2014 that night
inception so on and so forth okay now
that was a lame example that I gave that
I am going to remote please etcetera but
let's say I want to find out top 100
movies and I want to do some kind of
research on it as to the Best Actor
except as if you have heard about a
website 3 6 9 or 7 16 and I I don't
remember the name of the website but
there's a data scientist in us who has
predicted that you know which actor is
going to win Oscar who is going to
believe in u.s. presidential election
except for purely based on data science
right and he did it via fight
okay nice I tell you you see this the
most voted feature film released from
2005 to 2014
the first is Dark Knight inception Dark
Knight Rises Avengers etc except now I
am thinking that you know instead of
going through this can I write a small
program we should pull all the let's say
50 hundred whatever movies the top
movies that that's there in imdb.com so
I do this I write how many lines of code
that I've written one two three four
five six this is not counted five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
okay so I have written two headlines of
course and what does it do I say okay I
don't know what's the problem over here
okay let me turn this again then I am
tv.com oh my bad
sorry I need to kill this because it's
printing everything no comment
now let me run this okay so twelve lines
of code guys just see this twelve lines
of code and you have everything okay
what's the first movie over here the
Dark Knight
what's the John of that movie x and
crime drama you see this action crime
and drama and what's the length of the
movie 152 minutes it on here and what's
the rating it's nine point zero in just
twelve lines of code I was able to scrap
it completely now this is not even a
tiniest problem that Python can solve
it's not even point zero zero zero one
percent of what a Python is that it this
is just a very high-level example now
yes even it's it's it's awesome just
think of writing this in Java C C++
think of writing this in any programming
language and you will you know you'll be
exhausted by the number of number of
lines of code that you write it's less
lines of code there is at the second
aspire okay first of all it's almost one
is 220 when
compare this with Java if you read 20
lines of code it's almost like one line
of code okay and at a very high level
I'm not saying it's it's exactly
yes given right so if you were to look
at Java it's almost like one is 220 if
you're writing 200 lines of code maybe
you are writing ten lines of code over
here right yeah
that's all okay and now I would want to
show you something okay now now that you
have seen this let's see some other you
know do we need to learn C or C++ okay
Oh excellent question et the great thing
about Python is that you don't need to
learn any programming language okay even
if you have basics of any programming
language you'll be able to learn Python
C I don't say you'll become expert in
one day but I can guarantee you that if
you start learning Python in four days
you start writing your own program and
in 15 days you will start writing
complicated programs that is my Derek
okay but it's it's not that I would be
giving Gavin here and you would learn
out of nowhere you have to make put your
effort but in four days you start read
writing code and you will write better
code then you would have written in C
C++ or or in Java what is input at top
of the file yes sir that's something I
would explain I am reusing some of the
package that someone wrote okay the
whole code that I have written over here
is based on the package called beautiful
soup with sup era some someone some
developers like you and me contributed
to it there are not this beautiful so
Python is easy because there are many
packages available contributed by 50,000
strong developers community who are
contributing to fight an open-source and
that's the reason why you know we will
be able to use some of these packages so
as to be able to do our work very easily
but before going there right that's a
good observation though uh I don't you
know I ideally I would not have
explained this on the first day itself
you know I don't explain this because
people might get confused there but but
then good observation you have a keen
eye so let me go here and and show you
something okay now how do we normally
define a how do you write a hello world
program in programming language right
I'm sure all of you have some kind of
programming background right who does
not have sir the one who has programming
experience would always tend to compare
you know his or hers previous
experiences with Python right you would
say that
the syntax was like this in C and it's
like this in Python it's it's always a
comparison back and forth right although
it will be easier for them I'm trying to
say that even for you who has who does
not have any programming experience even
Srikant
right would find it extremely easy to
work invite them okay Kiran says I've
been working in fact in building web
application learning Django framework
but never open scrapping the Python
correctly I want to focus on which
crappy using beautiful suit
this webinar will really help me with at
least the basics of web spam absolutely
Kiran it will definitely help you but
then so as to bring everyone on the same
page right I will have to give a brief
background of what is go scrapping but
what is Python in the first place for 30
minutes and the next 30 minutes I will
be concentrating on scrap ok so guys
even before I go there right now let me
let me give you a simple example ok now
there I say how do you write a
HelloWorld program in Python this is the
way I you see this and if I were to
write the same program in Java how do I
read I define a class class ABC and then
I say public static void main system dot
out dot print line
hello world closed brackets open faces
closed brackets braces and so on right
how many lines of code did I skip over
here it's just one simple hello world
right guys just look at it okay how do I
assign and hello world to a variable
there you go
the absolutely Balakrishnan there is no
syntax at all it's just awesome program
okay it's just awesome programming now
having gone through this right let's say
let me try to make it a little more
complicated
not even complicated I'd say let's take
it one step further now I want to only
print hello from hello world what do we
do I say a of zero two zero one two
three four you see this the way I am
using I mean if I were to do this and
let's say SQL right or anywhere right
what do I do
I would say substring and then I would
use in string or if I if I were to do
this in in Java
io do some kind of functions etc right
now in case of Python it is extremely
simple okay you just say I want the
words from 0th index to one two three
fourth to fifth index five minus one
I mean it takes from zero to four right
so 0 1 2 3 4 2 3
it just gives me hello okay and from 5
till the end it needs to be word right
that's the beauty of Python so there are
a couple of things in Python which are
really important also called as
sequences okay there are a couple of
sequences called as lists dictionaries
and fighter I'm not sure how many of you
have you know have heard about Big Data
etc if you have that's really great if
you have not
that's not OK ROCK and science he bit
okay with dictionaries is something
similar to key value pair it's it's map
if you don't understand this forget
forget about Twitter times live these
are all sequence and they are similar to
okay it's lists dictionaries and not
Python sorry disk tuples okay my bad
look excellent someday you have heard
about that right so lists dictionaries
and tuples are sequences
okay so we'll bills will see that later
as to what mystics theories and
sequences are but trust me I'll just
give you one example and then move on
okay if I say one two I say right in
list there you go list of zero give me
Apple list of one will give me ball list
of two will give me cat so on and so
forth okay so it's extremely simple the
way you slice and dice the data and
hence it is one of the most preferred
language of all data scientists as well
as it's becoming a preferred language of
you know developers as well okay yes if
you say list of ten you will obviously
get an error you see and why do you get
an error because it says index error
list index out of range which means to
say that you have zero one two three if
I say list dot length okay one second I
say var of list and for index and then
sale is don't worry about it okay guys
don't worry what what I'm writing list
dot count okay count take exactly
one argument okay then yeah I should
have done this list door count of a ppm
Apple will give me one okay but all I
was trying to show you was if I see you
see here I was trying to show you this
okay now if you see here when I say
length of list right
it gives me full so if you try to access
anything beyond four it will give you an
error okay Sanjay
now now time to move on to something
more interesting okay
web scrappy now what's web scrapping
like I told you it is scrapping of a web
for example I want to scrap this data
how do I scrap this data in the first
place right I scrap this data by first
reading this website right and how do I
do this website if you right-click on
any website and then say view page
source you'll be able to see the source
code of page isn't it okay and once you
have done that now the second part right
how do you scrap the data so as to be
able to pull the data that you want okay
before that guys guys can you give me a
quick confirmation all of you whether
you have first do you have any questions
on you know the simple things that I've
explained over here okay and goods the
second is Python is machine dependent or
independent okay okay excellent so let
me let me answer you someday so what all
you have to do is you know download an
exe Python 2.7 python 3.2 what whatever
you would like to install just download
it it's an exe double-click on your
Windows machine and then you will be
able you will also install along with
something called as idle this is an idle
right this is also Python 2.7 28 cell
it's an idle on that I tell you will be
able to work on it ok or the other way
to do would be
download pycharm right you can download
Python this well and you'll be able to
work on it so see I work on pipe charms
and I work on Idol interact
I mean interchangeably whichever I I
want okay is fire a machine dependent or
machine independent so Python is an
interpreted language so it's a machine
independent language okay okay syrup
will vital work on Windows it absolutely
apart from Windows Python comes in Auto
installed with your Linux machine your
Mac and and even okay okay I was reading
about our this morning so python comes
in default installed with Windows and
Mac okay in okay sorry Linux and Mac in
Linux you get 2.7 as well as three point
two versions in the installed in Mac
it's 2.7 SCM and we'll Python works on
Windows 8 absolutely it will work on any
version any flavor of Windows Linux Mac
what's the difference between Python 2
and 3 Bonet the difference between
Python 2 &amp;amp; 3 is that there are certain
packages which are still not compatible
with 5 - word 3 but the most widely used
Python version is 5 - 2 point X ok so
mostly you know we will be using you
know we mostly use Python - I use Python
to two point X I okay now back at home
and using desktop apologies I could not
respond to few of your question that
that's okay Phyllis now if you have any
questions do let me know ok so guys ok
it's time that I take you through some
of the you know some of the things
related to we're scrapping how do I
scrap again ok it's it's a good question
now let's see how to scrap away although
guys if you are not able to understand
something right
I'm straight away moving into the topic
of the subject that we promised we will
discuss ok because see here now let me
just quickly walk you through pee-peed
easier and I have not even shown you BPD
I I just forgot about it so let me show
you what if
so people ease so this is what I do
right I can really like to give up I
generally like to take people through
hands-on I mean TPT's are all these
statements and sentences is something
which you can read online as well
there are numerous documents available
so I I generally avoid using PPD's etc
but but let me let me take you through
this objectives at the end of this
module you'll be able to you know
understand what swift scrapping will
you'll be able to understand beautiful
suit package will be able to scrap IMDB
website and will not touch pi2 for now
okay so these are the three things that
we will do now okay we will not go into
the legality of it I we all know as to
what web scrapping useful scrapping is
for pulling the data from structured or
unstructured data which is website okay
most fun snack most website do not offer
functionality to save a copy now you
know this is you can read about this
data as and when you have find web scrap
why it's quick easy way to gather huge
amount of data with less effort so
that's the reason why you need to scrap
with and web scrapping there are many
packages I am I will be going to I will
be using beautifulsoup I will explain to
you as to what beautiful soup is and cup
popular web scrapping packages are
pattern requests crappy beautiful soup
and mechanize these are there are many
more not just this there are many more
packages as well but these are the more
common ones typical HTML structure okay
this is how your typical HTML structure
looks like now now let me move back
right this is this is not very
interesting let me go here and explain
to you now I say from so what I have
done is I am I have a package by the
envious code inside that package there
is something function or you know sub
module called beautiful suit I use that
beautiful soup in
- scrappy website okay now first of all
I would not even scrappy website all I
would do here is now this is a what's
this call this is a simple HTML page
okay if I if I open the simple HTML page
you see this is it gives you this right
first paragraph hello students this is
basic HTML - blah blah blah right some
information about okay so now how do I
scrap this way okay the code behind this
is this right the code behind that
website that you saw is this is it right
so this is what I would do now let me do
this full cut to clipboard and I would
say let's say equal to my and I would
say open this file which is inside my
this location I have explained to you as
to what what I'm trying to do a penis
baby boo
there you go and then if I say soup
there is okay so guys all I did here
okay all I did in the first place is I
this is a standard that I have to I'm
saying from BS for input beautiful soup
okay which means to say that I want to
use beautiful soup as a package now once
I've done that this is just a variable
right I am using this beautiful sue to
open a static HTML page guys are we
clear and then I'm just printing it when
I say soup I'm just printing it or I can
say drink soup this is just a variable
okay guys try to be clear so far on
these two lines okay now
Kiran coming back to your question right
the reason why I used two double slashes
either you can use two backslash or one
forward slash okay that's the way you
will be able to read a file in
beautifulsoup
okay either double slash or one forward
slash whichever way you are comfortable
with
okay Kiran okay excellent now now the
first thing okay now in this example
right
oopsy just a second in this example this
is already aligned right HTML already
looks beautiful it's head here
HTML year ahead here title here
simple web page but there will be
circumstances in which this will look
hot spot right this might not look
beautiful and in those circumstances
right we do not find it very hard to see
how this up looks like how the HTML page
looks like you'll not be able to read it
properly so which first thing for you to
do is to beautify okay or prettified I
want to make my code if it is not
beautiful I want to make it beautiful so
the literal statement of which is I say
print and I want to prettify I want to
prettify my shoes so when I do that you
see here it will properly align your
code okay guys so what did I do now the
next thing yes Kiran it's it's awesome
now you might be like you know you might
you guys might be thinking where am I
getting all this functions right you
guys might might be thinking it I mean I
don't know where these functions are
coming from I don't know what what they
be I mean until and unless I study the
package you know how would I ever know
if I am a newbie to fighting programming
how would I ever be able to tell until
that pretty file is the command that I
need to use right valid question guys I
mean if I were in your place I will be
asking the same question okay I
understand
I understand your problem I understand
this question so I say var of soup this
will give you everything every method
that you can use with soup okay guys now
now that now the next question arises
rate and this looks like it you have
held a lot of methods it's it's insane
right no intelligence it it is there
suggest there isn't any sensors you know
you'll be but then you'll have thousands
of methods how how do you put which you
want to use right so even with this
there are thousands of methods or
functions right and then you still don't
know I mean it just not even have a
description it makes no sense right this
is what you might be thinking I don't
understand this
how will I ever understand no problem so
let's take for example what is the ramp
I don't know even I don't know even in
spite of working for so very long
guys I'll be honest with you I don't
know what all of this method - I only
know those methods which I have used or
for example if I feel that you know I
need some kind of method I go and Google
for it first right and then when I find
an example in Google I come back here
and then I try to implement okay that's
how I do it
because there are tons of packages that
I've used there are millions of
functions that I have them used and I
don't remember all of them my memory is
not that sir so but then I know that
this function might be available in that
package so let me exclude that packet I
have that sensitive but if so that's the
only thing that I'll be able to impart
to you okay I'll be able to impart to
you the sense using which you'll be able
to figure out your own post you'll be
able to chart your own good ok now I
stay so I don't understand what rat is
right so let me do double click on a
core piece and then I say I don't know
what we're after right do I want to go
to Google I don't know I don't want to
go to Google right now or a
well it's not even allowed in my office
what way did I say I don't and then I
say let me see what happens there is no
documentation then I'll have to go and
read the book
for example list list first is right dir
of list give me this
so I did not know let's say for example
I did not know what is sort does in most
package let me show you first
in most packets you will have at least
one liner documentation available with
it sadly you don't have that beautiful
soup now it's not because you don't have
it that you're not able to see it it's
because I only download it from ps4 I'll
need to beautifulsoup I do not take the
document part of it so let's not go
there ok let's not complicate things now
I say list of my list is this one right
list has a full ball cat dog
I say list and this is the sort function
that I want to see list dot sort dot
underscore and this good dog which means
to say that
give me the documentation of this list
and the method saw ok and then it says
if sort is compared none Kenan is stable
sort in place compared x and y if it's
minus 1 if X is within y -1 X equal to Y
is 0 X less than Y it's 1 so this is the
output that you would get
it's a one-line description if you need
more description you are free to go to
Python dot dot dot or and you'll be able
to see the entire documentation of
Google soon
ok so now moving on now now that we have
rectified it right I say print su dot P
ie
rectify there you go right now that I
have seen this soup dot prettified okay
now that I've seen the soup
I want to access some more right now
let's say I want to see I want to see
title I just want to see simple repeat
what's the title
I say radiant sue and then in the truth
I say AIT le title first of all let next
one intitled dot okay there is no string
my bad one second
prints mm very good
the functions displayed would suggest
method reading xml doc yes Krishna
dysfunctions I mean if you can relate
name to something that is reading xml
doc which is good but then the wave
syntax our structure might be little
different so you will have to look at
the methods from at least syntax point
of view I think that's what I understood
from the question if I did not
understand it you might have to refresh
efficient
okay so there you go guys
if I say print su dot item I just get
title simple right I say friend
su title dot let's step back
it's a parent oh there's no parent
spinning state there you go so when I
say what is the parent of title it is
head so from here to here it should give
me the data from their head to head and
I get the data
Hey or I can say print it also gives me
the same thing so guys I have it clear
so far on this you tell me whether you
are clear if not and I will have a glass
of water okay now can it
the Rahul says can you so this print
super dusty
drink soo dot html' you know it right
now Rahul I'm sure you were able to
understand this okay I so functions like
next sibling i curative get previous etc
so thought it would be like except it is
it it traveler says your HTML okay it's
it is like XML processing Krishna you
are not wrong okay Sanjay okay
voila Krishna okay business is clear
clear clear Krishna
Kiran okay herbalist I swept are quite
easy till now okay excellent will it
return complete a statement yes it be
right okay
this man excellent sir a be sick
excellent guys
now will do one thing will explore a
little more some more right I say print
sue dot title you know what pseudo title
inside this is title it comes here and
then I say next
su dot title okay soup dot title titl II
got title dot next and why is it being
in error soup dot we'll see we'll see
why this give me an error soup your
title dot append children clear content
Serbs see I told you I don't remember
everything okay there you go
I told you I don't remember everything I
have to visit it I say soup dot title
that contains what's the content of
title it's a simple web page what type
of web page it is it is Unicode you see
you means it's a Unicode okay and it
also gives me that there is a new line
here right after title there's a new
nine it comes in a new line so you see
everything now you might be like but we
have two P tags so how to get on newer
yes Rahul I'll I'll get there as well
you can say okay just once around first
it
sooo dot body dot P dot next right you
get first paragraph first paragraph
okay and then you want to get this one
right I say next dot next do this
Unicode sweater okay I get hello
students next what next I get hello
student right and then if I say soup dot
body dot okay one second soup dot HTML
just give me a second guys I just want
to so you know because I think Rahul
let's ask me this question I want to
show him HTML dot body dot P dot next
it's just that you know the reason why I
am NOT giving all the details is because
I'm not trying to make it complicated
for you guys okay there you go
right now will you are able to get it so
we'll have to first learn ABCD and then
only we can learn a for Apple B for ball
etc right so will will will go step by
step okay we will build it slowly I mean
if I take you here directly you might
not be able to grasp it just what I'm
what I'm telling you but if I build it
slowly we'll be able to understand and
you'll be able to appreciate it much
more now okay guys forget about all
these things that I've done over here
okay forget about everything
we will only stick to soup dot titles or
content now even at but where did okay
the 9j is saying he does not understand
anything or python and where is python
mostly used okay very good patient that
injured thank thank you that you asked
this question now let me tell you where
is patent use google search engine was
first made in by python and then they
redesign it in their proprietary
language Amazon Web Services completely
build invited okay
YouTube is completely written in Python
okay and Haughton works big data
framework is come
lately written in Python and what is
most data science that is being done in
majority of the companies doing
analytics whatever PHP they are used as
whether we say cup they are used in bits
and pieces but it is not used like the
way Python is used and let me tell you
this okay I read an article about Google
sometimes back ok if you want to get
hired in Google learn Python was the
statement by Google chief technical
officer
it's Apache Hadoop no no no Apache
Hadoop is not written in Python the room
it is written in Java but you can write
your MapReduce everything else in Python
the architecture has been done in a
written in Java but everything else can
be written in fighter
ok you know it right have you say oh you
know Python I am Not sure I I'm not sure
if I got efficient but waved ever better
and most of the web things I have done
in PHP actually you can do it in PHP you
can do it in Jiang group you know this
day is developers prefers Django because
the turnaround time of developing a
website in Django is extremely fast ok
and Django is again another version
fight ok
Vinay good question Rene is asking how
do I compare Python with Alec I would
say python is much better than our R is
only meant to be used for implementing
models right machine learning infect
models
ok any model that you can take you know
support vector machine algorithm KB mmm
it's it it's basically used for
statistical model R whereas python is an
object-oriented programming language
which can also implement statistical
model R is in memory operation and
python is not so I like Python much more
than ah okay I programmed it go shriek
on could you tell me what is the
application of Python in biological
sciences I mean in in case of
let me tell you the example that I did
and I have not practically used it
because I have not worked in any
biological application as as such but I
have read that it has been used in
genome sequencing using big data
somewhere I don't remember the place but
it has been used not not just that you
know I keep reading this white papers
and blogs and Python has many more uses
I can talk about it for three hours x2
the sticker I mean just from what I have
brain okay but practically I have no
experience as to how Python is used in
biological sciences because I have never
worked on so as it is easy to switch to
Django yes are we safe learn and I
learned him around three days are we
saying okay I'll tell you one thing
after learning for three days you might
have thought that you know python is
easy and you can you can do everything
with it you can program in it but three
days that's what I said
three this you'll start you will learn
how to crawl but you will never be able
to learn Python until unless you have
spent sufficient time on it okay you
have learned how to crawl in Python and
Python is very very very powerful okay
excellent I mean if you are working on
it if you have worked excellent of you
saying if you have if you are already
doing it if you are already working on
it I mean it's no rocket science at the
end of the day right very good
I'm sure you would have learned about
lemma J's okay you might have used some
NLP you have used nearly as a package
maybe you want to try it now you know
some of the packages available for text
analytics suspect anyway sir unless we
know big data can I relate write them
you don't need to go big data for vitals
returns Python is independent of big
data which now sometimes I need to log
on to a page and then extract
information has soup got any functions
to make it easier yes Krishna
so now I I'll show you a couple of this
and I will be able to save some of this
examples with us well later on see here
for example if I want to go and log
let's say Google Finance okay okay
Google Finance now why does not even
come let's say I want to log in to
Google Finance and scrap some data right
now that can be done as well let's say
sir I think it might be the New York
Stock Exchange might not be working so
the data might not be here see this is
my scrap finance data okay I want to
scrap data for SAP IBM PC TCS Oracle etc
etcetera what are my 15 it's not doing
other data I don't know why but anyway
stuff I'm I'm running this code after
long time so I might have screwed it up
somewhere so Wyatt is you will be able
to do that which now I'll be login
you'll be able to log into any page
you'll be able to dynamically insert
data as well on that page and retrieve
data as well so I have written many of
equip scrapping examples going abstract
data from various websites okay does it
have header file how does compiler get
to know about so many functions which we
are using continiously JIRA you see here
the the number of packages that I've
downloaded these are the compiler will
understand the package okay you see this
K and then KB in this are the package
that I have the coupon will be
understand the package and this package
will have methods which will help you
you know use the function or retrieve
the data or whatever whatever it sees
okay
all the way in developing for what
purpose Python is used okay let me
deliver and I'm using Python to create a
website full of e I have use patent to
create a website I have used Python to
write a data science application to
write a statistical model I have used
Python to write map and reduce in big
data I have used Python to to be a
scripting language like UNIX shell
scripting and I have also used Python as
an object-oriented programming language
so hopefully that helps you answer your
question mister the discussion seems to
be a tough I am unable to compare what I
let's see okay
okay I am getting a lot of questions we
sue them that and I need to take some of
those at it now sweepa how to write code
in Python it's it's it's a to see here
it's an ID all you have to do is write
the Python code and it should be it it's
like any arising I am using pipes
pycharm turn okay
now dice up so like like wristlet all
right we're deviating a little bit from
topic there are many more questions that
many of you who are very keenly
interested in in Python I understand
that I might not be able to answer all
the questions but keep writing all the
questions guys what I would do is after
this class is over after I have
explained you certain stuff you know I
will take this question and maybe get
back to you by an email okay or or what
you can do is you would get this PPT you
can go here and then you can you can
post your question on you know in
Twitter on Facebook or you can call and
and get all those information okay we we
will try to help you as much as we can
and the second thing is that okay I know
about that mu okay okay tableau it is a
data visualization tool Pallavi you can
integrate you know you you can integrate
our with tab you can integrate fightin
with tableau you can integrate the
tableau okay you can integrate Python
with me tableau that has been done below
me so okay maybe I did not understand
your question there okay okay guys so
continue to ask your question so
yes Rahul internally it will be
converted into byte code so that Java
understands it okay but guys keep
posting your question let me take you
through some more examples and then that
and then let's stop our class here today
okay now let's talk our session today
now now again if if I want to let's say
I want to find all the tags right for
tag in soup now these are some of the
packages or these are some of the
functions that I will use these are very
powerful what what do we call it very
powerful regular expression type
functions now what do I do
I say put tag in soup dot find all find
everything and then I say print so you
see this what are the tags that are
available over here HTML head title
title body PB blah blah blah all the
type okay and now I am too lazy to I
just need the content of this website
right I don't care what's their diet
cetera so what I do is I say print soup
dot get on this boat txt now some of you
you find this interesting and there you
go based on this as a delimiter find
only the text now I say I don't like
this right I don't like the way the data
is being displayed so
I say print soup dot get underscore text
and I say just delimiter by this one and
skip everything is strip off all those
unsung stuff simple webpage first
paragraph fellow-student this is basic
see if it's a simple webpage first by
developing this will be seeing SP ml -
now guys this is where I would like to
stop okay now we would be sharing some
examples to real-time examples on IMDB
lips crapping etc you see this we will
be sharing with you just have a look at
it get back to us and we will help you
answer any questions that you might have
just to confirm will have access to the
video of the entire session correct yes
absolutely Ravi you will have access to
the entire video how python is related
to Hadoop item dementia is not related
to her Luke but you can program entire
MapReduce or your UDF in imp item and it
takes you know it takes it just takes
one by sixteenth of the development and
that normally to Java looting okay how
do we keep a Livi okay okay no problem
how do we get access to this example
sucks the support from a director will
send you all all this examples on Oh
papa okay so guys sir keep posting your
questions keep asking your questions you
know Twitter's you know send us feedback
on the on Facebook if we get more rocks
let's say if you guys need more of this
you can you can talk to us about that
computer and then and then we'll get
back to you with more sessions okay
yes is it based on C HTML or Linux it's
based on C below me
absolutely them enjoy them enjoy all of
you will get access to this video and
some of the examples
okay okay okay guys thank you very much
but before you go okay before you go
please don't forget to give me feedback
okay I need your feedback if you give me
feedback if you if you tweet about this
if you write us we will be able to
present some very interesting an
interesting thing I am working on some
interesting thing maybe next time I will
only concentrate on those stuff so but
before that you have to read a little
bit of about pattern and come back okay
sanchita to start with there is a
cookbook on pike and esther google
who can patent okay okay then guys have
a good good night guys you guys all take
care and keep studying keep breathing
okay take care guys bye bye thank you
bye listen thank you for your time man
Thank You Obama thank people to be get
set up
bye guys good night thank you sigh thank
you sir
all right thanks Rahul obviously given
race guitars with us from thank you guys
