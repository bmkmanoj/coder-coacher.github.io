and this video is on the top ten reasons
why you should learn selenium obviously
there are numerous testing tools in the
market but today I will be telling you
why selenium is the best fit for you and
why you should learn it the number one
reason why you should launch selenium is
because selenium is an open-source tool
which means anybody can use it for free
it is powered by Apache which means any
organization can use selenium to test
their website or even independent
programmers can implement and practice
selenium without having to pay for it
most of all remember that a selenium is
backed by Google which has a huge
developer community the problem with
other testing tools are that they are
either licensed tools or then
functionality is just not as good as
selenium HP is q2p
IBM's RFP test complete ranorex are all
proprietary tools and feature wise
selenium is a clear winner no second
thoughts the second reason why you
should launch selenium is because there
are no operating system or browser or
hardware demands
you don't need a system with 16 GB RAM
or a system with a lot of free hard disk
space neither do you need to house a
Windows operating system or a Mac
operating system or Linux operating
system the operating system you use for
home purpose is good enough for testing
with a selenium the problem however with
other tools is that majority of them run
only on Windows operating system with
selenium you can also test your website
or even web application on any browser
be it Chrome or Firefox or Safari or
Internet Explorer or even a para for
that matter of fact the simplicity
needed to work with selenium can be
related to how easy it is to plug in USB
drivers into your system for
transferring data this is the next
reason why you should launch selenium
and this must be the single most
important factor for any programmer to
get into the automation testing domain
most tools in the market need you to be
specialized in the particular
programming language
languages such as VB script Java c-sharp
are among the most common scripting
languages required by various tools but
with selenium you will not face any such
restrictions even if you're familiar
with one of the programming languages
such as Java
Python or Perl or PHP or Ruby C shark or
dotnet then you can start a selenium
courier right away the next reason why
you should launch selenium is because of
the availability of frameworks
frameworks are very similar to templates
you can make slight modifications to the
code as per your requirement for
different conditions instead of making
wholesale changes in selenium there are
Willy's frameworks like data-driven
testing keyword-driven testing hybrid
testing module driven testing and many
more using these frameworks you would
reduce your time to code and time to
test and because of this a lot of
companies are adopting selenium and
looking for professionals skilled in
selenium the next reason why you shall
own selenium is because of its strong
presence in the DevOps lifecycle
selenium forms an integral part of the
continuous testing phase in the DevOps I
of cycle and today most companies are
replacing agile or waterfall approaches
with the DevOps approach very few
testing tools qualify as a dog stool
because dogs emphasizes on using open
source tools and also because most of
the software products development
nowadays are delivered on the cloud
web-based testing tools are the ones
that are extensively used and this is
where selenium fits perfectly the sixth
reason why you should launch selenium is
because it can be easily integrated with
a lot of open source tools some of those
tools are Jenkins tests and REE maven
j-unit
C Coulee and auto IT and when these
tools are integrated with selenium we
can achieve automation this is where
other tools lag behind the next weasel
is parallel and a separate testing
executing multiple test cases at the
same time is called parallel testing and
executing them in remote machines is
called distributed testing selenium grid
is used for this purpose by performing
parallel and distributed testing you
save time to run the tests you do not
need extra machines to perform the tests
and you can also execute the same test
cases on different web servers the next
reason why you should launch selenium is
because selenium does not depend on any
GUI based systems since selenium tests
can be executed without a GUI the tests
can be carried out on web servers and
automation can be achieved by shuttling
the exit
test cases and since the GUI is not
involved
there will be no system overhead and the
performance of your machine will
drastically improve the benefit over
other tools is that most tools read a
GUI for scripting and those scripts can
only be executed through the GUI
provided by the tool the ninth reason
why you should launch selenium is
because of the flexibility that you get
while designing your test case for
designing test cases you have the
flexibility to design it either way a
programming logic using webdriver or via
the record and playback feature provided
by IDE if you are a technical person and
prefer writing with the programming
logic you can use webdriver if you're a
non-technical person then you can use
IDE to record your tests and export that
programming logic to an equivalent
programming language of your choice the
last reason but not the least important
reason is that there's an increasing
demand for selenium testers believe me
when I say that among all the tools in
the market selenium has the greatest
demand and you can visibly see it on the
screen right the one on the Left shows
how the selenium job vacancies have
grown since 2008 and 2018 is not going
to be any different the demand is still
going to rise and even the pay is pretty
good so my advice to you is launch
selenium when it's still the right time
and on that note I will conclude today's
session thank you for watching the video
till the very end
happily on you from iterator I hope you
have enjoyed listening to this video
