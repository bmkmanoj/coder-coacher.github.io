welcome to this session on waters
robotic process automation now as you
guys know RP is quite a buzzword in the
industry right now and most of you must
have heard about RP a by now
right and for those of you who are still
new to the topic guys don't worry I'll
be discussing all about RP a in this
session and by the end of the session I
guarantee you that you'll be able to
create your first automation project in
any other IP tools all right so let's
get on with this session and before
getting on with the session let me show
you the kind of project that you'll be
able to make after this particular
session so what I'll do is I'll go to my
uipath studio so this is a project that
I've created that I'll create again when
I'll be going to the demo part of this
session but what this project will be
doing is it'll read your email you'll
get the subject line of that email and
search that subject line on an
e-commerce platform and whatever results
that we'll be getting it will fetch
those results from the website put it
inside an excel file and mail you that
file alright so for example I want the
information about all the Blackberry
phones so I just write myself a meal
with the subject line blackberry right
and I'll then run this program and what
will happen is in the next few minutes
it'll give me back mme Lyth all these
search results are the BlackBerry phones
along with the prices don't believe me
let me show you how I can do it so what
I'll do is I'll go to my gmail so as you
can see there are no messages as of now
I compose an email and send it to myself
with the subject line say iPhone okay so
I want the information about the iPhone
product I send it to myself and as you
can see I've got an email for myself
with the subject line iPhone now I'll go
to my program I'll run this particular
program and as you can see it will pick
the subject line of this meal it will
open an e-commerce website search it to
that particular tag name so that was
iPhone go to every page extract the
information from those page save it
inside an excel file and send it back to
me right so it says sorry no results
found because it has reached the end of
the page now all right so now basically
just looking for any other name that it
can get on the page and once it
recognizes that this was the end it will
close this program and you can see the
mean in my
in box let's wait for it to get
processed all right so this was it it
got processed let me go to my meal to
check if I've caught any email so as you
can see I've got a meal but see is
attachment let me go inside it and as
you can see there's a file so let me
download this file and let's open this
file now so as you can see I've got the
information about all the iPhones with
the price tag and as you can see there
are 53 iPhones which will lift set on
that ecommerce website and I've got the
all their information just of a click of
a button right so this Patrol is that
powerful and you'll be able to create
this automation in just five minutes
once you're over with this session all
right no coding required no prior
experience so let us go to the slide and
start with the session today so let's
see what all we are going to learn in
this session today so we're gonna start
by the first discussing why do we
actually need our PA and then move on to
discuss what exactly I Pia is once we're
done with that we look at different
tools which can implement the rpi
technology we will be discussing the top
tools and out of these top tools will be
picking up one tool that is uipath and
we'll be discussing the basic components
of that tool once you're done with that
we'll move on to the demo part where
we'll be deploying a project and
automation project which we'll be making
use of email automation and data
scraping all right so guys this is our
agenda for today I hope it's clear to
you let's move on to the first topic of
today's discussion that why do we need
rpm right so why our period so let's
explain this using an example as you
know every bank has this system that is
called a fraud detection system alright
so let's take the example of credit card
fraud detection system and now any
transaction that is coming in it is
judged on the basis of rules that you
have designed right so let's consider
these rules should be something like
this so for example the last location of
access off your credit card is far away
from the axis which is showing on the
screen right now or which is being
showing in the transaction right now so
it becomes suspicious second the usual
amount of transaction that may be in the
month you transact around twenty to
thirty thousand of cash from your red
car but suddenly you made a transaction
of five hundred thousand right so that
is a huge number that also becomes
suspicious and the third rule could be
that the number of trials or the number
of times you entered a wrong pin right
so this could be that someone caught
hold of a credit card and he's trying to
get money out of a bed covered he is not
able to get your PIN right so this could
also be a suspicious transaction right
so if you were to judge a transaction
based on these rules one way of doing it
is through the human workforce so this
human workforce was actually being used
like 10 15 or 20 years back when there
was no automation system or no
automation tool which is this invented
right so there were a lot of people
whose sole purpose was to investigate
each and every transaction and
authorized a transaction based on those
rules all right but as in when
automation came in now 95% of those
transactions are automated and the rest
5 persons of those transactions are just
flagged as an anomaly now why are they
an anomaly anomaly are basically the
transaction which cannot be judged by
the automation system now you cannot
program your code to judge everything
right you cannot program your code to
see the world right so there are always
some loopholes and there are always some
situations that the computer cannot
judge and that way you need human
intelligence so this is where you will
be needing your expertise and you'll be
judging whether this particular
transaction is fraudulent or not all
right so this basically clears it out
when people ask me it's quite often
asked question that will RPL replace the
human workforce so guys that is not
entirely true right it may reduce the
workforce that is already existing on a
project but it will never be able to
replace the human workforce which is
already working because for in every
department you need that human touch
because the basic difference between a
machine and a human is that machines are
good in following the things that we
tell them all right but humans are
capable of thinking out of the box they
are able to think of something new which
machines are not right so there will
always be vacancies for humans to work
inside the department
all right so let's take another example
let's take the example of a data entry
employees so the typical job of a data
entry employers take data from multiple
sources and aggregate them inside one
file right so basically this employee
would follow the same steps each and
every day for each and every hydration
right and then save it inside one file
so he's doing the same steps every day
and then getting his job done what if we
can do that what if we can tell our
computer to do those same tasks and get
the same job done right so this guy will
then automate that uh so this we are
basically automating the - by making use
of a robot or a machine or an RPA tool
and now our tasks become more faster and
they become more robust they are more
accurate etc right so in some situations
automation becomes a boon and in some
situations it could be actually a threat
to your job all right so let me give you
some facts so according to McKenzie by
the year 2025 there'll be an impact to
fight to seven trillion dollars right
five to seven trillion dollars is a huge
amount of money guys it also says it
will touch more than 230 million
knowledge workers all right so don't get
scared with this line because it says it
will touch the jobs of 230 million
workers so what that basically mean is
that whatever tasks that you are doing
today maybe you'll not be able to do
them tomorrow tomorrow you might be
doing a different job or different set
of tasks will be expected from your job
right so this is what you mean by
they'll be a touching more than 230
million knowledge worker so that is
basically 9 percent of the global
working population right so don't be
scared with the fact bias but it is
always good to know about all the new
technologies which are coming in the
world and obviously if you're best at
what you do nobody can replace you all
right having said that let's move on and
understand why RP is relevant from a
company's perspective alright so if I am
a CEO of the company and I have to think
about implementing RP in my company what
are the things that I'll consider so
first of all if I'm using our PA it
saves a lot of course because I'm
downsizing my workforce with
a stick number right so I'll not be
paying society to a lot of employees now
and also I'm getting my work done very
fast right so it saves cost and like I
said it is more accurate in lesser time
because machines they do not commit
mistakes guys they never get tired they
never commit any error and hence they
are very accurate and that - they do
each and every task in the least time
possible all right the third point is it
is easy to implement it and this is
probably the most important point right
to do any tasks you can write a code
right so what's the point of writing
thousands lines of code for a very small
task it's better to do the task on your
own rather than writing thousand lines
of code in it but that's the best part
about rpm whatever demo I showed you in
the beginning of this session it is all
done using tag and drop and it hardly
takes five minutes to configure it and
if you don't believe me hang on till the
end of the session and I'll show you how
you can do that mo alright so with this
guys we have understood why did we need
RPN let's move on to the part where we
will understand what RP exactly is all
right so what is our PSO RP a as you
might have guessed it's an acronym for
robotic process automation right so
let's understand these three terms one
by one so what is robotic robotic is
basically an entity which can be
programmed to mimic human actions so any
entity which can mimic human actions on
being programmed is called robotic then
comes process so a sequence of steps
which lead to a meaningful activity for
example you make tea right so to making
tea the first step would be to pour some
water let it boil then put some tea
leaves let it boil and then to pour some
milk in it well your tea is ready so you
did three steps and with the help of
these three steps your tea is ready
right so this becomes a process of
making tea then comes the pipe
automation the what is automation
automation basically means when a task
happened automatically without human
intervention all right so whenever a
task happens without in human
intervention it becomes automation now
if you take the words robotic process
automation robotic means mimicking human
actions to do a process without human
intervention
so this
the meaning of our PA this is what it
basically means this is the definition
of our PA all right so now that we have
understood the definition of our PA and
we have understood why do we need our PA
we saw how our PA can work let's go on
and understand the different tools using
which we can actually implement the IPA
technology all right as of now there are
three tools which are at the top of the
ladder which are uipath blue prism and
on automation anyway these are the three
best tools in the our PA world now what
is the difference between these three
tools is let's talk in terms of
Licensing guys first so how many of you
can use it for free so blue prism is not
free at all they don't give you an in
trial version alright you can only
request the company and maybe if they
think you'll be buying this product and
you just want to test it before you buy
it they might give you a trial version
of 15 days but that has to be requested
from the company cannot directly
download it from their website all right
same is the case with the automation
anywhere but with the automation
anywhere you might get a demo if you
search a bit on google right and in that
part also you get a demo version Baron
you have only 50 tasks that you can do
with that demo release there you get
right and then you have UI part so UI
parts is a severe in this case what they
do is they offer you a community edition
of their RP a tool but that community
edition is strictly for personal use if
you want to learn uipath if you want to
get acquainted with the tools that are
there in UI path you can use the UI path
Community Edition and learn it and once
you think that you want to implement it
in your production environment maybe in
your company you want to use it then you
can go ahead and buy their lies all
right
so since we want each other to learn and
I want you guys to practice as much as
you can we will be discussing about UI
paths in this session all right so let's
go ahead and see what are the basic UI
path components right so the UI path
components can be broadly divided into
four categories so you the first
category is recording when you do
recording basically what you are doing
is you are not creating any flow charts
you are not dragging and dropping any
activities on any tasks that you want to
do all you're doing is you're clicking
record button and you're doing the
normal work that you do and uipath
automatically captures whatever you are
doing and replicates the same when you
play the button alright so there is no
dragging drop there is no coding
involved you just click the button do
your daily tasks and the computers
recognizes it automatically alright so
this is what recording does then comes
scraping so scraping basically means
extracting data out of something and
then putting it in a structured manner
alright so this is what scraping is if
you have screen scraping and then you
have data scraping screen shaping is
basically used for desktop application
data scraping can be used for web
applications as well alright so there
are a lot of differences but this
difference is fine for today's
discussion then we have user events or
user events and nothing but events that
are done by user for example if you
press a key on keyboard that becomes a
user event if you click the mouse pair
of a mouse that becomes a user event
right so these are user events which you
can use in your program to do different
tasks and then in the end you have
variables variables are a very important
part of any sequence that you are
creating guys right so variables
basically act as mediators or they act
as a bridge between two activities or
two things that are happening at a
different level all right even they help
and data manipulation as well all right
so guys these are the basically the
components of UI paths we will be
focusing on activities and scraping
today so let's go and see what is the
problem statement of our hands on right
so like I said I already showed it off
so what we'll be doing is we'll be
creating an application which will read
the email right it will take the subject
line of that email it put it inside the
search query of an e-commerce website
get the results extract the result from
the scraping technique and put it inside
a CSV format file save it and send it
back to me via email all right so now
this sounds like a daunting task it
might seem like it'll take a lot of time
but it will hardly takes five to six
minutes to do it if you were to
implement it in UI path let me show you
how
so I quickly jump to my tool which is
here I'll click on new sequence let's
name the sequence as demo and click on
create
right so I've got my new sequence so the
first thing that I want to do is get an
email all right but before all of that
guys I want to first show you how you
can extract data from website because I
know it's pretty interesting to learn
with the first time how the data is
extracted from the website like so let
me show you how we can do it
so first you have to click on data
scraping alright so before that you have
to open the website from which you want
to scrape the data from for example I
want to scrape it from Flipkart com
so I go to flip car comm I'll open this
page and say I want to search for
blackberry all right
so I'll enter a Blackberry phones
alright I'll get it list over here and I
want to scrape the data out of this page
so what I'll do is I'll go back to my
tool I click on data scraping and we
give me a visit right so it wants me to
select an element that I want to extract
from the webpage so I click on next and
select their elements for example I want
the name to be extracted so I click on
the name and now until ask me to select
some others items name as well so that
it can see the pattern and can replicate
it throughout all the products in the
page so that gets the name of all the
products in the page right so now I'll
be clicking on one more name so I click
on next I'll select one more name and
then it gets it it's now ask me the name
that I want to give it the column so
I'll just give it name right and do I
want the URL for this particular product
as well yes I can extract the URL as
well and let's name the column as URL
right I'll click on next and as you can
see it has extracted all the names of
the product which are there on this page
as well as their URL all right so now I
want the prices as well so what I do is
I click on extract correlated data I
click on the price now it will ask me to
select one more price so that it can
form a pattern I'll click on next and
then select the second price as well and
now it will ask me to name the column
let me name it as column that I'm gonna
get let's click on next
and as you can see it extracted the
prices as well it's pretty cool pitch
and it's very easy to implement as well
now I'll click on finish and it will ask
me is the data spanning across multiple
pages so if there are a lot of pages in
this website it can actually go to each
page to see if there are more products
right so it has to be specified how this
particular program going can go to the
next page so we have to specify the
button over here for the next page so
the button is here right so I'll click
on yes and I'll click on next
alright done my data scraping tool is
ready all right so now this data
scraping tool has to save this file
inside a CSV right do that what we'll do
is I have to go to activities and I have
to search for an activity called
write CSV all right when you search for
this activity we'll get this particular
event you can drag and drop it here and
now it will ask the file path where you
want it to be saved so let's select the
file path let's name the file as see
Eddie Aikau demo all right let's save it
and now it will ask the data source from
where it'll get all the information so
when you are extracting all the data
from this particular website it is
getting saved in this particular
variable in the output section you'll
find data table this is the variable in
which all your data is going in all
right so this variable has to be
specified here so let's specify it its
extract data table we'll specify it and
our job is done guys so let's run it
once to see if our information is being
extracted we'll run it and let's see
what it does
all right it has been to the last page
and when you go to the last page
basically see that sorry no results
found that basically means that it has
passed through all the pages now let's
wait for it to get finished alright some
program is completed let's go inside the
file and check if we can see our excel
file over there
all right so here it is Eddie Rica demo
CSV let's open it so as you can see the
information has been extracted Kure so
now what we'll be doing is you'll be
adding the email automation part of it
so let's see how we can go about it so
as of now my reader scraping tool is
capable of going to flip card search for
blackberry get the results and store it
inside a CSV format but what I want to
do is I want to do custom search that is
I want to take the data out from my
email take that particular subject line
and then search it on Flipkart let's see
how we can do that so first what I'll do
is I will search for mail and I want to
get the incoming mail right so there's a
protocol called
IMAP so I drag and drop the IMAP
activity over here right that is in the
beginning and then I have to configure
this right to how I can configure this
is something like this so basically I
will click on the activity and I get the
properties page on here on the right
side so on the right side now I'll have
to first give the port numbers the port
number for IMAP protocol it's nine nine
three right
so once I've specified nine nine three
I'll have to give the server name as
well right now any string that you give
inside your UI path it has to be
enclosed inside double quotes alright so
the string is imap.gmail.com alright so
this is the address of your server now
it will ask you for your email and
password so let's create a variable for
the email and password we will go to the
Spain that is variables we will click on
create variable we'll create a variable
called email and we'll create a variable
called password alright let's feed the
information over here so like I said
double quotes are there we'll enter in
double quotes my email ID and you have
to specify the password as well so let's
specify the password as well that is it
so now these variables have the password
and the email ID let's pass it to our
IMAP activity so I'll specify the
variable over here and password over
here
guys when you're specifying the
variables you don't need the double
quotes anymore all right let's see what
else we have to configure so if we are
reading the email we want to be marked
as read I want to read only one email
from the top let's specify one and the
output of the mails
all right so whatever you're getting
from your mail where do you want to
store it you have to store it inside a
variable right so that variable is of
less type because you can exact as many
means as you want right so for the very
reason we have to create a list of mail
messages all right so the variable
should be of the type of list of mail
messages so let's create a variable of
that shot will click on create variable
let's name this variable as mail message
now let's select the type of this mail
message so we'll browse for types and we
will search for list right under systems
are collections of generate you'll find
lists of tea you'll select it now what
is T we have to define it here that is
mail message so I'll go to the drop-down
go for brows with types and search for
mail over here and inside system dot net
dot mail I find main message property
I'll just click on OK and as you can see
it'll be a list of mail messages I click
on OK and the type automatically becomes
that now I have to specify this variable
name in the properties of my IMAP
activity so let me specify the variable
here and that is it so my IMAP is now
configured to receive emails let's check
all right so now let's check if I am
able to search for it but now we are not
be able to search for it because I am
not passing the information anywhere
else right so I have to pass the emails
that I'm getting right now so for that I
have to use an activity called for each
right so for each mail I have to do
something
for each meal I have to get information
right so there is only one meal that I'm
getting right now but for any future
uses you'll be using for each right so I
a drag and drop for each over here and
it will ask me for each what in - right
so in - basically is the variable that
I'm getting from my mail so that is mail
message right for each mail in mail
message you have to do something now
this is mail how will this for each
attribute know that this variable that
I've entered here is of the type mail so
for that you have to click on it and go
to properties and inside the type
arguing what the type of argument you
have to specify as mail all right so
I'll go here and I will select mail
message all right so now it identifies
that this argument is of the type mail
message and it is looking inside the
variable which is of the type list of
mail messages right sounds logical now
what will do is it will execute anything
that is inside this body time and again
each time it receives a mail from its
list all right so inside this list now I
have to open a browser which will point
towards my custom searched page now for
that what I'll be doing is I'll quickly
go to my ecommerce website alright and
let me search for say any product let us
search for say iPhone right and I will
copy this link and let me go here such a
property called open browser all right
and drag and drop it here so basically
now whenever it finds the mail inside
the list of mail messages it will open a
browser and it will point to this
particular address now again the address
since it's a string it has to be
included inside double quotes all right
now again it is searching only for
iPhone but I want to change the search
term remember so what I'll do is I will
close the quotes here and I'll open the
quotes here
and this thing I'll change it into a
variable right so basically for male and
male messages I want the subject of this
particular mean that I'm getting from
the list of main messages all right so I
write male dot and then I get all the
properties over here so basically I want
the subject of the mail so I'll select
subject all right and now it will get
the subject of that meal and it will
replace it over here in the search query
so basically what has happened allow us
that it will read the mail it will store
everything inside a list of main
messages now I am going through each of
those meals and doing something over
here all right
so now every time there is an error
inside your workflow it is recognized by
this exclamation sighs sign all right so
this exclamation sign tells me that
something is wrong inside my activity
let's see what is that so if I go here
it says that there is something wrong
with my link over here so let me see
what is wrong all right so basically
I'll have to add plus here that
signifies that I'm adding something to
this URL so as you see the blue thing
has gone away and if I click here every
warning has been gone all right so for
appending the variable to your already
existing link you have to add plus
telling that add this thing in the whole
of the shrink all right so now it will
go to that custom link whatever I have
specified in the mail and will do what I
wanted to do data scraping on that all
right so I've already defined data
scraping I've done it on four Flipkart
right so what I'll do is I will just
remove the part where it's specified
that I have to go to the BlackBerry page
right so what I do is I'll extract the
do part out from here and maybe paste it
here
then go up and delete this part attach
browser and I can put it back inside my
data scraping right
seems fixed now I'll put this data
scraping part inside my
do of my open browsers so that whenever
the browser opens it gets to know that
it has to do data scraping on this
particular website that it got from this
particular link all right so let's see
if we have something extra here all
right so let's leave this we don't need
it anymore
all right seems functional let's name
this as demo fine so now it is getting
everything so we already are getting it
inside it a record demo dot CSV now we
have to mail it back to me all right so
as if now it will take the email it will
get the search query it will search it
it will save it inside the CSV but I'm
still not getting it back as an
attachment for that you have to go here
and search for SMTP protocol and you
have to drag and drop it over here
alright so once that is done you have to
specify her whom do you want to send the
mail to so I want it to be sent to me so
I'll give the variable here subject what
should be the subject so let the subject
be attachment information or something
like query right and then the body let's
keep it as please find attached all
right and now let's attach the files so
we will attach the files you have to
enter the file path over here so let's
go to our files this is the location
let's copy it and paste it here inside
quotes obviously and then specify the
name of the file despair
all right so it'll pick the file from
this particular address and send a meal
to me but again you have to configure
your SMTP as well so say over the case
you didn't an IMAP in SMTP as well you
have to specify the port number so the
port number for SMTP protocol is it's
465 right and the server name is
smtp.gmail.com
all right and it'll ask me for the email
so email is inside my variable same is
the case with password as well
all right who will it send it to it'll
send it to me whom is it from it is
again from me all right so you can
actually create an advanced version of
this play around with it create an
advanced version and that is it and I
think that is also as you can see there
are no errors in our sequence so that
basically means I can execute it now so
let's go to my email and let's try to
search something
let's try a search for TVs right so
let's try to search for a particular
brand of TV called vo TV alright
so whenever in the search query you are
trying to add something for every space
you have to specify person instrument u
so basically I want us to search for V U
TV so since there is a space I have to
specify percentage 20 because that's how
in any link that you see in the browser
you don't have spaces so instead of
spaces you have percentage 20 all right
so I specify bu percentage 20 TV and
I'll send it to myself if i refresh it I
can see there's a male over here right
and if I go inside my project now let's
try and run our program now
so it will open the Flipkart page as you
can see it caught to the view TV page it
spanned through all the pages it came to
the end of the page now it is processing
it putting in to inside the excel file
and then email me across let's see how
that goes
all right so our process is now complete
let's go to my mail to check if I've
caught something yes so I've got a mean
let's download this file and check if
you have caught anything inside it so
yes as you can see I've caught the
product name the URL of the product and
the price of that product as well
