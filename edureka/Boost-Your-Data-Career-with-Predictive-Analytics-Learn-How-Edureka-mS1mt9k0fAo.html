hour and there's a lot of meat around us
and we need to look into a lot of
aspects of predictive analytics so I
will request you to just hold on to your
questions until we get to the end of the
session because otherwise will not be
able to complete the session in the
fullest right and also towards then I
wish to showcase a small case study
which will help you connect to walk east
predictive analytics and how can that be
used in a retail segment right so let us
continue with the session is everyone
able to hear me because yeah so when key
you need to probably check the
connection at yarin everyone is able to
him that means there's a problem at
urine so please fix that Winky hey I
sasikumar hello perfect yep let me put
this in the slide mode alright what is
data analytics all about and how to
become a scientist do I really need to
know predictive analytics for me to
become a data scientist oh yes answer is
literally yes you need to be a data
scientist so let me quickly show you are
a quick thing about data scientist right
data scientist is going to be the
sexiest profession of 21st century and
this word called sexiest job of the 21st
century is coined by harvard business
review and they also make another
alarming statement which sees the
shortage of data scientists
is becoming a serious constraint in most
of the sectors that is where you have a
lot of advantage potential to tap into
right so if you want to become a data
scientist you need to possess the skills
of building predictive models predicting
the future predicting the future things
of your organization's right so in this
agenda will be covering what is
predictive analytics why you need to
know about predictive analytics and why
is predictive analytics all of a sudden
becoming so imperative in the current
world right we'll look into predictive
analytics the life cycle of that one of
the greatest career opportunities which
are awaiting you if you join this
program we are also going to understand
how companies are using predictive
analytics right see here we go what is
predictive analytics predictive
analytics is all about using your
historical data you use your past data
and by using few statistical algorithms
and machine learning techniques you'll
be able to predict your outcome you'll
be able to predict the consumer behavior
hey is this consumer going to purchase
the product or not right we'll be
looking into artificial intelligence
we're in your machines are going to rule
the world they are going to become more
and more sophisticated right you'll be
able to detect who is a fraud say you're
doing credit card transactions which
particular credit card transaction might
be fraudulent transaction because you
know every now and then you receive a
call from the call center whenever you
make a purchase a specific purchase you
get a call you do not receive call on
each and every credit card transaction
that you mean however you receive a call
only on few transactions why is that so
that is Collins identifying the patterns
in your data right yeah sasikumar I've
started the recording right you'll be
able to use visualization i'll be
showing you that visualization right
which I've personally worked on a
project on a retail project actually
that predictive behavior hey will this
customer purchase this product yessir
know a person was purchase iphone 6 is
what is he going to purchase samsung
mobile also can i predict that behavior
that will help you in your decision
making right and that will help you
communicate better and to target your
customers better and thereby increase
the profits or for your organization
what is the difference between analytics
and being predictive predictive
analytics you just take your analytics a
step forward right sorry analytics is
all about understanding your fast
behavior but predictive analytics means
understanding your future predicting
your future who doesn't want to predict
his or her own future right so we can
even predict our futures your futures
would obviously be bright you know if
you get into data analytics no doubts
upon that all right observing the past
friends is analytics by observing the
past friends trying to predict what will
happen to the future trend will my sales
even increase now or net sales decrease
with my profits increase or decrease
with a number of customers whom i am
going to acquire increase or decrease so
you will be able to take decision
come up with some decision-making based
on predictive analytics using analytics
you look into historical data you look
into current data but when it comes to
looking into your future date I it's all
about being predicted lagging indicators
are the indicators which will not help
you take any corrective action or help
you do the course correction right for
example if we complete one quarter if I
look into all the past data I'll come to
know what is my profit if you identify
these kind of metrics right indicators
you'll not be in a position to take any
action because already you know what
your profits are now in this quarter you
cannot go back in time until unless you
are into those you know scientific
movies wherein scientists build some
kind of a time machine waiting you go
past in time and take corrective actions
right until unless you have that kind of
an equipment you cannot go back in time
and take corrective action so that is a
lag indicator what is a lead indicator
if I predict the saints if I predict the
sales if you predict my profits for the
next quarter and if a prediction sales
that says that your profits will be ten
percent less than your organizational
group if that is a statement which I can
make about the future then I can take
corrective actions to ensure that my
profits do not dip by ten percent so on
and so forth that is the difference
between analytics and being productive
so one of the various roles which you
see typically right you looking
do these Calif rules right so with me a
highlight business manager what is a
business manager do is considered to be
a domain expert he makes decisions he
evaluates your current processes and
looks into the return on investment how
much I am I investing how much a month
am I getting back and then comes your
business analyst what does the business
analysts do he's there to explore the
data is there to visualize the data and
also provide some reports to the various
stakeholders now this is the interesting
profession that we are speaking about a
data scientist Data Miner because as
part of your predictive analytics you'll
also be learning about data mining
techniques you'll be learning about art
1 statistics you'll be learning about
forecasting techniques you actually come
to know what is the difference between
forecasting and predicting add these to
the same know so you learn about all
these concepts as part of this program
right and you have data miner a
statistician what does this person do
this person is going to explore the data
he's going to segment your data and say
hey if you're launching iphone come up
with two variants iphone 5s vs iphone 5c
if you are aware of iphone 5 Series
right this happened Apple has come up
with iphone 5s and 5c why did they come
up with two things because they fill
that there is one market which is niche
market wherein people are willing to
ping as much amount as possible and
there's another market people there
cannot afford so much and if we can
reduce the price a little they're
probably purchased my product so I've
segmented them into two categories that
is segmentation predictive modeling and
we'll spend some time when this kissing
predictive modeling I'll explain about
few case studies in Holland
so how does it typically get started and
you have your IT manager this is pretty
self-explanatory right so let us look
into the life cycle ring first you try
to identify what is your problem then of
course if you already have the data
which you have collected then you go
with the data preparation if you do not
have the data you collect the data you
go and collect the data by doing surveys
questionnaires or if you already have
some data available on the internet you
try to scrape through that and get that
information then you try to explore the
data is my data continuous data or
discrete data is it nominal ordinal and
things like that you try to explore the
data and our outer any outliers things
like that then you try to transform the
data if required and build a prediction
model once you build a prediction model
your job is not done yet you try to
validate that model whether your model
that you have built prediction model
right is accurate or not once you
validate the model and feel that
accuracy is good then you'd apply the
model in real life you deploy it to
there and and you know you also look
into the final results after deploying
what are the results looking like and
you try to monitor those results
continuously so this is all about your
predictive analytics lifecycle let us
move on in look into few of the examples
or case studies where it is used yeah so
Mike so those are the differences that
you'll come to know when you you know
actually look into this program but for
a lot quickly touch upon this otherwise
will not be able to complete you know
it's a bigger topic so data mining is
all about unsupervised and supervised
learning right what does that mean if
you go to supermarket and
just things right you tend to purchase
toothpaste and toothbrush together you
probably may purchase beer and chips
packet together right are you probably
want to purchase your shaving cream
versus shaving gel together after shave
lotion probably so all these things
which go together right if you analyze
on that you'll come up with some
interesting insights that is all about
data mining and supervised spa if you
look into data mining supervised right
if you get an email in your gmail you
are going to classify that as span or
not a spam should it go to my spam
folder or should it go to my Inbox
should it go to my social category or
should it go to promotion category or
should it be in my general category all
that is part of your data mining concept
are supervised learn forecasting means
there should be time series it should be
based on time for example my electricity
consumption is increasing in summer
decreasing in winter it's a good
increasing in summer and decreasing in
winter or my sales is increasing during
Diwali season and Christmas season are
the number of greeting cards that a soul
is increasing during Valentine's Day
right this is all about forecasting how
much should the minting happen for
example if currency minting should
happen what currency notes should I
meant at what piece what should be the
electricity production looking into the
increase in the population increasing
the urbanization increasing the number
of industries increasing the power
consumption of the power what should be
my electricity production so all this is
forecasting is great and prediction you
know is also part of your forecasting
it's also part of your data mining
supervised learning alright
so look into this campaign management
take this example this very example of
you all attending the session right when
would you want in this session or when
will you enroll this enroll to this
program if I market using social media
Facebook or if a market using Google
Adwords or if an market using some
advertisement or television which
advertisement is effective to ensure
that you all really joined this
particular program enroll for this
program that is campaign management
customer acquisition he have 10
customers which customer should I really
acquire see there are let me give you an
example of two different customers here
this customer a and there is customer be
customer a has a revenue or his say
monthly salaries one cruise as you his
monthly salary is one cruel and this
person is month salary say three lakhs
which customers
robot and target for me to you know sell
a niche product which person do I to
argue should I go and target person a or
person be what would your gut feel see
are based on this limited information
that I provided what do you think you
were with person the AdvoCare right so
you know what you have missed out on one
key thing that is this person though he
has one cruel think about Vijay Mallya
though he has crores of rupees is going
to take a loan and he is going to
default or he'll purchase your product
on emi and he'll not be the year mine of
this person already along with one crew
right he has two crores of expenses per
month based on his earning versus
spending power these are the weight is
attributes that you need to look into
before you acquire a customer probably
this person who is earning only 3 lakhs
right he does not have any other
commitments maybe he's a very good
customer in terms of taking the loan and
paying back and things like that you can
see the task bar at the bottom cannot be
hidden yeah it can be eaten but it will
come back once again is it distracting
you from viewing anything
yeah is it distracting you guys from
doing anything go wrong no all right so
it's only the URL which is given you
because when a navigate right it comes
back yeah sorry about that but when I'm
trying to navigate right that's coming
back I can't do much with that I do not
have a lot of control next thing is
budgeting and forecasting which we have
briefly discussed right forecasting is
all about time series then you have
fraud detection whom should I lend alone
sorry whom should I lent loan and if I
lend loan is that person going to repay
the your mind repay the loan whom should
I give the credit card if I give you a
credit card are you going to pay me or
are you going to set in the credit card
after making all the witches right next
thing is promotions think about this
that on a daily basis you keep getting
smss from say amazon or from apple or
whatever product it is and the keeps
sending that promotion promotional
coupon we will rely on that
advertisement sooner or later you not do
so right say you're a bachelor or a
spinster not yet married do not have any
kids or not planning to have any kids
and if I send you a promotion about baby
Kate product will you ain't catered
after that no right however if you are
switching something around pregnancy
online are based on some historical
information say in India for example in
Mumbai for example people who are of
that age say 27 28 29 and if they earn
more than one lakh per month things like
that they tend to plan for families may
be based
these kind of analysis if I can send a
promotional activity or promotional
coupon only to those people who are
planning for babies our people are
already pregnant expecting babies right
if i send baby care products promotions
then it makes more sense for me I'm
narrowing it down right this can be done
using your predictive analytic pricing
why should the price of iphone 6 be five
hundred dollars why shouldn't it be four
fifty dollars or five why shouldn't it
be any other thing right why shouldn't
it be any other thing right so that is
all about your pricing analytics demand
planning I've given you example of
electricity production right as a now
the number of people increase
urbanization increases your number of
companies increase number of factories
increase as a now that happens your
electricity consumption should increase
ellipticity production should increase
that is your demand plan so these are
all the bunch of possibilities there and
here are a few real life examples your
Commonwealth Bank has built a fraud
detection model and each and every
transaction right look at this
commonwealth bank and reliably reliably
predict the likelihood of fraud activity
for any given transaction even before it
is authorized within 40 milliseconds
less than a second right immediately you
get a call saying that hello sir did you
even did you make this purchase if you
say no they're going to reject the
transaction how cool is that right look
into this Lenovo lenovo detected a
product issue thirty percent faster and
reduce violent he calls ten to fifteen
percent for previously you know issues
which were hard to detect now they're
actually looking into all these things
right and you have some
single as salt river project which has
come up with the forecasting model which
helped them know the best time to sell
excess electricity for the best price
probably during your nights everyone
switches off their electricity so you
have some excess electricity at that
point of time simply lying there can I
release excess electricity at night or
during non-peak are words for a lower
cost so that I have balanced out things
probably yes so that's a very good case
study right what is the difference
between promo and campaign is a question
from Jay sheet right what do you mean by
campaign campaign means i can either put
an advertisement on television or i can
do a newspaper ad or i can do a
promotion on google adwords i can do a
promotion on your facebook right that's
campaign what campaign do i want to
choose they want to choose email
campaign online campaign what can't be
what do you promote promotional activity
whenever there is a promotion of any
activity or product right you'll get a
promotional email you'll get the
promotional code which says hey use this
code and get an instant ten percent
discount that is promotion you're
promoting your product right basically
that's a thin line of difference between
promotion and campaign jersey and then
we have staples staples analyzes online
and offline in a consumer behavior to
provide a complete picture of their
customers let me leave you with this
start when you know for this line let me
take one of your name randomly Jay
shield right jay scheel and I are
extremely close friends and jay scheel
is a campaign manager
alright let me tell you this jay scheel
and I are friends very close friends and
jay scheel is a procurement manager and
Jay shields company is trying to procure
procure laptops and I'm into laptop
selling business suggestion comes to me
and says hey there is this procurement
contract which has been released and I
want to award this contract to you
because you are my clothes body however
I want twenty percent of the profit
alright we both agree no one comes to no
contract is awarded to me now I enjoy
she'll meet outside in a pub and I give
him cash twenty percent of profit how
can you even predict this kind of a
fraud which happens under the table
offline right it's extremely difficult
right think about that how to predict
that if the values are provided on the
table if the values are recorded then
it's easier for me to predict however it
is extremely difficult for me to predict
if the values are not recorded I leave
you with that thought in just keep
thinking all right why predictive
analytics because there are a lot of
parts right it's a jigsaw puzzle for a
puzzle for me outside in the world there
which product should i launched in which
geography shouldn't launch what should
be the price of that right so all that
all this uncertainty is there if I take
this path will I even be successful or
not right I think the number of users
allowed for this webinar has reached and
I'm frequently getting that message
sorry himanshu says we can find by
analyzing me expenditure what is that if
I have more money so I have spend extra
yeah true hey keep hearing this message
sorry so visions of risk is required you
need to identify the risk involved in
taking a decision right if you're
launching a product and tomorrow if the
product fails it's going to be huge loss
so even before I launch my product if
someone can help me predict and see if
you learn that product is going to be a
success if you do not launch that
product that's fine because it might
take you into loss so this kind of
prediction if someone can do even before
I take an action then that's gonna be
the cool thing right for example you can
even predict who is the next president
who is going to be the next president of
india you can literally predict that i'm
not going to give you the solution
oddity at all are you thinking about are
you analyzing the procurement from that
i'm speaking about other Thea oh no no
no i will not give the solution because
you know what do I see that's you know
the unique selling proposition right
it's very key algorithm and holic even
if I tell you you might not be able to
understand at this point of time
right but offline you can get in touch
with me oddity I'll see how I can help
you with that but I have a question from
ravi how can we apply predictive
analytics and student scores you mean to
say which student will score how many
marks and things like that rubbing is
that your question
question Ravi that's gonna be a very
simple model Ravi it's going to be a
very simple prediction model right
forecasting we are looking into the
previous course of the students and you
want to forecast the next score you look
into their previous semesters course and
want to predict the next semester scores
you look into how many classes that
person is attending versus what was his
historical marks right and look into all
those things and you know probably
predict that Sonny was a question can
you help answer how predictive analytics
will help in identity and information
security alien I can just keep yeah we
can have n number of variables for
student problem absolutely you're right
on that you're right on target so you
spend majority of your time in
identifying what are those where your
bills which are going to influence your
output and what is your outcome I want
to predict this to rim school absolutely
there can be thousand also i am not
discounting you in one they can be
thousand variables also but what are
those variables which are really
critical for me to predict my outcome
that is he right you can go about
identifying many but wait what what are
those variables which are extremely
important for me to predict lots of
relevance for us right so let me take
the Sun dips questions and leave as a
question can you please answer how
predictive analytics will help in
identity and information security so I
you speaking about the data security and
all that are are you speaking about
security of a different person security
of human beings what is it that you're
speaking about here Sandeep
ah access management I might
accidentally or willingly provides
someone access to my secure data
environment probably i'll give someone
access to Social Security numbers
probably i'll give someone access to my
credit card numbers right i might be
dealing with the credit card details of
the customers right you know again you
know this is again domain based question
that you're asking you need to look into
various variables once again right you
look into your historical information no
doubt about that what are the security
parameters that you have right probably
you look into what databases that you're
using what are the way its locations on
which you are trying to place your data
what is a firewall that you have so
probably you need to look into all that
so this is a bigger question sandy this
is the bigger question is straight to
analytics just the probability equation
of an event no it's very advanced move
on it's not just the probability aspect
of that and then analysis right now we
need to not run absolutely other day we
need to do that how much is average
income of a data analyst or someone who
works with our it depends on the years
of experience that you have but a person
was 10 to 15 years of experience and if
you're a chief data scientist right our
people tend to pay you 250 thousand
dollars or so per annum
started working on a POC in this area as
of now no product support yeah
absolutely son that's a nice thing right
that's a nice thing that you're working
on it's all part of your fraud detection
and all that for predictive analysis is
machine learning algorithm the only
solution all we have some other means my
unk you know for predictive analytics
it's not just machine learning it's also
about using statistics right you tend to
use poisson regression binomial
regression negative binomial regression
right you might use largest a linear
multivariate there are a lot of other
statistic stuff also which will help you
do that not just your data mining
techniques which statistical concept
will help when I only subject school
what is the object score subject score
again is each question carrying one mark
or do the lecturers or professors also
give you 1.5 marks 1.25 marks are 0.37
marks what is the data type that you are
dealing with you need to look into that
based on the data type your statistical
concept is going to change assuming that
it's a whole number probably i would say
i'm going to use a logistic regression
or i might use some other taking them it
depends can we continue with our lecture
and take questions only related to the
current slide yeah lithia what is the
data analyst gets in in here for three
years of experience is the question
screen was us I think six to eight lacks
hear the audio has problems pinky no one
has a problem so you need to check your
connection so do a Eureka conduct
classroom coaching in data science and
predictive analytics area yes absolutely
suddenly they have a session on that
currently I'm ready I'm in Java how to
become a data scientist so garnish were
you need to join some of these kind of
tutorials which will help
you gain experience I have turtle four
years of experience is fine too deep
dive into analytics yeah your data
analytics is fading new concept fairly
new in the market so I will request you
to proceed and pursue that career now
all right you know what predictive
analytics can also be used in these kind
of things wearing you know you can
predict whether there's a place for you
to park or not barking you and where do
you need to park where the parking lots
available right BMW is using predictive
analytics to find a place to park
automatically while you go that route
while you take that route based on your
gps based on your parking lot space you
come to know where there's a space and
automatically can go panting yeah google
is coming up with driverless car right
car is driven using a robo there won't
be any driver at all predictive
analytics frediting on which route to
take things like that it is extensively
using your sports domain as well right
which country would most probably win
the next world cup which player would
most probably score a lot of goods which
player would be tired after one hour of
the plane which player should i launched
our introduced into the game into the in
second half all these analysis are being
done as of now as we speak in Indian
premium lead right for example I peel
whom should I pick for my team signs so
that with lowest cost I get the maximum
benefits I get the maximum profits that
is your sports will need to cry and this
is needless to say right as mortals you
need the ability to predict the future
if your God not a problem but otherwise
you need to do that
so predictive analytics rising adoption
right this is what folks has to see the
top objective for between two-thirds and
three-quarters of executors is to
develop the ability to model and predict
behaviors and I want to predict this
real time I'll explain on what a small
case study right and these things would
become clear for you so these are the
way these companies which have started
using predictive analytics and started
gaining a lot of benefits right bestbuy
determine seven percent of its customers
were responsible for forty-three percent
of its sales now probably I'm going to
target these seven percent of my
customers and provide them with more
profits more discounts and try to lose
them and ensure that they stay with me
Olive Garden uses data to forecast
staffing needs and food preparation
requirements down to individual menu
items and ingredients wow how cool is
that individual menu items you're not
going to have a generic menu item right
if a customer particular customer is
frequently visiting you probably you
will have a personalized menu options
for him you can also come down choose
the ingredients which he wants in the
food that's superb absolutely right and
this is why
few of the predictions for 2015 our
business intelligence is all about
reporting as of now based on whatever
happened until now I'm going to report
upon that that is business intelligence
right the future strength is going to
lie in predicting the future and there
is a lot of dirt for data scientists
your McKinsey predicts that there would
be a shortage of 140 thousand to one
ninety thousand people across the globe
data scientists sorry not about across
the globe only in us only in united
states alone 140 thousand to one ninety
thousand that is a shortage that we are
looking at here is a chance for you to
just pitch in and you know feeling good
gap data science tools become a
commodity so you have tool called r r is
an open source it's a commodity now so
the price of the other commercial tools
are also going to come down drastically
because our has forty seven percent of
the market as compared to SAS which has
just eleven percent of the market share
according to various research bodies
predictive analytics career
opportunities here is an interesting
thing for you all right look at that
orange graph there and i want to tell
you that this is a new profession fairly
and in 2011 or so it picked up its piece
because of the burst in the data because
of the big data and all that and
predictive analytics is leading the race
as compared to analytics or bi bi is
slowly dropping or it's fairly constant
there but there is absolutely no
comparison between predictive analytics
job growth was this your business
intelligence and here are the major
companies which are using you have your
department of justice very interesting
right if you have a high profile case
your judges are relying on statistics in
sin
a person to any imprisonment or should
we release that person scot free to take
such a decision they are using
statistics when IBM users iBM has IBM
Watson which is used in your Wimbledon
also sport tennis until Dale bank of
america walmart into the retail segment
amazon amazon has the d best
recommendation engine right if you
search for iphone i'm going to recommend
you probably something or some of the
windows mobile and you're most likely to
also purchase that or try to purchase
that so you've always how predictive is
being how predictive analytic is being
used in the industry here is a small
snapshot of that cross-selling up Celine
right campaign management customer
acquisition if you have a tail Vodafone
and few other mobile providers they give
a lot of importance to how do i acquire
the customers right how do you ensure
that you do not move from one customer
or one so is provided to another service
provider that is our chrétien fraud
detection is fast gaining you know a lot
of speed there it's a lot of attention
and a lot of other things are there here
promotions prising demand planning and
all that so here is a big question boost
your career with predictive analytics
learn how here are simple answers this
is going to be the game changer no doubt
about that no questions about that
analysis on past data is no more enough
and you want future prediction to be
done on split of a second I want to
predict when a crime is going to happen
when a person is going to murder someone
that is called as video analytics it's
that is also a fast catching up that
engine their organizations are adopt
predictive analytics and benefiting from
it and here is the most interesting part
for you there's gone going to be a
shortage of data scientists which still
exists now now I'm going to take your
questions even before I take your
questions here is a small case study
from my inform so there is this retail
store now which has various shops right
there's a shopping mall which as we is
stores there men's apparel Sporting
Goods footwear life and human life style
electronics and all these things there
are people coming in right when a person
enters a shopping mall he'll be given
access to free Wi-Fi and when I give you
access to free Wi-Fi you're going to
connect to that and provide me basic
demographic information such as whether
you are a male or female your age and
things like that very basic demographic
the moment you connect to the Wi-Fi I'll
assign you a mac ID which is unique ID
for each and every person and I'm going
to crack on how much time each person is
spending in my mouth what are the
weightiest tools that he or she is
moving around right and there it's
easier for me right if suppose there is
a person in grocery store here and he's
the person who has searched online for
baby care products I would quickly send
him a discount coupon which is hey the
MA the store store which is adjacent to
grocery store is a baby kid product you
can probably purchase baby care products
for 10 plus an additional discount for
you maybe there is a pleasant say in
your home life sign this person searches
online say he is searching on amazon for
the cost of I food immediately I send a
trigger to the iphone sourcing
hey there is a mic ID who is just
adjacent to your store he has searched
for the price of iphone online and he
most likely might come to your store to
do showrooming and the moment he enters
the store there's a trigger which is
sent to the store owner which says the
person was says the online is in your
store now then this person might provide
him an instant discount say online when
he has done he has urged on Amazon the
price was five hundred dollars but in a
store it is five fifty dollars so you
instantly providing fifty dollars
discount to ensure that you know this
person does not leave over your store
without making a purchase right I can
look into all the trends look at that
let me fasten it as in how the time
approaches 9pm right okay that it's now
seven now it's eight all the store will
become empty and people will accumulate
in the restaurant now right slowly
they're going to the restaurant why is
that so because it's night time I need
to have my dinner so as in how its night
probably the different restaurant shops
can keep sending the coupons saying that
there's a special ten percent discount
on your favorite food product and things
like that so these are the bunch of
possible I don't want to deep dive on
this because there are a lot of original
parameters which have gone into this so
let me take your questions now
oh there are a lot of questions which
have come in all right attending the
course will get you real time experience
absolutely shiney because Shri no
because they're a lot of real-time key
studies which are discussed in this
program which programming language is
used whipple has this question on which
programming language is used for
predictive analytics any specific type
of programming so we majorly use our are
as I've told you the tool are just our
alphabet art right you can do a google
search it has forty seven forty sixty
forty seven percent of the market share
so it has its own programming language
which is extremely extremely easy person
y0 programming knowledge can also learn
are in a shorter time span Frank what
analytics BMW used to find empty parking
slot ha weenie what analytics all right
they look into gps they look into
parking lot application right and based
on that there will also be your senses
to the BMW which is going to sense
quickly and said while you are passing
that wrote that hey there is an empty
space available there I'll not get into
the depth of that that's just a key
study whipple language heights are
something like if a Schwinn takes two
wickets and dhoni scores more than 40
plenty mean yeah absolutely got them
absolutely that is all predictive
analytics when it has a question in real
world what's your experience in our do
you have one which is more flexible in
predictive modeling Python are so I
would say that you know are can do
literally anything and everything in an
attic space just because there are two
million users an element to me and users
are contributing to the development of
our but if you want to build dynamic
applications then python is the best
solution for that if you want some
enough static you know application which
you're building then our is better at
that where is this far is Ruth I didn't
hear that question what is the
difference between analytics and
predictive analytics Manish we have
spent quite some time in Brad analytics
is all about analyzing the current data
and taking a call until then right
predictive analytics is all about future
analytics is all about past and present
predictive analytics is all about future
shinhwa's has this question currently
I'm in to.net with 10 years of
experience I want him I wanted to be in
data analytics learn pretty one antics
from IT and the web but not in limited I
was at the 30-day program 30-day program
wasn't extremely useful right in IIT
feeney ones I wanted to know what are
the subjects to be learned and what type
of opportunities are so to be a data
scientist you need to know statistical
analysis data mining forecasting and
data visualization and opportunities are
just awaiting for a person was good
skills oh yeah money because I've shown
you I have not shown you the entire real
life data there I've just shown you a
sample manish you mentioned analysis of
pancetta is not sufficient but isn't
pretty shin-bi's on historical data
mohan it's based on historical data as
well as data points which you cannot
even think about at this I've told you
about the procurement fraud right what
historical data would you have if I want
to predict fraud in procurement move on
and I are friends we both meet outside
somewhere and I hand over cash to you
how can you predict that will you and
have historical data for that so
predictive analytics is not all about
you know just having the past data
otherwise will not be able to predict
you not like that
so IDK it's all about I didn't get that
question what are the key skills of a
data scientist so Ravi you need to have
these skills wearing you need to possess
statistical analysis skills forecasting
and data mining how can we predict
something get in there are a lot of
techniques for that you know in this
program with that Eureka is going to
discuss in detail on how to predict
something I'm working as qlikview
developer all right wing it so you're
good at visualization that means pratik
that you need to get in touch with a
Eureka support right on the cost the
example which you were telling when
crying going to happen do you have any
live example that's pretty cool so
suddenly there is a video available on
YouTube just type BBC crying prediction
BBC New York City crime prediction
you'll get to know about that it's a
1-over video there can we use our
language with dotnet platform if you
know darn it right it would be easier
for you are accurate e to actually
understand our language and start
programming in our can you share with us
a URL of the demo alejandro I think you
need to drop in an email to support they
are going to help you with that may has
requested if parative analytics can be
applied to crime crying pattern
detection some of the tasks of data
mining the clustering and classification
circa has to be applied to group the
signal data which clustering technique
is more simple and easy so that it can
be applied and prime lead I not so you
can ok again with respect to clustering
there are several techniques k-means
clustering could be a better option
k-means clustering right if you want to
do clustering techniques it's easier not
that is what i want to say but again it
depends on you
data on your case study on your business
problem you cannot bank on just one you
might tend to use two or three different
clustering techniques can you please
talk a little more about fraud detection
Ganesh fraud detection is immediately
used in your financial services
insurance yeah you can apply that on
your enemies something all right so
ganesha is can you speak you're asking
me to talk a little more on fraud
analytics from fraud detection right so
fraud detection is primarily used in
your financial services insurance
wherein you might apply for a loan until
now you have never default on the loan
but would you default the loan in the
future just because you have not
defaulted the loan until now does not
mean you are not going to default it in
the future so things like that you know
there might be a number of credit card
transactions which might be happening
online right think about one bank how
many online credit card transactions
would happen in a day right you have big
data there and trying to find out the
anomalies in that and trying to predict
which particular credit card transaction
might be fraudulent maybe in the past
you have never purchased anything worth
fifty thousand dollars but all of a
sudden there is a transaction on your
car which is $50,000 that might be a
fraudulent transaction or maybe you have
not done this online transaction or some
kind of transaction using secure network
right things like that maybe always you
have been doing online transactions
using your personal computer so it had
one particular IP address now it's a
different IP attorneys are all the
various parameters which people look
into before predicting any fraud
planning to
are to integrate compute oh you're
trying to integrate to qlikview using
Aria that's a good thing when you it was
really nice similar yayuh I might be it
depends once again but I am going to be
the trainer for the session which is
going to start from Saturday what is
machine learning in which programming
language we should write here you can
use our you can use our yet or oh I'm
available on supported at Eureka right
the moment you wrap an email there I'll
be getting that email for for the
clarification ring what is machine
learning yeah you can use our for
machine learning also machine learning
is all about there is an algorithm which
you build and that algorithm is going to
learn on its own for example if you get
an email to your inbox on some kind of a
promotion and you select that and click
on spam that algorithm has learned that
if these kind of emails reach this
particular mailbox it has to be
automatically sent to spam learning
basically right or a period of time this
becomes more and more accurate rwise
despite on most widely used is our what
would be the role of predictive
analytics in pipeline cohesion
management so you're speaking about oil
and gas here basically girl so that's my
industry or sector that i am i lying to
write oil and gas it depends on the
quantity of the material thickness of
the five what is the oil that is passing
the crude oil with geography in some
locations a crude oil itself might spoil
or a road your pipeline to a great
extent if it is if you're trying to
drill in the sea you need to look into
the salt water camp
decision also right how salty the water
is and things like that and what are the
other minerals or chemicals which would
be there how deep are you going to Rhyl
if it's deep waters the intensity would
be high so there are a lot of other
things so it's it's yeah that is how you
can predict you know by when is a
particular pipeline going to you know
there will be some kind of breakage in
between even before that breakage
probably a person can go do some kind of
welding and do the fixing activity there
what do you mean by dynamic and static
when I say dynamic right dirty nice mean
on the fly now as we speak for example
share market price I want someone to
help me predict the share market price
while the share trading is in progress
from nine to whatever we three or so
when the trading opens and closes within
that time I want someone to predict it
should not be something like I look into
this entire day's data I will sit down
after the trading hours and then I'm
going to predict tomorrow what is going
to happen that is static right that's
static I want on the flight that is
dynamic right how can I join the lease
classes where we Ju need to drop an
email to add Eureka I have our distances
are arpita does there is a better idea
yeah ID you can go with us to do in
statistics what should we know you need
to know hypothesis testing you need to
know regression and all that can you
elaborate when you set Python his yeah
that is what so if I'm building a
prediction model for a client and I do
not want him to come back to me every
every time asking me to predict instead
I can probably provide him a web
application right or think about this on
Twitter people creep tweeting right
recently there was that Maggie incident
so people keep you know posting tweets
tweeting on Twitter when I say dynamic i
see that you analyze that data as in how
the data gets generated and thereby do
the information or triggers to the
management saying that he in the past
five minutes that have been 20 tweets on
Maggie right and it seems that there's a
lot of lead content on that England how
to say it the tool are for web analytics
and mobile analytics you will have to
extract the data put it you're our tool
and then analyzed but our is coming up
with or a studio they've come up with
shiny silver whatever work you do you
can publish them yankoo Coweta has this
question if I want to look into
predictive analytics seriously what
should be my next steps current lament
so I will request you to you know focus
on our along with statistical analysis
forecasting and data mining these three
would be the core for your success how
and what measures the reliability of the
reason for parade so each model that you
are working on has different aspects
right some model might have something
called as a I see some other model might
use into it might look into our square
so it depends on what model that you are
looking into where is a chart showing
great need for predictive analytics
phone booth has a question I didn't get
you raise the charge shrink sorry can
you refreeze that which other tools are
available for predictive analytics you
have stata you have matlab you have sass
IBM spss and all that Minitab what does
the course at at eureka cover with
respect to procure announces a pretty
much whatever i've been seeing are
relevant for your data scientists right
um statistical analysis
it looks into forecasting data mining
and all that of course many other things
in that aditya see is sad my ambien
marketing and I no idea of you know
technology should go for why Java you
are an MBA in Marketing right you should
be into analytics kind of a space not
java right so I will request you to
learn our how does how does our can be
used with our programming language so
output if you know Java you can use Java
code and right in our if you know how to
write in different of the languages you
can use those languages right enough so
that is how there is an integration
right any kind of tracking code is
useful in the studio cracking cold uncle
oh that's if you are speaking about the
case studies have shown right it's based
on the mac ID once you connect to the
Wi-Fi there is a Mac idea sign and your
movement is track using them that is
your tracking ID mark ID basically
difference between data scientist and
data analyst oh there is no big
difference and nowadays they have come
up with this new word called data
scientist right it means the same is it
useful in business analyst courier yes
absolutely about 15 years experience but
now two years break in service imma
bring myself with all articles like my
analytics and all that getting a job
would be a problem for me no Sun no
Santa absolutely no because it's a nice
kill there's a lot of demand don't ever
think that you know it's gonna be
difficult it's going to be pretty easy
the recording will be shared in 24 hours
we need from a direct last all that can
you guide me how do i apply prediction
how machine learning is associated with
predictive analytics joshy machine
learning has two aspects classification
problems and numerical problems if
you're trying to classify such as when
the person leave my organization yes or
no will this customer or switch to a
different window yes or no that is
classification that's machine learning
right in the same machine learning if
you're trying to predict instead of this
classification a number how much salary
can this person draw in the next one
year numerical then it's called as
predictive and these are used in
conjunction they are not used in
isolation forecasting is time series
based if it is not time series based
then oh then you can use something
called as prediction in short in labels
and term sergeant I've understanding of
ebn sequel how easy it would be for me
to another it will be very easy because
our commands also will be kind of sequel
wink it how can we apply this for a
shade market absolutely there's
something called as financial analytics
central murugan using which you can do
so I'm a fraud analyst and I would like
to move into data scientist so what
would be the next step so you need to
unk it learn all these techniques right
once again the statistical part
forecasting part and the data mining
part because for some kind of case
studies for some kind of problems you
end up using statistical analysis for
some other you might end up using the
remaining for some other you might end
up using forecasting so it all depends
so you need to learn all these tools
Your Strengths lines in you know using
the appropriate tool in getting the
solution for you is there any connection
between RN signal our signal or sorry I
have not heard about that accra theme is
there a difference between variable and
observations last ring very
continues did not your observation
concering what you're speaking about
your Ravi what are the tools or
frameworks we should learn to become a
data scientist are in pretty much the
same things which I've been speaking
among our pit has a bunch of questions ?
I don't know what that it other than
k-means clustering the data is not going
to be real data as I'm doing a project
using dummy data if you're using dummy
data probably you can do using dummy
data whatever data you use right
probably that's a mocked-up data that
you're trying to use recording these are
a big part of big data yes yes yes RS
big part of big data I have
understanding of EB it will be very easy
how to start our programming language
you should join one of these programs
which will help you do that is it goes
good for database absolutely Hadopi is
all about getting the data from various
sources structure on structure giving it
a structure from their own starts your
analytics I mean data scientist or
analyst yes after course completion is
there any job assistance I'm not sure
probably you need to drop in any min to
support ya guru sure thank you cannot
help with actually sounds absolutely
actuaries do what they're going to come
up with the model right insurance
policies and things like that yeah
critics pretty much useful there will
you teach her lube also with our
programming there's a different program
called data science i believe which
looks into Hadoop also often
it all depends so we conant on what is
the amount of data that you're getting
on a daily basis on a weekly basis
monthly basis and things like that as a
now you have some data right some
sizable data then you transfer I to
tweak your data but it all depends once
it's not there's no thumb rule as such
are you going to cover all sudden yes
absolutely Fieri what is our stance no
no art doesn't have any abbreviation as
such it's just an alphabet what are the
prettiest to go not nothing if you just
know English language it's efficient
where is predictive announced its needed
in the United States predicting you're
crying buses opening a new store Walmart
says hey help me predict a location
where I need to open a new store for me
to be profitable things like that yeah
there's a lot of difference audit here
between Hadoop NR Hadoop is all about in
Hadoop you cannot do all these
statistical things which you do in our
building the prediction model cannot be
done another the anchor sorry we do not
have so much time what kind of reports
can be generated from our it's all about
your analytics you know predictive
modeling reports is there any R&amp;amp;D
department in data science field most of
the companies have there are n DS most
of your universities well-known be
schools have our indecently designs or
the chance of games people there are a
lot of opportunities for you to switch
single r is a technology in dotted all
right RS pretty model manage here yeah
alright I didn't hear what single are
small difference between big data and
predictive and it is all about
generating a lot of data which your
traditional tools cannot use cannot
manage such as you cannot analyze data
using Excel if it's big data right so
your traditional tools cannot handle big
data on top of big data or otherwise on
data you use predictive analysis
I two years experience I would say crack
salaries are crazy jetton but I cannot
just you probably i can give you arrange
for two years experience maybe it's
going to range between anywhere between
5 to 10 lakhs per annum so r is just a
programming line it all depends if you
have that skill right people do not
hesitate to pay you until max per annum
so r is just a programming language and
has to be used with some visualization
to absolutely accurate you need to use
some visualization tool but are is also
very good at visualization but you can
also use tableau click view which is
always a stick in which women if I don't
know about Hadoop then we should come up
with ah if I don't know about how dope
then we should come up with data
scientists now you can become a data
scientist without knowing how dope
that's not a requirement at all forever
analytics what reports can we get from
our oh such as you know you can get data
such as which particular page are people
most likely to visit on your website how
much time do this pin on a particular
fish how likely are they to purchase a
product from a particular webpage things
like that can we get a job only learning
are no no no not only learning are you
need to learn all these sickening
statistical forecasting data mining
techniques with our is our yeah there is
something called as you know web
analytics and all that uncle it's going
to be helpful yes absolutely yeah jeton
are sorry
if I have missed out on few of your
questions because there are a lot of
questions coming in right to any other
question friends thank you yes so
probably you'll receive an email from a
new recording so this is how your are is
going to look like jetting they have
business analytics with our advanced
predictive modeling with our and data
science I think these are the three
things which are available during Sri
Hari course contains an oracle team is
going to share with you hey everyone
please fill in the survey after the
webinar right you'll be given a survey
for screen you need to fill that and
within that itself you have a comment
where you can mention what are your
clarifications right probably they're
going to get in touch with you and this
recording is going to be shared with you
are in 24 hours it's my pleasure Sri
Hari yeah we need to call it a detail
but the coding is damn easy don't worry
about that it's extremely easy don't get
bogged down by looking at the code that
i'm showing you it's very easy thank you
thank you everyone big data has to be
processed by something like a dog before
our can absolutely gotta duck written
that's right spark has Mlle yeah Ganesh
what fact is exactly the first Hadoop
inner how do p is all about
assessing the data big data are is all
about building prediction models on top
of the process data seventh can we use
it for printing analysis which one spark
Sparky as you can use that it's a new
thing which is coming up so many tools
available for analytics which one to
learn are our only are jetting it's
gonna rule the world are no no you will
be getting the feedback screen once you
leave the session aankh it so it would
take I would say two months or so it all
depends on your dedication once again I
would say two months should be good
enough yeah if you start
from the scratch I would see soon all
right thank you so much friends I'm
going to stop the session now cheers and
have a good day hi pigma hold so many
year for that's all for a Hadoop right
not for data scientists that's all about
big data processing that and all know
there is no globally recognized
institute for our can you please these
are things to learn to become a data
scientist i would say statistical
analysis hypothesis regression
techniques and your data mining
supervised unsupervised forecasting and
visualization well this all day i can
extract how can you uncle you can
extract but can you do analytics on top
of that when i see analytics prediction
alright friends I need to drop off now
here's their real-life projects which
will be given so oddity of the things
that I've told statistical analysis data
mining forecasting in olin all right I
think you can approach or fill in your
survey and then they're going to let you
know that all right friends goodnight or
good day based on the location that you
are in all the best for your careers in
data scientist thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
