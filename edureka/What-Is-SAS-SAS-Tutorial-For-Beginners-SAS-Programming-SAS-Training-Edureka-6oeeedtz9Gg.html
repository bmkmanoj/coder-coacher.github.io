Rica and today I am going to talk about
sass sass is one of the prominent tools
in the analytical market it is a
software suit with various analytical
and graphical capabilities but before we
get started with sass let's quickly take
a look at today's agenda I would be
starting things off with data analytics
and different data analytical tools the
fact that sass is a data analytical tool
I feel it is important we understand
what is data analytics first once you
understood data analytics then we can
look to access in SAS I will be talking
about why it is needed and what it is I
would discuss Asus framework once we are
done with this then I would get into the
programming part I would introduce you
to status programming concepts and I
would give you few examples so you
understand the programming part better
and finally I would finish things off
with SAS applications so this is our
today's agenda let us get started with
the first topic of discussion that is
data analytics but this term has been
telling the market for quite a while now
many businesses and individuals use it
and using data analytics there's all
different kinds of problems but still
people and businesses have this question
as in why and analytics why is it so
popular why do so many people and
businesses use it what kind of problems
do they saw using data analytics well to
answer these questions let us consider
these three points what data analytics
does is it helps you achieve these three
goals that is Cost Reduction better
decision-making and improved services
let me give you an example Reliance
telecom services in India launched a new
SIM card called as Reliance you what
this did is they gave away some free
internet services and calling services
to people for six months now this
resulted in lot of people switching from
the existing networks to reliance and
this was a great boon for Reliance now
how did they do it they use data
analytics using data analytics they
crunch the existing data they had they
found out patterns that is what is
required in the current market and
accordingly they took decisions these
decisions has them save a lot of cost
and it also has them improve their
services now that is what analytics does
now matter what kind of business it is
it helps improve businesses by taking
better decisions by understanding that
data better and finding out patterns
Kandra otherwise so yes that is my
analytics is needed now let us move
further and understand what it is
exactly
data analytics but it is very simple
what data analytics does is it takes in
existing data now it is there's a lot of
digital data but this data cannot be
used for some reasons for many other
reasons actually say for example
businesses have data in different
formats
they have different problem statements
according to his data also varies so
this different data is difficult to
understand
hence it is mass at times are missing
values at times it is not clean there's
so many problems with it
so what these people do is they contact
data analysts or scientists now these
people basically organize the data into
more understandable manner or more
understandable format they store it
properly and then finally they mind it
when I say they mine it they actually
implement various algorithms and those
algorithms help you understand the data
better you can target particular problem
statements and accordingly you can
generate data and try to find out
information that can help you take
better decisions in short we are taking
data converting it into knowledge which
gives you clarity which helps you take
better decisions that surround a
business that is our data analytics is
now that we've taken and look at what
data analytics is let us take a look at
few important tools that are training in
the market now all these tools help you
to data analytics I have mentioned few
popular ones only because there are a
lot of tools but we will be focusing on
few important ones
let me quickly walk you through these
tools what would these tools group say
for example we have R and Python now
these are open source tools these are
statistical programming languages both
other different capabilities and both
are very popular in the market now
available freely so anybody can download
it and start analyzing data then we have
axel if you like the old traditional way
of dealing with spreadsheets you can
always turn to excel it has various
graphical capabilities and statistical
calculation capabilities then you have
other tools like - P these are big data
tools what happens is it helps you deal
with unstructured or structured data no
matter what format it is in it helps you
analyze it summarize it and find out
patterns out of it it has its own query
language called as high query language
then we have
called as big pic is mostly used for
MapReduce sports writing MapReduce codes
that is what it is very famous for now I
won't get into the details as in what
MapReduce code is in simple words what
it does is it helps you form a template
I would say using that template you can
crunch data or you can divide data into
smaller parts and then process it to
make sense out of it so that was about
quick we have a patches pack which is
another open source tool if you are
looking for parallel computation this is
one of the best things you can use it
has high parallel computation
capabilities
it is highly fault tolerant and again
it's available freely so anybody can
download it and use it all in on a great
tool but then we come back to sass again
now all these qualities which you talked
about almost everything can be taken
care by sex yes it is a proprietary tool
and companies have to pay a lot of money
to get sass into the system but yeah it
has so many good capabilities that makes
it stand out or stand ahead of all the
other tools I just talked about let us
try and understand few of these
capabilities with sass has or why it
stands out either of the other tools
wise as well have shot it on few
important qualities as in why SAS is so
good the many other qualities as well
but I thought these were a few important
ones
say for example ease of learning now SAS
is very easy to learn it is very SQL
like and anybody who has knowledge of
SQL can easy duplicate or start learning
or understanding it it's not that if you
do not know SQL you cannot learn it you
can still learn it it is very easy to
learn but SQL does help the many
components which just help you
drag-and-drop components so that way it
helps you to minimize your work you
don't have to worry about the coding
package either you can just pick up the
components you need and you use them
directly so yes it's very easy to learn
let me give an example an analogy if you
compare two operating systems say Linux
and Windows and both are great and they
have the difference can followers but if
you look at its doer or ease of using I
would say that Windows beats Linux
because it is very easy to use as far as
the interface is concerned similarly
when it comes to programming SAS use
other tools far behind it is way better
or easy to learn as compared to R and
Python
so that is one quality the other one is
graphical capabilities now if you are
analyzing data or you're dealing in data
analytics it is very important to your
tool has good graphical capabilities
because there's so much visualization
and understanding of data so it is
important that your tool uses these
facilities where you can take a look at
data you can visualize it and SAS does
exactly that it has a component called
as SAS garage if combined with base SAS
component it just does wonders the next
point is advancement in tools now yes
SAS has been there in market for more
than 50 years so it follows a structure
no matter what kind of change comes in
the market say for example there has to
be some advancement in the existing tool
it takes time because the strong
procedure is follow but when those
changes are made they are very much up
to the market and they beat almost every
tool when these changes are incorporated
so yes again great advancement in tools
and finally the job scenario now what
happens is people normally turn to SAS
so they can get good jobs and they are
not disappointed most of the times there
is a simple SAS holds 70% of analytical
job market now that is used by huge
margin the second competitor sasses are
with is some 15% in the market and which
is way less than 70% with SAS has so
it's clear-cut doesn't these are the
qualities which makes SAS stand out the
other qualities as a say for example SAS
is a great reporting tool or an ETL tool
when it comes to data warehousing you
can do so many things using SAS you can
extract it can transform you can load
your data the way you want to you can
manage it in different ways so there are
other capabilities which I haven't
talked about but all these capabilities
makes SAS very good too this is about
why SAS let us try and understand what
it is exactly well to start with it
stands for statistical analytics system
as the name suggests it is used for
analytics or that is what it was
designed for other many people who don't
even use it for analytics they do
various other things using SAS but that
is one of the prominent features with
SAS as it is one of the best tools for
analytics so yes
statistical analytical tool it has its
database management capabilities or data
management capabilities I talked about
it being a great ETL tool it has various
expression transformation capabilities
as well and it's data management
capabilities also make it very easy to
use none it is also great programming
language as it is the fourth-generation
language if I am NOT wrong SAS with the
only analytical tool which is a
fourth-generation programming language
for people who do not know what fourth
generation programming languages it is
nothing too difficult or different to
understand in simple words these
languages or these applications are
designed to meet the particular goal say
for example if I have to develop a
commercial software I can use SAS I can
use some component of some application
of SAS and I can develop that commercial
to which I'm planning to develop and
since I am using SAS what I am doing is
I am using only those features that are
required for developing that commercial
group so it is more focused on the
technology or the stuff that is to be
developed what this does is it helps
reduce costs it helps reduce time and it
also reduces the programming part so
that is where SAS stands up it gives you
almost everything you can do analysis
you can develop applications you can
cater different needs it has its own
data management capabilities all in all
it does almost everything it is a
complete software suit so this was about
what it is let us take a look at Sasha's
framework as in what are the things that
makes us strong or how does it
internally become very strong or what it
does well these four capabilities of SAS
make it a strong contender in the market
one of those is its accessing
capabilities then it's managing
capabilities the weight analyzes the
data and the way it presents it so let
us discuss the first point which is
accessing data as I've already talked
about there's a lot of data in the
market if you take a look at the digital
data that is then the market if you ask
me how much is this data well if I write
down this data in a book and if I stack
these books on top of each other the
stack would be so long or the distance
would be so much
it could actually travel from Sun to
Pluto and come back again
now you can imagine how much is this
data and this data is stored in
different small maps and based on
different businesses the data is handled
differently because it's meant for
different problems so this is where the
businesses face problem when it comes to
accessing this data they want the tools
that would help them access data in any
which way format it isn't that is what
slash lets you do no matter what kind of
format it is in whether it's an Oracle
file whether it's a SAS database file it
is a raw database file or your excel
file it would help you access that data
with ease so that is why it is one of
the important qualities or capabilities
such as the next one is managing data I
have already talked about it being a
great ETL tool and all those things but
yes it still has a lot of other
capabilities it has great management
capabilities it can help you subset data
it can have to merge it it can help you
create new variables claim and validate
data now you might say that many other
tools also as we do this how is SAS
different
SAS is different with the ease with
which you can do these things it is very
easy to implement all these things in
selves you have well-defined libraries
and procedures which make programming
very very easy and doing these things
has in subsetting data and creating
variables are just one step processes
you can implement complex algorithms by
the single line of code that is how easy
it is to take data and manage it and
store it properly the next point is
analyze our analysis now yes SAS is a
great statistical tool it is a cold
stand within the market to start with
the reason is you can do so many things
as far as statistics or analysis is
concerned whether you're talking about
basic problems dealing with frequency
central tendencies that is mean
calculation and all those things even
these things can be taken care of
but if you are dealing with complex
problems like regression classification
problems decision tree is forecasting
data almost everything can be taken care
by using cells it is one of the best
tools as far as critical research is
concerned and that is why it's very
popular as far as forecasting is
concerned so yes it has great analysis
or
lysing capabilities as well and the
final point is presenting data now it
becomes very important that you are able
to present at the Italian if you ask a
data scientist where does he put in most
of his energy he would say the most
difficult part which we start with this
organizing data seventy percent of the
effort is put into it remaining thirty
percent is distributed amongst other
things now out of the seventy percent
most of the time again is spent in
visualizing data so if you can represent
data in a good manner it becomes easier
to organize it and once you are done
with this 70 percent of the processing
the other 30 percent is given to
analyzing data and finally presenting it
to the business people now this is the
toughest problem people have yes as data
scientists we do understand data but
would the data be understood or would
the problem definition be understood by
the business people now that is a
different problem so whatever these
people understand it needs to be
communicated to the business people and
that isn't there is a large gap between
these two cases so it becomes very
important that your tool is able to
present the data in good manner because
this forms the bridge between the gap
that is dead
and facile should be exactly that it has
great presentation capabilities you can
create any kinds of reports you can
generate lists report summary reports I
talked about its graphical capabilities
you can even print reports now while
programming we would be using
sasses University Edition I've used this
tool for quite a while now and this is
one of the easiest tools when it comes
to giving outputs or printing data so
all these capabilities make SAS a great
presentation tool as well and all the
capabilities which I talked in last five
minutes these form the SAS code or its
framework I hope you understood this so
this was about the sacis concepts and
analytics which we just talked about let
us get into something more robust now
the SAS programming part so what I would
be doing now is I would be introducing
you to the SAS programming concepts and
parallely i would also be walking you
through with the code cells and how to
implement those codes now to do that I
have used an environment called as SAS
University Edition it is a double
sacis website you can download it and
you can install it if you need any
installation guidance you can go through
my block a given its link below the
video or above the comment section you
can refer that link and you can install
this environment and you can start using
it if you already have some interface or
environment you can just follow the
commands of the code which I'm going to
do now so let us get started with the
first topic that is a SAS programming
process it is a very basic thing I
believe most of you know it already what
we do in SAS has we first define a
problem statement we write a code we run
it and if there any errors we debug the
code or modify it according to any
andrey implement it if we get our
desired result or whatever it is from
now on we are going to focus more on
this part this is where we are going to
do the work of a talking that is writing
a SAS program so let us try and
understand SAS is programming structure
first when the programming structure of
SAS is divided into two building blocks
data steps and your proc steps data
steps help you create data or data sets
you can add data to the existing data
set you can compute values of variables
you can manage data say for example you
have to do operations like sub sitting
or merging these can be done using your
data steps now once you have the data
you need to process it and to process it
you use your other building block that
is proc steps also known as the
procedure steps now you have to process
data in any way that can be taken care
by using your proc steps you can print
your data your xx outputs you can
analyze data the way you want to you can
create reports you can do various
visualization or graphical operations
using your proc steps so when it comes
to creating data your data steps and
when it comes to processing it your proc
steps this is what forms the core of SAS
program every program would have a data
step or a proc step or boots so this was
about the programming structure now let
us take a look at SAS as data and data
types which it uses well data in SAS is
dealt in tabular form your variables
would always occupy your column space
and observations would take your row
space for example name your ID or
whatever it is these variables they
would line the column space and their
subsequent values depending upon the
records would line your observation
earlier in your row space base 2 so this
is how the data looks if you are talking
about the data types it has two data
types your numeric data type in the
character in your data type the numeric
data type will have all the numbers and
everything other than that would fall
under your characters so what is that
data that is not understood or not
classified by SAS under these two
categories
how does SAS hand then it will to handle
that kind of data says uses two concepts
called as in format and format I would
be talking about these things but and I
would also be talking about one more
thing called as SAS date but I want to
do it while doing the program so that
you understand it better so let us do
one thing let us switch to our
environment or the interface and start
coding first so we can get to this part
and this is sacis University Edition
this is how it looks and it is very easy
to use interface for your base SAS
coding almost all the code that is in
basis everything can be done using your
university edition let me just tell you
what all it does now this is your code
window you can write your codes here and
you can run here and here you have this
log window where you get all the
warnings errors and notes the result
winter weather result is displayed now
you have these icons these are used to
display your data you get a file from as
an output say for example I want to
download an HTML file I can use this
icon this is for the PDF file Word or
RTF file I can plainly download it in
whatever format it is already there
using this thing I can print it I can
minimize maximize it so it's an easy to
use interface everything is available
all you have to do is type your code and
run it so let us create a dataset I
would be using a data step let me tell
you one more important thing SAS is not
case-sensitive you can enter data in any
case upper or lower but I would suggest
you follow some standard procedure
because it would be easier for you to
see and understand your quotes when you
written lend your course in future the
more organized it is more easier it is
for you to understand so let us get back
and create a dataset I will be creating
a dataset called as employee info
I would be giving it input values say
for example three variables my first
variable is imply underscore ID it's a
number so I do not have to worry about
it next one is my character variable so
if you are creating a character variable
you have to make sure that the variable
in follows a dollar sign which indicates
that it's a character variable and my
third variable again would be a
character variable and it would be
called as vertical so yes I close it
with semicolon and I give it some data
lines as input say for example I am
giving it five values about five
employees but the verticals they work on
so these are the four people who are
working on some particular technology
given some random value state it's not
very important I just want a data set
with five values so not five I can have
any values but for the safer side I've
created five values let us say ot she
works on JavaScript and finally I have
proteges too many hours on it she is
working on maybe data science or
something like that say Python yes so I
close this with a semicolon and I run it
to see what the data looks like now you
have to select the code and you have to
click on this icon where a little guy is
reading you can always click on it and
run the code
and this is how the output would look
now this was about creating a data set
I used a data step I created a data set
called as employee with three variables
and five values let us use a proc step
and try to print this data so I would be
using a procedure called as proc print I
would be giving it the data set which we
just created and then I would run it
again
now the data is more visible or it is
more in printable format now what I've
done is I've just used a procedure
called as print and it gives me the data
that can be printed so yeah so this was
a simple code which help you use a data
set or help you use your data step and
create a dataset and we use the simple
procedure to print it or to display the
data now let us go further and
understand few other concepts for that I
would be needing a variable say called
as do J it is date of joining D okay now
that we've created the variable let us
give these people some data joining say
19 0 1 2 0 1 4 are you she joined say
2001 before hey month ROM was the first
to join the office say that ish is
fairly experienced as well say 2000
level and let us assume that Ruth Suja
is fairly new to the office and she has
turned in recently so I've created a
data set and have given a new variable
called as DOJ and have given few values
so let us try and print these values and
see how the data looks or how the values
look if you take a look let use a column
it's empty it just has dots or dashes in
it now why did that happen why did not
read the date which I gave it I've
mentioned it already as if there is some
data which is not understood by SAS as
an it is not classified into numbers or
characters SAS won't be able to read it
so how this has deal with this kind of
data will to handle this kind of data
SAS uses a concept called as informant
let us try and take a look at it first
yeah what informant does is it tells SAS
how to read a variable depending upon
the kind of format or in format you want
SAS to read the day time it has three
types character numeric and data now the
syntax is given here a character in
format is nothing but dollar which tells
that the variable is character and the
blue dot which indicates the width or
the length of your word
is to be entered for numeric you have WT
urw indicates the number of integers
that are there in your number and
thought the indicates the number of
integers after the decimal and it has a
fairly standard format that is mmddyy w
dot but a blue dot indicates the number
of letters or integers or symbols
whatever you are using in the format let
us go back to a problem and see what we
just did or can we do it using this
informat thing now my dataset is having
a problem where do J is not visible to
me so what I'll do is I'll tell SAS how
to read aloud and informat
the name of the variable and DD mm YY 10
dot because I have say eight numbers and
two slash signs that is two forward
slashes so let us try and execute this
code now we should have the date
okay wait we still don't have the dates
we have some random numbers now why is
that
to understand this you need to
understand Sasa's date concept dates in
SAS are dealt with differently and there
was a saturate counter which was started
on first of January 1960 so the dates
are the days that represent the date on
this day that equivalent to zero the
dates that are before this number those
would be in - values say first of
January 1959 is - 365 that is 365 days
less or before this date then you have
January or 1961 which is plus 366 days
and if I were to represent January 1
2003 could look something like 1 PI 7 0
6 so that is what I mean as far as the
date is concerned I've used an informant
and I've given in the dates and it has
displayed these dates in this format
that is the format with SAS understands
because SAS creased dates in these kind
of numbers so that is why we have that
output there where your date looks
something like that or something like
this I should say so what can I do with
that I mean how do i display the dates
now yes my SAS has understood that it is
a date and that is how it should be
wrecked but I also need to display the
dates to do that what we do is we use
the format procedure it is similar to in
format but in format tells you how to
read the data format tells you how to
write it so it also follows the same
syntax and it can deal with same numeric
character and date and time kind of
formats so let us try and do one thing
let us try and implement this in
accordance see if we get the dates out
yeah what I will do is below my informit
I would just add a command say format
name of the variable again the same
syntax
and now I would try and run it and see
whether I have the ditch
there you go you have the dates finally
so that is our format sinan formats -
they help you read and understand data
that is normally not understood by cells
so yeah that is what information formats
were meant for we won't be using
information formats in our future quotes
or the problems which we are going to
deal with but I just wanted you to know
this because it's an important concept
and since sales dates are different I
wanted you to know how to handle these
things so this was about few basics as
in how to create a data step how to
create a proc step how to print the
values how to see the results at all I
just wanted you to get an idea of all
these things I hope you understood that
now I would be getting into something
more detailed or something more related
to statistics is what I should say I
would be talking about the next problem
that is a linear regression so let us go
back and get started with linear
regression for people who are new to
statistics do not worry it's not very
difficult or it is it's not something
that is that would require you a lot of
project let me simplify these things for
you as in what linear regression is
first suppose I have two variables a and
B and I need to find whether there is a
relationship between these two variables
I can do it using linear regression
suppose I have multiple values for which
represent a and multiple values which
present B and I have new value widths
for a I need to predict a corresponding
value that would be in the same block
for my B variable so how do I focus this
value I can do it again using linear
regression let me give you one more
example in the slide you can see that
the first example is income and spending
say for example I have a dataset where I
have few income values and how much
people earn during arena months phase
and I have how much do they spend in the
same time so that is given by the
spending variable so what if I say that
I wanted to find out a relationship
between these two variables
whether the income of a person is
related to his or her spending habits
whether if the income increases does the
spending habits also increase or does
the spending value also increase or vice
versa so to compare these things you use
linear regression you also use linear
regression to prove few facts from say
for example the second example which
says student heighten grades what if I
say that
student grades are related to the
students height you would say that this
makes no sense and yeah absolutely does
not but I need to prove it so I can
prove it using linear regression again
so the linear regression when the
equation looks something like this it
looks like Y is equal to beta 0 plus
beta 1 into X now this beta 1 and beta 0
are coefficients with represent and
intercept and the slope these are
mathematical concepts I won't get into
the details to keep it simple I would
say that slope and intercept help you
establish a relationship between x and y
so here Y is your dependent variable
where Y is dependent on X and your X is
an independent variable so this equation
tells you that x and y are related to
each other and beta0 and beta1 are
somehow affecting it so if i were to
take an example and i were to compare
two variables i would have to consider
two possibilities either y and x are
related or they are not related let us
assume that our first possibility is
that they are not related and let us
call it as beta 0 sorry h0 which is
called as null hypothesis so if Meinl
hypothesis says that x and y are not
related that would be based on beta 1 is
equal to 0 that is what we are claiming
is this value beta 1 is 0 let me tell
you why if beta 1 is 0 then X becomes 0
if this term becomes 0 that means Y is
equal to beta 0 so Y is nothing but a
horizontal line if I plot it on a graph
and its value won't change with a value
of x changes or not because it's not
affecting this equation in any ways so
if beta 1 is equal to 0 then x and y
won't be related let us assume the
second possibility where we have our
alternative hypothesis which is beta 1
is not equal to 0 in that case it would
have some value positive or negative so
when exchanges value of y will also
change with the dip as X exists whether
it's positive or negative so that is why
this beta 1 value is very important and
it actually tells you the relationship
between y and x so let us do one thing
let us switch to a programming mode
again and try to pour this out and see
how the code works exactly what I will
be doing now is I would be
picking up a data set which I've already
created so yes have gone ahead and
created a data set
it is a simple data set what I have done
is I've named it as practice one I have
given it to inputs X and Y and that
given it nine values values for x and y
so what we'll do is we'll take a look at
this data first how it looks
yes we have nine observations with x and
y values with no missing values so what
we'll try and do is we'll try and draw a
regression line out of these values but
before we do that we need to develop a
scatter plot
what scatter plot does is it tells you
as in how the data is scattered whether
it's normally distributed or not and if
it's normally distributed fairly
distributed we can heal it on a draw a
regression line through it so let us
quickly for the formality sake take a
look at a scatter plot how the data
looks for that I would be using another
procedure called as proc SD scatter is
the name of the procedure and again I
would be giving it in the dataset which
is practice one yeah so let us plot x
and y that is done using this command
let us see how the output looks
okay there was a syntax error okay I
made a very simple mistake I've actually
forgotten an equal to sign here yeah so
let us run it now
so this is how the scatterplot looks the
data is fairly distributed and I'm sure
we can the regression line through it
and find out some relationship between
these data points let us try and do it
now that we've drawn a scatterplot
let us try and build a model it is again
done using a proc step the name of the
procedure is reg and I would be again
giving it the data set the data set is
practice 1 and I will model it my
dependent variable is y my independent
variable is X and I would be taking the
confidence interval say 95% which is by
default I would be talking about what
confidence interval is and water does
but let us first build the model and see
how it looks
yeah it takes a while because it's
calculating a lot of values as you can
see this simple one line of code has
given us this much amount of data you
have the fit line you have the residual
plot you have Dez graphs but I'm more
interested in the inaudible which we
have here let me walk you through it
what it is exactly now what we are
trying to do is we are trying to
establish a relationship between x and y
for that we've taken a table which has
nine values now this is what this table
gives me it tells me that the total
number of observations read one line and
the observations that were used is also
nine so item so you might have missing
values so it would tell you that the
observations used with less Y because
there were some missing values the
observations could not be used so this
is what this table tells you the first
table then you have analysis of variance
table now it gives you various values
say for example your sum of squares your
mean square your F statistic your p
value for it now I won't get into the
details as in water B is used for to
simplify things your F test and your T
test these have different purpose for
the multiple regression but since you
are using the simple linear regression
both F test and your t-test would serve
the same purpose now what do these tests
do they try and tell you whether there
is a relationship between your two
variables now how I have talked about
the thing that if beta ones value is
equal to zero then my variables are not
related to each other and while coding I
have used
one more thing or wrecked
one more thing that I would be having a
confidence interval now this CL B it
gives me a confidence interval for my
parameter which I am using right now and
the confidence interval is 95% now let
me tell you what is this 95% confidence
interval first what I am doing is I am
taking a particular set of data okay
what confidence interval tells us is
that my model is 95% confidence or
confident that the data lies in this
range or in this order so whether there
is a relationship between the two or not
so I have this confidence interval which
is 95% and it has predicted parameters
accordingly if you take a look at this
table we have the intercept value and we
also have the slope value and it is in a
range it is in a particular range say
the value might be in between seven
point nine to twelve point four and for
the slope it would be somewhere on minus
1 to minus 0.5 so it is giving me
arrange that bulk of my data it lies in
this range that is it as 95% confident
about it that my data lies in this range
so there is a possibility that this 5%
chance that the data does not lie her it
lies somewhere else so if this case is
through this value that is the p-value
would be above 0.05 I'll tell you why my
confidence interval is 95% so I'm left
with 5% if I divide these two numbers by
hundred I would be getting values like
zero point nine five and 0.05 so for the
first condition to be true that is beta
1 is equal to 0 this value has to be
more than 0.05 so if this value is less
than that value that means my first
assumption that beta 1 is equal to 0 is
wrong so let us take a look at this
value first my value is zero point
ripple 0 9 what does this indicate is my
alpha value is very more than this value
and that my null hypothesis says that x
and y are not related is false my
alternate hypothesis we say that there
is a relationship between the two is
true so yes I know the fact now that
those two variables are related
I have these parameter estimates here
which gives me my intercept value and my
slope value so if I were to go back to
the equation where Y is equal to beta 0
plus beta 1 into X then I would replace
beta0 and beta1 value with these values
and I would form the equation so yes I
have an equation and I also have a
regression line this is how it looks it
gives me a relationship between y and X
now my value of Y would decrease
gradually in this reason for it
the slope value here is negative hence
the value of x as the value of x changes
the value of y also changes and it goes
down a little that is why there is this
downward graph here and these values are
not on the line there's a reason for it
this is the closest approximation which
tells you that this is how the data is
related so the little error that is
there separates these points from this
line and that error can be calculated by
this distance between the line and the
point so yes we have a regression fit
and it says that there's a relationship
between x and y now what if I tell you
that I had one more record where I had a
value of x and I wanted to predict the
value of y based on the model which
output could we do it yes definitely we
could do it so let us go back and try
and do that now what I will be doing is
I'll be creating one more data set let
me call it say practice - I would go
create data lines yeah
input would be x and y again so let us
assume that my x value is eight point
five and I do not have a Y value so I
say put a dot here maybe and I end it
let me just print these values by the
prop c'mon
there is a small error that is because I
haven't entered this command here now
let us do it
yeah but we are still not able to
display the values because you do not
end these lines with semicolons you have
to follow a pattern where you end it
after the value which you've given so
now the data would be visible more
clearly say this way yes so you have a
new data set or a new data value now I
need to add it to my existing data set
which I already have so what I will do
is I will go back I'll type a data set
because that is what you use to manage
your data I would be wanting the value
in my previous data set so I would be
giving its name first I would be ending
this so-called line then I would use a
command called as set and in set the
data set where I want that value to be
its name and the data set from which I
want its value that data sets name that
is to be entered let us print this
result as well
sooner on it
yeah so I've added a new value 8.5 and I
need to print the value for y so how do
I do it what I'll do is I'll run a
regression model on the data set which
I've just updated and I would try and
print the value so I'll use the Reg
function again I would give it to the
data
I would build a model for it by seeing Y
is equal to X and this time I would be
using CLI because I want confidence
interval for the records I've entered
and not the parameters so this is what I
would be doing and then I would be
running the model on it let us see how
the result looks
and there you go you have all the
statistics again but if you've noticed
the change here we have ten observations
and one has missing value the one which
we are trying to predict we have
previous turistic cells in the p-value
for TNF tests but we are more interested
in the prediction part right now so let
us quickly go to the back table we have
output statistics here now you can see
that we've calculated a 95% confidence
interval for all the variables but we
are more interested in this value the
missing value of dependent variable that
is your Y value now we have our x value
which is 8.5 for it and we also have the
model that is which we built based on
the nine values which we had so based on
that model and the value for the X which
is eight point five my model is 95%
confident that value of y should be in
the range of minus one point three seven
two five point three seven so yes using
linear regression in SAS what we have
done is we predicted the value of y here
and that is what our aim was so this was
a very basic problem but I hope you
grasp few things as in how to do basic
linear regression operations and house
has works and the coding part works so
this was for the programming concept and
I'd be ending the programming part here
and I will be moving to the next part of
the session that is SAS applications
ITSO SAS has quite a few applications
I've mentioned few here I will be
talking about stock prediction now stock
prediction is something that is very
time dependent as in the values or the
stock prices those vary from time to
time and to deal with these kinds of
problems we use time series and that can
be done in SAS by using a component
called as SAS CTS which is very useful
for time series analysis now using that
you can predict stock values or resin
you can predict how a particular stock
is going to behave in near future so yes
SAS does help in stock prediction the
next point is creating safe drugs SAS is
one of the important tools when it comes
to medical analytics it has various
applications when it comes to
prescription drug or prescribing drugs I
should say to different customers those
problems can be solved by using the SAS
it recently helped
detect cancer or solve cancer problems
using analysis now that was an
achievement so yes it has a great market
as far as dealing with drug problems or
creating safe drugs is concerned or safe
medicines is concerned then fighting
fraud it is VC is one of the important
clients as far as fraud detection is
concerned and what they do is they use
the SAS technology to develop the
real-time applications like detecting
fraud in real-time when it comes to
dealing with credit card fraud or debit
card fraud and they actually plan to
take this technology further and they're
still collaborated with SAS and they're
working on those projects right now so
yes as does help fight fraud as well
then optimizing workflow now this is a
very important problem normally most of
the businesses have this problem they
have a lot of traffic and they have to
manage the traffic or have to manage
their workflows now optimizing these
workflows becomes very difficult and as
SAS is a fourth-generation programming
language it can be built in such a way
or used in such a way that it can solve
these problems which are specific to
organizations and it helps optimize
various workflows so that is one of the
applications so this was about SAS
applications and this was the final
topic of today's session I hope you
understood whatever I talked about
Tilton let me just quickly walk you
through as in what all we've talked
today we started things off with data
analytics as in white is needed and what
it is let me discuss few data analytical
tools then we got into SAS as in why it
is needed what it is and we discussed
its framework as well I introduced you
to few SAS programming concepts like the
basic building structure or the building
blocks of SAS is programming I also
talked about how data is handled what
are the different formats of data and
how formats in formats and SAS dates
work then we got into statistics and we
took a look at a simple statistical
procedure called as a linear equation
and we tried and predicted a value based
on the model distributed and finally we
talked about SAS applications so this
was about SAS and I hope that you've
understood whatever I talked about but
if you still have any doubts you can
pose those questions in the comment
section below and I promise you that I
would be getting back on those
questions with my answers as soon as
possible so and if you are interested in
knowing more about search you can always
turn to a website that is at Eureka and
you can take a look at our SAS training
programs I am sure that would help you
get in-depth knowledge about SAS and
help you pursue your career if you are
interested in pursuing a career in SAS
so that was in my part or that is
something I wanted to talk about I hope
