in the rest of this chapter we're gonna
talk about some of the library functions
that are available to make your job
easier while writing a C program the
first thing we're going to talk about is
string functions the multiple string
functions the help you perform basic
operations such as copying strings
concatenating two strings comparing two
strings etc but before we talk about
these functions the first question is
why do we need special functions to
perform these operations we don't have
special functions to copy an integer
into another integer so for Strings why
do we need this
let's see why first let's look at what
happens then we have an integer so let's
say I say int a some main memory so
let's see the memory just allocate 4
bytes call it a and if it's a int a
equal 25 puts the number 25 here now if
I say int B equal to a it allocates
space for B and copies
number 25 here now I can do anything I
want to do with B I can say B plus plus
it makes this 26 this still remains 25
because a is not changing now let's see
what happens with strings we know it's
string they're nothing but character
pointers there is no such thing as a
string datatype
so when we declare cast our str equal to
hello what really happens is in memory
first you can allocate space for hello
and a backslash 0 so that's 1 2 3 4 5
and 6 so you need space for 6 bytes
and you're gonna store hello and the
final backslash zero now let's say this
have a starting address 2004 also for
the variable STR now you need allocate
four bytes because they are the pointer
so for STR you're gonna allocate four
bytes and as J as a pointer is pointing
to the address of the string they're
starting at a listing is 2000 for the
STR has 2004 so you declare a single
string and this white looks like in
memory now let's say I have another
string I say cast are str two equal to
str those are allowed now what happens
he's gonna look at space for STR two so
let's say allocate space here for bytes
we Christ ER 2 is a point of STR - I say
STR 2 equal to STR what is STR STR is
2004 so I'm gonna copy 2004 now if you
realize both STR and str2 are pointing
to the same string I have not made a
copy of the string by saying STR 2 equal
to STR
I haven't made a copy of the string
largest copied the address then case of
integers if you noticed we make no copy
of the number itself so it's simple
equal to operations are available or
even things like less than greater than
you're only going to compare if I
compare STR is less than STR - I'm
comparing the addresses here they both
actually equal doesn't matter but let's
say I have two copies of the string and
I want to compare the two of them how do
I compare I can't check if STR is equal
to equal to STR - because all I'll be
doing is comparing the addresses but for
all you know STR could be pointing to a
different string str2 could be pointing
to a different string and the contents
in those addresses the strings could
actually be equal
you could actually have str2 pointing -
hello - so in so saying STR - equal to
STR I can say STR - equal to hello what
will happen in this case is do you
allocate again space for hello you'll
store hello here and let's say this
address is five thousand four we store
the number five thousand four here now
if I compare if STR is equal to equal to
STR - it will be false because STR is
2004 STR - is five thousand four
this is gonna compare the addresses it
will say it's not equal whereas the
strings are actually exactly the same so
the handles these kind of scenarios
where you want to actually make a copy
of the string or compare the strings
themselves you need special functions
which of course you can write but see
library already has these functions you
have to include something called string
dot H and you have a list of functions
which help you perform these tasks so
here a list of some of those functions
here's something called STR cat helps
you concatenate two strings so the
string passed as SRC or source this
concatenated to the end of the
destination string so similar to STR cat
yo STR n cat in that case you pass a
third argument called int n what happens
is n characters from the source string
are concatenated to the end of the
destination string now if you want to
compare two strings like I'd mentioned
you pass the two strings to strcmp that
will return 0 if both the strings are
equal if STR 1 is smaller than STR -
then will return a negative number and
the vesti R 1 is greater than STR - then
return a positive number
similar to strcmp strncpy compare only
the first n characters then like I said
equal to does not actually make a copy
of the string so if you want to make a
copy of the string you are strcpy which
copies the source string to the
destination string and similarly you
have strncpy which copies just n
characters from this
string to the destination string and
finally this you've used which is STR
Len to find the length of the string STR
the neon legal STR CHR which basically
searches for the character see in your
string see in your string STR and
returns a pointer to the first
occurrence of the character see in STR
similarly I've STR our CHR which does
the reverse search which means it
searches for this character see in your
string STR where it goes in the reverse
order which means it will point to the
last appearance of the character see in
the string STR so these are various
string functions that you have in string
dot H</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
