to this blockchain 1:01 session now
without wasting any time let's move
forward and look at today's agenda the
first thing that we'll be discussing is
what exactly is blockchain
because it's essential that you
understand what blockchain is to
appreciate blockchain act we're not from
there we'll talk about the various
concepts of blockchain which make it
highly popular and one of the most
trendy technologies in today's market
after I will talk about hyper ledger
fabric which again is a derivative of
blockchain but is one of the most
popularly growing technology as far
today we'll see how happy little fabric
has revolutionized the industry then we
will talk about blockchain use cases how
it's being used in different domains as
well as we will see what blockchain has
revolutionized in different industries
and how it is changing the convention
system finally we'll also be working on
a demo involving smart contracts where
I'll help you understand how to create a
smart contract so I hope you guys are
clear great so all of you seem to be
clear so let's not waste any time let's
move forward to the first topic that is
what exactly is blocked cheap now
blockchain is the cool technology that
bought in the most popular
cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin system
to put it quite simply blocked in what
in a platform where in people could
exchange this cryptocurrencies as such
now as the name says a blockchain
basically is a change from from
different blocks but you might be
wondering what exactly is present inside
this block now to give you a simple
understanding this block contains the
details of all the transactions that
have been using bitcoins so you combine
all these transactions and then store it
into a block which then gets linked
corresponding at every given fixed do-it
interval of time there is a new block
create the present scenario helps you
create a new block somewhere in 15 to 20
minutes but again this is something that
keeps very ating with respect to that
now the blockchain system in itself is
not present at one single position it's
distributed across a peer-to-peer
network and anyone who wishes to join
this network is free to do that so what
you're doing by joining the blockchain
network is that you're downloading the
complete ledger of transactions that
have happened on the blockchain system
now
don't worry when I say incomplete used
of ledges which have transaction details
because all the data present here is
completely encrypted so your personal
reader does not get affected here now
how that happens we'll be learning up in
the upcoming slides so let's move
forward and talk about the various
features of blockchain so the first cool
feature of blockchains is that it uses a
distributed public ledger and what we
mean by distributed public ledger is
that all the transactions that happen on
the blockchain systems are stored on a
ledger and this ledger is completely
public as well as mr. buted across the
whole network but hold on you don't have
to worry yet all the data that is
present in this ledger is this
transaction tickets that is the
transaction ID number but trust me even
if you do take the transaction IDs from
here you cannot hack into anyone's
account and steal their balance so it
also ensures that you're completely
anonymous and this is achieved using the
hash to encryption that is part of a
blockchain feature now the hash
encryption is a unidirectional
encryption method when you feed the
input and the output is completely
unique so from this output you cannot
guess what exactly was the input as well
so this in turn makes it completely
secure apart from that there is a
concept known as proof of work a proof
of work basically is used as a means to
validate the new blocks that get created
and finally there are some incentives
provided to those who will create the
new block aspect so let's deep dive into
each one of them and understand that in
what it now as I had mentioned here we
use a distributed ledger what I mean by
distributed ledger is that everyone
who's part of the system gets a copy of
the latest and there is no central
ledger system existing it's because it's
distributed to across anyone who's part
of the blockchain system now you might
be wondering if you have a copy to the
ledger can you not just modify the
ledger and make profit out of it
definitely not this is where the
peer-to-peer network of blockchain
system comes in to have because what
happens is even if you try to manipulate
a ledger it is already reflected in your
lit when you try to send across to
everyone that this are the transactions
that have happened in the ledger then
what happens is since the majority of
the people that are part of this crew
the copy of the original ledger you
create transactions or the invalid
transactions get rejected and this
completely ensures that no feed
transactions or invalid transactions are
part of the blockchain system as well
and since it is spread across everyone
who's part of the blockchain system so
even if you lose your copy of the ledger
you can always download it from one of
the other people holding onto the ledger
so two blockchain system will help you
to that with our about now I'm sure you
might be wondering even if I get the
details of transaction would it not be
possible to hack their account from all
the information present the answer is no
because firstly the ledger contains
details of only the transaction the
amount of transaction being happening as
well as the timestamp when the
transaction has initiated not even the
transaction ID that is part of the
ledger is completely encrypted and this
encrypted value actually is a hashed
output well so let's talk about the
hashed value next now to give you a
better understanding of how the hash
function works let's take an example
here let's say I'm going to give hello
world as an input to the hash ranch it
is going to give me a corresponding
output now looking at this output I'm
quite sure none of you can guess that
hello world was deep and this algorithm
is so complex that even if you make a
slight change with respect to the input
the output value completely changes let
me show you that with this now here what
I'm doing this along with my hello world
I'm just putting an exclamation mark but
when you look at the output it is
totally different from our previous
output so here the hash value has
completely changed this in turn ensures
that the output value is completely safe
and secure and it's just a
unidirectional encryption that keeps
happen so this way what happens is no
one can actually find out the details
that is being passed through the hashing
algorithm so a decryption cannot happen
in this case similarly what I will do is
I just change the capital H and capital
W to small hatch and small W that I'm
what happens is it again completely
changes with respect to the same so as I
had mentioned it's not easy for you to
just look at the output value and decide
what the input value is now in the
blockchain system we use a sha-256
encryption
and technology and unlike most other
encryption algorithms a hash function
cannot be decrypted that is from the
output you cannot decrypt the input now
imagine all your details personal
details would be hashed then wouldn't
you feel secure at least 111 definitely
even I would feel that but apart from
that you also use a group of
incompletion technologies like the
public key private key encryption system
on these hash values as well so that
adds on another layer of security as
well to the block chain details so even
if someone tries a brute force approach
to guess all the values he will be able
to encrypt the data that is being
encrypted with the public key of the
private key so he may be able to get the
hash value which I have encrypted using
my public key or private key but at the
same time he cannot decrypt it any
further because this is the Union
directional hash function then he has to
try out every possible value that is
there out there to get the correct
answer so you can see here it occupies
more than 53 places so that's a huge
number where you need to guess all the
possible inputs to just get the output
so if the counterfeit e again increases
as a whole know you might be still
wondering ok I have understood how the
distributed ledger works I understood
how the data present in this ledger is
secure as well but then who adds goes
data to the block or who creates the new
block for the blockchain system that is
the job of a Bitcoin Mike now how does
he do that is basically he solves a
mathematical complex busts now to give
you a better understanding of what
exactly is presented on block there are
mainly three major things that are part
of a block the first part is the hash of
the previous value that is the previous
block that was present you're going to
take the hash address of that that has
to be included into the present block
this is mainly to ensure that we have a
chain of blocks and that's exactly where
the name came in the blockchain system
apart from that it also has block data
now block data has the details with
respect to all the transactions that
have happened in the interval when the
last block was added so as I had
mentioned earlier the interval between
the creation of blocks is somewhere
between 15 to 20 minutes so all the
transactions that
we taken place in that timeframe and
have been verified by the minor can be
added to this flow so again you use a
hashing algorithm here as well so this
again ensures that no one can and
decrypt your it finally comes the
concept of knots this is the part which
makes blockchain system interesting okay
now these people known as - mainly due
to major task one is that we verify all
the transactions that are part of the
transaction put now there are millions
of transactions that come in every
instant on the blockchain transaction
Boop so they pick up a few of them and
they start verify now there's always the
case where someone is trying to send
bitcoins when they don't have the
sufficient ballots now this needs to be
identified and rejected and that exactly
is what a blockchain miner would we do
it he'd reject all these fake
transactions and ensure only the valid
transactions are part of the block ship
apart from doing this he'll also start
building the new block now why he's
building a new block he needs to compute
something known as being not now the
nonce basically is a value that you need
to try to achieve by using a hit and
trial method basically you need to just
guess the value of not now hold on it's
not as simple as this think because even
the present scenario in the year 2016
you have to compute close to twenty
quadrillion values of north before you
got the final solution now once you get
the correct value of not now it's always
predefined what the value of non should
be for every block so once you've
successfully kissed it so you can tell
everyone and successfully computed the
value of nonce and my blog is complete
so I'm adding it to the block chip now
this value of nonce in itself is a
proof-of-work this means that you have
invested your resource and you are
completely correct with respect to the
values present in the project because
automatically when you are creating a
block all we valid transactions are
added to it so thereby all the
transactions present in this block also
are valid as such so it basically is a
challenge that you need to overcome
where you need to compute a specific
value so to guess get now you might be
wondering why would anyone actually
waste their time solving this
article passes that is because they get
a specific insect now every miner who
validates a block that is who creates a
block which goes on to become a part of
the blockchain system get a reward of
12.5 bit cards now 12.5 bitcoins is not
a small amount
given today's market value of Bitcoin
being close to $3,500 a bit card it will
be close to forty four thousand dollars
that you make from mining a new block
magic $44,000 is a very huge amount but
the problem is that no individual today
can create a block by himself or herself
as such because the resource needed to
compute this file as I had mentioned you
need to try out at least twenty
quadrillion values now imagine guessing
twenty quadrillion values and that too
in a time frame of this ten or fifteen
bit now this is why what happens today
is that - come together and form
something known as a pool now food
basically is same as the groups that we
form here what happens is that they
share the responsibility of finding the
values and then what happens is based on
the resource that each one has
contributed the reward gets distributed
occurring sounds interesting right great
now one thing you need to understand is
that the generation of bitcoins happens
only in this way that is only by
creating new blocks can you have your
bitcoins come into the system okay
because there is no other way where you
can create bit cuts the bitcoins are
only provided as rewards for mining and
there can be only 21 million bitcoins in
the world this is mainly because the
maximum base that Bitcoin values can
take and it is believed that given the
present scenario the last bit point is
going to be buying by 21:40 so if you
are looking to move into this market now
would be a really good time seeing as to
how the Bitcoin market is growing as
well so I know the guys have got quite
an insight into the blocks in sister and
the Bitcoin system as well so any doubts
video
great moonflower let's talk about the
hyper laser fabric the pipe ology
project is managed by the Linux
Foundation and is something like a
cross-platform
collaboration approach here you have
organizations working in different
domains coming together and working on
the same ground now the hyper ledger is
one of the most trending technologies
today so if you are looking to go into
the Bitcoin and blockchain term it then
hyper laser is something that I would
definitely recommend that you look into
now the reason why it is being so
popular is because the hyper laser
project helps provide people with
private as well as public blockchain for
their needs and requires basically you
don't need to worry about setting up to
block it hyper laser would help you do
that as well thereby reducing the effort
that you need to put it as well as the
complexity of bringing people on board
and giving them the resource to set up
the block once you've given them your
requirements they will help you in
creating a private lock chain as part of
the moving block chain itself now the
advantage of this is in future let's say
there are two companies who have their
data present of the hyper edger and they
want to communicate this data then it
becomes quite easy transient connecting
them to your servers or putting all your
data on cloud you just need to connect
these two blocks it's there by
completely sharing the data that you
want at the same time you can set the
permissions there by ensuring you let
them see only what you want now moving
on from here let's talk about a use case
of how blocking can be implemented in
the stock market now the stock trading
system has been dated back to 1602 where
the first public stop was of East India
Company okay although it has been around
for four hundred years
the conventional system is something
that has still not changed it is still
almost the same as it was back then
they're having few minor changes however
there was no major change to the system
as well and talking about the issues
with the current system there are
depositories as well as agents not these
people of contact these points are
contacts themself our field because we
always hear certain frauds happening
between agents there are instances where
you cannot completely trust them or even
certain organizations as well
apart from that the registration
transferring of stocks as well as
distribution everything involve a
certain fees associated with so every
transaction that you've been performing
in itself has a separate transaction fee
fantastic highly there's also the
arbitrator fees that comes with them
which is always Chloe now if you work
with stocks then I'm quite sure that you
are familiar with all these challenges
as well now we made your issue with
respect to the current system let's take
the first issue itself now there are
mainly two problems here the first is
the regulator that is the person who
manages all this and then you have the
Clearing House now every stock it's int
let's say an IFFT or Centrex has its own
Clearing House and at times what happens
is Clearing House in itself becomes this
single point of contact where the
failure for this whole system takes
place so some correction here can in
itself make the whole system come and
they're having issues over the centuries
when this single point of contact
themself has been the source for all the
frauds that we see now let's talk about
our problem state what we need to do is
design a blockchain solution to solve
the issue of centralized stock exchange
system that is one central authority
governing and managing this should be
broken or decentralized proper and the
problems with respect to a centralized
stock exchange can be that one single
organization is taking money of all
others and dumping it for its own profit
they're having a lot of cases like that
apartment that the extent of use of
market debt is one major concern that
happens increasing price to earn ratio
is also another major concern because
all this is completely covered by the
central topic state so what we will do
is that we will introduce a blockchain
that stores all the transactions made by
these regulators and this letter would
completely be visible to everyone at any
stage anyone whose part of the public
can also view this letter by just being
part of the blockchain system and anyone
who wants to get verification with
respect to how they are doing they can
get an understanding from seeing these
blockchain systems as well now this
brings in a lot of transparency with
respect to how the system works because
the blockchain becomes complete
visible to the public so we get a
clear-cut idea of what exactly is
happening because here what happens in
today's market is that it's all
controlled by one central authority and
we have to put our complete trust on
them that they would not betray us but
again times have told us where there
have been certain issues now this in
turn will bring in a lot of transparency
as well as increase the trust of the
system and move the trust of the system
increases more will people invest into
the system thereby increasing the value
of the system now let's say someone
wants to transfer certain amount of
stocks from their account to someone
else or they want to sell it then what
happens is it gets broadcast across the
network where in the network of notes
these could be regulators who validate
these transactions find once they have
identified this transaction to be valid
what they'll do is they'll add it to a
block and increase the blockchain slack
now this block could have just one
transaction or even multiple
transactions depending on its capacity
so I hope you guys are out here
okay great moving on from here let's try
to understand where exactly is blocked
in being used apart from the bad Kingdom
now as I have mentioned banking is one
of the major domains where toxins can be
implemented and is being implemented as
well similarly you have payment and
transfer industry where you're
transferring certain amount to your
friend family or even some stranger
where you want to make a payment
definitely the blockchain system can be
used Healthcare is another major domain
where you can create a centralized
blockchain system where it holds the
complete details of the patients thereby
reducing the amount of paperwork and
completely keeping the secure data of
the patients as per lot of enforcement
would also be a useful domain so here
what you can do is that you can
completely share the data of all the
criminals it could also bring some
awareness to the public giving them
knowledge of the common thieves in their
area also make it quite easy for Inter
agencies to share that it then you have
Wooding domain not voting domain I will
talk about it extensively in the
upcoming slides transportation is
another domain online music you can
ensure that the piracy of online music
is completely reduced real estate market
is something else that is going to get
revolutionized with blockchain now all
these domains are just the beginning
there are multiple domains where
blockchain can be used and trust me guys
every given day there is newer
technologies being used so this is the
right time for you to move into the
blockchain market if you're looking to
get a good career here now in the band
Kingdom in what happens is by
implementing blockchain you can
basically cut across twenty billion
dollar worth middleman cost now this
twenty billion dollars includes the
middleman transaction fees that you
provide to various banks and financial
organizations now wouldn't you like to
get rid of all the transaction fees that
you have to pay every now and then
definitely I would like to apart from
that hacking into the details of the
customers becomes completely impossible
because as I had mentioned the
blockchain Ledger's stores only the
transaction details not the account
details thereby even if you hack into
the ledger get some details of the
transaction you cannot get the idea of
who has made how much transaction and
how much balance to the
in their account now since it is running
on a blockchain system the issue of
double spending as well as financial
crisis gets reduced to a complete minima
this is merely because we follow
decentralized approach and here every
transaction is validated and verified
before getting up to so the next term in
is payment and transfer to me here
basically what happens is you have
complete security with respect to your
tickets now let's take an example of
Paytm which is one of the most popular
payment application today in the market
in India at least here what happens is
you need to either share your mobile
number with the user or you need to show
the desk you are but when you do that
what happens is that firstly you're
sharing a personal number with someone
else
secondly what happens is that they get
the details of who has to receive the
money and this in turn causes certain
amount of confusion as well as this some
amount of breaches security as well but
by using Bitcoin wallets what you can do
is you just need to provide them with a
QR code or your private key thereby what
happens is no one completely gets any
idea of who exactly is receiving the
money at the same time you're completely
sure no one has a personal details and
there is an upside and a downside to
this you heard to the upside now let me
just give you an idea of the downside
would if most of you have been aware of
the news there was recently a ransomware
attack that had taken there what
happened was the perpetrators had
requested payment in mode of bitcoins
and they had given their Bitcoin wallet
address now since bitcoin system
maintains a complete anonymity with
respect to the user details no one
really knew who exactly did that money
go to and it became hard for the law
enforcement agencies to track now one of
the major reasons that bitcoin and
blockchain system can be used for
payment and transfer the way is because
there is no fixed transaction fees
attached to it there are certain block
chains and cryptocurrency systems that
add an additional transaction fees but
you always have the option of either pay
a minimal transaction fees or no
transaction fees at all it's completely
left up to be used here you don't need
to basically set up your bank records we
all know the hassle of setting up a bank
account here all you need to do is
download a Bitcoin
and then you are ready to go as such as
I had mentioned earlier as well the
anonymity factor comes into this picture
you've seen would be good and the bad
side good is that no one can really know
who you are but this also bad side when
you use it for the wrong purpose coming
to the voting domain this is one
interesting thing that I would like to
bring to your attention if implemented
correctly we can use the blockchain
system to create an online voting system
wherein everyone who has a valid voters
ID can work and there could be no issue
of war fraud or lost of cards or even
for ways that happened because we know
the blockchain system is completely
secure and cannot be manipulated apart
from that the hashing algorithm can
ensure that no double voting happens as
well because everyone is going to get a
unique identification number for their
war and this in turn cannot be
duplicated as such this in turn will
definitely lead to an increase of Tura
imagine having the ability of voting for
your favorite candidate just from an
application in your foot wouldn't that
be handy great move out from here let's
look at some of the blockchain
applications that are completely
revolutionizing the industry as such
first is follow my word
follow my word is being the first online
blockchain solution for various people
do identify themselves and cast their
online work now if this a work in
progress but definitely we can expect a
research so now so that is another
revolutionary product that is built on
the blockchain system here you can
completely store all your valid
identification card and then provide
link to this for any verification or
validation as such thereby completely
ensuring that no one can manipulate it
as well as giving you complete access to
who use it as well then you have Arcade
City now our key city is one of the most
upcoming technologies in the blockchain
system in the field of Transportation
now this also believed to be an uber
killer because it helps user to maintain
their anonymity as well as perform
carpooling as such then you have ever
ledger which provides you an immutable
blockchain ledger and this is mainly
used for diamond transactions on
validation so today when you go into
moose
popular diamond merchants I am quite
sure you can find them using a villager
to maintain a ledger of all the diamonds
transactions in Guam
then you have your propane microwave
which basically is a platform for buying
and selling energy that they produce
from their rooftop solar paths
interesting right while you have bitches
which basically is a high-performance
decentralized trading platforms on which
one now the item of trade can be
anything as per your choice but again it
is quite growing assets then these are
just some of the revolutionary ideas
that have just started in the blockchain
system so if you do have some idea I
would definitely recommend that you
start away because this is one of the
greatest time for people who are moving
into the blockchain and Bitcoin tech not
great so moving forward let's look at
today's demo for the session now in
today's session what we basically be
doing is that we'll be creating an it
smart contract on the etherium remix
drawers now before we go on to talk
about what exactly is smart contract let
me talk a bit about solidarity
programming last now if you are looking
to work on aetherium as well as create
really smart contracts then solid et is
one of the most important languages that
you need to be aware of now solute II is
an object-oriented language like
JavaScript but it also supports
inheritance libraries as well as various
user-defined types of such okay now
these are just some of the basic
features of solidity if you want to know
and learn more about solidarity I would
recommend that you look at their
official website that is solid it e dot
read the docs dot io so let me just show
you the page now this is the official
home page of solid attic and if you are
looking to explore this language mode
this is the best place that I would
suggest that you get started with okay
coming back to our slides
okay now using solid DT you can create
contracts for various different purposes
now as we had mentioned earlier you can
create a contract that would help you
for voting let's say even if you want to
create a complex contract let's say
there is a condition that you want that
multiple people have to sign before the
contract becomes true and in a real
world scenario that is true so all such
thing can be done with solid 80 okay
now coming on to today's demo session
what we're going to do is that we want
to create a smart card
now smart contract word may seem a bit
complexity so let me put it quite simply
a smart contract basically is a program
which helps you either transfer your
digital currencies or an asset are such
between two parties wherein you're
specifying these conditions are such now
let's look at the example here what
happens so let's say there are two
parties who have come to an
understanding where they're trading
certain asset with respect to that's it
once they have understood this we'll go
on to form a smart contract which will
then be added to the blockchain now once
this contract has been added to the
blockchain anyone can view this contract
and verify it as well now this becomes
highly essential why you're trading your
real estate through digital transactions
now let's say tomorrow you want to see
who has owned the property before big
present owner so that can be really
helpful if the contract was present on
the blockchain and it becomes completely
easy for anyone to verify as well as the
same time it avoids the need for paper
transactions now let me show you how the
smart contract works so this is what
your aetherium block browser would look
like okay so here you have details of
the block the transaction size and
backed up okay
now all the code that you're going to
write in solidarity is going to be
written in this to be mixed solidarity
ID okay so all you have to do is just
search for remix aetherium okay so this
will will give you a system the first
one that you see remix solidity IDE this
is what you want okay
so here you have the sample code okay
here you have the contract details the
environment from the input the accounts
present in the environment the gas limit
as well as the value okay so first let
me change the value of injected web
three it has to be web three provider
I'm getting this notification let me
click on up here here it says it's going
to communicate with my poor 8545 now at
my 8545 oh there's also the application
known as test RPC running which has the
complete list of all the accounts as
well as the private key present so 8545
is going to be the port at which these
two applications are going to
communicate so here let me just click on
okay now I'm getting a security warning
let me load this it may take some time
so I request you to be a bit patient
once you've selected on which account
you want to create the smart contract
then all you need to do is just click on
create option procedure
okay now again as I had mentioned this
may take some time so I had a question
to be a bit patient
great so now here you can see the cost
of this transaction how much cash how
much has it cost me to complete this
contract transaction and if you see in
the account that has been reduced
earlier it was 1 litre now it has
reduced corresponding another way to
validate this is to see it in your test
RPC card now test RPC is a continuous
running program so it may not be that
easy to get the detail
now if you see here there is the
transaction ID for the smart contract
that we have just inserted the contract
ID that has been present for the
injection as well as the amount of gas
or resource that has been consumed for
creation of this contract which block is
this contract presented as well as the
timestamp as to when this was injected
that is with respect to the block now
what you need to understand this with
respect to this program this is a basic
simple program that is used for
calculating both based on Delegates so
when you are inserting a transaction
basically means that you are inserting a
ward with respect to that set okay now
let's go back to our etherium browser
and let me show you how the transaction
looks like
here you have a new block which has one
transaction and a corresponding
timestamp so if you click on the block
number here you can see the block number
the receive time okay so the difficulty
and the nonce have been set to zero and
correspondingly the gas limit and the
minor details so here you can see the
detail of the transaction the hash for
this transaction okay
from whom has this transaction come to
and to whom it is go ahead so 0h0 is
just being set so that it is going into
the system so with this I hope you are
the stood how we can actually push a
simple contract into an account and how
the transaction would be is reflected in
our aperian block Explorer so again you
have the hash for the transaction
present here you have the from address
you have the to address here as well as
the gassed out of the resource that cost
for this transaction to copy let's go
back to our slides
so with this we come to a conclusion of
today's session just to summarize what
we had learned today we started off with
what is a blockchain what are
distributed Ledger's how does the
blockchain
encryption system work what is a
proof-of-work how our blockchain
incentives divided and who gets them we
talked about hyper ledger fabrics we
talked about how blockchain is being
used in different domains we looked at
different technologies built on
blockchain and we also saw a demo on
smart contracts so I hope you guys are
quite clear with respect to a session
any doubts please let me know it's not
thank you for today's session hope you
have a great week
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
