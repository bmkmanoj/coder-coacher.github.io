and eswe mainly focusing on this way
okay it is used in banking a swing is
used in banking it's like if I have an
application I want to communicate with
the bank for credit card authorization
or debit card authorization I have an
application but how will I connect to
Bank oh I have an application which I
want to connect to a bank and get the
approval for the debit transaction or a
credit transaction right so I will be
using SOA architecture I'll I'll be
connecting with a bank and I'll provide
all the details to the bank and get the
approval either it's approve or decline
the transaction okay
even in manufacturing also sorry even in
manufacturing also SOA is used but as if
actually in any manufacturing unit they
will maintain the inventory right if
they will have a minimum level and
maximum level for any component if the
level of the component if it drops down
to minimum below minimum it has to be
informed to the vendor so that the stock
gets refilled in but in in by using s
way you can reduce a human intervention
the moment the stock reduces then
automatically it informs the
manufacturer and manufacture the vendor
and vendor acknowledges and refills in
here there is no human intervention is
required okay even in insurance let's
say like you know if an employee joins
the organization and we need not
manually give all the details to the
insurance company and get the employee
insured so we have all the details we
need to have if we can develop a
software using SOA we can just connect
to the
insurance company provide all the
details and the insurance happens like
the insurance is done for the employee
and insurance policy has been sent by
email
everything happens automatically so you
don't need to manually give all the
details to the company to work for the
work okay
some of the company's uses the SOA
architecture is ICS a bank HDFC Bank X
is LAN lot of banks like any bank you
take it up right it will be using the
SOA architecture because any bank which
provides the credit card they need to
support is where your architecture
because they need to give on the web
however the the credit card transaction
is approved or declined if they want to
go ahead for like they want to process
credit card transactions then they have
to support SOA right some of the other
companies in IT sector are using eswe is
IBM HP are cool Google Amazon it's like
the list goes on right so we don't right
now without a CoA in a huge
organizations it doesn't work even for
any transaction the basic idea is if you
want to reduce a home human intervention
and we want to connect automatically and
things to happen automatically
then SOA has to be used okay
some of the companies which uses its
ways for manufacturing purposes Pulu
Marathi Hyundai and many more companies
okay and Harvard Medical School and all
these hospitals uses the SOA
architecture SOA architecture if there
is a lot of demand in you know
everywhere for SOA architecture if you
look at the trend so this is like you
know so lot of job demand is also there
it is that we write the code and use the
services on the other side without human
intervention everything it's everything
is automated
okay that is the main advantages of s
wait okay why s way it is let's say if I
if I'm starting some company and I don't
have the expertise in it in one of the
field or not all the fields or other
fields in that case what I do is I
outsource the work I use the work i part
of the work I used from others and plug
in that component as part of me right so
that becomes the s way if it is not
there I have to develop everything on my
own then it increases the speed to
deliver and then like when the time to
deliver is more definitely the cost also
goes up so to reduce the cost and to
deliver fast then I need s way and one
of the problem of not having s way is
one of the problem of not having s way
is that interoperability
interoperability means let's say I have
two systems dissimilar systems for
example I have a Macintosh I have a
Linux system okay and I want to connect
both of I can't I want to connect these
two systems and communicate with each
other I want to use a Linux system to
use the services or the product which is
installed in the Macintosh machine it is
impossible without this way okay what
are the advantages of eswe as it said if
I use the services from the other
company or the other vendor okay
I can I can I'll have these other I
shall have these advantages that is
speed to deliver the customers will be
more right I can deliver very fast if
somebody is very special somebody is
specialized in that area I will use a
services of them so that I can deliver
the service with a customer fast so the
cost reduces and customer can get
reliable
it's like I develop mobile and I talk to
Android to install Android on my machine
I don't invent OS I'm a mobile
manufacturer but I need weights I'll
give I'll use the architecture given by
somebody else
who is who is like specialized in the
particular subject right the customer
service is improved and as I said
interoperability can communicate with
similar and dissimilar systems for
exchanging information and data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
