give you all a brief introduction about
my Android app which I have titled as
PNR status by the way my name is
Prashant Chen and I am currently a
computer science finally a student in
GLA Institute of Technology and
management matera now let's go to the
app this is the official Google Play
page of my app the basic motive I had in
mind while developing this was to ease
the checking of the PNR status that most
of us do a lot of time in our usual days
for those among you who aren't very
familiar about what a PNR number is let
me tell you P n R stands for passenger
name record basically it can be treated
as a unique reference number for our
railway ticket and on the basis of which
we can fetch the current status of our
railway reservation at any time now
usually most of us either go to the
official website which is very painful
especially for the mobile browsers or
try to send the SMS in emergencies and
in the end we usually forget what to
send and on what number to send etc guys
this app here is the solution to all of
those problems now let's go through the
app once and figure out how does it
actually work now for the development
purpose we will be switching to the IBM
Eclipse environment which is generally
used for the Android development
purposes now as you can see the name of
the project is PN our inquiry and we
will be launching it on an android
emulator of the target version 4.0.3
that is also known as the Ice Cream
Sandwich on running it you can see the
name of the virtual devices eyes and the
target is 4.0.3 now double clicking it
we will be launching it on the Android
emulator and the main activity screen
will be brought to front
on the main screen here as you can see
this is the icon of the app that is also
set as the background and this here is
the text box which is showing the hint
that you have to enter your 10-digit PNR
number here the first radio button is
for choosing the internet more and the
second mode is the SMS mode the internet
mode is recommended as it is generally
fast in free for those who have the data
connection and this is the button which
you have to press to get the status now
we will try to fetch the current status
of a PNR number first we will enter the
number here
as you see if the number is not ten
digits long it shows you the warning and
prompts you to enter again
now if we try to use the SMS service it
shows us the warning message are you
sure to use SMS mode the standard
charges may apply usual rate by
Government of India is 3 rupees but it
totally depends on your network operator
we will cancel this and he was the
recommended mode that is the internet
mode as we click on the check PNR status
button it shows us fetching PNR status
and ask us to wait as you can see on the
resultant screen our lovely indian
railway mascot titi Balu comes with our
PNR status
it shows the train number the train name
boarding date from 2 reserved up to
boarding point class that is slipper it
also shows the status of all the
passengers individually which in this
case there is only one passenger then it
shows the charting status that the chart
is prepared or not and in in the end it
shows the warning that the current
status may upgrade or downgrade at a
later stage it basically shows all the
information that is required by a PNR
number now we go back to our main screen
next time you want to check the status
you don't have to remember the number
the app does it for you when you enter
just the first digit of your number it
shows you the traditions that match you
can select from them and check the
status
as you see I select from the suggested
numbers and press done now you can check
the spinner status here it also has a
special screen layout for the landscape
mode as you can see when we switch to
the landscape mode everything adjusts
itself automatically and it all looks
nice and beautiful now let's have a
little code walk through and familiarize
ourself with the basic project structure
as you can see the project basically has
two activities and three other Java
classes among them the PNR inquiry
activity is the activity that handles
the main screen and the show status
activity handles the results screen the
operator class displays a request to
user to rate the app after a certain
term of use and the other two classes
the my SQLite helper and PNR datasource
help in performing their database
operations the project basically has two
XML layout the main layout for the main
screen and the stateís layout
representing the results screen as you
can see in the end Royd manifest file it
supports all SDK versions from three to
sixteen that is Android version 1.5 to
4.1 the jelly beans the current version
it requires only two permission from the
user first permission is the internet
permission for the internet mode and
second is the send SMS permission from
the SMS mode it also supports all all
type of screen density and every type of
small and big screens now I'm going to
show you some ways to quickly find my
app first you should open the Google
Play and in the search box type Wartburg
dot p NR dot inquiry that's the package
name of our project and click search you
will quickly find a link to our app that
is PNR status by word burg another way
to find the app is to go to the
categories tab and go into the
transportation category that is our

now as our app is free you should move
to the top three screen as you see on
the fourth number this is our App PNR
status by would book as you click on our
application icon it will take you to the
official page of the app as you can see
you can have a quick view about the
progress of the app as it is evident the
app has crossed the 10000 download mark
in less than 25 days and the reviews are
also good the rating out of five is 4.7
