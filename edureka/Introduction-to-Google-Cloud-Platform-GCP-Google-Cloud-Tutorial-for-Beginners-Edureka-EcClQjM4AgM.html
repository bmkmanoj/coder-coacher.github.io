and today's session is on introduction
to the Google cloud platform so before
we move ahead to look at the agenda if
you guys have any topping in mind that
you want Erica to cover let us know in
the comment section below
so in this video I'll be covering these
topics I'll start with the growth of
cloud computing and we'll explain what
is Google cloud platform then we'll
discuss the various cloud providers I
learned why TCP is the most preferred
cloud service provider moving forward
we'll discuss the various services
provided by the Google cloud platform
one by one in depth and finally I'll
finish off this video by showing you
guys a few demos on how to use the
Google cloud platform so in recent years
the market for cloud computing has grown
unexpectedly be it a large organization
or small startups they all use the cloud
services in one form or the another her
garden to gardeners prediction the
worldwide public cloud service market
will increase from one hundred forty six
billion dollars in 2017 to one hundred
and seventy eight billion dollar
industry in 2018 and will continue to
grow with an alarming rate or twenty two
percent annually that's a very huge
growth now Google provides these cloud
computing services so let's understand
what is Google cloud platform first now
Google cloud platform is a set of
computing networking storage big data
machine learning and management services
provided by Google that runs on the same
cloud infrastructure that Google uses
internally for its end user products
such as the Google search Gmail Google
photos and YouTube so let's understand
what is cloud computing
now cloud computing is basically getting
the services you desire on your computer
via cloud now you do not need to buy
thousands of servers or systems to work
everything is managed by the cloud
service provider the cloud computing
allows companies to avoid or minimize
upfront IT infrastructure cost to keep
the up their applications up and running
faster with improved manageability and
less maintenance and that it enables the
IT teams to adjust resources rapidly to
meet the fluctuating and unpredictable
to man
many cloud providers in the market today
such as digital ocean VMware Rackspace
Amazon Web Services Google cloud
platform we have Microsoft Azure join it
IBM cloud to remark and many more so
what makes Google stand out from all
these other service provider let us find
out so first of all it has a very active
and a huge community supports lots of
tower architects from who will actively
participate in the community for all the
queries plus on their websites you can
find lots of tutorials which are really
helpful if you are new to cloud
computing coming to the second point it
is very cost effective there are no
upfront costs required in the Google
cloud platform it is can on average 60%
less for many compute workloads than
other cloud providers and it has zero
paid upfront cost that is you do not
need to pay any money while setting up
your account and initializing the Google
cloud platform plus you get discounts
for consistent uses of resources and
also you pay per second which is how a
cloud should work coming on to the third
point the Google cloud platform is very
flexible
now custom machine types is a feature of
Google compute engine that lets you
easily create a machine-type customized
to your needs with custom machine types
you can create virtual machines with the
optimal amount of CPU and memory
required for your workgroup be it a
single CPU machine or a 64 CPU machine
anything is possible
now cool cloud platform is highly
scalable it can be scaled according to
your needs with virtually very less
amount now GCP is very reliable and
secure all the data is automatically
encrypted when uploaded and decrypted
when you use it it is fully managed that
means all the services are fully masked
by Google and they use their own
infrastructure that they use for the
daily purposes for the Google cloud
platform as well and lastly now we can
all agree that Google may not need any
introduction for how fast they work or
how fast their services are just we when
I say that they are fast they are pretty
fast now coming on to the Google cloud
platform growth and market share so from
this graph as you can see that Google
has a very high
annual growth rate it is more than even
hundred percent so at this state there
is no doubt that Google will one day
become one of the most used cloud
provider or the cloud service provider
in the market now Google cloud platform
provides a lot of services here some of
the main services provided by the GCP
these are the compute services the
network services cloud AI services the
big data services as well as the storage
services now we'll look at each one of
these in depth one by one so starting
off with compute TCP provides a scalable
range of computing option you can tailor
to match your needs it provides highly
customizable virtual machine and the
option to deploy your code directly or
via containers now coming to the Google
compute engine
it delivers virtual machines running on
Google's innovative data center and
worldwide fiber network Google compute
engines VM would quickly come up with
high performance persistence and local
disk options and a deliverer consistent
performance now Google App Engine is a
platform for building scalable web
applications App Engine provides you
with built-in services and API such as -
no sequel data stores memcache a and a
user authentication API which is common
to most of the application now App
Engine will scale your application
automatically in response to the amount
of traffic it receives so you only pay
for the resources you use just upload
your code and Google will manage your
apps availability you do not need to
provision or maintain a single server
now coming on to Google kubernetes
engine it is a powerful cluster manager
system for running your docker
containers now kubernetes engine should
use your containers into the clusters
keep them healthy and manages them
automatically based on the requirements
you define such as CPU as well as memory
now coming on to the Google cloud
container registry it is a private
docker repository that works with
popular continuous delivery systems
it runs on Google cloud platform to
provide consistent uptime on an
infrastructure predicted by Google
security you pay only for the storage
and the internet you use and nothing
else
now cloud computing had made possible
fully serving as models for computing
where logic can be spun up on demand in
response to events originating from
anywhere now the Google cloud functions
you can construct applications from bite
size business logic build to the nearest
hundred milliseconds only while your
code is running now coming on to the
networking we have the cloud virtual
network with Cougars virtual private
cloud VPC network you can provision your
Google cloud platform resources connect
them to each other using the Google
almond global network and isolate them
from when another you can also define
fine great networking policies with
Google cloud platform on premise or
other public cloud infrastructure
now you can scale your application on
Google compute engine with the Google
cloud load balancing distribute your
load balanced compute resources in a
single or multiple regions close to your
users and to meet your highly
availability requirements now Google
cloud load balancing can put your
resources behind a single IP scale your
resources up or down with intelligent
auto scaling coming onto the cloud CDN
which is the content delivery network
Google Cloud CDN leverages Google's
globally distributed as caches to
accelerate content delivery for websites
and applications served out of Google
compute engine cloud CDN lowers network
latencies offload origins and reduces
serving costs now Google Cloud
interconnect allows cloud platform
customers to connect to Google via
enterprise create connections with
higher availability and lower latency
than their existing internet connections
now these connections are offered by
courier interconnect service provider
partners and may offer higher as list
than standard internet connection now
coming on to the final segment of
networking services which is the cloud
DNS it is scalable reliable and managed
authoritative domain naming system
service running on the same
infrastructure as Google it has low
latency high availability and is cost
effective way to make your application
and services available to your user now
cloud DNS is programmable you can easily
publish and manage millions of DNS
and records using the simple user
interface command-line interface or the
API s-- now coming to the cloud AI
services which are the machine learning
services cloud auto ml is a suit of
machine learning products that enables
developers with limited machine learning
expertise to Train high quality models
by leveraging Google state-of-the-art
transferring learning and neural
architecture search technology who will
cloud deep use are a family of hardware
accelerators that Google designed and
optimized specifically to speed up and
scale up the machine learning workloads
for training and inference program for
tensorflow hue cloud machine learning
engine makes it easy for you to build
sophisticated large-scale machine
learning models that cover a broad set
of scenarios from building sophisticated
regression models to image
classification it is portable fully
managed and integrated with other Google
Cloud Data Platform products such as the
Google Cloud Storage Google Cloud
dataflow and Google Cloud theatre lab
these are interconnected so that you can
easily train your models it also offers
powerful video and image analysis along
with the best speech and text
recognition we have seen so far now the
cool cloud platform you can focus on
finding insights rather than managing
your infrastructure and you can combine
cloud native services with open-source
tools as needed both in batch and
streaming mode here comes the big data
services now Google bigquery is Google's
fully managed low cost analytic data
warehouse bigquery is service there is
low infrastructure to manage and there
is no need to guess the needed capacity
or over-provision you do not need a
database administration you can just
focus on analyzing data to find
meaningful insights now Google Cloud
Data proc is a managed SPARC and Hadoop
service which is used to easily process
big datasets using the powerful and open
tool in the Apache Big Data ecosystem
now you can control your cost by
creating manage clusters of any size in
about a minute and turning them off when
you are done paying for what you use not
for the idle clusters
now Google Cloud Data Lab is an
interactive notebook which is based on
Jupiter and is used to explore
collaborate analyze and visualize data
it is integrated with bigquery and
Google Cloud machine learning to give
you an easy access to the key data
processing services
now coming on to the Google car pops up
it is a server less large scale reliable
real-time messaging service that allows
you to send and receive messages between
independent application you can leverage
its flexibility to decoupled systems and
components hosted on the cloud platform
or elsewhere on the Internet
now coming on to the storage and
databases services here we have the
Google Cloud Storage so Google Cloud
Storage really finds what the industry
can expect from online storage by
providing a unified offering across the
availability spectrum from live data to
archival solution data everything can be
managed by the good cloud storage
now cloud sequel is a fully managed
database service that makes it easy to
set up
maintain manage and administer your
relational my sequel and postgre sequel
databases in the cloud cloud sequel
offers high performance scalability and
convenience being hosted on the Google
cloud platform the cloud sequel provides
a database infrastructure for
applications running anywhere now cloud
BigTable provides a massively scalable
no sequel database suitable for low
latency and high throughput workloads it
integrates easily with popular big data
tools like Hadoop and spark and it
supports the open source industry
standard HBase API as well the cloud
BigTable is a great choice for both
operation as well as analytic
applications including IOT used in
analytics and financial data analytics
who will cloud datastore gives you an
elastic highly available
document-oriented database as a service
it is fully managed so you do not need
to deploy update configure or manage
your database solution now coming on to
the final stage of storage services
which is the persistent disk so
persistent disk is a high-performance
block storage service which is suitable
for virtual machines as well as
container storage it offers unmatched
price to performance ratio you only pay
for the capacity and you are never
charged for the provision I opt
additionally persistent disks offer
multi reader mounts and
demand volume resizing to simplify
operations so now if you want to learn
more about this database and storage
services we have entire video specified
to this topic make sure you check out
this in our YouTube playlist the link to
which is given in the description box
below now coming on to the other
services which are provided by the
Google cloud platform we have certain
security tools in that we have the cloud
platform security the cloud iam Identity
and Access Management and we have
certain management tools in which we
have the stag driver we have some
monitoring tools logging tools as well
as error reporting tools and in the
development tools we have the cloud SDK
development manager and we have some
other tools for PowerShares or visual
studios or for eclipse as a matter of
fact so now I think you guys must have a
pretty good idea about the Google cloud
platform and the various services which
are offered by it so now Google cloud
platform services are available in
various locations these locations are
divided into regions and zones you can
choose where to locate your applications
to meet your latency availability and
durability requirements regions are
independent geographic areas that
consist of zones and locations within
the regions then to have a round-trip
network latency are just under five
milliseconds a zone is a deployment area
for cloud platform resources within a
region so let's have a look at the
radius locations where the servers are
located and the number of zones for that
particular region here you can see that
in total we have 15 regions where the
servers are situated and with at least
three zones in every region now a few
Google cloud platform services are
managed by Google to be redundant and
distributed within and across regions
these are the global or the multi
regional resources these popularly
includes the bigquery data store and the
cloud storage
now regional resources are resources
that are redundantly deployed across all
the zones within a region for example
App Engine applications this gives them
higher availability relative to the
zonal resources the Sooner resources
operate within
single-zone if a swan becomes
unavailable all the stolen resources in
the zone are unavailable until the
service is restored
so guys let's have a look at some of the
demos on the Google cloud platform and
see how we can use it so to use the
Google cloud platform all you need to do
is create a free account on an
enterprise-grade account on the Google
cloud platform and you will be
redirected to this page now to step on
the go to console button and you will be
redirected to the console now console is
nothing but basically a dashboard where
you have the summary of all the
resources and the project infos along
with the billing details at one place as
you can see on the left hand side we
have the project info the resources
which we use some of the tracing tools
where we can trace our data and we have
certain getting started tutorials which
are for the people who are new to cloud
computing so in the middle you have the
api's in which you have the requests per
seconds on the right hand side you of
the Google cloud platform status which
provides you with the status of all the
services which are running on a project
below that we have the billing details
so the billing are done as per the
project basis that is why every other
project you select will have a different
billing amount below that we have the
error reporting and the news where you
get some of the updated news on the
Google cloud platform and finally you
have the documentation section when you
get the in-depth knowledge about the
various services provided by the Google
cloud platform be it the compute engine
cloud storage or the App Engine so
suppose a company wants to ship from on
promises to the cloud storage or the
cloud network I must say the basic
requirement for any company would be
some machines and the storage so I'll
show you how to set up a VM and a cloud
sequel instance and how we can use these
instances together to get the desired
result so on the left hand side in this
task bar you can see the various
services we have the compute storage
networking stack driver which is the
monitoring we have the container
registry we have the big data tools IOT
tools and so much more so let's go to
the compute engine section and under
that we have the VM instance let's click
on the VM instance better
tap on this create you will be asked to
enter certain credentials for the
instance so you need to input the name
of the instance and select the zone
where you need to deploy it so here I am
selecting US East 1b now you have the
option to select your machine types now
look at this carefully you have so many
options of all the different types of
CPUs with different permutations and
combinations of the memories as well so
on the right hand side you can see for
this particular one CPU which is having
3.7 GB memory I have to pay a twenty
four point six seven dollars per month
so for now on this is fine and below
that you have the option to select the
boot disk image which will be the base
image for your virtual machine now I'm
going to select Center seven and just by
that tapping on the create button in
within seconds your instance will be
created
you can see it did not even take 20
seconds so now that we have created the
VM instance let's go ahead and fire up
this instance
so this VM instance has sent to s7 has
the base image which comes with a
pre-installed Java let's see if that's
the case
found the commands so that means we do
not have job install so let me first
update the system
you
so our system is updated now let me
install Java for you
now it seems that Java is installed now
so let's check
yeah you can see that we have to Java
eight running open JDK version one point
eight point zero so in the similar
manner you can install any type of
framework beat Hadoop spark my sequel
for a matter of fact so now that we have
created this instance let us go ahead
and create the sequel instance as well
go to the sequel section under the
storage tap on the create instance here
you have the option to select or to
choose between the my sequel or the posi
our is equal as you can see the post
here the sequel is in beta format I'll
go ahead with my sequel now again you
have two types of cloud sequence
instances we have the my sequel first
generation and the my sequel second
generation which is recommended as it
has high performance and storage
capacity you can see it has seven times
the throughput and the 20 times the
storage capacity than the first
generation and is less expensive than
the first generation for most of the use
cases and the supports my sequel 5.6 and
5.7 so let me select the second
generation
again you need to put in the instance ID
and the root password you want and you
have the option to select the region as
well as the sole
I selected the US central 1b for the VM
instance the theme I am going to use for
my sequel instance as well it all
depends on your requirement where you
want it according to the latency or the
traffic requirement you have on your
website it all depends on that it will
take a few minutes to load the instance
and create it
so as you can see our secret instance is
also created and now we have to connect
our sequel instance and the BM instance
now it's a two-step process first we
need to connect it externally so let's
go into the sequel instance as you can
see here you have the options to select
the users create a user or the my sequel
instance you have certain databases by a
default we have three databases which
are the information schema my sequel and
the performance schema you have certain
authorization SSL and backup changes
also now let's go to this edit path on
the top and under authorize Network you
need to add a network
you need to provide a name for the
network and you need to provide the IP
address of the engine or the VM instance
you are using so let me just copy the
external IP here
and just a pon the Save button now
externally our work astern house equal
instance is connected to the VM instance
now our VM instance does not have my
sequel in it so first we need to install
my sequel so we'll do that in the same
process we did for installing Java will
use the yum commands
just type in sudo yum install my sequel
and now my secret is installed now we
have to connect our my sequel between
installed here to the my sequel instance
which we connected to the VM instance
now coming on to the step 2 of the
connecting process
so to connect it internally we have the
following command as you can see here we
have the my sequel - - host and we have
the instance IP so now this instance IP
is for the my sequel instance which we
created so let me go ahead and copy the
sequel instance
see here we have the public IP address
just copy this one paste it here now
here you have the option to select the
user and a password so you remember guys
I showed you that you can also create
your own user so I'll create a user for
the specific task
that will give us more clarity and more
flexibility so within seconds your user
is also created as you will see here
see within seconds our user was created
now let's get back to that page the
shell here I'll enter the username as
Kistler and the password
so now we are in the my sequel shell now
this my sequel is connected to this my
sequel instance here so let's go ahead
and see the databases first
see we have the information schema my
sequel and the performance schema as
well which will be the same as here now
you can create a database from here as
well but I prefer to use the shell so
let's create a database
now if we to show
a basis we have the demo database here
and when i refresh this page you will
see we have a demo database showing here
as well see here we have the demo
database you can delete it from here or
from the shell or from the VM which we
are using so guys this is how you
connect a particular VM instance to a
sequel instance which is used for
storage you can connect any type of
stolen instance to any type of VM
instance and you can use your own
Virtual Private Network for all the
other purposes as well so guys I hope
this demo of the Google cloud platform
was helpful to you
