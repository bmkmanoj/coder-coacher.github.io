know what is data meaning at a high
level what is business analytics what
are the stages of analytics data mining
and all that and we will also talk about
brief introduction about our so friends
data mining right it's a very very
important thing in the area of business
analytics right data mining is very
important aspect right so in a nutshell
mining means practice it's it's just a
practice of examining large data set in
order to generate information so we all
must have known about you know the
mining aspect now why do we need to call
it as mining we all dig land right for
minerals oil and we even you know dig
for various things right oil minerals
primarily or even gold sometimes right
so similarly we dig the data here right
we take the data in order to get
insights right so that to recognize some
patterns so which are going to be very
useful for analytics right once we know
the patterns right we kind of mind the
data in order to get insights from the
data so that's the primary objective
here so I'll just begin with a quick
example you can see the deck you know
there's so much of information available
here like it's a process of finding
correlations patterns dozens of fields
in large data and it is also finding
useful information from the data
devising knowledge out of it for
improving future right because any data
which is not analyzed because data has
been there and data you know as the big
data is growing right data there's going
to be a lot of data that's going to come
in to us right unless we know how to
mine the data how to derive the insights
it is as good as it doesn't exist right
so mining is a very important aspect so
let's talk about some examples right
let's you know for example I want to say
about clickstream data
so whenever you are viewing a public
site or visiting any site in the
internet we always leave clickstream
trail right so that data we kind of
leave it when you look at the
information you know just just like that
right it may not really seem useful
either you know at an initial glance
however let's say that you know you are
a retailer right if you are a retailer
you're going to analyze the trail of
data they users leave right so what
doesn't user do before clicking the
final purchase button right so we get
the complete picture of the customers
and we can even you know we can
understand the nature of the customer we
can even profile the customer to an
extent right so these are some of the
you know benefits like you know another
example could be like in Telecom right
we all know that the people we call them
as journals who kind of you know defect
to a different service provider right
these people are known as journals so we
can do this analysis right it helps us
to identify the profitable customers and
find out what can be provided as
customer retention how can we retain
these customers because you know if any
churners we if we can analyze and find
out mine the data and find out people
who are on the verge of churning or on
the verge of defecting to a different
service provider how can we stop them
right so and and people do mining the
data in the credit card as well you know
just to study the consumer behavior of
certain section of people right then
there are myriads of you know it can be
data can be mined and in science can be
derived almost in all the domains right
all the domains today so bottom line the
transaction transactional data does not
bring in much value unless we mined the
information and get the insights right
so data mining is a practice that
involves examining a large data set in
order to get the insights from the data
right so there are like you know
lot of techniques in that you know
clustering Association rules neural
networks there are lots and lots of
techniques available so let's talk about
business analytics here right we'll take
a quick peek at this you know if you
look at the definition right any
business for example business analytics
is all about you know study of business
data using statistical techniques and
programming for creating decision
support and insights for achieving
business goals right so any business you
know it's all about you know two
essential aspects one is to you know to
increase the revenue which will
positively impact the bottom line or in
other words the profit right profit of a
company and the other aspect would be
like you know bringing down the cost if
a company misses revenue targets they
always look various ways to find out you
know well how they can cut down the
operational cost right so this is a
pretty essential thing which any company
you know follows this so business
analytics is all about you know offering
support to the organization to arrive it
inform the decisions backed up by solid
data to achieve either to increase the
revenue or to cut down the cost right so
if you look at this study of data
through statistical operational analysis
and make use of past data statistical
methods to understand business
performance makes it necessary steps to
improve it and it is an intersection of
business and technology of course
because it is just not technology right
so it's it's about extensive domain
knowledge as well I have a question
right now which I'm seeing from mithoon
Roger what is the difference between in
fact I was just about to ask this
question to this section of audience
difference between business intelligence
and business analytics when it comes to
decision making ok so that's a excellent
question methyl so let
me answer this business analytics if I
need to answer it in one sentence right
analytics is futuristic business
intelligence is historical right if I
want to just say that you know one line
answer right so bi which is business
intelligence we have for example data
warehouse in a company using that we can
generate reports right we can generate
reports and dashboards but it is not a
very futuristic thing and you know we
don't make any kind of prediction in
this right and whereas in analytics we
create a model after analyzing the
historical data that can predict the
future right so it's a it's a very
forward-looking because you know it is
more a predictive model something that
can lead to the futuristic insights
right so methen am i clear I mean are
you are you understanding the difference
yeah sure Thanks let's look little
further
why is it getting popular these days
okay friends okay can you just throw
some insights here I want to ask you why
is business analytics really catching up
now why is it you know it was you know
it it is creating tremendous buzz around
you know the circles right so why is it
all of a sudden competition is high
there is one one of the answers here
growing data excellent so the in a
nutshell if I want to say this right if
we have the data we can start the
analytics as simple as that
right in a nutshell so all these are
like you know strong indications of
advancement in analytics and how it is
going to play a vital role in making
business decisions
so let's see you know the I mean I see
all right Lee pointed out in the last
two three years the business analytics
has really picked up steam right it has
create a tremendous buzz right and the
reasons are you know I think whatever
you said they're all perfect answers
right of course
with the advent of social media coming
into the mix right social media coming
into the mix mix lot of unstructured
data is coming in right and we cannot no
longer ignore the social media because
in way back in 2006 if you just rewind
your memory right if you go back a few
steps back and think 2006 you know
people were using Orkut and all that
right or could probably you know awkward
is already dead know so those days
social media is just used as a hangout
tool you know people just you know
probably you know people a person who is
working on you know in or somebody
accessing Orkut in a corporate world
that person is regarded as a wastrel
right somebody who is not probably if
he/she ain't and all that now social
media is a integral part of analytics
right it's integral part of an analytics
you know we talk about sentiment
analysis you know just to do test
marketing and all that so it's a very
vital cog in the area of analytics and
as data is going to grow and grow and
grow we need to have you know we need to
do analytics very efficiently here right
because we we all know there is a
goldmine hidden underneath it you know
if it is properly analyzed you can
derive the insights that can change the
you know a company's dynamics or you
know some main important product
strategy can evolve out of that right so
it can really take a company to towards
profitability a lot of great things are
available so the significant drivers I
would say I mean besides all the points
what we said you know the costing of the
the cost of storing data has
dramatically come down you know way back
in you know when I'm talking about 25
years back right I mean early 90s
storing one terabyte used to cost you
like probably you know millions of
dollars I think will be
very surprised now right so today a
terabyte of data storage you know you
just get it in a small you know probably
you can get it for like you know six
seventy dollars something like that
right so it's dramatically you know the
prices have come down
similarly the cost of processing data
just imagine in a 95 right even a normal
five forty five forty Meg Ram you know
I'm talking about midnight if I know
that used to cost like 50 grand inr
right so today you can do the same thing
you know a mobile phone just a seven
thousand rupee phone can do lot of
processing you know it's even more
powerful than this right the cost of
processing data that has also
significantly come down so these are you
know fundamental influencers for us to
you know most of the companies you know
they were little skeptical like you know
few years back on their big data
investment or even you know business
analytics you know how do they now today
most of the companies are like
forthcoming they have not only dipped
the dough they want to go deeper because
they know that things are going to be
lot more useful and insightful for the
company as such right so okay moving on
to make a carrier with BA there is a
question here for future or not is best
for future yeah I think of course it is
a it's going to be a great career I
don't want to go there Peabody but you
know it's going to be a great career
even if you want to pursue something in
that because analytics is there to stay
for a long time right because the data
is going to grow because we know the big
data mix the velocity at which the data
is growing and the volume it contributes
to the volume when the data is there you
will have analytics right so definitely
it's going to be a very rewarding
carrier in case you want to make in
but on that okay and there are few
models here few models here you know
it's called cross industry this is one
of the models of data mining so there
are a few models like you know crisp is
there and you have CMM one other model
is there and and you also have knowledge
discovery and data mining so these
models are like you know just like your
software lifecycle model right your
waterfall and I trade you model in
mining also we have crisp model you know
in this you know this is also a kind of
iterative process so at any given time
we can go back from any step even if you
have stuck at evaluation for example
right evaluation you can go back to
business understanding all the way to
validate further right so this is a
continuous process so it's and modeling
is one of the things it's not a one-time
activity it is a continuous process
right mining model right because even
after the system is deployed we always
try to do continuous monitoring on the
model pre-curved friends I think can I
take these questions towards the end you
know what is the pre-qualification for
career what is the scope for m/s
intelligence yeah
because let's go with this flow and you
know if you have anything pertaining to
this you know I would appreciate you
know any questions pertaining to this
right who can get this course yeah I
mean a lot of people are asking what is
a pre-qualification for getting into
analytics because it's a specialized
domain by itself so and again ms there's
a lot of people who are my you know
providing postgraduate courses in that
right who can get that yeah anybody who
is you know if you have the aptitude for
math and stats right it's going to be a
great thing if you have aptitude for
math I would say not that you need to be
a master if you have aptitude so you can
do this where can you take this no I
don't have an
about the Sun dip I think if you just
google it a lot of universities are
offering right okay so uh let's look
into our right so R is an open source
okay it's an open source statistical
software it's also a language you know
when we download the commands what we
write in our is the language part right
so our enables us to communicate
analytical results in a very innovative
visually appealing way right that even
the non-technical audiences can clearly
understand so our R helps to improve
processes and effective you know by by
even the effectiveness by enabling
analysts to conduct analysis efficiently
right so coming back to this R is
flexible right R is flexible you know it
has all the types classes packages and
all that right so it has got you know as
we speak we have about five thousand
packages in our right we have about five
thousand packages and it is an open
source so that is an added attraction
right and it has you know it is
supported by an active you know
community of users and developers so
you've got a very big community
following for our right any kind of
problem you know most of the problems
whatever your you might face while using
are if you just go to the community you
have the answer most of the times right
so this is gaining popularity because
there is lot of advancement in analytics
and R is one of the leaders in this
space right it was actually you know if
you go back to the history right it was
born as s you know SS in Singapore right
then it became s plus now it is called R
so it has been in existence for nearly
15 years so it is open source you know a
lot of vendors like you know we have our
studio is one of the vendors right and
we have revelry
analytics they have come up with their
own flavors towards commercial
development but the core platform layer
remains the same this is quite similar
to you know what you see in Linux right
where we have different distros for the
core platform of the layer is the same
right so even for for your information
even IBM Teradata Oracle s ap they have
come up with their own versions of our
it provides a lot of you know a lot of
corporate you know usages ranging from
Telecom forma financials life sciences
gaming I mean you name it you know R is
there it has penetrated pretty deeply
into all these things and again just
want to reiterate the advantages it's an
open source it provides advanced
graphical features right it has a GUI
that helps learning things faster easier
and it can connect to any kind of
databases and data types as well right
so can even you know cross-platform yes
that's right the brush-on and our
program can pull data from social media
it can provides it provides reuse
potential as well you know see if you
want to develop a package also you know
you there is a committee is you develop
something you know which can read data
from for example social media all you
have to do is just develop the package
and you know then once it is once you
get the approval from the panel you know
then you know it is set for usage for
the others
so let's you know I'm just want to take
a quick look at the question window what
is the advantages of or using you know
sass I'll come to that sass and are sure
I'll come to that is a person wants to
make career with BA what language he
needs to study only are you know I think
we booty I think people either point is
you know there is no company we know it
shall say our sass because both are here
to stay
just for your information
right because and and if you know our
because iris got great accepts
acceptance in the in the industry right
so our is a pretty you know if you know
our I think you have a good chance of
because many companies use our right and
and SAS as well so I would say you know
knowing our because know our is slightly
you know it has an edge over SAS when it
comes to you know the number of
companies using overall usage of our in
the industry definitely our ace ahead
right so we will see that I'll give I'll
just mention some comparison sure
how is our different from SAS or Hadoop
I would probably make a comparison on
SAS so I'll come to that what are the
limitations of our I believe it process
data using RAM so memory limitations are
there that's right Maria pond that's
there that's generally there but but
that's not a big crunch as well you know
you can still you know it uses memory so
our inherits from C and C++ it is
actually it was developed using I would
say Fortran to start with and even our
was used towards the later point right
so the advantages as I told you it is
open source right open source provides
advanced graphics and it can connect to
many data sources that is one thing
right and disadvantages it doesn't have
dedicated support for our right you
don't have dedicated support and because
there is a you know but there is a
strong community strong community
available that serves well can we
install our on cloud let us complete
yeah yeah sure that's right
so we will good you know friends shall
we take up questions you know I do agree
with the word let's go with the flow and
let me take up the questions towards you
know probably you know I will pass for
questions fine
so we need to know for example
disadvantages stores data in RAM as one
of you pointed out need to have better
programming skills and we need to know
which package do use there are about
5000 packages right so we need to have a
good knowledge on these packages right
because we without which you know you
may not be able to use the which package
to use where and let me draw a
comparison with the or with sass right
sass is expensive because of you know
annual licenses but one good thing is
you know it has dedicated support
extensive documentation which is a gap
in our and we need to have again you
know you need to have programming skills
and all that right so internet I mean if
someone asks you like you know will sass
there to replace our the answer is no
right
in fact you will be surprised this SAS
studio which provides capability to
interface with our language because you
know finding they are finding ways to
make them work better with each of this
so that you know in in the best interest
of customers so that's why you know both
of them are here to stay right data
analysis software you know increase
popularities and increase substantially
in recent years and it's a RS for
statistical analysis you know primarily
you know it makes things pretty simple
for the analysis look at the
characteristics effective fast handling
storage a bunch of operators for
calculation of arrays list vectors data
analysis and visualization in fact I
would say that you know ours
visualization is definitely superior to
SAS or any other tool for that matter
right it has got very rich visualization
well implement an effective programming
language called S on top of which R is
built a complete range of packages to
extend enrich the functionality of
are right so and look at the
visualization right so we will in fact
see as part of a visualization in fact
as I told you our has got advanced
graphics right so we can have a very
good visual present representation of
data that can be used for effective
communication right of information with
clarity and integrity and visualization
again friends it is one of the most
important aspect in analytics right if
you just go with you know your p-value
and K means two years senior leadership
or executive leadership right it's going
to be a disaster because they don't want
to know all that you need to talk the
business lingo right so you need to have
a good visualization technique right so
our provides all these things RSS you
know it provides with very very it has
got great rich visualization
capabilities so you can actually you
know just to stimulate the viewers
engagement right the lot of functions in
our that can do things yeah so who uses
our domains right this is another if you
see this right there lots and lots of
industry as I told you in the beginning
right they use are like for example in
you know I told you about the journals
in the telecom industry right so they
can you know we can analyze the
historical data coming back to the
Chernus content context right so
historical data and you know is this we
can actually see it's the trend with you
know for example if you find some of the
churners right if you find some of the
journals right if you have identified
the potential churners who could who
would defect to a different provider
what you can do is you know you can see
you can do some analysis and see whether
the trend is reflecting with a
particular age group or does it happen
with
the salary range or is this an attribute
of a particular city and so on and so
forth right so once done we kind of
document our findings make it as a
report right we we share it with the
leadership then we narrow down you know
based on you know what what should be
the action plan to you know address this
issue so that's how it is typically done
in an organization right so we can you
know even the marketing team or the
sales team they can try to entice them
with some offers or you know try to find
out what was the actual reason for them
to you know think that way you know why
do they want to defect right so all
these things because why people want to
do this is like you know customer
acquisition new customer acquisition is
five times more costlier than retaining
existing customers so all the people you
know all the companies do this as part
of customer retention right so this is
one thing and similarly in the retailing
you know in the good old days I think
you all must have faced this you know at
least I have faced this numerous times
when I used to be in the u.s. way back
in early 2000s they used to give bunch
of discount coupons if you go to a shop
like Best Buy or if you go to a shop
like any kind of shop even Target and
all that right so the given bunch of
discount coupons and you will I have
never seen them you know I used to it
straight away trash it
the reason was you know it never made
sense because you know you may be buying
products ABC and the discount coupons
will have A to Z right it's so many
flavors and so many variants in that
right so because the information was
completely irrelevant right so nowadays
the retailer's of are they do they
launch product promotion based on
customers buying patterns right because
analytics plays a very important role
here discount coupon what do you get on
relevant products what the customer
usually biased right so Jane's like you
know the Publix supermarket Sears and
they're all making significant strides
in the area of retailing
they do extensive analysis of data have
you know they make lot of business
decisions right great business decisions
let us not only help them you know
customer retention they also help them
widening their customer base so you know
that way they are okay and even the
customers remain happy customers it's a
win-win for both sides right so that way
you know it's it's a great thing to you
know them
most of these retailers of making giant
strides in this and yeah you know there
are lots and lots of examples like
sports analytics you all must be knowing
how s ap as a company right they helped
Germany in winning the World Cup soccer
because they identified some of the
critical attributes and they helped how
a player can actually you know the they
they kind of figured out that if they if
a player has reduced ball position
compared to what they were doing right
so that helps them to pass the ball
pretty quickly and this way they could
penetrate into opponents defense right
this was again analytics for you right
and health care you know we all know
that you know how it is revolutionizing
in the areas of genome sequencing you
know especially in the cancer research
and all that right it monitors the you
know health of a heart of a person it
can predict even nowadays you know it
can even predict cardiac arrest by
monitoring the hot regularly and quickly
you know it can even looking at the hot
tip monitoring right it can predict the
cardiac arrest and again in the BFS
domain you have fraud detection trade
surveillance all these things are you
know they automate steps to validate
oversights right so all these things are
there lot of lots and lots of examples
again in Airlines
right we know I can give you this
example as well in the airline's
half a terabyte of data is generated in
every Boeing Dreamliner flight
for a single leg over Atlantic right
just imagine the Airbus 380 which is the
largest passenger aircraft how much of
information it would generate with four
engines right so and we are talking
about in 100,000 flights a day and in
fact GE has in fact come up with the
aircraft optimization project right so
they do a lot of research on this and
they do a lot of predictive analytics
right so this is endless folks you know
I don't want to give more examples but
you know this is you will find it in all
the you know we have just listed down
like three or four domains here but you
can this has got entrenched into any
domain here right so it's going to play
an important role down the road down the
line
