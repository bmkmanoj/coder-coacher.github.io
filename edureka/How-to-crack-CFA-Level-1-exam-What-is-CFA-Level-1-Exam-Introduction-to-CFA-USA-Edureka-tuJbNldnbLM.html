good afternoon and good morning to
people from other time zones all right
so so let's let's get started let me
just set out the agenda for today's
webinar
so we're going to talk about the CFA
course I think this is something that
has already been indicated to all of you
and I'm I really think you guys to have
taken some my jumps taking some time out
to be there for the webinar so the
agenda is we're gonna talk about the CFA
and in particular CFA level one I shall
be discussing you know who could be the
ideal candidate for this exam so who
should be writing this exam who should
in the first place be registering for
the program what are the kind of career
opportunities that await you or awaits
you after clearing the exam now this is
one thing which all of you would be
interested in and for people who have
already registered themselves for the
program for CFA level one I think they
would be pretty curious about knowing
how should they go about preparing now I
believe a lot of you would be planning
to write your CF exams in June 2016 and
some of you might be looking to write
your exams in December 2015 which is
like two months away I would be I would
be looking at that part as well so for
candidates who just have two months and
they are about to start or yet to start
and if they are wondering whether they
can crack the exam my answer would be a
resounding yes and I shall indicate how
to go about but not to in any way
indicate that that's the right way of
going about them the earlier you start
the better it is
so we shall any which ways try and
address that issue I'm going to take a
small discussion on one of the basic
topics in CFA I mean time value of money
now that's that's that's a topic which
is part of the Quan section but will
find its application in all
most every domain that you would go
through in the CFA curriculum so we
would be looking at equity fixed income
valuation of other alternative assets
and you would invariably see that time
value of money find its application in
almost every area so I thought this
would be a very basic topic but at the
same time a very very useful topic
having a very wide application and hence
I tried to choose this topic for today's
discussion maybe we would take out 3035
minutes just to have some basic
discussion on this topic I think this
would especially be of interest to
people who are absolutely new to this
program and not to forget the most
important part of the webinar I would be
very very I would say anxious to take
your questions and answer them so I
would leave the floor open once we are
done with the topical discussion so
irrespective how much we cover off the
topic I think I would just try to keep
aside the last ten minutes five minutes
off of the of the webinar for for your
questions and I would love to answer
them okay great
so just a bit about about us about
myself and my colleague we are the ones
we're going to take you through the
course so a mammoth Perik and a quick
introduction I have doubled with
corporate banking I couldn't research
strategic finance before really getting
into full-time training so I've spent
around six six to seven years in the
industry before I decided that let me
get into training and academia on a
full-fledged basis so what I do I teach
finance I teach accountancy cost
accounting mathematics so these are
subjects which are of interest to me
specially finance and and and
mathematics so I love dealing with
numbers and I teach maths at different
levels I have been fortunate enough to
have written
quite a few exams and and to have
cleared them and I believe that is where
my strength was I mean I was pretty good
at cracking exams and hence I thought
let me try and help you guys do the same
so be it CA cfa frm which is financial
risk management MBA I did my MBA from
I'm am the BOD Indian Institute of
Management I I could possibly be of some
help to to you guys so I'm there I'm
there to help you out so my colleague
uncle he is a veteran cfa trainer and
he's been training for the last seven
years and i believe is one of the best
trainers that we have in this country
he's worked in corporate finance area he
was associated with Suzuki and he has
spent a few years in consulting and
advisory role and he was the town stand
young he's been a serial rancor that's
what I that's how I described him beat
the university exams all CAS albeit CFA
well you don't have ranks but he was
really there in the top percentile he's
a swimming buff and he loves teaching
like what I do so there we are and we
would be we would be now you would get
to know more about us as and when we get
further into the course but today it's
gonna be our session with me so a little
about CFA so cfa level one in particular
that marks your entry into the program
so you register for the CFA program and
then you register yourself for the CFA
level one example for people who are new
to CFA you would have three levels level
1 2 3 and you can write your level one
in December or June level 2 and level 3
exams they happen in June so what does
CFA all about well you would deal with
the areas like ethics quantitative
techniques wants as I call it fr a
financial reporting analysis corporate
finance portfolio management equity
fixed income derivative economics
alternative investments alternative
assets as we call it so there are quite
a
two areas which you need to master and
the weight edge of all these areas would
spread somewhere within the range 5 to
15% so that is where it would be except
I think the exception being fr a which
would nearly have a weight edge of 20%
as you can see it in the pie graph which
is there on one one corner of the slide
now let me tell you while you have these
many areas and we do have the tendency
to pick the more important ones let me
tell you I mean all areas are important
I mean you just can't afford to drop any
of them as far as your preparation is
concerned so most of these areas in fact
all these areas would find adequate
proportionate representation in the in
the exam so so that means that if I
leave out a particular area let's say if
I were to decide and I were to leave out
economics because that's quite
voluminous and and and and people like
to believe that given that its it has a
10% weight edge and and and you have to
read volume as far as this particular
subject is concerned a lot of people
tend to go a little easy on economics I
mean they do part of it they leave it
out I mean I am dead against it I think
every area would have its share of easy
questions difficult questions and in
case if you decide to leave out that
area entirely I think you let go at
lease the easy questions so my strong
suggestion is take up all the areas try
and make sure that you cover all of them
irrespective of the kind of time that
you have all right so what is the exam
gonna be like so you're gonna have and
I'm going to be in specific or talking
about cfa level 1 because that's where
my focus is right now and I would assume
that all of you there are prospective
level 1 students so level 1 is gonna
have two papers AM and PM so there's
going to be a morning session and
there's gonna be an afternoon session so
they're going to be two papers that you
need to write both the papers each paper
rather would consist of 100
and 20 questions so you're gonna have
180 minutes so three hours paper you got
to cover 120 questions so that would
practically give you 90 seconds for
every question that you attempt on an
average all these questions are going to
be MC cues that means they are going to
be multiple choice questions every
question would be followed by three
options and you got to pick one of them
which you think is the correct one so
the question is is there any negative
marking there is none okay so it I would
suggest that you should attempt every
question irrespective of whether you
know it I mean whether you think you
know it or you don't right so you got to
attempt every question there are 120
questions to be covered in 180 minutes
each paper so that gives you 90 seconds
for every question so does it make your
task difficult yes but not very very
difficult why because some of the
questions is going to take less than 90
seconds and some of it is going to take
more than 90 seconds right so we're
going to cross subsidize our attempt and
we would right so I'm that's that's how
you would go about so how would your
preparation be well at any point of time
you should be going through couple of
areas so I would never suggest that if
you've chosen up let's say quants and
you should be spending days and weeks on
corn so at any point of time you should
pick up more than one area and you
should be preparing parallely because I
think that will give some variety to
your preparation and would make it
interesting
you should definitely regularly watch
and listen to the video tutorials be
regular for your life sessions and in
case you missed out one make sure that
you are able to access the the archive
and look at the back up along with the
tutorials I would strongly suggest that
you should be going through the practice
questions so if today I teach you time
value of money for example well the very
next day or let's say the very next are
you set
with your with your practice questions
on time value of money and you try and
work them out I mean that just improves
your attention I would say significantly
and trust me you don't have much time
left for the exam so you would never
have the time to go back and then catch
up with the practice questions and it's
best done when it is being discussed and
when it is being heard right so kindly
keep your active preparation in parallel
to our classes so who should be writing
the exam well anyone who would be
interested in the investment industry so
if you're looking to join let's say
banking or Investment Banking or you
want to get into the research profile
equity research profile I think this is
the course for you so in terms of
eligibility if you are in the final of
the final year of your college or you
just clear your college I think you're
well illogical for it if you have four
years of professional experience you are
eligible for it right so if you happen
to fall into one of these categories and
you're really really very very inclined
towards the finance domain I would I
would say this is one of the best
self-study courses that's available the
best self-study course in finance okay
so I think we are we are now well-placed
to start off with our discussion and I'm
going to take up time value of money I'm
going to keep it very very basic and I
would not really want to make this
webinar and a heavily technical one so
this is something that all of you would
be familiar with in some way or the
other formally or otherwise so a few
questions coming in and so we have a
question from Karthik who's asking do we
need to have finance background to take
this course but somebody with a finance
background will have some kind of an
advantage at least to begin with but
when we teach this course we assume that
we starting from scratch so you could be
somebody from from from an arts
background but if you're somebody who is
was inclined towards finance who look to
make a career in finance I think it
should not be a hurdle so III as a
trainer assumes III would assume that
every candidate is is absolutely
clueless about about these topics and
hence we would start from scratch
I believe that answers your question
right any other question about the
program before we get started off with
our topic
okay so Madhu has a question how good it
would be to crack CFA after doing
financial modeling I think it would be
wonderful there's there's a bit of
synergy in it between CFA and financial
modeling a lot of valuation that we do
which would be taught and CFA you know
finally it gets it practically gets done
by way of financial models so I think
there will be quite a bit of synergy
that you will realize baju when you
would be going through the CFA course
and then you would definitely find it
interesting
having said that financial modeling is
more of a practical course it's it's
it's more I would say skill oriented
than anything else and the kind of
concept that is needed to have a good
grip over financial modeling I think CFA
comes in there for that matter any
finance course would come in there all
right well permission he has a question
so CA plus CFA is it beneficial well
well I can I can only say permission
that I am a chartered accountant and I
have entered and did my CFA and I found
it immensely useful so I believe that
answers your question
Rajat finds CFA rather see a tough going
and and and and and I think the implied
question is is CFA going to be the same
well in in my personal opinion I think
CFA M is it's it's far more conceptual
so rather than rigorous training if you
have a good conceptual grip over the
subject you would be able to do it right
so I don't think it's gonna be as
difficult as see it I mean that's that's
my opinion
I
think it would it would Laxmi so would
would would put your other courses
permit you to go for CFA yes it would
yes it is
okay mutations doing is CMT so which is
basically a technical analysis course
and would CFA and CMT together be
beneficial while there I mean these two
are different Sciences CFA tends to
focus more on fundamental analysis while
CMT is essentially a very very focused
course on technical analysis given that
both are related to capital markets to
that extent yes okay in terms of
preparation I don't know whether I've
covered it maybe going forward I would
in terms of preparation how many hours
should you be putting in for level one I
mean I would be conservative and I would
say 350 to 400 hours should be good
enough right so the Institute places
it's somewhat lower but I think 350 to
400 hours would be great
alright okay great I'm open to other
questions but if you guys can just keep
it reserved for the end right so pretty
we are going to come up with with more
questions and answers maybe at the end
so maybe you guys can come up with your
questions at the end so we'll keep aside
ten minutes for that thank you thank you
guys so there we go so let's look at the
topic which we are going to cover time
value of money now this is the first
topic that you would see in quantitative
technique as far as you see if a level
one curriculum is concerned and so I'm
going to take up concepts related to
time value of money and in particular
I'm gonna cover things like interest
rates future value present value so
hopefully I think we should be able to
touch upon all of these so there we go
so let me discuss a bit about time value
of money give you a slow introduction to
it so there I have so let's say if I
were to give you a choice between
hundred dollars today so let's call it I
give you an offer of hundred dollars
today or let's say a hundred dollars a
year later
so let's call it a year later alright so
and if I were to offer you that you can
very well take hundred dollars from me
today or you could take it a year later
what would you prefer now you would say
well that's a no-brainer I'm going to go
for this hundred dollars today is
preferable to hundred dollars a year
later isn't it all of you would say yes
so then why should it be so I would say
well that's very easy if I have hundred
dollars today I can very well invest it
for the next one year so if I get
hundred dollars today I'm going to
invest it for a year for one year I'm
gonna invest it let's say at 6% so at 6%
I'm gonna invest it and and this would
finally give me hundred and six dollars
all right an hundred and six dollars a
year later any day is greater than
hundred dollars a year later so that's
that's absolutely correct Rajat so
hundred dollars today is much more
valuable than hundred dollars a year
later all right because you have the
choice of investing it for the next one
year and that would finally give you one
hundred and six dollars so let's look at
it a little differently if I were to
give you a choice between hundred
dollars today or hundred dollars a year
later well you might not be a an an
investment guy you might not be somebody
who looks to invest but you might you
might look at spending this hundred
dollars now you would say so if you were
to give me $100 today I can very well
buy a nice jacket for myself now then
you have the festive season coming
around and and and and again it's going
to be winter in this part of the country
up to at least in our country and hence
one would say hundred dollars will fetch
me a nice jacket and I can very well
enjoy my winter in the warm jacket so if
I were to get it a year later that would
mean deferring my consumption so I'm
letting go my consumption all right so
what am i alluding to what I'm trying to
say is there then when I get hundred
dollars today there is an investment
utility and
which gets captured by this extra $6
that I get over the next one year or if
I were to get $100 today and if I were
not to invest it I can still consume it
I can still consume it and and and enjoy
myself and when I let go hundred dollars
today to get hundred dollars a year
later there's an element of sacrifice I
let go today's consumption to go for
let's say future consumption so there's
an element of sacrifice and again there
is an investment utility which comes out
of getting the money today so you would
say well the amount today is much more
valuable than the same amount a year
later so can I argue that hundred
dollars today is equal to hundred six
dollars a year later all right so you
would say hundred dollars today is equal
to hundred and six dollars a year later
in other words if I were to be given a
choice between hundred dollars today and
or rather one hundred and six dollars a
year later I would be almost indifferent
between the two when you would come back
saying hey I'm Adam and I would be
indifferent between the two you can give
me a hundred dollars today or you could
give me a hundred and six dollars a year
later that's absolutely fine so the
future value of hundred dollars the
future value of one hundred dollars of
this is in dollars is equal to hundred
and six dollars so how did we get that
well we would say well we took the
present cash flow and we multiplied it
with one plus the interest rate what was
the interest rate it was 6% one plus
0.06 please keep it in mind 6% is equal
to 0.06
so that gives you hundred and six
dollars so here we were able to find out
the future value of $100 by multiplying
it with one plus the interest rate
isn't it so by the same concept by the
same logic may I say if I have hundred
and six dollars a year later wouldn't
the present value of it be hundred
dollars wouldn't the present value of it
hundred dollars and how do we get it how
do we get hundred dollars from 106
dollars so if I need to find out the
present value so let me use this part of
this
so if I need to find out the present
value of the future cash flow well in
that case I'm gonna take hundred and six
dollars and I'm going to divide it by
one point zero six isn't it that's
absolutely correct Roger
so 106 divided by one point zero six and
that gives me hundred all right
so for me to find out the present value
of the future cash flow I'd divide it by
1 plus R for me to arrive at the future
value of the present cash flow I
multiplied with 1 plus R all right I
hope this is clear with everyone so let
me try and formalize it so I'm gonna
erase this so I hope this part is
registered with everyone so let me erase
this or yeah so may I say that the
future value of the present cash flow is
going to be equal to the present cash
flow into 1 plus R and the present value
of the future cash flow is going to be
the future cash flow divided by 1 plus R
all right so we add $100 if we were to
transport it one year later it becomes
106 how do we get 100 6 we multiplied it
with one point zero six and from hundred
and six that means the future cash flow
if I need to come to the present value I
would divide it by one point zero six so
this is division by one point zero six
okay so when I multiply it I call it the
process of compounding please remember
when you multiply it with one plus R to
get the future value of the present cash
flow this is known as compounding and
when you move from future cash flow to
back to get its present value that means
you are moving back in terms of time
from your one two you're moving today
your zero you divide it by 1 plus R and
this is termed as discounting all right
so to get the future value I compound to
get the present value I discount
isn't it alright yes yes that's
absolutely correct great great so let's
let's now move on so let me now move on
to the next slide so let's see if I can
just move on to the next slide so let's
now try and understand what what what
interest rate is I mean we've already
discussed it a bit now we did see that
we used interest rate to find out the
future value or to find out the present
value well so in one way interest rates
could be used as the discount rate so
that's one way of looking at interest
rates okay
now also try and understand that when I
started off my discussion I started off
I started it off saying that that that
if I were to get let's say instead of
the current hundred dollars if I were to
get a future cash flow I should be
getting hundred and six dollars and how
did we get hundred and six dollars well
by taking into account the six percent
interest rate so may I understand
interest rate as the minimum rate of
return that I would want on my
investment right to replace the present
cash flow with the future cash flow so I
can let go the present cash flow if I
can earn a return of six percent so six
percent is the minimum rate of return
that I would want on my investment and
investment basically replaces the
present cash flow with the future cash
flow I can also understand interest rate
as the opportunity cost of spending go
back to my discussion when I said hey
when I go four hundred and six dollars a
year later I'm letting go the current
cash flow of $100 I am letting go my
current consumption so there is an
element of sacrifice I want to get
compensated for that and hence interest
rate can be can can be understood can be
implied as the opportunity cost of
spending so when I spend I let go a six
percent return so that's the opportunity
cost of spending and that six percent is
nothing but the interest rate okay so
let me very quickly sum it up interest
rate could be understood as the minimum
rate of return that I would want on my
investment it could be understood as the
opportunity cost of spent
that means the return that you forgo
when you decide to spend instead of
investing or it could very well be
understood simply be understood as the
discount rate or the compound rate which
is used to find out the future or
present value of the future cash flow or
the future value of the present cash
flow so that's how we would interpret
interest rate as moving on let's now
look at what interest rate would consist
of now and in my example I had taken the
interest rate to be 6% so okay so I had
used 6% as the interest rate so in our
example we had taken the interest rate
as 6% so let's now try and analyze how
does this figure of 6% conjure up what
does it built off what are the
components that go into 6% now you would
say the dumbest when I try to invest
hundred dollars today I'm letting go the
current consumption so there is quite a
bit of sacrifice that goes into letting
go current consumption for future
consumption right so there's an element
of sacrifice you want to get compensated
for that so so you would argue that
since I am sacrificing so there's an
element of sacrifice you let go the
current consumption you want to get
compensated for that and you say okay
you need to give me three percent extra
so if I invest one hundred dollars you
need to give me three percent because
I'm letting go the current consumption
I'm letting go this money so you need to
give me three percent I would not buy
the jacket today I'm gonna buy it next
winter but then you know letting go the
current consumption involves sacrifice
so three percent is the amount of
compensation that I would want for the
sacrifice so that is what you demand as
an investor
now you also remind me of the fact that
when you would be purchasing the jacket
a year later the jacket is in all
probability going to cost you more so
this jacket could have easily been
bought four hundred dollars today but
maybe a year later it's going to cost
you 102 dollars that means there could
be a two percent
rise in price levels and you would want
to make sure that you get that extra
$2.00 when you invest $100 so you would
say hey I think I will be happy enough
you could if you could give me another
2% because that's the inflation which is
which is expected to prevail over the
next one year and so I would be happy
enough to get let's say five percent
return at least three percent on account
of the sacrifice that I make so that
compensates me for that two percent as
the compensation towards the possible
price rise so all in all I would seek a
return of five percent I was a great
okay I'm willing to give you five
percent now this three percent is
technically termed as the real risk free
rate guys so let's call it RF or the
real risk-free rate okay so kindly keep
this in mind that this is the real
risk-free rate this two percent is your
inflation all right and your risk-free
your real risk-free rate plus inflation
would become the nominal risk-free rate
and which is normally alluded to as the
risk-free rates so moment they would say
three percent they would qualify it as
the real risk-free rate it's real
risk-free rate plus inflation becomes a
nominal risk-free rate so normally when
you your interest rates yields returns
those are all nominal rates the
inflation component has already been
factored in unless and until they
qualify an interest rate as real always
assume that inflation has already built
in okay now so I was almost quite happy
with giving you a five percent return so
you are lending me money I'm quite happy
to give you a five percent return but
then you remind me that hey I would need
another extra one percent and I would
say what for now you would say well
Ahmed I've just been knowing you for a
while it's just been a couple of days
and there's a possibility excuse me so
there is a possibility that that that
you might default or let's say when I
lend out two hundred individuals there
could always be a few individuals who
could you know
would likely who would likely possibly
who would default so there's a risk in
investing there's a risk in lending so
if unless until I try to build in that
expected loss into my return I would end
up having less than what I had invested
so fair enough so you would seek a 1%
risk premium okay so that's the risk
premium that you're going to seek so all
in all you would be seeking a return off
so nominal risk-free rate plus the risk
premium and you would say okay great
you give me 6 percent okay so you would
say hey I would be happy enough to get a
6 percent return and this 6 percent
return is known as the risk adjusted
return please keep it in mind
5 percent is a risk-free return 5
percent plus 1 percent which is your
risk premium makes it 6 percent which is
the risk adjusted return so the 6
percent in our example possibly
consisted of these three elements real
risk-free inflation and default risk
premium there could of course be other
investments which would try and build in
liquidity premium and maturity premium
let me just spend a few few seconds on
this of course I think you will become
these things would become much more easy
for you to comprehend as we move further
deeper into the curriculum especially
when we would start looking at fixed
income so liquidity premium essentially
is the extra return that you would seek
from illiquid assets right so you invest
into certain assets you buy certain
assets but then you you you feel that
you feel that as and when you would look
to sell these assets it would not be
easy to sell them you might not be able
to realize the fair value of it so there
could be some amount of hit that you
might have to take and hence to begin
with you would try to seek a higher
return from these assets so you would
try to build it build that in into the
price of the asset you would you would
in other words say hey I'm gonna pay a
lower price for this asset right in
other words you would seek a higher
return from those assets maturity
premium I mean in simple words if I
would have put it at the
part of time longer investment horizon
so there is a 10-year investment that is
a one-year investment you you would try
to seek a higher return from a ten-year
investment simply because there is much
greater uncertainty associated with a
longer-term investment isn't it it's
very very difficult to predict future so
farther the future the more difficult it
becomes to predicted there is greater
amount of unpredictability and hence you
would seek a higher returns if you if
you want to lend out money to somebody
for 10 years most likely you would seek
a you would be with you would you would
charge a higher interest rate visibly
let's say when you are lending out to
somebody for a year and and so you might
be lending out to me for a year at 6%
per annum
so if I say hey I want it for 10 years
you might say ok give me 7 percent per
annum all right so that extra 1% is on
account of the maturity premium I hope
this is clear with everyone so are we
well poised to move to the next slide or
any question so let me try and erase
this portion before we move on to the
next slide
ok great so there we have it the future
value of a single cash flow so let's
very quickly do this so you have $800 in
your pocket and interest rates are 10%
what would be the future value of your
money in one year in three years and in
five years so let's see so I have $800
all right and I would want to know what
shall be the future value of it one year
later so we are today over here so today
would generally be termed as y0 okay so
get conversant with these notations so Y
zero means today at this point of time
so if I were to look at the future value
of this $800 a year later you would say
that's easy we just did it it will be
800 into 1 plus the interest rate I'm
going to use R for interest rate instead
of I so that there is no confusion so
this would be 800 into 1.1 because R is
your 10% so that's zero point zero one
zero point one so that
makes it eight hundred and eighty
dollars so that is what it is going to
be one year down the line absolutely
correct and two years down the line we
won't want to know it we would not would
want to know the future value in three
years time so let's say three years time
you will have three compounding cycles
isn't it
so 800 into 1.1 this will get further
reinvested at 10% and hence would become
800 into 1.1 Square and this would get
further reinvested to finally give you
800 into 1.1 cube so I'm not calculating
it I think this is something that you
guys would be able to do it easily so
let me just show you the working so this
is how the expression would look like so
800 dollars into 1.1 cube so 3 when I'm
investing it for 3 years
so similarly when I invest it for 5
years it's going to be 800 into 1 point
1 raised to the power 5 all right
yes I would believe that the answers
that that that are coming in should be
absolutely correct so this would be 880
dollars so I would not know the maths of
this so 800 into 1.1 cube well you can
very well work it out it should be 800
into 1.33 1 so it's a this is something
that you would be able to work it out
and 800 into 1 point 1 to the power 5
all right so let's all move on to the
next question if we have one so let's
see so let me raise this alright so
there we have it calculate the future
value of $800 at the end of 10 years if
the annual interest rate is 4% yeah so
what should that be so $800 is what I've
invested today so what is going to be
the future value of it 10 years down the
line so we are over here
y 0 and then you have by 10 what shall
be the future value of it well it's
going to be 800 into 1 plus R which is 1
plus 0.04 4% is the interest rate this
is 4
to the part 10 all right so it's gonna
be 800 into 1 point 0 4 raised to the
part 10 now I'm getting a few consistent
answers one one eight four point one
nine so I believe that should be the
correct answer all right okay great
great
okay wonderful okay let me now move on
to the next one so I shall leave the
calculation aside I'm sure all of you
would be comfortable with that so we
just try and look at how how do we go
about working it out okay right so
calculate the future value after 20
years of an investment thousand dollars
which will be made after five years the
expected annual rate of return is 8%
let's see this let me just try and draw
the triangle around this is one practice
I think which you guys should get used
to I found it very very useful so here
we are y 0 and then you are going to
make the investment after five years so
after five years is when you are going
to make an investment of thousand
dollars all right and I am curious to
know the future value of it 20 years
from now okay so this is where I would
want to find out what is going to be the
future value of it
all right so how do we do it now you
would say between Y 5 and Y 20 you have
15 years going alright this is 15 years
so I have 15 years so my money is going
to be parked for 15 years so there will
be 15 compounding cycle which my
thousand dollars would undergo so
finally the future value will be
thousand dollars into one plus R which
is one point zero eight one plus 0.08
raised to the power 15 I hope this is
clear with everyone so one thousand into
one point zero eight raised to the power
15
all right so what do we get so that it
says it should be three one seven two
point one six nine would others agree
with that so 1000 into one point zero
eight raised to the power 15 saml has a
question which calculators should be we
should we be using I think you can use
the TI calculator the Texas Instrument
be a to professional version I think
that should be a pretty useful
calculator so there are two calculators
which are suggested by the Institute
Texas Instrument ba to is one of them
alright okay great
alright so let me now move on to the
next one before I do that let me just
erase this so given a discount rate of
8% what is the present value of 1500
cash flows that will be received in six
years let's draw the time line this is y
is 0 and at y 6 I'm going to receive
$1,500 so what is going to be the
present value of it what shall be the
present value of it and remember I get
the present value of the future cash
flow by discounting the future cash flow
is it so it's a future cash flow divided
by 1 plus R to the power n where n is
the number of periods so going by that
it should be $1,500 divided by your
interest rate is 8 percent so 1 point 0
8 to the power 6
I shall discount it to the extent of six
periods because there will be 6
discounting cycles I hope this is clear
with everyone all right ok so 1500
divided by one point zero eight to the
power 6 so what do we get
so rhythm says it's going to be 9:45
would others agree yeah because the Tesh
hit H gets 940 3.39
others are getting 9:45 so I think a
tissue just need to check ok great Oh
but this is how you would work it out
wonderful okay so there we go to the
next one okay now so now we have a new
topic within time value of money and
this is ordinary annuity so let's
understand what is the annual D I think
I'm just going to discuss angle T and
then try and close it there and just
make sure that we have time enough to
take questions I'm sure we would any
which ways have this topic in a
full-fledged manner and then when we
formally start off our course okay I
hope I hope you would appreciate that
and thanks for being there I know it's
quite late for some of you thanks for
being there so let's understand what's
what is enmity so far we'd been dealing
with single cash flows right so and most
of the questions that we've done either
we ended up finding out the present
value of a single future cash flow or we
found out the future value of a single
current cash flow what if I have a
series of cash flows so let me take an
example now I work for a year at a
particular place and I was getting a
salary of 50,000 I was getting 50,000
every month now this is an annuity I was
getting 50,000 every month at the end of
the month now this is annual tea okay
how many such cash flows did I get well
there were 12 such cash flows there were
12 such cash flows all of them were
50,000 each okay this kind of a cash
flow would be termed as annuity so how
would we define an annuity or how would
we understand annual T as an annuity or
rather an ordinary annuity would be your
equal periodic finite number of cash
flows okay so these are the three key
words equal periodic and finite so I'm
going to receive equal cash flows so
they are going to be even cash flows and
it's going to be periodic they are
spaced apart at equal intervals and they
are going to be finite in number so you
have 12 cash flows all together so this
is a classic enmity okay now in lot many
examples that we discuss in finance
well our cash flows are going to be
in the nature of an Matisse oh you're
gonna have the same set of cash flows
equal cash flows but it's going to be
multiple cash flows all right so that's
what would be termed as an annuity okay
so how would we arrive at the present
value of a series of such cash flows and
so I'm going to take a couple of
examples one way we will try to find out
the present value of annuity another
where we would look to find out the
future value of the energy so let me
take that okay so how would we arrive at
the future value of an ordinary annuity
now before I get started off with this
question let me take a simple example so
I'm gonna receive 50,000 at the end of
year 1 so let's call it your 1 so your I
am your 0 okay so then I have your 2 and
then I have your 3 so I'm going to
receive 50,000 at the end of year 1
50,000 at the end of year 2 50,000 at
the end of year 3 now I'm interested in
knowing the future value of these cash
flows so I invest 50,000 at the end of
year 150 at the end of your 250 at the
end of year 3 what's going to be the
future value of all these 3 cash flows
and when I say future value I'm
interested in knowing what shall be the
cumulative value of these deposits which
I'm making on a yearly basis which it's
more like a recurring deposit and let's
say the interest rate is 10 percent all
right so you would argue that 50,000
which you have invested at year 1 you
park it for two years this investment is
allowed to grow for the next two years
isn't it from i1 to y2 from y 2 to y 3
so you would say this 50 would become 50
into 1 plus R square so I'm just looking
at I'm just focusing on this single cash
flow so this would become 15 to 1 point
1 square this 50 would become 50 into 1
point 1 because this is invested for
just 1 year
and this 50 would remain as it is so you
would say hey the cumulative cash flow
or rather the cumulative future value of
these series of cash flows is going to
be fifty plus fifteen to one point one
plus fifteen to one point one square all
right now I'm of course not going to go
and do this by looking at every single
cash flow and then would look to find
out the future value of it we would try
and do it cumulatively in one single go
by one single expression I'm going to
take a couple of approaches one by way
of an expression and the other for some
of you who have the calculator and who
would be interested in knowing how to
use the calculator to arrive at the
future value I'm going to just give you
some sense of how do you use the TI
calculator to arrive at the future value
so but conceptually how do we go about
so you would say hey the future value of
annuity and I'm not going to go into the
derivation of this expression that's for
some other day so the future value of
the annuity is going to be the annuity
cash flow which you get every year
divided by R which I used to describe
interest rate into one plus R to the
power n where n is the number of such
deposits that you're making minus one
alright so this will give me this will
this would give me the future value of
the annuity so let me substitute so a is
fifty thousand so this is fifty thousand
so let's say 50,000 interest rate is ten
percent so that's going to be zero point
1 0 into 1 plus interest rate so that's
one plus point one so that becomes one
point 1 raised to the power n you have n
such payment so it's going to be because
it's going to become raised to the power
3 minus 1 so that would give you the
answer that would give you the answer to
this particular question to this
particular illustration that we discuss
all right so I hope this is clear with
everyone so let's very quickly go to
this example and see what would my
expression look like okay so in this
case we have eight years of eight such
payments being made or being received at
the end of each of the first 80
assuming the interest rate is 6% what is
the future value after 10 years ok so
let's do this and I think I would end my
discussion on time value at least with
this question and then I would leave the
floor open to you Q&amp;amp;A so let's very
quickly do this
so let me raise this alright so we know
that the future value is given by and
with T divided by R into 1 plus R to the
power n minus 1 let's use this here I
have a tan line where I'm making deposit
or rather I'm receiving money every year
for the next day's here so it's y1 y2
and so on till I come to Y H ok so I'm
gonna give I'm gonna get 2,000 every
year for the next 8 years
all right and I would want to know what
shall be the future value of it after 10
years so this is where I would want to
know what is the future value how do we
do it
now you would say let's first get the
future value of this at this point of
time because this expression helps you
arrive at the future value at YH and we
would say the future value at year 8 is
going to be 2000 divided by R which is
the interest rate which in this case is
0.06 1.06 to the power 8 because there
are eight such payments minus one
alright so this gives me the future
value at your rate now how do I arrive
at the future value at your 10 now
whatever value that you get so let's say
this is FB 8 and you arrive at 8 now
that's a value at y 8 for me to arrive
at y-tan all that I need to remind
myself is that this amount will get
reinvested for another two years so it
will allow one would allow this amount
to grow for another two years so there
will be another two compounding cycles
so very quickly if I were to replace it
with future value
period ten well that's going to be
multiplying it with 1.06 to the part two
where I'm going to compound it further
for another two years and that's how I
would use I would arrive at the future
value so finally your answer should be
this 2,000 divided by 0.06 into one
point zero six to the power 8 minus 1
into 1 point zero six squared so that
gives me the future value of it at your
10 now this is how you do it if I were
to do it well by way of a simple
calculator well if I have a financial
calculator a TI Texas Instruments so
this is how I would do it I would say
well not you're gonna have four people
who have it greatly they can use the
calculator for others who don't have it
I mean I would just simply try and
introduce certain terms now within the
financial calculator you will have a tab
called PMT okay so there is going to be
a button called PMT which stands for
word what's a regular payment on the
regular receipts that you are getting so
in payment you're going to feed in 2000
in the number of such payments which
will show up as a tab n okay so there is
there's another button called n you
would say 8 well there is no PV so you
would feed in 0 as far as PV is
concerned and then I by Y stands for the
interest rate and that is 6% so you
shall feed in 6 and then you would say
compute there is a tab called compute
compute FV and it will give you this
face value this will give you 2,000 by
0.06 into 1 point zero 6 to the power 8
minus 1 that's the future value that
will be thrown up by the calculator that
means the future value at your rate
don't forget to multiply it with one
point zero six square to get the future
value at your 10 all right so that's how
you would arrive at it now don't be too
surprised or don't get baffled if you
get the future value negative because
that's the calculators way of
understanding that if the PMT is 2000
that means if I am getting 2000 every
year alright so this is an inflow so
what is exactly if I'm getting 2000
every
for the next eight years what is it that
I would have to give back at your tent
well that amount would be thrown up by
the calculator
okay the calculator would understand
inflows as cash flows with one kind of
sign and outflows as cash flows with
another sign so I would suggest when you
work out your problems you should take
inflows as positive cash flows and you
should feed them as positive numbers if
you have a problem dealing with cash
outflows you should simply take them as
negative numbers when you feed them into
the calculator okay if you don't do so
well sometimes the calculator is going
to throw up an error especially when you
try and arrive at IRR internal rate of
return without really paying attention
to the sign of cash flows you're most
likely to get an error term all right
okay so I think I would I would stop
your and I shall leave the floor open to
questions and let me very quickly go to
the last set of slides I think where I
have okay let me raise this alright so I
would skip this for for some other day
okay so there we go
so what are the advantages of clearing
the exam now in case if some of you are
contemplating whether to write in
December or would you want to write it
in June for people who register
themselves for December I think you
should just go for it
for the simple reasons if you crack your
cfa level one in December you are you
are or you're well poised to write your
level two in June and then June 2016
level two June 2017 level three so you
save almost a year I think that's a lot
of time all right
in case if you've decided to go for this
course I would say congratulations it's
a gold standard course acknowledged
worldwide I mean you go anywhere in East
Singapore China and Japan or let's say
Middle East Europe or the USA I think
CFA is acknowledged all
in all countries and in the finance
industry so I would I would suggest that
in case if you're working of course this
being a self-study course just gives you
an opportunity to pursue the
professional course and you don't really
need to give up your work so for
somebody who is into some kind of an
industry would look to switch over to
financers genuinely interested towards
finance not that you need to quit your
work you can very well pursue it while
working alright so I think some of you
would have kind of made up your mind
some of you would still be thinking
about it in case if you are they're on
board I would say congratulations join
the club there you have a great journey
ahead all right so all right okay great
so let me just take up a few questions
so okay all right okay so we have a
question from Karthik he's asking apart
from class recording to you do we have
extra video tutorials for all chapters
and modules yes there would be Karthik
kind of keep it in mind that I'm talking
from the perspective of December exam so
our course would be launching from from
I think from seven days or a week from
now so we would basically have two
months or rather eight weeks so some of
the topics would be provided by way of
video tutorials and topics which are a
little more technical in nature which
would require a bit of explanation we
would try it we would be looking to
cover it by way of life sessions alright
so for example a bit of ethics a lot of
economics would be provided by way of
recorded tutorials but derivatives
fixed-income Kwan's I mean I would I
would I would look at taking it life
okay yeah
Rajat is asking what's the scope in
India III think it's expanding Graduate
if you would have asked me this question
ten years back not many people knew
about CFA but today I think the industry
even in India is beginning to note
this this particular course so
especially in the K POS and the high-end
K POS I think CFA you know makes it very
very easy for you for you to make an
entry a lot of my students are there in
investment banks so okay all right let
me just expand the question window so
that I can just have a good look all
right
so frmo CFA is what permission is asking
well that depends on permission what
you're looking for so if you are
somebody who's still naive and Finance
and is and you're looking at a general
finance course then I think CF is a
better bet frm is a little more
specialized so I think frm is for people
who have a bit of background in finance
okay for wealth management any day CFA
for wealth management any day CFA
permission the Jew is asking CF is
considered core for corporate finance
even in India
well corporate finance and India they
look at CAS CFA mba finance almost from
you know the same lens but I think being
a CA as well as the CF it just gives you
an advantage if you don't have a CA CFA
almost becomes essential for you to make
an entry into corporate finance not much
of a difference Britta
I think merchant banking is almost like
a passe now you use the term investment
banking more often than merchant banking
level one candidates they could get jobs
but not I would not say really high
salary fetching bonds but yes in terms
of experience yes it is level one
candidates do get jobs and it always
makes sense to take up some kind of a
job because I think that just makes your
profile stronger
yes permission it is but I think a CFA
is if I may say so it is a much more
respectable core CFP is great I think
it's specially cut out for wealth
management financial planning
CFA is it looks at financial planning
but at the same time it looks at asset
valuation so did that extend it's a
little more broader in scope okay and
CFA is an international degree so I
think it just gives you greater job
graphical mobility Hirsch is asking
should we have any any work experience
before clearing CFA
not necessarily well I if I can
understand your question correctly
Hirsch if you if you're saying
CFA level one well you don't really need
any work experience for level two level
three do you really need any work
experience in terms of clearing the exam
not no not really but I think it helps
in terms of you know improving your job
prospects I always ask my students the
doctor level one you should just look
out for some kind of a relevant
experience and upper level to look out
for something a little more serious
because I think this that just increases
your value your marketability once
you've cleared your level three I would
be a little scary of situation there you
have a fresh whole who's done is level
one two three and it's still a fresher
okay then the context is slightly
different harsh being a CA final student
do you have articleship with you so to
that extent I think a CA and the CFA a
combination would do well it would be it
a choux dishes you know interested in
being a value investor trader
well value investor and trader these are
two different things
value investor definitely I think CFA
would help for a trader well you need to
make up your mind
CFA definitely gives you so let's let me
just see in case if we have any question
okay oh I think the other questions you
guys can now I would I will just try and
see if I could okay I think I have kind
of answered most of it Harsha all these
classes would be done online so I think
you know being in Hyderabad of Mumbai or
anywhere for that matter in India or
outside India you're well
place to take our sessions whether these
sessions are going to be online these
are going to be live and of course you
would have the content coming from Wiley
so iron uncle would be taking you
through the course and and you would of
course have the Wiley content with you
and all of it would be provided to you
online okay
so I hope you guys can now also try and
visit our website so Eddy Rica Arabica
so in case if you've got the link it's
wonderful so anyway cup and of course
you would have the CH in level one page
over there so I would insist that all of
you should try and visit our our web
page and act upon it in case if you're
interested well Nikita it's never too
late so negatives asking would eight
weeks be enough for preparation and
mocks I would say well yes but it's
never too late a day as 24 hours Nikita
and we just need three hundred dollars
from you and there we are okay so I'll
just very quickly guys go to the I'm
just try and show you so there we have
it so while the page gets loaded alright
so there we have it so I hope all of you
are able to see the page so okay thanks
guys thanks for being there I know it's
pretty late for some of you and see you
hope to see all of you
thanks thanks good good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
