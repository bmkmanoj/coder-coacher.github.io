mastering regex in pole so what is a
regular expression in fact what is a
pole so before that I just wanted to
give you a small induction about pole
and then we continue with the regular
expression part so let's get started so
what is the agenda for today objective
is we discuss about pole we discuss
about what are the benefits of using
pole what are the advantage of whole
scripting as well as some of the regular
expression we are going to touch today
as well as i provide lot of examples on
how we do the request station so that is
a complete agenda for today it's a
one-hour session and i try to discuss as
much as I can what is full so i hope
that you have a basic idea of paul it if
not i just try to give you a fair
understanding what fall is all stands
for practical extraction and report
language so this is the name given to
the pole that's what i mean actually
arrived from by are you all who is a
creator of pol pol is one of the most
successful as well as open source
scripting language available nowadays it
is heavily used everywhere even if s for
the survey all the 500 fortune companies
are using pole as their primary
scripting language now oh why pole why
pole that is a most important question
people ask why we use for why not any
other language now when we discuss about
pole you know a maze most important
thing in both is it is very user
friendly very very user friendly it
provides a lot of features which are not
available in any language as well as a
pole moto is you can do the thing in
different ways many ways in fact i can
say so like for example if you want to
write a very small basic if if
conditional statement so you can write
it in different different different
phase so you have operated available you
can write in blocks you can write in
single execute to the statement as well
and so on so any any operations you want
to perform you can do it in different
different ways using for now the most
important thing is all
is regularly updating itself so like for
example a new technologies coming to the
market if you speak about for Hadoop or
maybe any other technologies which are
very new to the market or existing from
last some time so pearl adopted it very
well because it has a huge number of
programmers who work day and night no to
provide it the open source community
which actually accept the things and try
to do it in this in this video way the
second important point about poll is it
is platform defend independent so the
languages like C C++ which are more
platform dependent so if you are writing
a program in windows system you know you
can execute directly in Linux system
without changing a single line of code
the only thing you require is an
interpreter so that is the most
important thing over here now another
thing is Paul is having a regular
expression or egg expression which is
our main topic for today regular
expression is ill bit in built-in poll
so how the inbuilt feature of
registration is going to help us out
inbuilt regular expression is going to
help us out in case of data filtration
mmm data substitutions as well as data
transformation if you talk about let's
say that the ticket analysis you know
where you are handling hell lot of data
so pull became a very very important and
at particular point because you get a
huge amount of prevalent as well as
irrelevant data and you you have to
fetch few few data out of it then you
know the languages like poll become a
very very important for analysis
purposes even pole know as a Swiss Army
cheese snow of scripting language
because it has in fact various features
to work on so this is a very very fair
understanding about pole and what are
the benefits of using pole definitely it
is very easy to learn because it has
very few keywords simple structure and
clearly defined syntax like unlike in in
the programming language C C++ where you
just wanted to write a simply hello
world program so you have to include lot
of libraries and based on that no you
execute your prints type printf
statement and you get a result out of it
now in pole you don't have to do
anything like that you simply file a
print statement
it is all done so it is very
user-friendly you know it provides you
the features which are very common in
any in the scripting language so it is
very very easy to learn definitely you
require some instructor to perform these
activities in such a way in a more
faster way so pole become a very
important at that particular aspects
second one is portability put abilities
as I repeat that it is platform
independent so whether you are writing a
program in Windows Mac or any other OS
no you switch your program easily from
one operating system to the other
resistor without changing a single line
of code databases infraction now this is
one of the greatest point pole that it
provides interaction with or the
commercial and non-commercial databases
if you speak about databases like Oracle
if you speak about sybase if you speak
about your data my sequel hole has a
single interface with it so that
interface is called as dbi database
infraction so if you're walking in any
databases you can easily interact with
the databases with the help of pole know
and that is common that is common you
just require a database drivers in this
cases include your database drivers and
execute your food standard libraries now
this is the strongest point poll has and
which is upgrading day by day a standard
libraries like for example if you want
to interaction with Haru / if you want
to interaction with the maybe xls file
if you want an interaction with XML
files whole provide almost 20,000
different kind of libraries through
which you can connect to the servers or
any other application in future data or
maybe interacted with that in a
particular the another beautiful point
about pearl is its it is hard automatic
memory memory management as well as
garbage collection so you don't need to
worry about Daniel pointer which you
might face in C++ or any of the
languages because at a time when you
come out of the scope pearl you know to
the memory management automatically
without bothering the use so this is one
of the important point other benefits of
using folates it is object oriented
although object oriented concepts you
have are applied on pole very very easy
debugging techniques so Paul has inbuilt
debugger as well and as well as there
are a lot of editors are available so
that you can do the debugging
capabilities
high level very high level data types
and operations it has so it is it is
very common you know easy to remember as
well as the programs are very scalable
in poll unlike you have seen in UNIX
shell scripting on any other okay so
there is there is a small history before
we start our main topic for today about
Paul Paul is is very mature now it was
first created by Larry wall in 1987 so
it is almost more than 20 80 years so it
is very mature language and you know it
is one of the primary scripting language
most of the company uses nowadays so how
Larry wall decided to write a pole pole
was actually written as a single command
like grape ox-head we have an initial
scripting but later on that you other a
lot of evolvement happening happening in
pole lot of programmers joined him and
created for a new scripting language
nowadays you know we are using pole 50
pal 5 version in most of the systems
pole 5 is almost a very old system or
old programming version we have and that
what's we are going to use the very
first thing if you want to check it out
whether the pole is installed in your
system or not you go to the command
prompt so I use Windows system here you
can use definitely any any any other
system you want you say pol- so it gives
you the complete description about the
version you have in your system so it
says this is a pole 5 so this is the
pole 5 version which we are going to
discuss and its version is 16 it's 5.16
and so version is 3 so 5.1 6.3 and it is
used for windows 64-bit machine so
similarly so if you want to install a
polynomial simply there are two versions
are available in Windows system one is
strawberry perl and another one is
active pole just go to active polo
strawberry perl downloaded directly so i
just wanted to show you before we start
go there there are the binary is
available just go and install how the
software's like you install in similar
way you can install the software's in
your machine
just downloaded the latest version we
have is full 52.0 2.2 so just go there
click it and it just installed the exe
on your machine double click your esc
and you're you know the pole is
installed in your system and the other
one is of strawberry perl but here you
come in to install activex pole because
of its various features like ppm and
others so it is preferred that you
install activex fallen emotions and all
the Linux systems on the unique system
Paul is by default available over here
if you see my reddit kleenex box I go
here okay I say pol- so it is by default
available over here this is Paul I point
z10 Watson but there is not much
differences between these versions
because you know the only thing is then
most of the new things are getting
included most packages and all as well
as lot of bugs has been resolved in the
newer version so you can install any
version after 5.8 and that will be more
than enough for doing the programming
info now the next thing is where we can
use pole we can use the simple answer is
everywhere so there is not any specific
reasons where we cannot use for it has
started with database programming may be
any kind of data developers you have a
targeting whip scrapping internet
scripting system utilities this
processing etl so if you speak about etl
the transformation layer is completely
buildin regular expression so this is
you can create your complete scripts and
you can create your complete
transformation with the help of a poll
as well as you can use it in networking
programming where you are have a
client-server protocols and you are just
from a client you're connecting to the
server and extracting a data out of it
so this is a basic uses apart from this
you can do anything you want in pole
it's from web scrapping where you
extracting a data from different web
pages and showing to your website so you
have seen lot of websites are available
which are doing the similar kind of
stuff if you talk about any flight
booking websites so what they does they
just go to the service fact information
so in showing
their web pages and then you can do the
fight booking similarly for hotel
bookings photo com booking.com so these
are the common websites you know which
uses scripting language for different
different fifth scrapping purposes apart
from this hat targeting is one of the
important thing where you have to put
specific ads based on the user's cookies
and all know so at a time you require
the language which have a faster
response and poll provides it so it
becomes you it becomes very important
for you to find out the language which
which provides you more faster responses
in any other language and pol is
mastered in death so now we come to the
main topic for today so not that we use
for what is for what are the benefits of
using poll and what are the traditional
uses of using poll this is what we do
now we come to the main topics which is
regular expression so what is the
expression Greg inspiration is a whole
concept is a very in fact pretty old
concept 1950s one of the mathematician
you know came up with the string of
characters which performs some basic
kind of operations so leg expression is
common in every scripting language
whether you speak about Paul whether you
speak about unix shell scripting is
creepy powered Python you speak about
Ruby you know this regulation remain
common so there is always guards remain
common every every features of regular
expression become common so if you try
to concentrate over here you know
whatever against patient we are going to
read here it is common for the other
language only differences is there their
sin taxes might be different because in
Python if we use a regular expression we
import the regular expression library
into a namespace and we try to run our
program in all it is by default
available in the system so you don't
have to important libraries and start
working on it in unix shell scripting
you use all crepe set these kind of
duties using regular expressions very
heavily today are common everywhere so
what is Wrigley expression regulation is
a set of characters together join and
form a pattern venues of Wrigley
expression is to match pattern in any
string format so like for example it in
notepad plus plus also let's say you
provide or against phishing to source
something so some particular word let's
say I
want to find a word which is started
with t know so i use regular expression
in this particular cases because you
know I want that word should start with
capital p maybe so and maybe I want to
say that okay do some fine in the place
feature in which I want to find some
specific Ford and I substitute it with
different but maybe I want to do the
transformation as well like for example
I want to replace all zeros by nine
maybe all a's by a J maybe so any kind
of transformation we can able to perform
so in pole you know these registration
very very fast because they are in built
and they provide a superb combinations
of my cards characters which commonly
used together and form a regular
expression i come to the practical
session that how we use this regular
expression in pole so i hope that you
have very very basic idea about pole in
which how we write the the if statement
and how we open a file in all so that it
will be easy for us to understand what
is erica expression is so in real world
let's say India you a lot of issues when
you are receiving a call from 140 okay
if I have a software which which filter
out all the numbers which are started
with 140 our life become more easy
because all these calls are getting
filtered out when it is receiving to us
maybe let's say you are is you you have
a block files of 5 GB and you you want
to find out specific error out of it
then again you require some kind of
languages which iterate through the logs
and get the revelant information out of
it maybe you have some real time data
system in which we are receiving a data
from any system and we want to filter
out those data and may be substituted
data or maybe store into a database is
all those all those things become very
easy when we speak about regular
expression so regular expression are
also called as reg ex as so we are going
to use them in in pole as it is but the
first thing which we are going to
discuss about s match operator the match
orbits its use for matching things like
for example if you want to match a word
specific word
now in this example what we have done so
when we are using the matching operator
we have equal to till design so equal to
his assignment until design we have to
use to say that ok I am going to match
this particular string in any any
variable or opposite offices negation of
negation and followed by a tilde it says
it is unable to so if it is enabled it
returns true and the first cases if it
is able to match it to turn school so
like the program is started from nine
number nine so say I have a defined a
variable I say dollar string equal to
and have some values inside it so this
is my test string to test rig X and I've
put into the if conditional statement as
well as is conditional statement and we
say if my string which is a variable
here Colleen contains the word string or
not you know here we are checking it out
whether it contains a string or non-hit
contain a string it print a word
otherwise what it does it says it does
not contain a swing like for example
here so i have a very simple program the
x1 okay so this is the same thing that
may remove this statement this is not
just on a string
op
which let's make it a starting an end
point so then I use here /is it's a
string containing word string
you
followed by Paul again okay this is the
one okay and I said Paul followed by the
x per se string contain the string word
so let's say if I remove the string word
from here maybe I put capital strength
because this is case insensitive okay
sensitive so now it says it does not
contain a string word because I've use a
capital word here so let's run this you
know they say string does not contain a
string word so this is we are doing a
very basic matching over here in which
we try to compare whether the string it
contains you know a word string or not
now ah this regular expressions are case
sensitive so if I try to make it case
insensitive we use the modifiers now
what are the modifiers modifiers are the
special correct curse which make my
oracle expression as i want so let's i
use a modifier for less I so when I use
a modifier called as I it make my
expression case insensitive so here we
have a capital string and i have a small
string so definitely it is going to
match because with the help of I
modifier I make it case-insensitive now
going forward we are going to see what
are different kind of modifiers call
providers and how we are going to use in
our programs so this is a very basic
example in which we are trying to match
with a string whether it contains a
spring or not now I move forward now
hear this remember that we use equal to
enter lesson if I if I don't use it what
I am trying to do I'm trying to store so
this is always true there is I try to
store a string inside with which is
always true so if i put here maybe
shuttin it always returns true because
at the time i do the assignments i am
not doing the regular expression
matching if i have to use stata here if
I have to use notation I have to sit
negation and followed by it and this for
one might say string contains string
work so maybe I have to change this a
bit a message of it so that it won't be
it will be explanatory so in this case
you know how this is how we can able to
match the things in pole and that we
move forward and maybe we see more
examples ok the next example is let's
say I want to match something I want to
read something from a user and store it
into the fire so first thing what I done
is I have open a file and using a 500
here is go file and we open it into the
right mode and if we are unable to open
a file its it just exit from a program
with the diocese now a line number 5 we
simply say we just printing a statement
to the user type done when you are
finished typing and we are reading it
you know line by line from a user so
when the user give when when the user
give the input as done now this is again
case sensitive then because i don't use
any modifier over here and it's 64 done
if it has done it come out of a program
and close it so let's let's let's try to
run this program so here it is what it
says it open a file into write mode so
if the file is already present it is
trying to truncate and you know again
try to write a data into it and if the
file is not present it will create the
same so let's run this program so we
suppose britax ok there's a type done
when you're finished so whatever I type
here let's I type here this is the line
number one in the Phi ok spelling
mistake no problem this is the line
number two in the five ok now i sit down
what happen when I so when it says done
you know it comes out of my happened to
the file the file has been created and
we should have a Content equal to what I
have to in so see the spelling mistakes
comes over here sort it this is the new
five we have I say this is line number
one of the file and this is
line number two in the file so in this
particular case is you know I can able
to write a content to a five with the
help of regular expression so we say
because this is a whenever I try to give
the input it accepted and based on that
it performs operation so this is the
second example we have in which we try
to read the input from a user and try to
write it to the fight now these are the
very very basic operation because we
just use the matching now the things
comes into picture which is wild card
which makes our eggy expression more
understanding now the first wild card we
have is dot or PDF now dot or period now
as I say that these y cards are common
for every every language which has
regular expression so there is no such
exceptions we have so whatever the Y
cards we are going to discuss it common
for every every every scripting language
which has a regular expression features
the first one we have dot or period dot
represent any single character except
slashin so it can be a character it can
be a desert or it can be any
alphanumeric character but it should not
match / and it matched space as well it
matched tab as well but it won't match /
in so let's say I have a string which
contains some statements so this is my
taste string to test rig X so this a
variable which holds some statement and
line number 3 we are matching it out
whether the string contains m dot so m
dot says M followed by any single
character yeah that's true because my
string contains m why so this is
completely true in second example we say
m dot dot so we say m followed by
anything any any two characters so that
is true because thought is also matches
space where we have em followed by Y
followed by a space so it is going to
match it as well now the next case we
have is we say a string contain X
followed by any single character so we
say X followed by dot if you notice here
we have x over here in a reg ex now x is
is a last character over here we don't
have any character followed by it
so definitely this statement is not
going to be executed this statement is
the regulation it is not going to return
a true value so that's why we are not
going to see this particular print
statement in our output now we say dot
followed by T so this is quite true
because we have seen that here if you
speak about this test p EST because
registration also map always match a
first character so it try to match test
here so it is a dot followed by the yes
it is also going to match so we are
going to see this into our output and
next last one we have is dot T naught
dot T if you notice here we have ulti
available at a very first character in
my string so we say dot T naught T is
this a any character followed by T so we
don't have any character so it this is
not going to be printed so in this
example rig extry so if i try to run
this program i just remove this because
this is not a valid one okay so i try to
run this whole like x3 okay so we have
only three matching here this one this
one and this one so we are not going to
match line number five as X is not short
followed by any character and seventh
because any character and followed by T
is not present in mind I hope it is
clear in case you have any questions you
know we try to discuss it so there is a
cushion from as ass if he says that is
there any course focused on pole for
analytics M can be applied to any system
admin yeah we do have you know when
we've been able we discuss about a pole
you know we we start these forces from
very basic till the end so we discuss
about networking here we discuss about
databases interfaces we discuss about
ribs crafting we discuss about
interaction with several kind of
interfaces you know so it is completely
focused we discuss about graphics we
discuss about how to create graphs out
of a data we have we discuss about file
handling so the force which we provide
needed a car contains all those stuff
I oppas audits answer your question okay
so there is a cushion from lithia he
says that can you explain the last
sprint statement okay the last plaintiff
statement says God followed by T now God
richter followed by but in my string you
know we don't have any follow character
over here because this is the start of
the spring and because that's why we put
into focus let's say if I put something
space over here or maybe I put some tea
over here or maybe 0 over here now the
last statement returns true because here
that that is expectation from our
particular crystal sure if i run this i
get the last statement down as well make
sense is this answer a question with you
pretty cool thank you now let's say in
case i have to match i have to match dot
itself because sometimes we see in that
email ids email ids contain dot and user
calm and maybe IP addresses IP address
it contains IP if you speak about IP for
it is it had three different dots in
case if i want to match dot but these
why characters loses their spatial
meaning when we say backslash followed
by here in this example if you say m
followed by back slash dot now here all
exactly looking for a dot neither for
any any character we should have a dot
over here then only it will match it so
like example if i run the statement now
it won't give me the for statement
because here we exactly looking for a
dot now if you see here the next example
we have is match operator so let's see
here now I want to match 10 dot11 dot 1
to 1 dot tutu now I want to look for
exact IP addresses ok so what I do is
escape this character with the help of
backslash and when I say backs and I
start it exactly looking for the
character let's say here the IP address
has 10 dots desert because I have a
message here which contains IP addresses
so when I exactly looking for a dot it
match similarly in the last statement if
you see pray the sixth statement it's a
backslash dollar IP so what this
backslash meaning is its suppress it
separates the special meaning of dollar
now in pull the dollar means it's a
scalar variable so it exactly looking
for a dollar IP if you try to run this
which is my program here it is let me
check it out
okay so this is not the one let me write
this program in fact so we put here okay
so let's say I have IP address i give I
p equal to ten dot11 dot 1 2 dot 13 now
this is my string see this program would
say I save this program is free kicks
for dot PL ok now we say here if I p
contains dollar IP contains 10 dot this
is the case this is not a valid valid IP
we are looking for if I tried this let's
say I simply put here IP matched /a not
on this let me clear this and say all
followed by reg ex for okay so HIIT
match still this IP is correct because
this God it is looks for any character
right match for three but if I put back
/ here then we say exactly looking for
such as it won't give me any or because
in this particular case it is not a
valid IP so if I have to provide dot
here then only this is going to be nice
so whenever we try to escape any
wild-card character we simply give back
/ to that character in that case it will
be match for those character mix-ins
okay now the next thing is otherwise
heartbreakers we have now this is again
common for every scripting language as a
logical expression the worst wildcards
we have a star what is star star says
match zero or more occurrence of
previous character like for example that
same I agree regular expression is like
this I simply put here a beast are so
what it match which is zero or more
occurrence of previous letter what is
the previous character here we have be
so it match for a it match for a be it
match for a BBB it match for a bbbbb any
advance is number of attention so it
match for a followed by a number of
occurrences of starting from if I put
like this so it says he followed by a be
followed by zero or more occurrence of
it says a be followed by zero or more
occurrence of previous character which
is see graphic our string now this is
the matching string of a BBB let's say
okay now here we put
so it case it contains a be cool I get
it so now let's say if I give star here
now what I start says it says it should
match a followed by zero or more
occurrence of p yes we do have is a
followed by zero or more occurrence of p
now if i try to run this i get the same
output again but if i say here a be bc
now we say a followed by p
so when I try to because this this this
matching does not exist so this is
another wildcard character we have
fine
ask a question somebody raised a hand do
you have any questions just can you can
you please type it down pronoun please
problem when I said it was by mistake no
problem if you have any questions just
let me know I take a pause here
thank you let's continue the next
wild-card character we have in our list
is plus now plus is almost same as star
the only difference between plus and
star is plus says match one appearance
or more occurrence of previous character
now star says match zero occurrence or
more reference plus says match one
occurrence or more reference in this
case followed by be followed by C 1
occurrence on put here ABC ccc it match
that if we see is a BCC because here 0
whoa sorry one or more occurrence of
previous character let's say I if I put
like this a B b-plus what do you think
it is going to match or not what do you
guys think it is going to match or not
no it won't yes correct yes correct it
won't how do people say is yes it won't
because we say a but it's a poor a crime
writer than this I do any output but if
we put star here what do you guys think
it is going to match or not now
yes many people say yes yes it is true
it is going to match now because we say
a yes that is we have B yes we have this
is zero or more occur this character yes
we we don't have any occurrence so it is
going to match now because plus says one
or more occurrence stars says zero or
more intense so these are the two
registration we have I hope that okay we
shall have some question we shall raise
his hand we shall do you want to ask any
question here now again by mistake ok
leave it don't hesitate to ask any
questions you can stop me in between and
ask a question ok the next one we have
is the next one we have is yeah yeah we
shall go ahead please any questions you
have just type it down please what do
you want me to one meet you
we shall can you type your question
please otherwise I have to proceed
further okay we shall say is star is 40
or more recurrence of previous character
or any character only previous character
so in this case what is the previous
character we have the previous red
crispy let's see here the previous
crater is see you put 0 here the
previous vector is 0 so only the
previous character not all the character
but if I put a brace is here brackets
yes a bee B star C will match it
definitely a BBC it will match yeah you
have to correct here so now you
understand the concept that how the
matching is happening with the star and
plus the next wild-card character in our
lives this ? now ? is the same as is
same with belonging to this family it
says cushion mark says 0 or 1 at trends
now it don't say many errands it's a 0
or 1 occurrence so like for example here
I put a bee D ? what is the previous
character here pushing my 0 or 1
occurrence of previous color
I get contain ATP because you say ? says
zero or exactly one occurrence of
previous character okay so we can also
put also match two different characters
here like like for example if I say m
dot star so what it says followed by
so you
you
you
I space zero or more occurrence of any
spaces so definitely it is going to
return as I put hair instead of that
input here true okay so we say s
followed by any space any n number of
spaces zero or more spaces after s make
sense motion does this answer your
question pretty good thank you now we
have seen three wildcard characters with
one is Star Plus and ? star represents
zero or more reference plus represent
one or more occurrence ? represent one
or zero reference now this is a few
examples we have ABC star so it's a a
for it by a small be followed by see any
zero or more occurrence of see directors
now we see a b c plus it's a a followed
by be followed by see one or more
occurrence of previous character this is
a followed by be4 it by c 0 or 1
occurrence of previous character not in
other cases we have CD star it's a one
or more reference of CD sorry zero or
more occurrence of CD next case CD plus
one or more reference of CD ABCD cushion
mark it is 0 or 1 occurrence of CD so
these examples are written over here you
can verify with the with the regular
expression we have
you
I'll go to any questions here so now we
see more things about another cushion is
asked why we shall can we give a star
and plus together now you know when we
give star or plus we should decide a
one-character now if you want to make it
a statement like this a let's say a plus
B star then it works but won't work
because here it is a confused whether
it's a pretty what is a previous
character here either you have to
suppress it one of them you can see in
this way a plus B star with a a one or
more occurrences be zero or more
references mixes
okay thanks rychelle okay let me proceed
further now we can we can combine these
wild cards as we have discussed just now
so let's say for example a B plus C star
a dot c plus dot dot c ? again to
character followed by zero or one
occurrence of C let's say if we want to
take HTML tags or if you want to match
some XML tags also we can put inside
these particular diamond operators
between that we can put anything we want
so anything inside this particular tax
and if I want to suppress you know
brackets as well because we have seen
that brackets have special meaning we
can put back / followed by braces and
then proceed further and last example we
say ap plus cease ? so it's a a one
occurrence be any number of occurrences
c 0 or 1 Atkins's so it will match those
correct curves we have again we have one
important thing that is called as a
character class now corrected class we
put inside the bracket square bracket or
the first character class it's let's say
ABC so it says either a either be either
sleeper only single character you can
also have a complete alphabets we say a
to z we can also define it in a hyphen
said so it says all all the traitorous
like for example here maybe tengo I want
to doubt whether or not we put into a
EIU they say if the city contains either
a either e either I either Oh either you
it returns true otherwise it says that
the city does not contain water so if I
try to run this
prisoners it returns true because it
contains wobbles it contains a it
contain oh it could in E but the first
match is going to be returned me true I
can also put a to z if I put a a to z
any any any Alpha babe so let's say if I
put capital e to capital not here we are
exactly because we this this regulations
are case sensitive but here we say
regular expression a until the end but
these are in capital letters so when I
try to run this now I have a B which is
in capital so it returns true if B is in
a small it won't return make sense okay
so this way you know we can define all
those way I can have more characters
over here let's say if I give bought
here dot says it exactly looking for a
dot if I say underscore it exactly
looking for underscore I can also have a
combination like this 029 so it man I
want to say now each and everything can
match a complete occurrences so plus one
or more occurrence of any kind of tears
out of it we can combine them as well
the last case if you see you say a to
say it and underscore so it match all
the alphabets along with the funders for
transfer if it contains underscore you
know it matches that particular string
as well negate negatives just opposite
of that so like for example if I say the
string does not contain ABC I said Nick
it or carrot of ABC if I say the string
does not contain from any alphabet I say
a to z similarly negate a twosie negate
AE I you you and I say IL followed by
not equal to a pc it says the string
should have i or l sorry should have
small L or
del L followed by none of these
characters neither a neither be neither
see similarly we can also have it like
this not a to z which I have a string
like this please pay ten dollars we say
02 check it out
say the string should not contain 02 so
if I try to run this it gives me nothing
because string contains 10 string
contains 10 make sense sorry it inside
it here the outside it has different
meaning inside it's a negative that it
should not contain those values so few
more examples we say a either a either
capital a this is 029 for it by any
character we say a number of occurrences
followed by any character followed by
dot all ? inside that we have dot ? so
it represent the same it is not a
wild-card character here so if you put
anything inside your square brackets it
match for exactly that particular word
this is a followed by either be either
see we say capital A for it by either a
either be either C 0 or 1 occurrences we
say A to Z underscore dot followed by
either it so in this examples you know
the wildcard characters make things
happening for you do you like for
example if you might want to match IP
address or if you want to match the
email id like for example if you have a
file which contains hell out of email
ids you want to bill only email addys
out of it now you quit LOL perfectly
efficient you can do very easily because
you know what are the wildcards it doing
what are the character class we have and
you make the combination and fit-out put
out of it so crater class also
represented by shortcuts so these are
the meanings now backslashes it says
number of spaces tab or newline
character opposite of that is capital s
so similarly n it is it 029 opposite of
that is capital d we say any word or any
digit character or underscore it
represented by /w and opposite of that
is / capital double like for example
here
if i put / w plus what does it mean it
says zero to nine or underscore match
now a complete
when i try to indefinitely
you
you
you
you
you
examples which you can use while writing
the registration grouping rate out of it
pressure data from a string some more
metacharacters we have now carrot says
starting say start like for example here
if I put pay it should contain page
returns true true but if i put here
start with pay start the string should
start with pay or not true because the
string is starting with please so if i
replace it by please hear it returns
true because now my string starts with
please so carrot say is outside the
character class carrot says starting on
the string similarly we have end also it
is it printed by dollar strangers
you
even one occurrence of C maximum two
occurrences of see in the next case it
says exactly one occurrence of C minimum
one maximum all or you can have exactly
that particular occurrences as well ok
so now a few more we have like backslash
it suppresses the special meaning of the
wild cards or like say we want to say
black or white so it match either black
or either white or must ring next thing
we have is grouping
again same as doll
we have seen in last slide control a
character so it match for control a
karate now Q is is a special case here
now Q it says that whatever we use like
for example we use ? enough potion by
represent 0 or 1 occurrence of previous
character if we write any registration
inside q and e with the back spaces it's
appraised the spatial meaning of my wife
cards now push mark represented pushing
mark here not a wild card yeah similarly
/ me it says boundary condition like for
example we say / be full / p it match
for exactly word full it won't match
beautiful maybe me the word contain
beautiful hair let's say PE a UTI ful
match it definitely returns because that
particular string contains full but if I
say back / b and / me for exact
beautiful is is a powerful is a part of
a word so it returns it don't return
true but if let's say I put spaces
around then it returns true because in
this case I have full as word
it the opposite of that you have simply
put / be so it it won't look about a
word it looked for a part of that looks
for a part of a word these are a few
examples of regulation of these are very
powerful over here in pole you can match
anything you want with the help of so
these are the few examples we have a
full exact word a 0 plus 0 or more
trains of 40 h 0 or sorry plus or plus s
one or more occurrences of o.o.h this is
zero or more references of o.h say 131
minimum one occurrence of 0 on maximum
three occurrences of 480 acres x is 0 or
1 occurrence of s check any number of
spaces followed by mates exactly looking
for a a dollar and followed by any value
capturing and grouping we have by
capturing and grouping we can also
perform with the help of the clinic for
example here
you
values we can capture these values in
this so here we say shrink equal to now
it's a string equal to now instead of
putting it into F we take these values
into our variables one two three four so
whatever grouping we have the first
first braces is first looping second
base is second booking third third and
fourth this fourth one and it stores
into these variable one two three four I
try to print this value and we get the
output out of it so if I try to run this
this is example number seven we have
okay this is the one the wizard dave is
average in study so we try to get these
words into one and two and we try to
rent them so if i run this rig x7 not p
and says hey that's what we want from
our regular expression inside this / one
represent the force grouping so this is
the first looking weak huh so we can
also have these groupings we can also
try to extract the word of it and so on
next one we have a substitution
substitution is kind of find and replace
feature it provide so in matching we use
we use em over here we don't use
anything which is by default like for
example here either i can use em here I
don't use anything over here thanks case
of substitution what did what it says
but say i put here s
and put hair like this
you
princes of finally x 45 we have is SAS
is used for a like for example dot me
know dot should not match / n but if you
use s modifier dot will also match / end
till early em let's say I have a big
string I have a big paragraph and I know
that carrot represent the starting of a
string and dollar represent the end of a
string let's say I have a paragraph so
each line is a starting of a string in
another string so I can use that in our
regular expression to modify it or to
match these characters accordingly next
is X modifier so we know that space is
considered as a spaces in regulation but
if you use X modifier space is just for
a formatting so like for example in
these in these cases I use when I use X
modifier space does not consider it as a
space it is just used for formatting
it's for good look and feel of my
regular expressions so we have various
kind of modifier these are the important
modifiers you have I GS m + X which when
you can use in our programs now the most
important property of these modifiers
they are duty what the greedy statement
says it tried to match as much as it can
so it becomes very harmful when we are
being substitution because you try to
match each and every stuff in our
regular expression so like for example I
have a regular expression I have a
string AAA so I i say starting with dot
star a dot star / to I say match as much
as it can so it tried to match as
metallic as it can in the first case
they try to match for is followed by a
single p and replace it by that so these
vague expressions are greedy so if you
want to code these regular expression if
you want to make it non ready just put
extra here it says as less as it can as
minimum as possible no so extra ? along
with the wildcard characters make my reg
expression non greedy so it becomes very
easy for us while doing the substitution
so this this this the
the common features now apart from this
we have definitely a lot of things are
available in a regular expression but I
hope that whatever I taught today is
much explanatory as well as this webinar
session is meant for giving your basic
ideas about regular expression and these
powerful features which we have in any
of the languages also in pole so
definitely after this session you know
just provide your survey because once
you accuse your session you get a survey
link provide your feedback over there
and if you have any questions I take a
pause here I try to discuss these
questions with you so we shall ask a
question do do we get this ppt slide
share with us I don't think so you get
these ppt because this is again a
propriety of a Eureka so once you
register for a training in at Eureka you
get a course directly on your LMS which
is learning management system in a
director so you get an excess of it you
can see all those videos you can have
PPD's available over here you have
chris's you have assignments you have
assignment solutions and lot of study
materials in there LMS okay ha is there
so we shall ask a question that is there
any ideally ID available so pull you can
we can write a program in notepad you
can write a program in VI you can write
a program in notepad plus plus editplus
for any data you use but in case you
want to use any ideally I prefer to use
comodo which is one of the ideal
available in for Paul and where you can
write your programs the clips also have
Eclipse also have the extension for pole
ideally any more questions guys
any any more question guys so can we
wrap up for a day now okay so thank you
so much for joining the session so I
hope you enjoy the regulation and
understand what are the different kind
of features it provides so just provide
the feedback after this session and a
high hope to see you again till then
thank you so much for your time thank
you thank you so much has</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
