is Sean on behalf of Eddie Rekha so it's
been a pretty good journey that we have
been doing these sessions so I'm going
to take on to something on as spring
framework for the day and I hope you
will enjoy the session so let's just
start so what's the agenda for the day
so we're going to understand the Java
frameworks for the day right and
thereafter we'll jump on to Spring
Framework and we'll understand why we
need Spring Framework and what exactly
it is
thereafter we'll also understand the
architectural part of Spring Framework
and we'll try to discuss a few modules
available in the spring framework will
also see what and all are the various
features associated to the Spring
Framework and we'll try to do one coat
on pink frameworks so let's start with
the Java framework so what exactly are
the Java frameworks for us so guys we
know what exactly is Java right - except
programming language which is supposed
to help us solve a particular problem
right and frameworks are nothing but
they are the predefined API which we can
embed in our program right so let's see
so when as a developer we are writing so
we need to write lot of code and many
times when the projects are in a
deadline so we are dependent on
libraries to accomplish our project in
time right so these life is are nothing
but they are the frameworks or they are
the API right so as a developer you
shouldn't be worried about you know
writing lot of code so as of now you can
rewrite so so much of course so as a
developer we are pretty much attends
about it so need something that is fast
and efficient now that's where we're
going to talk of Java frameworks or we
do not talk of the API that's like
application programming interfaces which
we need to put into our program so here
is the solution so I can use Java
framework and using the Java frameworks
it's gonna be very easy for us to
achieve our targets and our deadlines in
time right so this fits with my code -
right and whatever the frameworks you're
gonna choose so we got lot of frameworks
lot of kpi's available in Java now so as
per our requirement we need to choose
for example let's
that I want to search in PDF but I want
to generate an Excel report so I need
not write a Java io API so I need not to
write my own java io code so I can use
the predefined library right so like I
text or write PDF you know available
libraries and I can do my tasks very
easily so the problem is solved right
whenever you start using the framework
or when you start using the predefined
code snippets in your programs now
what's the key benefit of having all
these things right so my application
speed and efficiency is also increased
because the frameworks or the API they
are written in such a way that they are
very well optimized so we are looking on
to a point now right so we started from
a confused state and we have reached our
potential state where we have to meet
our project deadlines and all right so
guys the key target should be to use the
frameworks as much as it is feasible and
it is possible in our programming
structures right you shouldn't be
writing the code from the scratch so in
a smart world if we are writing the
programs from the scratch right it's not
gonna help us right so always try to
rely on the frameworks as possible as
alright Java frameworks principle what
exactly the Java framework principle is
all about right so it abides the
Hollywood principle that is our 'don't
call us we will call you so it's
basically inversion of control which we
are talking about so what exactly this
key principle states like so we got some
class right for which we will create the
object traditional so what is happening
over here so you create a class you
write down a class and then you create
an object but we are trying to talk of
inversion of control which says that do
not worry about creating the object so
frameworks gonna create objects for you
you just configure the objects now right
so let's say if we have a class a which
is having a dependency on some other
classes like D and C right or you can
say it is the other way around right so
if B and C are dependent on a or a is
dependent on B and C so how we can solve
such problems so Spring Framework
is one of the key frame work right which
focus is on inversion of control with
the key principle as a dependency
injection right so that's what we're
going to discuss so the traditional way
of constructing the java object is by
the developer but the Java framework
principle of the Spring Framework
principle will state that you don't
worry about constructing the object
objects will be constructed by the
framework itself all right so let's see
various different Java frameworks they
believe in the markets might be a lot of
frameworks available in the market right
- a name of you so hibernate charts and
string these are quite tough famous
frameworks develop in the market so DSS
play may when we were a lot of
frameworks now it these are some of the
most importantly and widely used
frameworks in the industry so we are
typically going to focus on string
timber so let's see that so what is
spring framework and what exactly are
its key features so let's now switch on
to that so guys Spring has been a label
on SourceForge and it's available since
January 2003 so it's basically an
open-source project and it was
introduced by the guide rod Johnson if
you can see this guy right so the first
version was released in the February
2003 and so till that right so spring is
available as in open source community
you can always browse the spring dot
o-r-g and you can browse Kristi eyes you
can browse which documentation and you
can learn a lot so or the package of
years right so we got 4.3 as in the
latest version in 2016 right so this is
widely used version in the spring
framework
let's now understand the definition of
the spring framework so spring is one
complete and a modular framework for
developing the enterprise applications
in Java right you guys then we talk of
spring as a framework it's a jarring
book but it is an Enterprise Edition
Java framework so what is meant by this
term Enterprise Edition right so
whenever we are writing the applications
for the enterprise's let's take an
example of an enterprise so this one is
an enterprise right Google is an
enterprise so when we are supposed to
solve the problems associated with the
enterprise's we
the Spring Framework all right so Spring
Framework can be used for all the layer
implementations for a real-time
application right so when I am talking
about the layer so let's try to keep it
very simple let's say Model View
controller architecture right so we got
a spring MVC as a design pattern which
you can use to completely construct all
the layers in your application so spring
can be used for the development of
particular layer as well so if you are
not interested in writing all the code
in your Spring Framework you can also
write few of the layer codes
let's see some features associated with
the Spring Framework the first thing it
is open-source right so it means that
you can anytime have an access to the
code and you can manipulate it and you
can use it as in your own domain right
so let's say I want to write a hospital
management system on an enterprise level
right and I need to use a spring
framework so I can manipulate the
framework and I can try to manipulate
the ETA which fits into my key domain
itself so we got comprehensive tools
available in our Spring Framework right
it's lightweight when we talk of the
memory part right so it's very much
relevant in solving the problems because
it follows the design patterns and it
effectively solved all the problems we
face in our enterprise edition of Java
so we typically say that Spring
Framework is basically a framework of
frames now why framework of payments
because you can use lot of frameworks
within the spring pin location for an
instance if you want to do object
relationship mapping using hibernate so
hibernate can be integrated or it is
already there it's already there so we
got the 18th through which we can
directly access hibernate right so
that's why we say it basically framework
off prim box
so it avails array of resources so we
got non of resources starting from the
very cap let's say I want to implement
security in my application or I want to
implement something known as the Model
View controller or any other thing right
so it's basically an array of resources
so you can avail a lot of features
within the spring framework itself even
the support like unit testing is also
available in the spring framework
success
all right so why we need to use print
rainbow I think the previous fiscal
features they are quite relevant that
why we should be using spring fingers
but let's try to understand it in more
detail so that these are the relevant
use it is across the industry right so
we got different different frameworks
available in the market budget you can
see the spring MVC suing outshining all
the other frameworks in the market
industrial right so it means that it is
industrially adopted and it is quite you
know roberts and all the industries all
the companies they love development in
Spring Framework and it is really
popular now there are reasons that why
it is so popular so it's simple now so
if you talk off for the simplicity level
so there are three basically main
reasons out here now the simplicity is
the first level right the writing of
code is very easy in the spring
framework right because here you are
trying to configure the things and you
are not trying to write the major
portion of your code here you are trying
to configure the things then we got
testability right and a loose coupling
so these are some of the other key
concerns and let's now discuss them one
by one
so when I talk of simplicity so here you
are always focused on writing your
business objects as is code your model
or D right so what is 404 is plain old
Java object so you are supposed to write
your Java object definition in the form
of class in your program right so it's
older or 4G so when I talk about plain
old Java object in a similar way we got
interfaces right so you can also write
interfaces which will help us to get to
our definitions to be implemented by us
then we got something on as testability
so Spring Framework is already having
the testing layers available for example
we got j-unit already integrated so you
can always perform a unit test or an
integration test as per your requirement
right so this is something where we can
write our own test cases and we can test
our own code right so this is one also
great feature which is available in the
spring member then we got loose coupling
so here we are trying to understand that
spring objects are loosely coupled now
for this first of all we must understand
what is meant by the term coupling and
what is this
coupling all about right so consider
that you got a class Rider right and we
got a bite so this bike over here the
reference to the bike object is
basically initialized in the set bike
method right so we got this interface
bike available and we have a start
method so we got various classes like
Honda Bajaj or Yamaha right so which can
implement the interface bike and we will
have a mapper like start now right
and we can anytime at run time set the
bike to either be Honda or Bajaj or yama
so run time polymorphic concept over
here is implemented in a very beautiful
way and it ultimately takes us to
something on as loosely coupled
environment so let's try to discuss this
as one example that how loosely coupled
concept comes into action let's say I
got one class as in rider correct and we
got one more class as in bike
now if rider has a reference to bike and
I am going to create one constructor for
the rider where I am going to create an
object of bike rides
so object of bike is constructed when
object of rider shall be constructed now
that is the true reality over here so if
I am trying to say that I will come up
in the main so if I am trying to create
the object of rider over here so when I
am creating the object of rider as of
now so the moment the rider's
constructor will be executed your biotic
object will be constructed it means that
there exists a dependency of your bike
object
construction on the rider object
construction right so this is like a
high in coupling so we got a high
coupling over here now I need to reduce
it in order to reduce it what I will do
I will just come down and I will create
one function like set bike and I will
write the reference over here in this
fashion right so I'm going to say this
dot be assigned B so if
is that now you don't do the concept out
here so rather than you create the
object over here in the mail now the
construction of bike object is not
dependent on the constructor of the
rider right so that's one key concern
over here so what I will do I will just
say r dot set the bike to be B right so
this is where we are trying to reduce
coupling right and I will say that it is
low coupling so guys this is bear we
will be reducing the couple so when I am
talking of the spring framework so
spring framework will focus on always
writing the port so that it is loosely
coupled right
so loose coupling concept with the
runtime polymorphism it brings a charm
in your code as in design pattern so
what exactly is the ecosystem of the
spring framework so guys we got a
babbler right and we got a common layer
service layer and a database these are
the different layers available in the
spring framework ecosystem so we got the
web layer right and it's basically the
spring IO platform right and thereafter
we got a common layer where we do some
basic operation as in spring boot right
and thereafter we got service layers and
the data layers available right as in
the spring XP and other you know
components available in the spring plain
right so this is like the entire Spring
Framework ecosystem how the spring
frameworks gonna come up and in tracks
and it is available in various modules
available so let's see the architectural
part of the spring framework so guys in
the architecture part of the spring
framework we got the base layer as the
testing layer available right so it's a
layered architecture now so spring
architecture is a layered architecture
so the testing layer is basically
focusing on the j-unit part right so
where we can write the unit testing then
we got the core container so course
container of the spring framework
includes being school context and spring
expression language so this is the major
and the main layer of your Spring
Framework right so here we got inversion
of control and dependency injection
which
using upper layers even right and this
forms the core part of your Spring
Framework so on top of poor container we
got AOP aspect instrumentation and
masking so aoq is basically
aspect-oriented programming so with the
aspect-oriented programming we try to
focus on cross-cutting concerns so what
is meant by this term cross-cutting
concerns cross-cutting concern is the
concern which is a kind of a security
not so security has to be taken care in
all the modules whenever you are writing
the project right so opposite oriented
programming helps us in implementing the
cross-cutting concerns then after we got
data access integration into the help of
which we will be able to access our
databases right or you can see where we
got our data set available we want to
bit container over here where we can
write the spring MVC web application
right so we can have servlets then put
it with a standalone application or the
web interfaces itself so let's see the
modules so the spring module basically
it contains our features and they are
quite well organized and we got
somewhere around 20 modules available
right so the modules are grouped up and
they are based on their few of the
features having the column right so as
in the layered architecture we discussed
so in a similar way we got frameworks
and legal so we got cold container data
access or integration right so you can
access the data sets or you can have
integration with the frameworks like
hibernate or so so core containers will
be the one which is the basic
functionality so using the web layer or
the bits kpi's we can write the width
embassy code then aspect-oriented
programming the way we got
object-oriented programming in a similar
way we got aspect-oriented programming
so here we are trying to fulfill the
cross-cutting concerns then we got
instrumentation and the testing layer
let's talk about the modules one by one
so when we are talking about the core
part of the spring framework so we got a
core container which focuses on
dependency injection and inversion of
control so the core layer provides the
fundamental parts for the famous so
these are the base of
Spring Framework ah right so we got
something or not be context and spring
expression language so these are the
three important key concerns right so
guys beans are nothing but they are the
Java objects which are constructed by
the spring framework so you need to
configure them then we got context it's
an implementation of the beans itself
right so it supports
internationalization for example EJB DMS
or remote ep8 if you want to come up
with that then spring expression
language is an expression language the
help of bits we can write programs even
the data access modules of the spring
framework will be able to access the
data sets right so if you have the data
available in the data let's talk about
we got an Oracle as a data base right
and we need to interact with the Oracle
and we can do so very easily with the
spring preamble so we got a JDBC layer
we got our M layer so that like these
are all integration layers so over m is
like object relationship mapping for
example the hibernate so we got the
integration layers which we can use then
we got basically an object or xml
mappings available then java mapping
services are available then transition
management is also available right so if
you are going to fire a transaction so
commit and roll back all all these
supports are available within New York
data access module itself so guys over
the web layer we are trying to
understand something known as a model
view controller based web application
right so the main industrial usage for
the web is BEM MVC model right that like
one of the major modules which is quite
readily used in the Spring Framework and
it is industry accepted so we got
something known as web reentered
features right we got portlet and
sockets so portlet are nothing but there
is a standalone application which are
running in a web application right and
then after we got WebSocket in order to
come up with a two-way communication so
the few miscellaneous modules which are
available in the spring framework
includes AOP right so AOPA
where you are going to fulfill the
cross-cutting concerns then we got
instrumenting where we provide the class
instrumentation support and class loader
implementation we got aspects right so
aspects are nothing but it provides the
with aspectj and aspectj something we
are we going to fulfill the cross
stemming concerns exactly good then we
got messages right and the testing is so
guys in case you want to come up with
the unit testing so we got support with
the help of components like J unit or
test ng so these are again the primers
so that's why we call a spring framework
as a framework of framework now let us
understand how the spring framework will
flow so guys the very first component in
the spring framework is inversion of
control right so we need to come up
slowly and slowly so that we can reach
up to the end point so the first
component is inversion of control let's
see that so what exactly is the
inversion of control so traditionally
when we are writing the program so we
will create the object right so that
like you come up and you create the
object so once the object is constructed
right so we need to wire them together
so let's say we got multiple objects now
and they have a dependency in between
let's take our previous example as in
bike and writer example right so rider
will have a bike so now we need to you
know fulfill this dependency somehow so
we need to configure them in spring time
what we do we configure there and
thereafter so whole management of the
life cycle of the object is taken care
by the Spring Framework except so we
don't worry on that part so guys we will
try to code this flow and understand
that how this glue will exactly work all
right so what are the other concerns
related with the IMC container so guys
the spring IOC container by using the
Java code your classes and configuration
metadata produces a fully configured and
an executable system or an application
right so what we are trying to say that
you come up with the POJO class you
write the pojo class and you provide the
metadata in the form of some xml
configuration you give it to the spring
framework or the spring container and it
will automatically give us the objects
which we can use directly in our
application or you can say we got our
ready to use application itself so let's
see what exactly are the ioc container
so we got two different API is which are
the IOC
containers in the Spring Framework one
is the bean factory other one is the
application context so bean factory is
basically an interface and application
context is an implementation of being
factory so it is always better to come
up and use application context so what
happens over here these container will
basically load the XML files and
thereafter they gonna construct the
objects for us so we can also do by
constructing by writing the annotations
we not podio classes itself if you want
to skip examine you can come up with a
notational model so that is also
supported now after the inversion of
control
we got dependency injection not
dependency injection is all about when
we have dependency in our code right so
Spring Framework has this di technique
where we can remove the dependency from
our poof right so it's going to make our
application quite easy and manage to use
and most importantly our programming
code becomes loosely covered right so
that the key important point which we
need to take care even when we are
writing the code examples alright so how
this dependency injection is taken care
by the Spring Framework so in the Spring
Framework we got PI constructor and by
setter method so these are the two
different techniques right by which the
dependency injection is resolved right
so we got a constructor arg and a
property as g tags which can help us to
resolve this dependency injection then
next is the AO p that like
aspect-oriented programming so
aspect-oriented programming is basically
build we need to implement cross-cutting
concerns right so I'll just try to take
up an example of a cross-cutting concern
right so consider that we logged on to
Amazon and we want to look on to a
product right so I search for an iPhone
so the moment I started searching the
iPhone and I am browsing the different
different iPhones in the same category
that's like Apple iPhone so Amazon will
record from what time I started hoping
the iPhones and what time I left surfing
- so based on that Amazon can give me
some promotional offers or I can get
some you know emails or I can get some
equity
on the Amazon which will say that you
must purchase this iPhone right so
logging now logging is also kind of a
cross-cutting concern to implement such
cross-cutting concerns we can use aspect
oriented programming in the spring thing
so it gives us a lot of other things
right so as in the number one it is
going to provide the modularity then AOP
will break the program into the distinct
parts called concerns it also increases
the modularity right when we write these
cross-cutting concerns and a
cross-cutting concern is a concern which
can affect the entire application right
for example security is one of the major
cross-cutting concerns right so we must
be implementing them in a proper and in
a regular game alright so have a look
guys are so in a cross-cutting Unseld so
we have a different different modules
and if we got couple of layers for
example Model View and controller so we
need to implement these cross-cutting
concerns in every module and in every
stage right let's say security so if I
am writing a very basic code and I am
trying to come up with the last level of
my code I need to make sure and I need
to ensure that security always remains
so the last component or the last
important concern which we have to
discuss over here is the Model View
controller as in the spring framework
right so guys what happens over here
when we are writing any enterprise
application or a web application or if
you try to write any software product
right so model view controller is one
design pattern so in this design pattern
what happens the user will send a
request over the presentation layer
right so this request can be on to
presentation layer that's like a user
interface so it is typically a view
right so requests will go from the view
to the controller and controller is that
guide which will process the request
from the client or from the user right
so typically the client over here is
acting as a browser now correct so let
us try to understand if I am going to
search an iPhone in the Amazon right so
then the Amazon website is open
the presentation layer we call it a view
where I am searching the iPhone and when
I click on the search
so this request goes to a controller
which is processed from the data set so
model represents our data set okay right
so we'll get the data from the data set
into the controller right and controller
can give it back to the view and this
can be sent back as a response to the
user so Model View controller as a
design pattern so what we need to focus
we need to write the model separately
controller separately and do separately
so spring MVC as a complete one package
helps us to write minimal of Port
because it's all you know modeled as a
frame book itself for us right so you
need to write minimal code and we just
need to write your own business logic
and everything else will be taken care
by this spring MVC flow all right so
let's summarize as the entire part you
guys we got power frameworks we got
Spring Framework Y spring frameworks the
architectural part of the spring
framework what are various modules they
will even in the spring framework and
few of the spring features which we have
discuss right so now let's try to come
down and see one snippet over the spring
framework right so I'm going to write
one java application so let's try to
write one java application and let's see
how we can come up with our spring
framework example so let's say it's one
spring
a dareka demo and I'm gonna finish the
project so here we are with the spring
every condemned now what I am going to
do over here is I am going to write one
new class and I am going to write the
class name as employed so let's try to
take one package as carotids maker and
let us finish it off now I'm on employee
class should be a POJO class so I'm
going to write one employee ID let's
write one employee name and let's also
try to write some employee salary so if
you want to come up you can come up with
some more data right so these are the
attributes for my object which I have
mentioned in our class right and
thereafter I need to define constructors
getters and setters to come up with the
pojo structure right so let's say the
right click source generate constructor
using fields so this is one constructor
along with all the fields
so I am also going to construct one
constructor as in a default one so let's
try to write one default constructor I
got one constructor with all the inputs
and the Cockney I'm going to do it as
generate getters and setters let's
select all so here we are with the
getters and setters and now I'm also
going to write one to string method so
let's generate one to string method so
this is one structure which is
representing Hojo or model or B right
call it as a POJO or a model or a bean
structure right so once I am done with
this what I will do next is that I'll
write one client class I'm going to
write one class as inclined along with
the main map right so this is my main
method so what is the traditional way as
a developer how I will construct the
objects right so I will say employee as
in a new employee right and thereafter I
will say e dot set of Eid as 101 T dot
set of employee name as in let's say
John Watson and finally I will take a
salary let's say 10,000 right so this is
the traditional way how you will
construct an object so other than that
all right so I think I did something
wrong
all right so I have taken the salary of
in spring so guys let me change it to
the integer part just a moment so here
we are done now I will just say C so and
I will try to print the e so what I will
get as in response I will be getting the
response as in the details of the
employee now this is my traditional be
how we construct the objects in Java
let's try to follow the Spring Framework
and let's see how we can come up with
inversion of control right so I'm going
to write something known as inversion of
control right so IOC as in Spring
Framework so let's see how we can do
that to do that I fall of certain steps
the step
number one will be to add jar files for
code I'll just say for spring code right
so let's add jar files for spring code
right number to configure Java object in
an XML file right
and number three use spring container
spring IOC container so when we TR
saying I use a container for example
bean factory or application context to
get the objects constructed by them so
we now need to follow these three simple
steps to perform the first fundamental
that's like inversion of control we add
the jar files for spring code and
thereafter we're going to configure the
Java objects in an XML file and finally
we will use the spring IOC container for
example being back to your application
context so that we can get the optics
constructed by the spring container
itself right so let's see how we can do
that so step number one I'm going to
configure my project with the build path
with the spring code jar files I'm gonna
set build path configure the build path
and in my build path configuration and
add the external jars under the
libraries so here we are with the spring
judge so I already have my cool jars
available over here right so you can
download over the web so I'm just gonna
link it in jar files with my project
structure and let's say apply and ok so
here we are with the spring food jar
files available in my project right so
once I am done with this so the next
part is to come up with one XML
configuration file so let me take up to
that so just a moment so I'll just copy
one of the employee bean dot XML file so
I have this XML file and I am going to
copy it in my SRC directory you will see
I'm not copying it to my package I am
copying it into the SLC directory okay
right
so once we are done
copying of this XML file let's try to
open and see the structure of this XML
file ah so the structure of the XML file
says that it's basically one root tag
known as being with the tag known as
bean and the property so what is this
bean ID all about so ID can be any name
of your choice for example I'm gonna say
this is m1 and the class over here goes
like Co dot ed record dot employ the
property is the attribute names
available in your folio structure e ID e
name and is salary right so I got a ID
so for my Eid the value goes like 1 or 2
right and similarly I got a name and a
salary similar case I think let me just
cross check right so it's all in
lowercase so en goes like Jenny and
these re goes like let's say 50,000 so
this is my one of the B so I can declare
that money as the object configurations
over here right so let's try to come up
with some m2 and let's say this is 103
this is Jack with 46 right so these are
the two configurations which I have done
in the XML file so the first thing was
filling the jar file second thing was to
configure the concept of my objects as
in key value pairs so key our attribute
names and the value is the exact value
which the object will hold for its
active so this is the state of an object
now right over here now what is next so
the next part is to use the spring
container in my client class so use the
spring IOC container so I'm going to use
the application context out here right
so let's see how we can use the
application context so you say
application context if you can see over
here so application form takes context
as in a new
classpath XML application context and
you mention over here employ be in dot
XML so that this name of the file can be
any name of your choice right you are
free to use any name but make sure that
this employee in dot XML file is
available under the SRC directory right
so here we got employee be in dot XML
file right
and that to within the application
context so now I will say employee even
as in context dot get the beam you
mention as m1 so what we are doing we
are using the API Noonan get B so this
m1 we gave it in our XML configuration
right so over here I'll just start down
cast it as in employee because it's
gonna return me the object right so we
need to downcast or the other way of
using the same guy is like you say mc2
as in context dot get the be m2 and you
just mentioned the class over here like
this and now let's say C so e1 and C so
of eat right so here I'm just going to
put a delimiter spring IOC in action
right so this is one delimiter let's run
the code and see the output
so guys now we can see the traditional
way of retrieving the objects was you
construct the objects you set the data
right and the spring framework says that
you don't create the objects you use the
objects in your program and now what is
the beauty about this XML file coming
into over here so many times we'll be
confused right so why we are doing all
these two big stuff right the reason is
that XML for here can be changed anytime
right and you can need not to worry
about changing the social so it's not
the kind of a source code right so XML
file is not a source for which will
become filed into some binary and then
binding will be processed by JVM so JVM
is processing the Java file
the byte codes so this XML file is not a
part of your source right so it's gonna
be modified at any time whenever and as
required by us right so here the
configuration goes in the XML file so
the real implementation of the same
inversion of control can be seen in the
Android right so let me you know run
down with one example over here so where
this inversion of control fits into so
let's see that one so how the Spring
Framework is related to the Android
let's try to come up and understand this
part it's very beautiful concept the
inversion of control which we have
demonstrated over here right so let me
try to open any of the wrapping
deviations over here all right so let
the system gets loaded for us so even
though it's exactly you know out of our
context but it steps for the reference
purpose right so we will now see that
there is something known as the layout
files which are all the XML files if you
can see over here so these are different
XML files and in this XML files I can
see that we got some you know
configurations done out here right so
these are the properties now so what is
the menu it's a drawer menu right so
what is the weight what is the height so
for every you know Android UI part so we
got this configuration available in the
XML file right so any time the user can
actually come down and change the XML
file structure so the code will not be
affected so what Android will do Android
will read this XML files and it's gonna
construct the Java object
it's inversion of control which is
available so in my boat if you can see
over here right so the UI is exactly
dependent if you can see the same XML
file structures right and we are trying
to say find view by ID so let's try to
understand this so where you can see the
toolbar coming out right - as in some
toolbar and here we are trying to say
find view by ID as in toolbar so it's a
very very similar story as in we are
trying to say context dot get B right so
the F
a standards are different so guys this
is what we got as in spring IOC write it
and the introduction to the Spring
Framework so thank you very much I hope
