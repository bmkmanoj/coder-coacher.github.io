in this light we're going to talk about
bubble sort previously we saw how we can
do selection sort selection sort with an
emulation of how we as humans might try
to sort a given set of numbers now
bubble sort is something with very
logical when you're trying to solve a
sort problem for a computer a computer
can look at only two numbers at any
given time so when you ask to write a
program to sort the most logical way of
writing the program would be compared to
numbers at a time and if the two numbers
are not in the right order you swap them
and that's exactly what bubble sort does
let's look at bubble sort so let's say I
have so what bubble sort does is to
compare two numbers at a time so we
compare the first in the second number
and we want to arrange the entire thing
in ascending order is it in the right
order
yes we don't touch it next we compare
this and this is it in the right order
no so we need to swap these two so five
comes here 100 goes here and then this
remains the same this remains same this
remains the same
next you compare this and this is it in
the right order No so you have 10 here
100 here and 60 here five and forty five
remains as it is now you compare these
two against wrong on the right order so
60 comes here and hundred goes here
finally ten five forty five and we reach
the end of the atom this is one pass
through the array as you can see after
the first pass the largest number in the
array has moved to the end of the array
now we need to again repeat the entire
process starting from the beginning
again you start comparing these two is
it in the right order
no so you get five here 45 here 10 60
100 then you compare these two in the
right order no so 10 45 60 100
and so on so you keep repeating this
process till you finish sorting the
array how do you know you started by
adding if at any iteration or in any
pass you have not swapped any of the
numbers then you finish sorting the
adding so as you can see for each pass
you need a for loop you need to go from
the beginning of the array till the end
of the array for which you need a for
loop and for the various multiple passes
till you finish swapping your needle you
need another loop which ends then you
have not swapped any of the numbers so
let's look at the algorithm on a slide
as you can see first we need to repeat
until no elements are swapped at the
outermost loop then you have a for loop
from 1 to n minus 1 so you keep swapping
every element so you need to stop
checking from the first element till the
last element and keep verifying if the
two adjacent numbers are in the right
order if they're not you swap them let's
write the algorithm let's let's write
the program for this now as usual we
start with the hash include stdio.h just
like the previous sort algorithm this
sort function too is not going to return
anything so void called bubble sort
we'll just call it bubble sort the
parameters are going to be exactly the
same star a and I'm in int I max
now first thing is we need the outermost
loop which keeps checking that there is
no swap that has happened so we need
some way of verifying whether a swap has
happened or not so we need a outermost
while loop we will see how we can write
the condition for the while loop later
let's write a single pass first so for
the single pass we need a for loop so we
have a for I is equal to I'm in I is
less than equal to I max I plus plus we
need to go through the entire array so
it goes from I'm in to I max integer I
now we need to compare two adjacent
numbers because I'm always comparing two
adjacent numbers I can actually start I
from I'm in plus one that is the second
number it's because I would be comparing
the second number with the first number
every time so I will compare the current
number with its previous number and if
they in the wrong order you swap those
two and go to the end of the array so to
begin with if I start with I equal to I
mean which will be zero I can have
nothing to compare against so I always
start with one so I can compare a of one
and a of zero so you say if a of I is
less than a of I minus one then they're
not in the right order then you say swap
a coma I comma I minus one the soft
function will be exactly similar to the
one we did in the previous program so we
can just copy paste that swap so this is
our innermost loop or the for loop which
is what one pass consists of so every
pass requires a loop to go from I'm in
to IMAX and if we do not have any two
adjacent numbers in the right order then
we swap those two numbers now we need to
keep repeating this or have multiple
passes still we made sure we haven't
done even a single swap so better swap
happen the swap happens inside this if
statement so if you ever enter the if
statement means we perform the swap so
we can just set a particular variable
here let's say swapped equal to true
which means perform the swap we have a
defined true so let's say hash define
true as one hash define false zero now
we need another way we'll call swapped
so if you ever enter the if statements
we say if you enter this if statement
means we have performed a swap which
means we need to perform the next pass
also
so this while loop will keep running as
long as swap is equal to true or we can
just say while swap the same thing to
swap true means one so if swap is set to
true this will be one so while one means
it will enter the loop but we need aside
to falls at some point so we will first
set it to false so we start with the
loop resetting swap to false if we
perform any kind of a swap operation
then we set so up to true now there's
still one problem left with the program
that is initially swap is not set to
anything so when you say while swap to
start with it can be any junk value and
that's not good
so one way of doing this is to
initialize this to true so that way it
will enter the loop at least once or we
can have a do-while loop because we need
to execute this at least once before we
do the check so you can say do-while
swapped
I just notice a missing semicolon here
and done that's your bubble sort
function now we need a function to swap
and the main which will just copy from
our previous program that's the swap and
the main the only difference is you're
calling selection sort
now we shall be calling bubble sort and
we need to declare the swap function so
I'll just copy this as a function
declaration let's try and compile this
program no errors or warnings let's run
it how many numbers five I'll just give
the numbers in reverse order 5 4 3 2 1 1
2 3 4 5 yep it works let's try another
random example fly numbers n 2 the
numbers 43:56
12 10 110 1243 56 and hundred this
program works - isn't this simple
because we know the computer can just
verify two numbers at a time we verify
to adjacent numbers if they are not in
the right order swap them and keep doing
this until we have the entire sorted
list
so that's bubble sort for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
