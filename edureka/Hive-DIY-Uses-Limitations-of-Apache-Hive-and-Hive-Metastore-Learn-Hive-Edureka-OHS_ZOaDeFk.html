know hive looks likes look the meta
store that we are talking about the meta
store can be in different ways initial
days you know or even today when we talk
about vanilla version of height which is
actually nothing but the version that
you get directly out from your Apache
version Apache version doesn't use a my
sequel database uses a derby reference
so doubly is a small you know a single
distance database so Apache high
provides the Derby database problem
interface it only allows you to have one
single connection at a time so you
cannot use hive with Derby in a
production ice cluster because it always
gives you only once in the collection so
other way is to set up a local meta
store so you can have multiple mega
stores all connecting to a single my
sequin it can be one way or it can have
a remote minister so you can have your
actual high residing in one node and you
can have a dedicated box which is
working as a sequel store so that these
are the three ways in which an admin can
configure high so you can install it on
the same node as a Derby database you
can install it other in a single box
we've seen make APIs or you can have a
separate dedicated magical box which can
act as a meta story so normally when you
talk about production is faster you
normally talk about a remote my test or
where my sequel database will do all the
ways maintain and store the separate box
and that box can be handling all your
MIDI written function right so this is
more about how the meta store philips
Lighting so one of the limitations of
high well no hive is a data warehouse it
is not designed for online transactional
processing second thing is doesn't offer
real-time analytics queries no because
every query that you hire every every
sequel query that you try to write is
going to get converted into a MapReduce
program so if you're getting converted
into MapReduce program you know it will
always have latency issues right so
because we're talking about MapReduce
program that produces the batch mode of
programming it always ends up having you
know latency so you do not use sequel
programs relentlessly
it provides acceptable latency for
interactive data browser so for no you
do not and you should not be using high
as the back end of any web application
or web sites no because web application
web sites can be a part of your actual
you know
real-time data processing or the
real-time you know interactions to
defines you do not want to have a
latencies of a system so it is highly
not recommend upon you to have hive as a
back-end data store for your web
applications or websites and latency for
height where is generally very high as
in minutes so if you run a program to
run a process in hive it will normally
run in minutes so it is not used for all
those ad hoc queries it is not actually
used for all those real-time queries and
it is definitely not used for or used as
the backend of actual evaluation all
right can you can be used for Oracle db2
also increase of my screen yes so no
Chris I have I mean up cloudera an
harden works they allow you the
flexibility of installing a database of
Oracle or db2 or my sequel any one of
these three not deep into actually
action Oracle host based mindset well
any one of the three they allow you to
become the meta stroke so you can set up
a separate box install Oracle machine in
there and make connection settings in
your actual hive where the - treat the
Oracle box has a meta story so yes it is
possible
all right abilities are very language so
it ability is to filter rows from a
table using a where clause so you can
use where conditions so we have been
talking about this that now hive is very
similar to what a normal sequel query
engine should look like so all new
queries that are having well conditions
that 99.99% of the queries can run
ability to do you equal joins so if we
joins left outer join by out on all
those one conditions you can easily
create and managing type so any table or
table based operations
you know I recommend it to be done using
high ability to store the results of a
query into Hadoop HDFS folder so if
you're creating a select query the
output of a select query can be pushed
into another HDFS forward so that is
also possible emulated of managed tables
and partitions so you can create and
manifest tables and create indexes alter
tables or drop tables all of these are
possible using high ability to store the
results of a query into another table so
if you have a table and you're waiting
on table of on top of if you're joining
couple of tea
although stable outputs can be pushed
into another separate folder in HDFS so
all of these are the capabilities of
hype and these are something that you
can easily do every time
yeah all right okay so so doesn't mean
that even if you do not know Java we can
still work inhabitable
yes so that's what I've been talking
about Puna for all these days right so
Hadopi is not supposed to be technology
specific you know either you know Python
or hive or on Java no it is it is more
long technology for technical
capabilities if you know and if you know
how the handle data and then yes you
know if you have the logic building
capability with and yes and of the
