start with today's session you know let
me just introduce myself I am the
instructor of this course financial
modelling given my experience it's more
than twelve years into various companies
such as McKinsey and company don't stand
on and I started with company called
American Express right now for the last
three years I run my own portfolio
management company based out of Cornell
I manage some around 100 million dollars
has a ton of management well I don't
like the tone I said under management
but yes I manage this must assets and
you know that's about me and where
financial modeling comes into play is
you know no one has actually taught me
financial modeling but I learned it over
a period of time because of the nature
of work I was always interested in
finance and that's why I taught at an
age of 21 I land up with merican Express
and I learned all these things there
with respect to personal finance move to
McKenzie and you know McKenzie was one
platform you know the valuation team
their corporate finance which taught me
means you know stuff which I personally
feel you know I owe it to them both from
a handling corporate or blind situations
as well as you know financial model and
I'm keenly interested in the financial
modeling part however I do feel that you
know a lot of people feel that financial
modeling is all about it so I personally
feel that Excel is a tool whatever
inputs you put in the kind of output
would depend on the kind of input that
would go in so you need to be very sure
you know just to deal in yes excel is
important knowledge of excel is
important no denying that but you know
equally important is a theoretical and a
practical understanding of how things
work in in this environment so what this
course really you know
you know what we'll do today is you know
why financial modeling is important what
is the course objective of financial
modeling what are the benefits you can
expect and who should take this course
and I will also cover something called
beta calculation so just a quick check
how many of you have heard about beta
before but the reason is okay since I'll
be covering this I need to know whether
I need to start from the basics so I can
talk about some advanced stuff so I need
to have a you know just an understanding
of the entire group whether you have
heard about beta before any finance
student must have gone through beta and
cost of equity calculation well if you
have not it's all fine you know doesn't
matter already I'm just checking with
the group ok so most per class has not
heard about beta so I will just touch
upon the basics first and I'll then move
into the advanced things but you should
just expect you know this is just a demo
lecture so given the time we have
allotted for beta calculation is not a
lot normally in the class it takes
around 2 to 3 hours just to understand
that but yes you will get a basic
understanding of what beta is and how
you can practically link it okay so let
me just introduce the course and tell
you how this course will help you so you
know this course I have taught
approximately more than thousand
participants now with the last I think 5
words
years now I have taught this subject you
know on webinars in person in India and
outside India and this is the work I do
day in and day out you know evaluations
and all this stuff so this topic is very
close to my heart and rather than
talking about or teaching any subject
where my expertise may not be that great
you know I picked up a subject and I
have been just doing this for for the
last you know a number of years now just
to you know it helps me become better
also as a professional and also you know
I'm able to transfer the kind of
knowledge I feel you know had I got that
knowledge at a very early age I would
have picked up in the right direction
and I figured out later on that this is
the way it is so this course will be an
online life course and it will help you
build an understanding of valuation a
comprehensive understanding evaluation
and at the end of course you can expect
yourself to become like an expert in
valuations and equity research and so on
so what this will help is basically if
you are already a finance student it
will help you deepen the understanding
if you're not a finance student it will
help you build the foundation and then
bit you know build your knowledge
however this comes with a caveat that
you know the excel part also which we'll
cover in this is not at a basic level so
I do expect people to be aware of what
Excel is and how does that work you know
the advanced calculation and scenario
analysis and so on and so forth all the
advanced function of Excel surely will
cover but not the basic functions I'll
not teach you know this is a worksheet
and this is a workbook and so on and so
forth so you need to be just aware that
a basic understanding of Excel is
required and then we'll focus on lot of
financial theory I am talking of a
little bit of accounting and lot more
into the analysis part how many of you
feel that
you know accounting is a very important
when it comes to financial analysis
you
all right
okay a few people are facing some issue
vishal are you able to fix your audio
issue I think you've logged off okay so
I hear that lot of people are saying
it's very important and yeah it's very
important okay fair enough
so my point of view one accounting is
you know as a student of Commerce and
later on masters and everything I have
learnt accounting but in my day to day
work more than accounting I think
challenging the accounting practices of
management is more important than
knowing what are the accounting
standards and so on
so yes accounting knowledge is important
but more than it just the accounting
knowledge I feel you know you need not
be aware of debits and credits I don't
know to be very honest you know this
would be a debit this would be a credit
you need not know that but you know if
certain action is being taken by
management you should be able to you
know just that bell should ring in your
head that this doesn't make any sense or
this makes sense because as you will
learn in financial modeling more than
just the excel piece there's a lot of
qualitative stuff which needs to be done
and that qualitative stuff comes with
experience and with a lot of reading of
books and you know as you grow as a
professional you build a knack of
challenging anything so just to give you
an example you know company coming up
with an IPO and say 100 million dollars
and you looked at you know last year's
revenue and sorry the net profit number
and it was around 80 million let's say
I'm just giving an example so you know
you that should just trigger a bell in
your mind that this doesn't make any
sense you know this company was already
having cash they are going to public to
get more cash so there is some kind of
waste
impressed by the management which is not
true of the investors you know the
shareholders this has nothing to do with
accounting this is nothing to do with
even finance you know it is just about
common sense and I feel you know
investing is all about common sense
after a certain stage I'm not saying
it's all about common sense but yes it
is about lot to do with common sense so
building that common sense will be part
of this course because what I have
failed you know my investing experience
say is that building that common sense
and challenging management practices and
everything is even more critical than
just coming up with the number of DCF
you know this is a DCF value so from
that perspective building that practical
knowledge of challenging management or
understanding management decisions is
very important so you'll understand
valuations and it's practical
application as well and as I said you
know building that understanding of you
know practices and you know which
management follow and challenging them
is very very critical part for whom this
course is relevant commerce graduates
MBA graduates CFOs risk managers
Chartered Accountants fresh CFA's if
they are in field of equity research one
managers private equity fund managers
and managers and so on so in my you know
as for my experience I have I have
trained you know journalists working in
our media house to CFOs of companies as
well as you know private equity and
lists of very sobering funds so the kind
of people would extract value from this
course is you know anyone who is into
the business of finance and valuation
and even senior management because they
are expected to learn lot more about
these things you know as they grow up
it's expected out of them that they are
aware of lot of things
you
all right any questions so far can I
proceed okay so the course content will
be this so as I said it covers advanced
Excel features and techniques it will
not cover basic Excel I think to get
hold of that basic Excel you can find an
n number of videos on you cube you can
go through them or it's a very simple
stuff so will not cover basics of Excel
but we will definitely cover it bounce
Excel when I talk about advanced Excel
it will include you know pivots to
lookup references goal seek scenario
analysis not to do with a function and
even running macros so we will not cover
writing back rows because you know I
myself am NOT an expert in language I
think C++ or whatever that languages but
I know how to record macros I know how
to embed macros and a lot of people get
fascinated with the macro application
everything but just to let you know that
logic is more important that love these
functions so yes you will build an
understanding of these functions but
building logic around them is gonna be
is even more important than for it like
that so we'll cover that in advanced
excel then we'll cover financial
statement analysis so this is yes it is
to do with accounting but as I said it's
not financial accounting its financial
statement analysis so how to read and
we'll report what kind of stuff to look
into all that is covered under this
Anne Shiell statement analysis then will
cover cost of capital you know what is
the cost of capital for a company will
discuss about valuation models industry
analysis company analysis here and then
we'll cover the DCF modeling this will
take a lot of time to cover will also
discuss upon you know how the private
companies are valued and then we will
discuss about the mergers and
acquisitions so quick question you know
those who are aware of Indian startups
and everything you know it will also
help you build an understanding of
underst
you will be able to challenge even the
media houses what they write because I
strongly feel here all these money
controls and CNBC's and all they don't
have any understanding of finance but
still they politeness is that they are
you know the best resource which is
completely incorrect
they are just journalists in fact I have
trained couple of journalists and I was
surprised to see that they were talking
about few stocks the next day and just
before that they were discussing some
basic stuff with me so I was really
surprised and shocked to see that so yes
after this course what we'll be able to
build is you know basically challenge
any issue you face whether in print
media or in television or these shows
they conduct and you will make some
sound decisions with respect to
investments and you know investing is a
profession on its own and it comes with
lot of practice a lot of reading is
required mister 2025 our course may not
be sufficient to make you perfect in
valuation because you know even after
spending 12 years in this space I
strongly feel that each and every day I
have to learn a lot of stuff and
that's the exciting part about the space
you know you you have to enrich yourself
with knowledge rich herself with a lot
of new stuff which is happening and you
know link the traditional stuff with it
so before I proceed with the beta
calculation any question with from you
guys
you
so I will just try and answer the
questions I'm getting here so you sure
you're asking me which version of excel
is used in this course it's 2010 if I'm
not wrong I'm using Mac so I don't know
which version they are using but I think
it's 2010 only in which is being used
but I am pretty sure the kind of Excel
models you'll be getting they will be
2010 only so you guys you're asking me
my purpose is to pick stocks as an
individual investor I think it should
help so yes some it will help you a lot
it will help you be you know build a
good foundation and after that as I said
you know investing is a profession on
its own so it will require a lot of
practice so it will not come on day one
probably it will take few years and it
can become so lucrative as a business
that you can sit at home in earn
millions I'm not talking about training
here I am actually talking about
investing I am talking about you know
Buffett philosophy and talking of
Benjamin Graham philosophy I'm not at
all talking about trading philosophy
here but that requires lot of lot of
practice lot of hard work and lot of
reading so yes it will give you a good
foundation but it will require a lot of
firm for the work as well Kanda you're
asking me does it also cover predictive
analytics on stock prices no that is a
part of technical analysis we will not
cover that I don't believe in that
philosophy
okay fair enough fine
so before I proceed let me just show you
you know a few books or a few areas I
feel you know these were instrumental in
changing my thought process um you know
when I was 21 I started trading you know
Buchan you were asking me that
by investing fifty thousand rupees I
earned like fifteen or twenty thousand
fifteen fifteen days when I was really
excited but I also felt that you know
this is not the right way because I was
just a fluke that was just a chance when
you are investing you have to be like
very sure that you know you have done
your groundwork and there is no way you
can lose money eventually you know you
may actually land up losing money on few
areas you know bases your assumptions
not coming through but those will be
less than for any person probability but
if you're investing into you know how
the demand supply of stocks is working
well you can make money you but at the
end it's like dealer's house and it's
like going in a casino dealer always
mints
stock market will always spend so I
don't believe in that philosophy but I
started with that thought process of
making money very quickly and I'm
talking about 2003-2004 you know fifteen
thirty thousand rupee for a student was
a big amount but yes I reflected back
and I felt you know this is something I
need to get deep deep understanding and
that's why you know I completed my CFA
that helped me understand a lot of stuff
in detail so this is my best book you
know Intelligent Investor by Benjamin
Graham it was written like almost 60 70
or SPAC and it is completely relevant
when you been famously father of value
investing and lot of my attitude towards
investing is also driven by this book or
style of book just to let you know that
this is actually the favorite or the
first book even
Warren Buffett read when he was 19 and
is built interesting to investing just
for your understanding that you know in
case you you are interested go for this
book it's it's an amazing book second
book is again the security analysis you
know how to value a stock again by
Benjamin Graham excellent book but a lot
has changed over years and but it's
still worth reading and building up your
knowledge and the last book I recommend
is valuation so this is written by a
published by McKinsey and company it's
written by Tim Kohler it's recommended
as a valuation book in Harvard Business
School and Tim Koehler was my partner in
McKinsey so whatever I've learnt in
valuation is actually from Tim Koehler
the master himself
and this book is closely linked with
intelligent investor and security
analysis by Benjamin Graham so this book
is on value investing it's not about
trading so yeah that you know I'll start
the content part of you know beta
calculation one question I'm getting
from Charen is what's the duration of
this course so it's spread over seven
weeks so we cancer covered there are I
think fourteen sessions to our each and
at the end there is a module also that
you need to power the case study which
you need to cover and the course will be
on you know we'll be covering one
company only you know how to build the
financial statement how to do the
analytics around this that DC of
modeling and everything so historical
analysis everything on one particular
company which is a live company so lot I
will go back on the websites and show
you you know from where to get the
information and this and that so that's
the way I
normally take session because I know
that once the session is over and you're
on your own and you're doing stuff so if
theoretically I may ask I may say okay
you need to regress 60 day troponin set
to the market index and you will get
beta well that doesn't really solve the
purpose you need to know from where you
can get those 60 data points so all that
practical perspective we will cover in
this any question course fee I think you
can just check on it records around
15,000 and they are giving some early
bird discount small so you can just
check that and it's priced at 15,000
it's some discount of you enroll before
a particular due date
you
do you have a practical coverage on a
cell 2:39 implementation that's a very
specific on thanking not in this course
we are covering banking valuation
banking valuation works very differently
but philosophy remains the same related
to banking valuation but how to do it as
different you use dividends
instead of free cash flow and so on and
so forth and it's a tricky industry to
value any other question please
any other question
okay I think you're not there when I
covered this so this course is relevant
for you know from people who are into
practice lis say private equity analyst
equity analyst to freshers from MBA
colleges even commerce graduates IT
professionals want to build
understanding into finance it's relevant
for anyone who wants to get into the
field of valuations and investing it's
not suitable for a person who is looking
for you know trading related strategies
we will not cover training related
strategies AJ you are into retail
banking operations so depending upon you
know what kind of work you actually have
I would not have an understanding of
that but what is relevant for you would
be on the Excel valuation side the
modeling side so modeling will help you
in your work but if you're not into
equity analysis and M&amp;amp;A kind of
scenarios and if you don't want to build
an understanding on that then probably
it will not make a lot of sense but
because just to learn Excel you don't
want to enroll into such a long course
yes it will cover profitability models
for forecasting projects yes it will
look and that's for you so
there's lot of demand depending upon you
know the question is what is the
industry need on financial modeler and
how much demand is there well just on
its own I don't think so people were
just higher financial modelers usually
it is linked with what kind of scale you
bring on table so let's say if you are
into equity analysis or bond analysis
and if you are very good
you know it's expected out of you that
you have to be good with the modeling
part so it's not something that people
are looking for a particular modeling
thing because as I said you know it is
it all depends on the input that goes
into the model and then the output is
linked with that so input understanding
is something you need to build and that
is your skill so it's not something just
by the Excel work you can learn that
skill excel any BPO guys are also doing
that right but you need to build that
skill of equity analysis and valuations
and M&amp;amp;A and you know how the management
is thinking and so on and for that there
is a huge tumor
I'll just move on and in the meantime if
you have any question just keep on
writing that so what is beta so anyone
who is from finance or has done this
would know about beta but let me just
simplify this in financial world beta is
an approximate measure of risk a company
takes I'll not get into what kind of
overall risk are there because as I said
you know practically in the program we
cover it for good three hours or so two
to three hours but here we are just
covering it in 20 minutes or something
so I'll just broadly talk about this and
you know there is something called cost
of equity so you know as we build our
understanding of how the valuations work
one of the critical inputs is at what
rate a cost you know company is taking
money from its shareholders or
bondholders so understanding that
perspective from an equity point of view
beta calculation is important I'll not
go beyond this because then it will be a
very very lengthy conversation because
we gradually you know in the program we
gradually build on to beta we don't
start with beta but my perspective was
you know let me just because this
requires some bit of you know practical
application so what I would expect from
you is not to build an understanding of
what beta is and the stuff like that but
how to link the calculation of beta with
you know practically what happens so
beta is basically a as it's you know as
it is mentioned a measure of how much a
company's stock moves with respect to
the market
right and beta is the result of
comparing market return with you know
how your company stock has moved just to
give you an example when we say that
apple stock is very safe or maybe not
I'm just making it up how would you know
that Apple stock is actually safe or not
the way you will do that is you know you
will learn about how the price has moved
over a period of time and you compare it
with how the market has moved over time
so there is a measure called volatility
in the market so that volatility you
know let's say today the price of Apple
was 113 tomorrow it is 112 next is 110
then it moves 214 and so on and so forth
and similarly there is a movement in the
market going on so how do you compare
you know whether Apple stock is riskier
than the market or not so this is what
beta does it tells you whether your
Apple stock is riskier than the market
or not as simple as that
and the way you do it is basically you
take 60 data points monthly 60 data
points let's say if you're valuing Apple
stock today you will take it for last
five years monthly data points and you
know you will compare it with how the
market has moved over those the same
time frame and you will get a measure
that measure is basically a reflection
of how you no riskier your stock is so
that is a measure of beta so you get it
by regressing it so we'll get into all
that discussion in the course what
progression and how those statistical
thing work but yes you regress a Apple
stock with the market to understand what
is the beta measure of
one you know if let's say that measure
comes to one basically it means that
Apple stock has moved just like stock
stock market so there is a phase beta
neutral if it is higher than the stock
market it will be more than one and less
than the market it will be less riskier
than the market so in a simple way and
let me just tell you practically you
know how to calculate this so you must
have heard of all Yahoo Finance so here
you go you know it gives you the numbers
from 1980 what we need is basically
monthly data for the last five years so
from 2010 we needed here you go so this
is the measure you know the close price
is basically the data points let's say
you know B we need to just copy this
input is Excel probably we can use that
yes there is and we also need to have
the market market let's say SNP 500
again we need to get completely 2.60 all
right so we have the numbers here I'm
opening a new Excel let's write sin fee
and we need to have Apple
a delinquent
okay let me just see how many data
points we have here so we have 61 which
is fine because one we have to take I'll
just show you what why we need 61 0 so
this number we need to just index it so
I would say this is these are the prices
and we need to just get an index because
regressing this to this will not make
sense we need to just start with a
common factor and that common factor
let's say we start with hundred just
that you know how any market would work
you know BSE or you know new york stock
exchange they started with a certain
value and that value is usually 100 and
from there they grow so we need to just
so during the class we get into all this
discussion and there is a lot of
practice around this due to paucity of
time will not do the practice here but I
am just showing you how the calculation
works and then we drag it till the end
all the shortcuts and everything will do
cover in the class
all right so beta is regressing which is
regression formulas slope I'll cover
regression everything in the class but
you know what is regression it's it's a
long conversation
what is regression how does that work
all right I see the problem here
so this although this number is showing
me as negative but I'll tell you what's
the issue and these are things you
should be aware of when you are creating
a model so you see that you know our
numbers actually started from 100 and so
on and so forth and then I see that
there was some kind of split you know
most likely there was a split of the
shares in June 2014 and probably this
broke down by 1 by 6 or 1 by 7 and
that's why you know these numbers reduce
so this number of BTI you know may not
give the right reflection so let me just
change the period of this just to get a
broad understanding of what this should
be
all right and we have 45 here so now you
see this changes to 0.26 looks like you
know Apple stock variation with respect
to pocket has been very very low well
this calls for lot of further
investigation but yes this is the
measure I doubt this would be the beta
measure it's way too low I was expecting
some around point six point six five so
we need to investigate further why this
has happened and moreover you know we
need to get hold of something called
total returns to shareholder which
includes the dividend part as well this
just includes price movement dividend is
not included see you might want to
adjust the dividend part as well or get
hold of you know platforms like Reuters
and Bloomberg where you know you can
just simply download the information
that requires a decent level of expense
and usually you know big companies can
afford access to Bloomberg and all but
from an approximation point of view this
really helps now I you know tell you you
know what practically I do when when you
know I have to calculate something so
well before that any question you guys
have
okay there are a few questions which are
pouring in so Nathan asked what is the
difference between CFA and the scores so
well this is just a online course where
you pay the fees and you take lectures
and I you apply your knowledge in your
work um CFA requires you to clear three
very very aggressive levels you need to
clear level one to three and then you
become CFA charterholders so these are -
not at all comparable you know things
it's not Apple to Apple comparison
that's a certification this is an online
course there's like difference are these
points available you guess you're asking
are these points available yes I took it
from Yahoo in front of you so yes I took
it from public sources only well why it
goes up and down we'll cover that in the
course um well it has nothing to do with
that you have to track it on a daily
basis but yes as a investor what you
really want to see is if you're tracking
a particular stock you need to just see
that if the market really miss prizes
that if the market you know if the stock
price crashes let's say you need to be
sure that that's a good entry point so
you're not just valuing from exit point
of view but you're also valuing a stock
from entry point of view so it helps you
get a perspective on both things
so the
session UK starts in November itself
well there is no way any any analyst of
the world even the best of the best can
predict any share price so people who
think that they are predicting market
they are actually making fool of you
I'll be as upfront as this they're just
making fool of you and you need to you
know what this helps in understanding
you know what are the fundamentals that
attaches to a company that would impact
a share price and you know measures like
beta and measures like cost and what is
the management doing what is the
economic mode of this company so on and
so forth you know all these factors help
you understand where the you know
direction of that going so during the
course I will cover both the defensive
end aggressive investors strategy as a
defensive investor what you should be
doing as an aggressive investor what you
should be doing so when it comes to
aggressive invested basically means
active management and defensive investor
basically means when you have to rely on
experts but when you know let's say
you're working with an advisor but
you're still smart enough to understand
what the advisor is telling you he's not
just trying to fool you around
so all both the strategies I will cover
during the course but your question on
can you predict prices no one in the
world can now just think about it if you
can predict any share price what it will
be after one are you can be a
billionaire now so that never happens
beta is you know your question is this
beta a static measure yes and no the way
you know I discussed about beta it's not
a static it's dynamic but there is a
concept of levered an unlevered beta
which we cover in the course itself that
really talks about you know
what you can do in order to arrive at
that beta and beta is basically you know
it should be really reflection of the
industry and not a specific company
let's say a particular industry let's
say IT companies will behave in a
certain way and usually that will not be
very different from their peers right so
that is why it becomes a industry
measure than a company measure you know
with all the capital structure and
everything taken into account will
discuss in lot more detail in the course
you know why I am saying that but yes at
that level it becomes a static measure
and not a dynamic measure and that's the
static measure I use for my calculations
so Gaurav you're asking about you know
beta link with the SNP well the way you
were asking is you know you need to back
it up with theta points so this is the
data point I have taken from Yahoo
Finance you can even use Google the only
thing that would impact this measure as
I said is something called dividend if
they have declared dividend which Apple
does declare dividend then you know this
beta measure needs to be corrected
because you know your returns put
increase so it's not just the price
movement your returns increases and
returns increases your beta is also
impacted by that so in general theory
you know beta of 1 you've had this
number being one then it would have been
equal to the risk of the market if it is
less it's lower risk if it is higher
than one it's it's more risk but
practically let me tell you how it works
you know beta measure you can take it
from various websites say you know this
is the Lutheran website
I do have industry Vitas for all the
industries let's say information
technology I'll just quickly wrap it up
technology information services it's
coming out to me more than so as an
industry measure it is more so this is
the measure I take or else you need to
just refine the numbers by even looking
into the price you know the PR set and
everything so in the course we create
like we create a pure set and then we'll
create the beep
but practically you use this for the
calculation perspective but you also
consider the margin of safety so risk
from a financial perspective is this but
the margin of safety I say is when you
come up with a result that let's say
Apple price to be around $50 right
that's your intrinsic value if it is
available at a 30 40 percent discount
then only you'll buy it
otherwise you'll not so we'll cover all
those strategies when to get in and when
to exit from a you know aggressive
investor's point of view but yes this is
a so I didn't get the question Jen Rick
one what is the merit and demerit of
reinvesting equity on stocks can you
just elaborate that I didn't get that so
they'll be ongoing courses you gauge up
so you can check with the head rekha
when they plan to schedule the next one
but yes they'll be ongoing courses yes
so for a very short while you know 60
weekly data points it can be impacted
you know 60 is basically what we're
looking at is not even one year just
just little over one year right so in
one year is too short a period for
assessing risk of a company in fact of
you know if there is any major change in
the stock you should exclude that or in
the market you should exclude that
period and 60 monthly data points it is
not weekly it could be actually more
than that also
predictive modeling we do as a sensitive
you know we will understand the
sensitivity analysis in that we will
understand you know if growth is
impacted or cost is impacted what would
be the impact on the price what is the
implied growth and so on and so forth so
that comes under predictive analysis
although I still feel that you know
those are different scenarios you're
building but nothing is you know very
concrete you need to challenge that and
go back whether you know you're saying
the company would instead of growing at
6% will go at 10% so what are the basis
for that you need to back it up with
something but yes it helps you create
various scenarios
so for beta 60 data points or plus yes
we'll be talking about valuations of
startups so in private company valuation
that will be covered and you will be
surprised to know what these media
houses print is all rubbish so in a way
I'm just trying to say Flipkart is not
valued at fifty billion dollars if it
comes even at a five billion dollar I
will be more than surprised they will
never come with an idea and not
profitable well you cannot predict
future prices so high beta is an
indication that a particular industry
behaves more riskier than the market
will that have any impact on your
investment strategy probably not it will
have some impact on the cost I am NOT
able to understand this question not
much actual values will be there but
just projections all right
well with startups you know the
unfortunate part is you can have lot of
assumptions you know even with the
companies that we will study with your
companies even with them will do lot of
valuations and projections it's just
that you know with startups it doesn't
make a lot of sense to do those
projections yes you will build
aggressive assumptions and it will be
valued higher but you know as we go
through the program there is something
called operating profit no platen all so
talking about no plat numbers and all
with respect to these startups
I think 99% of the startups at least in
India would fail to meet that criteria
and I am very very strong believer that
all these startups like Flipkart and
Gophers and so on and so forth
they will not exist in in the future
forget about they coming
with an IPO so we'll talk about all
these practical scenarios you know why I
am saying this and I am NOT a big fan of
startups all right so I think I have
covered pretty much everything so from a
beta point of view it's not that you
have covered a decent understanding or
covered beta in a detailed form this was
just a teaser in terms of you know how
to link what is publicly available in
theoretically you know combining them
together and coming up with result but
as I said you need to challenge a lot of
numbers and come up with right you know
it's it's analysis you know it's lot of
analytics involved a lot of brain
involved in lot of common sense involved
I would put it like that it's not a
brainy work but it's a lot of common
sense involved and when we bring those
common sense on table you know a lot of
lot of so-called popular companies would
feel to meet that criteria so I'll talk
a lot about Benjamin Graham you know the
strategy and what is the defense
strategy what is an aggressive strategy
how to combine it how to grow wealth and
so on and so forth whether it's for
individual investing or from a job
standpoint from both perspective it will
help whether euro fresher whether you're
a mature professional it will help you a
lot
any any other question you have you can
shoot up or else we can close the
session for for today
you
in case you do not have any questions
you can actually log off now these are
the details so by the way if you just
want to check
jaren you can actually write with Rica
they will reach out to me for anything
they're the first layer and I'll be more
than happy to answer anything you have
you can write them in email Daniel you
said that you missed out on the session
you can check with the Hedrick I think
they will be sending you the recordings
but just check with them
I think they would most likely send you
the recordings they were a lot of
recordings going on at my needles up so
I think they'll share that yeah makan
you're asking me what kind of models he
used to establish required return on an
investment and risk so popularly used as
capam only have less surprising model
that is aggressively used for India as
well as outside India well it has its
own flaws but there is no other better
model to create to come up with that so
cost of capital is derived on that
however you know practically also you
have to just see you know if if a
certain company has to go out and borrow
money what is the expected return from a
capital point of view so it's not just
from a modeling perspective but you have
to practically apply also this what is
the risk-free rate of India you know it
might be a US bond sorry India ten-year
bond is trading at seven point nine but
you know I normally take seven point
five because that's the average so all
those kind of things needs to be
established
any other question so as you will know
that
modeling will will be just a base and
after that its lot of work with respect
to in practically outdueling things
well Excel is more than enough for
modeling you don't need any other thing
turn when you're asking this question
you can I didn't get your question
well become the stance from your
question so that's where your
understanding about you know different
analysis would come for example I said
that you know this point two six doesn't
seem to be right so that basically meant
that the number we have arrived at is
not the right beta number we can use so
we have two choices one is to
investigate why there is a difference
the other is to actually use a different
method for example I looked into what
the madryn is saying and the madryn is
saying it's around 1.1 so either we can
use that or probably you know create a
pure list and from pure list we can do
an averaging of the industry and see
what is that average and compare it with
what the company is saying so
practically the way it works is you do
appear analysis come up with a beta
measure you unli were it and then you
lever it with the company's capital
structure that's practically you know
how it works so just to avoid that you
know we can use the motrin thank you to
measure because nowadays you know given
the globalization and everything it's
not that beat up or india will be very
different from what in the u.s. it will
not be different
well you will always use your judgment
modeling is a base that understanding is
also very important to play around
different scenarios in the current
environment you know back in 50 years
back this was missing but that does not
replaces you know you are contained your
knowledge or your judgment frame even in
today's time just to give you an example
Warren Buffett would not spend a lot of
time on his Excel and you would spend
more time reading animal reports so in
the program you know one of the major
emphasis is I have is not just the excel
in the modeling part but how to read
those reports how to challenge those
numbers and you will see that everything
is there in the report is just that you
need to just challenge it and a few
years later you will figure out oh you
made a right decision of not investing
what investing in a certain company so
yes modeling in judgment or knowledge
will go hand in hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
