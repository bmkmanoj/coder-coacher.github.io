shells available starting with the cat
command so that as I've said before in
this place the content of the file and
it also allow cells to create one or
more points it also is also helpful to
concatenate finds that means begin
combine two files missing the cat
command
so we have already seen one example the
poor cat decisions so this is the other
so I was explaining you about the cat
come on so here we have you see some
examples all right so so cat is
basically use it to display the content
of the pie and so okay cat is also used
to display the content of you know
political points you can rewrite the
content you can rewrite the content of
both the files too and you find like
file - this is the redirection operator
we used the country will get redirected
to the other pipe and there is another
option called as double redirection all
right so the first one should be
redirected it redirects to a file say if
you are redirecting some other content
to the same point okay so okay first we
have done this operation the content
present till this and this file
presently catfighting - we'll check
there okay we got the country now what I
am doing is I take the content or some
other type cat test2 - which and then we
directing to file you know what happens
so the content is over it'll be okay
say the scenario
yes I don't want to overwrite it I want
to append it to the existing contract
what should I do
all right so then we have something
called a redirection operator okay if
you do every direction
now what happens since the new continent
will get appended to the existing
contract okay you can see the same
content has been copied twice
all right if you do it again this is how
the content will get appended
so these are some important operations
of using cat command
this I yeah I hope you can see my screen
all right so next we have some other
important comments here starting from LS
CD for cat Ltd and these are very basic
commands that we use throughout the
course throat learning you know all the
stuff about whatever they do we will be
using this command so to be able later I
hope you you already helped use this
command your starting we will start from
the first okay
LS command so LS if you list the
contents of the current folder so I
important thing me that you have put it
over here are the man pages and every
flavor of Linux operating system you
will get the Superman goodness all right
so every command will take arguments
okay if you take LS here there is
something called - Ellie okay so there
is a lot of information associated then
you created mine alright so if you want
to see that information you need to
provide multiple arguments to the LS
command okay and if you want to see all
the arguments that have optica we
recommend to check the man peach
man hello yes ok here you will get to
see all the arguments alright so like
that for every command you can check the
man page usually we we max remember some
three to four arguments
so here I let's type in Tel to list it
will give a long last long listing so
here you can see something here
we'll discuss this this is related to
permissions ownership the group that the
file or the holder who has created this
file belongs to let me okay we will see
that later and some more information in
the time stamp with regarding in the
point right this information similar
information is also present for the
deckplates
all right so how do you differentiate
the better place here so just remember
here if you find the - the beginning of
the line it's a fine and then if you
find ad it is a directory okay so we
will see about these conventions later
how the files are identified so this is
how again now we have seen - L argument
then we will see another argument called
I think a a - cable you'll see the
difference between elif's and now you
can mean here it is just plain a lot of
price that start with the dot all right
so when you create a file with the dot
automatically if the file will be hidden
okay
touch creating another point starting
with the dot all right now unless we do
not find that point here then I do LS
type in a it will display all the files
including them with end points okay
similarly to clear up later directly
with the dot
it will only get this red when you use
have been a argument okay so this is how
there are a lot of important either some
of the other important arguments you are
like we can you can see the size of the
file or the particular directory as a
part of the Linux less common region we
can ask the command to list all the
files you know I put the date format
later creates the creation date or you
can reverse that okay so all these
features when you get to a specific
situation or you have a specific
requirement when you want to implement
something I want to display like this or
revolta
files with higher size they have to be
displayed later the requirement we make
use of the arguments but yeah for now
remember all the arguments are present
in the man pages okay then
I'm currently okay clear it's the
command to clear the screen without you
doing cousin working directory I'm here
and if I want to change the directories
okay CD is the command to change the
directory okay see this space slash
topmost lyric 3pw be having this
directly unless I'm listing the contents
this is the first level all the
important folders okay and by default if
I use a CD without any argument okay
observe here I'm logged in as a user
okay so as a servant I use default CD
okay automatically I will be taken to my
home directory where I'm am wherever I
am my default CD will take me to my home
directory okay
other than that you need to clearly
specify the folder structure where you
want to go okay
slash say PPC networks okay so this is
how it is okay so users so this comes
under the restriction how you get that
restricted they're not under to others
folder okay so the main thing is here we
need to provide the exact part okay
where you have to go then the other
commands here
m'kay the air and then we have more come
on okay now we have seen how to create a
blank pipe using touch cover all right
and then we know how to create content
in that file we have seen that
redirection operator okay file poor here
you can hatch through content okay and
then that file for automatically with
Angeles River okay
and the next thing is m'kay the air make
a directory how do you make a collect
even this is the commands okay I want to
create a new directory LS - well you can
see new the air this is the directory
okay it starts with D okay now I've
created a new directory CD you did it
now see this is how we go to the new
directory all right and then the next
one is the more current more command so
if you want to list some specific if you
want to open up and see you have a big
file okay I'll give you a better example
there's something called man pinch right
9ls so now that list will display the
Vantage but unless what I'm doing it so
basically I need a big fire and you file
I created see basically what this
command does is to fill the entire
content to your screen okay if I suspect
you of the size of the pipe once again
take a small example
test okay so whatever content is there
it will simply display to your screen
okay
similarly now I created a bigger pipe
man and it has just paid to the screen
rather than this thing we'd like it
again I have to roll the cursor just to
go to the content of the pipe rather
than doing that what we can do we can
use the more command okay now so you'll
see it will display part of the pipe you
can press Enter
okay and slowly go through the content
of the file ctrl C back to the prompt
okay so this is how we make use of the
more command so so far if you have
observed okay the way I'm aggregating
the instructions on the command front
here if you have observed so I have to
ever accept that bash shell has some
features all right so what what those
features are now you might have seen the
up and down arrow on here people right
so here if you press the upward arrow
okay you will get to see all the
commands that are that used before
okay so she'll remember it maintains a
history of all the commands that we have
used before
alright and another important like that
there are many features with the Bastion
okay so one of the another feature is
the Auto completion feature all right
see this cover is there cat I will type
M press the tab okay
it will complete the name of the binder
that is the order computation future
alright other features that we have seen
in the beginning some of the commands we
have three in the beginning now see cat
here control a pest control a it will
bring the cursor to the beginning of the
beginning of the line okay
similarly control e will bring the
cursor to the
these are the some of the commands that
we have seen in the beginning slide let
each other mention that I explained
later so this is how we can make use of
this command similarly another important
one is control our okay to do a reverse
switch what I'll do is I will simply I
want to use some previous command that
starts with mkd here okay and we simply
start typing m'kay it will complete that
line it will fetch the first matching
command that starts the 10k and it will
display okay so that is how we make use
of the control our teacher so like that
there are other commands over there that
you've been dripper and you can check on
your screen
I mean trick when we practice we want to
the next next slide so with this we are
done here
this covers okay - s is shown are doing
in the presentation you can see there's
actually sorting based on the file size
is doing the first sort other examples
that have been mentioned and then we
have and get the air to make a directory
so CD with is something we have seen so
CD by default takes you to the home
directory so this strange symbol it also
refers to your whole minute click OK to
do see this piston then it will be spear
slash
I will take it the good file system and
we have seen all this PWD and this one
this is important ok people see this
place dot dot it will take you one level
up okay yeah yeah
CD space dot dot now wouldn't be no you
see this space don't see the Lunik so
like that it will take me one level up
right the the three structure that I've
mentioned before it will take me one
level up okay so this it's very very
useful
other than this there is another
important command with silly argument
with CV that is - CD space - okay
so what it does is it will take you to
the immediate previous directory okay
we'll take one example now see where I
am
PWD home center I'm going to smash them
all right now if I want to go to my
previous directory it will go to the
home center the difference between dot
dot and - is so it will only see this
paste or dirt it will take you one level
up in the hierarchy and - will take you
to the previous directory on together
alright this is also very useful then
comes your going to be here you have
covered this k VAR title P it will
ensure that it's present and then we
have more come and give more then we
have move come on
ok so these are very basic commands make
sure that dear you know you have
practiced well alright the next one so I
have some point CP means copy command
okay now what I want to do when you want
to copy a pipe CP copy.c app ID which
phi phi - where should i copied i want
to copy this pipe to an existing folder
move here alright and gets copied unless
you see unless basically this press
dependence of the existing folder it
will do LS space that specific folder
may say LS space I will do M okay will
displace the content of the temp folder
all right
similarly okay so that's how a let's go
so we were checking at copy command so I
have copied this file to this clinic to
you again I want the copy file to slash
temp okay
copied is fine for this particular
notation or what else you can do is copy
I want to copy a file that is present in
template at 3:00 so I need to provide
the exact font theory see
slash temp take a file called pipe okay
and I want to copy this here dot refers
to the current folder remember the
notation or you can also see my current
folder is slash home so you provide
either you provide the path where you
want to copy or you if it is the current
folder you can mention it as dot all
right so it gets copied here is your
point five okay now once we have seen
how copy works let us see how more
comment works like control X alright so
I want to devote this file from this
location and move it to a different okay
then we use move command whoa pipe new
final two flash them okay this is the
same paxville this file to this location
okay so like that you can also try using
both command on directory okay so with
respect to the victory that will be a
slight change in the syntax because a
directory have can't have multiple files
and folders inside it all right so you
need to make sure that you move the
entire directory that means including
the sub files and folders okay so this
is copy come on yeah so you can see here
so with both copy and move there is an
argument called
- R so what - R does is it will try to
because you may copy all the content
with this isn't an that particular today
okay so basically here the test is taken
as an example under test you can have
multiple files and subfolders again in
the subfolders you can have multiple
subfolders okay so it's basically there
can be a big tree structure under it so
we need to ensure that all the tree
structure has been more than you copy or
when you move it move a particular
folder
so that and then we make use of them -
are comin to that but not only when
copying even when you want to delete it
remember this - our argument by deleting
if you want to make sure that all the
sub files and folders are delayed will
be use - are similarly when moving
folders we use - our command okay
even when searching for a particular
file we use - R as an argument
it will recursively search for a
particular point say you want to search
a file in a particular folder and the
other than simply searching in that
folder there are any subfolders it
should also search in a subfolder then
we use - R so - R is an important
argument remember that so with some
other commands it could be capital R but
in general remember R as a recursive
argument okay similarly RM is a command
to remove a point if you want to delete
a PI atom
yeah there are three different ways of
using this I mean mostly if you take a
Linux operating system right the entire
operating system is made up of files
remember this line it's as simple as it
is it's very important as well okay so
even your directory is considered as
there is one kind of file ok the entire
operating system is made up of files ok
further these files are categories like
directories or device files ok that
means all your hardware Hardware is
identified by your device point ok so
you take anything any networking little
devices or your output devices
everything will be considered as a
single file ok
I mean there will be the corresponding
file for everything and it contains the
corresponding configuration as well
okay so so everything in Linux
everything is considered as a point okay
but with respect to deleting the files
there are two references if you want to
delete a regular file normally find
something that I have indicated
indicated before with the - I mean the
files other than directories you can use
an RM command RM space filename ok so
let's go on but you know while talking
about different commands and all I
whenever you know topics like this to
come about device by use or how the
system works internal functionalities
and just when I remember I will give you
some pointers in order to understand it
but please give importance to this point
as well they are very important in
understanding your system all right and
I will also cover the categories of
files I will show you where this finds
are pressing so as of love what I was
explaining this it's about deleting
files and folders in your system other
than directrix so when I still directly
when you do LS - M you will you will you
will see letter D in the beginning of
the the beginning of the line okay so
other than directories if you want to
deliver any other points simply you are
in command okay RM space any normal file
okay that's it
that is when it comes to directive there
is a small change if it is an empty
directory the per mvar remove directory
are in the air paper it means
remove this empty directory all right so
our MD air now here something called new
the air
it says the vector is not empty that
means it only works when the directory
is not empty all right so in this
scenario
and the victory has country what do you
need to do is you can use an RF as
manual recursively and forcefully also
that's it
okay through it's very simple just
remember these three options if you want
to get a normal pie use the RM command
type space filename or any file other
than the directory if it is an empty
directory out of the air and it'll be
directly with content then you need to
do RM space - recursively and force me
you can leave it all the content which
is present in that sub directory
structure okay then okay
this what we've seen all right next
comes another important topic called as
text editors alright so we have here you
can see some the predator she had
written a known thing I mostly use you
know leave my Twitter VI or VI m VI M
stands for modified VI editor okay
I'm very comfortable with the features
present in them
I've been using it for a long time and
you can also try the other editors which
are present here I will help you with I
will explain you some of the features of
the editor now so whim is the text
editors divided to two categories
graphical GUI and also console text
editors so giad is a graphical
literature when you are in GUI boo okay
so I have been continuously using this
word see you I would write
I've been using it for a long time GUI
graphical user interface where you can
get to see that well you can see will
make this for other applications my own
let it treat trash all these options so
here I'm sure this comment okay which is
runlevel okay this is pipe so I have
mentioned before that most of the
server's they do not OP the packages
that that are related to your graphical
user interface should this graphical
part what we have seen so there are some
packages so that that will help you and
enable the GUI from for using your
interface with you
so most of the servers this will be
disabled okay so how it is visible is we
have multiple run levels in your system
okay so just remember tunnel of
Accession okay if you see here only run
level 5 is the graphical okay only when
you run your system run level 5 we will
get to see the graphics ok that is if I
run the system in other wrong level okay
say 3 we do not get to see the graphic
it would completely be a black screen
with command prompt
okay so I will show you I will explain
you what this stronger and when they're
going to get used okay but whenever I
use you know we have we are level
graphical graphically is it modes will
get to see all this
okay moving on so here even in terms of
text editors we have something good you
see edit so when you are in run level 5
you can make use of it so but that is a
possibility that your the next
administration work you will be working
on the servers you may not have the
kernel it abilify your GUI go so it is
important that we waited stick to v8 or
nano editor all right so these are it is
basically help you to edit the content
of the points if you want to modify a
find how to do modify button so far we
have seen how to frame
the content of the piles friend or you
know using the mode command we can just
go through the content of the file
slowly but if I want to vertically
something in a pile how do i modify the
content of the file okay so we will
stick to the VA that later now I will we
can open a file and a gear editor and we
can we will see how to make changes
using the VA editor okay you can even
try this graphical editor G edit when
you do a dehydrates naturally to see
password we'll do some we load some
other time here do it for what it does
is it will pop up near window it will
open the file in a graphical editor here
my name is a bit store so it's taking
some time so where you can yeah okay you
have contents print you can delete or
you can add some new content here you
can save and then you close the file
okay
automatically it gets it so this is all
about it editor in general so when you
when you start working with the VI
editor all right we'll see different
features or PA editor now we take the
other the big five yes so I copied some
man pages to this file
alright so what I will do is I will
again taken on page and at least and
then redirecting it to and you there is
a lot of content in the main page okay
VI space you'll find this is the same
type in order to open a VA to open a
file and VI editor
so the water participants have copied
the man pitch this pi controller looks
similar to the man page okay now see so
I have opened o P editor so when you
open up be hydrated right so there are
different modes in the editor
so the first more word using cleaner you
can use the up and down arrows to see
the content of that finding alright then
is another mode there is another mode
called as command mode where you can use
the forward forward slash and what you
can do is you can search the content see
forward slash I will leave something
called ok - ok automatically the cuts
that would come over there okay so colon
0 but we go to the beginning of the pie
know there are some optional tell you so
if you walk if you want to there is a
very big configuration file and you want
to quickly go to some parameter in the
middle of the fight and you remember
what that word is
ok so what you do is you open the file
use a smash and use that particular that
particular word we do something called
shell all right so I got word so this is
the first occurrence optician so then
when I search like that
the cursor will go to the first first
occurrence of that world ok then if you
want to go to the next occurrence simply
press n 10 will take you to next and all
right so this is healthy
go through them we go with the search
parameters that we have again : 0 it
will take you to the beginning of the
file shift and she will bring you to the
ending of the pencil knowing this
shortcuts will help you in editing big
files and going through the content of
the pipe and let's see what is that time
keep it enough so our country added so
yeah this is one quick example
used ba on the grabbed or confide but I
would suggest is you go through this tip
it is but you know do not try using the
making changes to the files that are
present in this presentation there is
something called UTC possible open this
this is an important configuration to
find your practice on this configuration
points you know highly recommended what
you do is the way I have showed you take
a man page you know dump the man page to
a pile I have shown you how to do it and
then you practice on that do not touch
the proper confines these are you know
your basic drug related
if you modify this or if you delete this
by mistake automatically it will affect
your system okay yeah some more commands
in the VI editor now I have two new okay
will quickly start from beginning VI
space filename okay I opened the pipe
and colon zero start topic Phi shift G
okay and then I told you how to search
further works as well okay the next
thing is say I want to delete the line
all right
so he will delete the line if I say for
lady I will be late for lunch
similarly it's very simple you can see
it here okay
press C twice it will cut the line and
then followed by P it will paste the
line you need to move the cursor
wherever you want to paste the line okay
similarly really will delete the line DW
will denote the word okay
this practice using this this is a very
important movement so here yes once
you're done with the practice of this so
how to delete multiple lines leading
will give it one line so to delete
multiple
all right tastes always works so here
why waste I'm still copying a line
yanking if you will for y by 4 lengths
will get copied the next time you will
press B it will paste all the four links
make sure that move the cursor wherever
you want to paste lines so you can even
follow this force field to wiper you can
practice all this you can try escape you
you can undo something you can redo you
can read face you can happen just I'll
go trees all the shortcuts and just
practice new shortcuts that very helpful
for your bearded some what features are
here if you want to highlight the syntax
or some other modes are available here
autocomplete et cetera you can also set
a builder spell checker so you can even
just read this and you know you can
practice choose options as well and we
also have nano editor here and you can
go through this features and see if
you're comfortable using a nano editor
so firstly it has all the arguments
available yeah and one last thing in the
V editor you have made all the changes
ok and finally : W you save those
changes you see here all the changes are
written to the pine alright and then you
to quit again you modified something you
want to save and quit at a time all lwq
that's it okay then we'll comes laniel
alright what I'd suggest here is the way
it's given here you simply open the file
nano space filename the moment you open
the pipe similarly just like
you can modify as regarding making
changes Monica the changes regarding
saving in exiting manual the commands
that different you can go through this
come on similarly just like IBM another
it's a different a little friendly
editor and anything particularly I mean
any specific questions regarding that
all right just try using it yeah
there are some options given here look
and feel are a bit different you have
all the options listed down at the
bottom of the Nano editor
alright ok guys if you are near to the
next operating system I just want to
tell you once again it's all about
comments okay so the course will be all
about understanding how the system works
understanding how the service works and
how to make use of the command and we
have a lot of other utilities like if
you can see here we have something
called on the screen you can see you up
you see the clip ok a lot of tools and
utilities are coming up ok if you have
new to Linux please practice all the
commands that we have covered today
because a lot of comments or comma and
we gradually you know go to the next
level of making use of these commands in
order to implement in order to do some
other tasks we will not be I will not be
through the basics but at any point of
time if you have questions please you
can drain them I will explain you but if
you are new to this topics of color
please practice will before coming to
the next session ok
practice is very important now here now
we have three important tools here
och grip and a CV so off you know all
together
there is a programming language
altogether but we will see the basic
usage on how to make use of command and
what is the grip from and what is this
uni and give you one basic example so
how do that these commands would exactly
put it where you can make use of these
comments all right so
okay okay we'll start with grip command
first okay that is see the pattern here
we have this wolf I wonder if it
contains a lot of data
okay so we searched for a word called
shell inside the VA editor okay
outside the way editor now if I want to
display all the lines that contain the
world called shell then I use to start
simply okay so in a file
this word shell can be repeated multiple
times or it can be once and I'm not sure
about it but I want to display all the
lengths that contain a steward holders
shell okay then what I do is grab that
particular world and the file name
okay now check here in this time it has
word called shell let's work on shell
and here also sure okay so basically
what drip that is expected such feature
okay it searches for a particular string
that we had given it
what is it pattern matching tool or
feature that we have using that we can
we can search for a particular pattern
it's not just direct but we have also
it's like other tools like clip key grip
you know searching rather than searching
with a single word I can I can also sit
with multiple words generally these are
the questions you might face when you go
for interviews how do you search for
multiple words in a pile like grip width
x as well as pi like that
so now that I have listed all this
rather than listing all the content on
the screen what I want is I just want to
know the number of occurrences that's
what that means number of times
grab the shell word shell is present all
right so then we have what happens links
I'm talking about other features option
all right today I had said before there
are multiple arguments present within
each argument you will get a different
output all right so here the basic
feature is when you use the grep command
what happens it will display the lines
that are matching the word the next
argument is grab - I - I what it does is
it's a case insensitive sense a shell is
present in capital letters which I ll
in caps or say the first letter S is
caps rest all are small letters so he
grabbed fill brick will only search for
the exact word that you have given so do
not consider the case sensitivity so
that's the if you want to search like
that you need to give - I so doing
everything just virtually so it will
lift though such magic words that not
present all right so that is the second
important argument next comes - n okay -
only prints the number of lines that are
matching okay like that so here if you I
hope you're what will scream so there is
something called group space in third
place s 0 to line alright so this is a
kind of regular expression so if you
have time please go through what exactly
a regular expression is okay here this
means something
it's from zero to nine it represents
number from 0 to 9 ok so we are
searching for lines
that are matching these numbers rather
than mentioning all the numbers I have
used an expression you know we call them
as expressions so grip also works with
expressions if you give an expression it
will search for that expression okay so
just go through what a regular
expression means so we also have some
special characters will be making use
nothing mimics and yes here so here we
have seen an example where we are
gripping for some string or for some
number in a point all right we are
searching in a pile rather than
searching in a pine they can also use
grip in an in a different way that means
if you can see you're right so here at
p.m. space - QE whatever it is it is
some command it will generate some
output okay and then there is something
called pipe operator which is called as
a pipe okay and then followed by grip
space crab here what we are doing is we
are running some common okay unless he
is displaying something for me okay I
want to know in this particular
directory I want to know how many file
names are starting with the world test
all right if you can see here LS means
it will des the content what I want to
know I want to grip for file names that
start with the word test all right see
grip helps you to search for a string in
a file at the same time it is also
useful to search for the strings we can
also apply grip on an output okay so we
can generate some output and then done
we can apply grip on that output eyes
good all right this is and here if you
observe there is something called pipe
operator
remember this it's a very important
symbol do you think it's out paper you
can you can perform multiple operations
okay we even you will you'll be seeing
me using this operator in a lot of
scenarios okay so this is the another
use case then we have a CD come on so
regarding runlevel so you got 11 points
to the okay in a Linux operating system
okay it will takes time okay let's try
there is something called a PC in it dot
t-- folder okay so it's a it's a bit
advanced but you try to make it as
simple as possible okay so all your
system initialization points okay when
you start your system a set of four
configuration files would get loaded
into your system okay so try to the next
time you start your Linux operating
system try to observe what is happening
it will display a lot of content on the
screen that it is starting this
particular that we use this is a
different bit successfully started
already
similarly observe when you shut down
your system what happens all right
the way it displays when you starting
your system similarly in this place Lord
of continued shutdown your system that
means it will stop the processes one not
with another so when you start a little
lot of all right so all this list will
be displayed to you at the beginning as
a regular ending of when you stop your
operating when you shut on your
operating system alright so here when I
say run level 500 among the list of
processes that are running there are
some extra processes which are related
to the graphics okay
so all together I will take some random
numbers okay random numbers say all the
way that there are a hundred different
services out of which five are related
to the graphics alright so when a number
system and run level by all the hundred
services are running in my system
including graphics so when I go to run
level three it will only consider 95 of
those services it will not consider the
five which are at left for the graphical
part all right so it will leave the
services it will only run excluding the
graphical part so that is why you will
not get to see the graphics that is
called as run level three what you can
do is you can start your system in run
level three there you will not get to
see any of the graphics only a black
screen with the command from so the
system has to the Lord has not loaded
any of the graphic models all right
similarly we have other other okay if
you want to know how to switch between
run levels all right so there is a
covenant called in it alright so in it
is to initialize all right so in it
space three will please will start your
system and run we level three okay so
there are other run levels I have shown
you and the prior you called
UTC in it there okay in the end you can
see that in fact your system when you
shut down your system you do what in it
that means the background I mean
normally you power of interesting but of
the background the system that will take
and unit space zero command all right so
if you lose unit space zero I mean you
need to be a dot administrator in order
to perform these commands just remember
this you need to be a root administrator
so if you do you need zero your system
will shut down if you do a unit one
single user mode
all right in
who is multi-user without end APIs and
then a tree will have everything except
the graphics and it for is unused and at
five is your graphical one if you want
to restart oil spill you know net six
okay so these are run level and this is
how you can switch between one level and
I will talk more about what this I mean
how this run levels work that means when
you do a minute space three what exactly
happens on the back door so what are the
points that are being triggered
okay of your system what what exactly
your system does when you do and units
these three ordinate physics like that
we will see will go deep into these run
levels and how they are implemented in
tomorrow's session so for now yeah I
mean I usually go with by giving a basic
overview of what the thing sir but these
topics do come again and again
throughout the session we'll go to the
next level and next level like that
we'll go deep into each of the topics
all right you started with grip command
so where we have searched for specific
strings in files all right we can even
perform multiple strings such using
other utilities like BFF depend on you
can see those little it is created but
the big start we have seen how to or
from a case sensitive case insensitive
switch also how to list the number of
occurrences you know we have seen all
those options using the grip from a trip
type in ie a pipe in n ok so we'll stick
to a limited are given initially
actually we will see the next we'll see
oh come on ok so first of all I really
show you a very pale example just to
have an understanding of
work on that then we'll see other
options other argument of the days of
making use of oh come on okay we'll take
a sample fight your own ice cream and
here what I'll do it
I'll make some increase okay okay okay
it's ready okay so here what I'll do is
I'll I I will apply off on this
so this pile has a few rows and columns
okay
and each element is space separated here
okay so what I'll do is using this okay
so a paste will the field separator okay
this is the basic syntax in order to use
the Optima
so here the field sector to is to space
okay followed by so in the PI record
test okay so if you observe the output
basically what we did is we have printed
the second column all right so the first
use case is earth would help you in
order to print specific you know columns
all right heel dollar two is referred to
a second column similarly we different
dollar one all right or we can we can
print the last line like that so this is
the very basic example okay so going to
the next level what else we can do is we
can we can also sit the way we have used
the grip command okay similarly we can
also use the of
okay so observe the syntax here so what
we are doing else of optional much what
what is it that we are trying to set
just like with grep space the keyword
you can also specify a keyword here okay
and then you can say print something or
you can say if off is matching this word
whatever line matches whatever line
contains this word that is for Ling Li
you can print them all the lines or you
can even print specific columns of the
ply or you can you can you know you can
exclude that line and you can print the
other lengths alright so here if you
remember there is something called a
pipe operator that we have used
yesterday so pipe operator basically it
helps you to redirect the output of one
command to another command so here
whatever we are doing using whatever
output comes we are redirecting using
the pipe command here we can use another
command on top of that output okay so
here you can see this example okay so
there is no field separator we have we
are not mentioned anything so we use
pure separator only when we want to
explicitly define the value that that we
are expecting so if I can have imagine a
pie it can have space separated content
you can have AB submitted content or it
can have you know you can even keep the
words or special characters as field
separators alright so if you have the
data file looking very complex you can
use the occupied you can you know use
this pipe and keep on givin sending your
output to the next level and you can you
know you can process the data ok so you
can consider this to like the ones which
are very useful for processing your data
you can filter your data I can perform
some operations on top of here to a
temperature like that so the second
example here is we are we are doing
another basic operation okay what we are
saying
I just want to print the first line from
this
ten dollar one so the first column from
the grub dot txt pie
all right print dollar one so here even
if you do not specify so when we are
specifying a field separate than right
so it would be applicable from work so
when we believe even without playing a
field separator it will save dollar room
first column whatever is there it will
get printed
all right so then you peel it here if
there's specific important appearance of
them then it will search for that
separate event it will try to filter the
content accordingly okay so here we are
printing wood dollar one comma Donald -
okay so observe one can be a printing
first column and the second column from
this pipe okay without any specific
fields of business okay so here what is
happening is if you observe I there is a
comma that separates dollar and dollar -
but this doesn't mean that output will
also be comma separated okay so we will
see this here itself okay what I will do
is I will remove the field separator
here okay okay
