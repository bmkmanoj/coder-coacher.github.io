first need to know what a computer is
and how it functions so what is a
computer the
definition says a computer is an
electronic device which can perform a
set of tasks based on the instructions
given to it sounds really complicated
isn't it but he can think of a computer
to be very similar to a friend let's say
you want your friend to do you a favor
you would just tell him what he needs to
do and how it should be done now if
you're not clear in communicating to him
as to what he needs to do that he might
just land up doing something totally
different from what you wanted him to do
let's say you wanted your friends help
to propose to a girl you really like but
you messed up while pointing the girl
out that he might just land up proposing
the wrong girl and for all you know this
girl might even be someone you hate so
you really don't want to mess up while
trying to tell what you really want
computers are also very similar if you
want the computer to perform some tasks
then you need to tell it clearly as to
what it needs to do so what do we mean
by clarity to have clarity in any task
there are three components involved
there is the input there is the task
itself and then there is the output in
this example input is the girl the task
is proposing and the output could either
be a slap or a smile now there is one
small difference between a computer and
your friend computers are really really
stupid
they are like three-year-old kid so even
if you have told the computer as to what
it needs to do you would have to tell it
step by step as to how it needs to be
done so the task that the computer has
to perform has to be explained to it in
every step so for example killer
proposing a three-year-old kid does not
know what proposing means you'll have to
exactly tell him as to what words to
tell the girl how to do it maybe take a
chocolate maybe take a bunch of roses
but you will have to tell in every step
that he needs to do
that's exactly how computers are so the
fun
of a computer is very simple it's a
device that can perform tasks for you
really fast but you need to instruct it
every step that it needs to do now we
know what a computer is let's see what
is inside this computer ok
so what is a computer made of we know
that the heart of the computer is the
CPU also you can see that you have
something called the keyboard or the
mouse right in front of you so the
keyboard or the mouse are the input
devices and then you have the monitor
which is the output device also you have
heard of the term called RAM or random
access memory which is also called the
main memory now we know what the
computer is made of so let's see how
these components interact with each
other the CPU as you know it is the
heart of the computer and it is
responsible for executing all the
instructions that are given by you in
the form of a program or an application
the program or the application could be
sitting on a hard disk the hard disk
acts as both an input or an output
device because you can get instructions
from the hard disk and at the same time
it can also store the results on the
hard disk
so let's say you have a program stored
on the hard disk the CPU would fetch the
instructions from the hard disk and copy
the instructions to the main memory it
would then fetch one instruction at a
time from main memory and execute it
during this whole process the CPU also
uses the main memory to store
intermediate results now you might
wonder as to why do we need the main
memory when everything we need is
already present on the disk the CPU
could just read the instructions from
the disk directly and store intermediate
results on the disk - then why do we
need the main memory the speed of the
main memory is many times faster than
that of the hard disk making
applications run really fast if the CPU
were to fetch all this from the hard
disk every time then the applications
today would be a million times slower
now what is the purpose of the input of
the output device the instruction the
CPU needs to execute is going to come
from the input device which could either
be directly from the user from the
keyboard or it could come from a hard
disk too and finally after all the
processing the CPU needs to send the
output somewhere which could be a
monitor or the hard disk again which is
again an output device now the input
that comes to the CPU consists of two
parts the input pencils of the data and
the instruction what do we mean by these
two terms let's say you want the
computer to add 45 and 56 the
instruction that you're giving to the
CPU is add two numbers the data you're
sending the CPU are the numbers 45 and
56 so any instruction or any input that
comes to the CPU always comes in two
forms that is the data part and the
instruction part I have now given you a
quick summary or the basic components of
a computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
