the components behind any Android app
that you might create one component i
have already talked about which is an
activity so everything that you see on
an android application screen is a part
of an activity a few people can relate
to other programming languages let me
talk about an activity as a form in
the.net perspective right so everyone
just remember that an activity is very
much like a form that has got a few set
of user interfaces that the user
interacts with if you talk about a
facebook application the facebook
application also has got an activity
where the user sees the news feeds the
user see is the friend requests and
everything right so i hope the activity
component of the android application is
clear to everyone any doubts any
questions you can respond back onto the
chat window let's then talk about the
intense if i talk about the intense what
I necessarily mean is that the intense
are the action initiators I told you
something that if I want to have a query
or access to all the images that are
housed onto the device the intense re
one that helped me in doing that it's
more so the action initiators that I
have for example i want to say okay i
have screen one I have stream too all
right so mean has asked me a very good
question here what software we need to
develop the app if you take a look from
it I've already got it open up for you
right so this is an Eclipse environment
with with the a.d.d bundled plugin can
you see that Java ADT it's more so an
eclipse software with the adt plugin
installed into it that will be making
use of in order to develop our
applications you can see that this is my
work space right so whatever i will be
creating will be creating as a part of
my workspace sameed any doubts any
questions you can respond back
then we talked about intense right so I
told you the intents are the action
initiators for example i say i have to
launch screen one right which has to be
launched from screen to and i can do a
wise for sciences launch screen to from
screen one so what i need to do is I
need to have an action initiation done
that action initiation is the part of
the intense then we have another
component which we call as service has
anyone taken a look at a call recording
application any call recording
application has anyone taken a look at
it if anyone knows about it no Sameer
all right Sonia has asked me a question
here can we use a dream we were or vb
for appt the blueprint actually they are
majorly done are used for c++
programming somil and how what we are
doing is we are doing a java development
so we'll be making use of NetBeans or
we'll be making use of the android
studio or we'll be making use of the
android ad deep under so that is how we
will be doing the app development it's
just that the dreamy word or the VV does
not support this kind of development
Cindy samee sorry let's talk about a
service all right I say what I want to
do is I want to have the user call
recorded any time the users receives a
call I want my application to have the
call recording done in the background
right app accelerator is for a cross
application development turn all right
when we talk about say us a call being
received what I want to do is I want to
record the call in the background
whenever we talk about anything that
runs in the background at does not have
a user interface then I will be having a
service component working for it that
will do they recording for me in the
background so any black background work
that I need to do I will be making use
of a service for it moving on we have
another component which we call as a
content
provider I told you about the content
provider a little in brief that has
images the SMS is the car logs the call
history everything is a part of the
system's resources taras and network
Android devices resources so what the
Android device does is it does not allow
me access to the database of these
applications for example the call logs
the contacts the messages it does not
allow me access to their database what
it does is it keeps a layer in between
the layer is called the content provider
when I talk about a layer as the content
provider what I necessarily mean here is
that the layer of the continent provider
is just assuming right that any
application can make use of the content
provider so it does not bind the
database to any application however the
layer binding has the application with
it it's more so I'll just give it to you
it's more so a layer in between activity
or my application understand or just
works with the layer the layer works
with the database the database response
back to that layer and my lair just
responds back to my application so it is
that kind of a work that is done with
the help of the content providers moving
on we have a broadcastreceiver alright
question for everyone how do I get to
know that I have got an alarm that need
to be wrong how do I get to know
whenever I'm traveling my time zone has
changed anyone who can think about it
they are actually a system events
whenever i plug in the charger right i
get to know my battery has caught
started charging so they are actually a
receiver pattern that is as soon as an
even happens as soon as an event happens
what happens is my application gets
notified that this particular event has
taken place so these are like the
broadcast receivers
that's correct it's more so at event
that has been kept by the system right
and whenever the even happens my system
gets notified that this particular event
has happened so that is how we take care
of the broadcast as he goes let's move
on see an activity I told you every
stream that you see on an Android device
is an activity and you can see that and
relate to it with the help of a facebook
application example let's talk us about
the life cycle of an activity if you
talk about there's a screen right
there's a screen but that screen has got
a various callbacks I'll tell you an
example I'm actually taking a look at a
screen however I'm looking when when I'm
looking at the screen what I do is I do
get a phone bak phone call right I don't
get a phone call I disconnect the phone
and what happens is i am still at the
same stream right everybody just respond
back to the query that i have asked you
i have an application up and running i
get a phone call i finish up the phone
call I'm again taken back to the
activity that i was looking at is that
correct I'll wait for your responses
back on the chat window what happens is
that in droid is a device right and we
have limited memory limited CPU it's not
as good as a laptop that is running on
an i5 it's not good it's it's not as
good as it right so what we need to do
is we need to make use of the resources
judiciously but I say making use of the
resources judiciously what are
necessarily mean is that I need to
handle the various callbacks in order to
let these nurses be allocated and let
the resources be deallocated so let me
take a few use case scenarios where and
my activity might enter in what state
whenever I create an activity will be
talking about when we will be covering
this course more in detail I go on to on
create on start on restore on the zoom
my activity starts running I get a call
right my activity gets into the pause
mode as as long as we call is going on
what should happen to the system
resources should they still be occupied
or should they be released question for
everyone if I'm making use of a system
resource all right I'm making use of
some services are making use of some
activity components buttons images
should they be released should they be
still occupied what you say is still
occupied sandeep say is released i would
say virtual they should still be
occupied however they should not be
performing any functioning is that
correct I say they still should be
occupied but not performing any work is
this correct right so what I do is
whenever I get a call my activity goes
into the positive as the call is in
progress the activity is stopped that is
I'm not performing any work under it I
finish up the call I again call on
resume and I go on the activity again
starts running anyone having any doubts
any questions understanding the use case
of the activity getting stopped I'll
wait for your responses i will give you
another use case i say i have the
application up and running and what i
have done is i have pressed the home
button of the device when the home
button gets pressed what happens does my
application do any work when i have
placed my application in the background
does my application do any work first of
all it will first of all go into the
ball state then it will also go into
this top state take a look at the
stopped state as something we're in I'm
not
seeing the activity on stream just
understand it like this anytime the
activity is not being seen on the screen
it has stopped is that is this example
correct clear to everyone now let's take
a look at an example where an i am
launching an activity i'm launching my
application i do p press the hardware
back button i say the i press the
hardware back button when i press the
hardware but back but what happens the
activity goes off i made for you to
respond back whenever I press the
hardware back bottom the activity goes
off in this case what will happen is
virtual first call will be done to the
post eight second call will be done to
the stopped state and third call will be
done to the destroyed state because now
I as a user have manually destroyed this
application any doubts any questions
I'll wait for your responses back onto
the chat window moving on the third
component the intense as I said you can
think of intense as a work and an object
for example you want to call from within
your application you want to play a
music file from within your application
this is all something that is governed
with the help of the intense let me also
tell you we are just covering a brief
about all these components when we'll be
covering on the actual development you
will get to know a lot more in detail
about these components right moving on
stretching between activities as I said
one of the primary objectives of intent
is also to initiate one activity from
another right services
first of all can everyone take a look at
the life cycle of a service it has got
starting when I'm destroyed no pause can
everyone see that it has it does not
have a pause state in the life cycle
whenever I talk about a service right do
doesn't service have a user interface
does the service have a user interface
since it does not have a user interface
what do we what it will do if i go it
goes into the quad state the reason the
service does not have a user interface
there is no requirement of a poskitt
since the user is not interacting with
the surface it keeps doing its work in
the background so even if it is stop it
can only have two states one is on one
is off right since the user does not
interact with it no pause straight here
let's also talk about what are the types
of services right there are actually two
types of services that we make use of
one is bound one is unbound a bound
service is something that is activated
or initiated with the help of an
activity and is in the memory only till
the time the activity is up however the
unbound services something that is
associated with an entire application
and will be up till the time the
application is alive and a use case I
have around 20 screens within my
application and I can have a service
running on only two screens from within
my application this is an example of a
bound service I have many screens in my
application and I want my service to be
running respective of the activity that
i have in my application that is an
example of an unbound service an example
keeps running in the background requests
or looks for the news feeds by
difference or notifications that you get
about different requests
content providers you can see that the
layer I was talking about my app and
practice with the content providers the
content providers ultimately interacts
with the database perform operations
like wearing up deletion insertion and
the updation then the broadcast
receivers as I said it is a system
broadcast so what happens is first of
all I need to register my intense to
observe for a broadcast as soon as the
observer gets the observance done it
gets a notification when the intent
occurs an example alarm that wakes up or
rings the device when the stipulated
time is reached is triggered with the
help of a broadcast receiver right
moving on now you know about what is an
activity what are intense what is the
service what are content providers what
are broadcast receivers talk about an
activity but when I talk about an
activity it is more so a screen that the
user interacts with so if i'm creating
application and my application has got
20 screens that interact with the user
so i'll say call them for the activities
now the activities need to be triggered
one from the another one right one two
two two two three and so on that action
of initiating an activity from one
activity to another is the one that has
taken care of by the intense talking
about services anything that does not
have a user interface and keeps running
in the background it keeps running in
the background and once it's process
gets over it will notify the user
interface that i have downloaded this
data and now what you want to do is you
want to show up on the user interface
this theta activity starts a nun one
service to listen for our broadcast
receiver and whenever the broadcast
receiver is
you all right what we can do is we can
start an activity or we can also update
the UI thorough right for example i have
downloaded some data what i can do is i
can update the data on 3rd then we have
content providers a central repository
of the data which way which our
application may look up to then we have
the broadcast receivers as i said a
broadcast receivers is a dormant
receiver that only observes for anything
that is being received everyone knows
what are the building blocks life cycle
how the hardware events are being
handled the background jobs the multiple
apps access share your souls that is the
content providers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
