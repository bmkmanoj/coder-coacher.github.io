welcome to this fourth video of a
trekkers free angular course for
business in this video I'm going to talk
about data binding now in my video on
angular installation I got a feedback
that I didn't show how to configure the
ID that I am using so before moving into
data binding let me first show you how
to setup or configure your ID for
developing Android applications well the
ID that I am using is called as Adam and
it is one of the popular ID for going
ahead with Android app development so in
order to get the Adam ID in to visit the
website
Adam dot IO now from the website
download the correct installer as for
your operating system for example if you
have a Windows then go ahead just by
clicking this red button else you need
to check out this section where the
installer for other platforms has been
provided now once you have downloaded
the Installer go ahead and install the
application or the ID then once you are
done with the installation you need to
add some plugin or install some plugin
in order to go ahead with angular app
development so let me show you what are
those plugins that you have to install
in Adam those are called as packages so
you need to go to file then go to
settings if you go to the packages
section
he says that you need to install our
Adam bootstrap 3 because for styling
purposes we'll be using bootstrap and I
will show you how to install boot strap
for your angular project we need to
install Adam typescript for typescript
support then for terminal you need to go
ahead with platform your - ID - terminal
now in order to install a particular
package go to the install section and
there you have to mention the name of
the package that you want to install for
example I want to go ahead with a script
so right i script over here and press
Enter
now once you hit enter you will be
provided with all those packages that
has the name typescript in it and you
have to go ahead with this Adam
typescript 11.0 point 9 now apart from
that you have to go ahead with platform
you - ID - terminal and you need to go
ahead with bootstrap 3 this one so these
are the packages guys that you need to
install now once you have installed all
these packages you're good to go
with Android app development now from
now on we'll be using bootstrap
extensively for creating the application
or for all the demos that I will be
showing over here so let me show you how
to install bootstrap so if you are using
atom and you have install the package
platform your - ID - terminal you need
to go ahead with all shifty for opening
the terminal then you to go ahead with
your project folder inside your project
folder then again bootstrap will be a
NPM package so you need to go with the
command NPM install bootstrap and then
last a safe the flag - does say what it
does is it put your dependencies that is
bootstrap in your package or JSON file
so that whenever you are committing your
project on github or you're sharing your
project with someone else that guy could
covert with the command and be installed
that command will look to a package or
JSON file and install all those
dependencies that is required for
running your angular application
check out this package or Jason you will
find that bootstrap hasn't mentioned
over here as you can see basically this
dependency or the bootstrap package will
be installed inside your node models
folder you can check that as well
here you can see this is the package
name that we have installed the
bootstrap package
once you have installed bootstrap you
need to mention it or tell your
application that whenever is startup it
should report that would strap
stylesheet while bundling your
application so remember in the second
video when we discussed the project
structure all the files then I talked
about angular - CLI dot JSON file and
specifically I talked about this style
sorry where you put all your global
style sheet that has to be bundled along
with your angular application so here we
want to mention the path for our
bootstrap style sheet so that whenever
your application is being rendered your
bootstraps I'll will be bundled
along so go ahead
by providing the path so node modules
then you go to bootstrap then you go to
test then you go to search then
bootstrap toward main toward CSS so
that's the path that I am talking about
now let's go ahead and run our
application so I will go ahead come on
NPM start basically NPM start and ng
serve are pretty much similar this NPM
start would execute ng serve in the end
as you can see this has been mentioned
in my package or JSON file all the
scripts as we have talked about this
earlier as well where this NPM start
command would execute ng serve if I go
ahead with my localhost 4200 so as you
can see the font has been changed that
indicates that bootstrap has been added
or what you can do you can inspect your
file
then you can go it inside held then the
stylesheet and you can see that the
bootstrap has been bundled along with
your application basically what happens
is behind the scene the CLI the command
line tool for annular uses a tool called
as backpack which bundles your
JavaScript and CSS or stylesheet files
and then add them to the index dot HTML
file that's why whenever you prenda your
application or whenever you execute ng
serve command in the end you get this
message from FF pack because it has
successfully performed all the bundling
so if I go ahead and do the paid source
as you can see that all these scripts
are the same script that has been
generated by your web pack so here is
your stylist or bundled or chairs and
here you can see that we have bootstrap
added alright then so we have learned
how to configure ID
apart from Adam there are other IDs as
well for example you can go ahead with
Microsoft vs code or you can go ahead
with web strong by the JetBrains or
sublime text 3 my personal
recommendation would be Adam and V s
code now the reason that I am
recommending Microsoft 3 s code is
because typescript is also developed by
Microsoft and is a recommended language
for going ahead with angular application
so I don't think I need to mention
anything else you can do the math and go
ahead with PS code as well now let's get
back to our slide and start learning
about data binding so in my previous
video I talked about component and we
learned that component essentially has
two parts one is business logic where
all your quotes or logics are written
and a second one is template or few the
visual part of component that you see or
a user see when it opens a web site on
the browser together these two make a
component now the question is how to
connect these two or if a data or
property has been defined inside my
component class how to bind that
property value to template so that is
where your data binding comes into
picture so basically data binding is a
connection bridge between your view the
template that you see and the business
logic to course the logics that you
right inside your component class so
whenever you want to collect
all those properties all the courts that
you have written inside your comprehend
class to your template or to some
interaction that hasn't performed on
your templates for example if a user
click on a button you want certain codes
to be executed you go ahead with data
binding now based on the direction in
which data binding works that is either
it is from your component logs to your
template or it is from template to your
component class angular provides four
types of data binding so the easiest one
of them is called as interpolation so
basically in interpolation the flow is
from your component class to your Tom so
any property that you have inside your
component for example suppose I have two
properties or two variables which has a
string value inside my component and
what I want is I want to display the
value of those property in my template
so for that I can go ahead and use
interpolation so let's go ahead and
understand what is interpolation
practically if I go to my IDE so I'll go
ahead with my first component
and this is my template so here what we
were doing we were hard coding the
content that we want to display in our
browser so now what I want is I don't
want to hard code all those text that I
want to show instead what I want is I
want to have a property inside my
component for example I want a property
as heading 2 which will be of type
string I want to set the value as I am
component first component so now if you
check over here
this is the component that has being
rendered over here and this is the
content that we are able to see now what
I want is instead of this hard coded
content I want this property to be
binded with my HTML h2 tag or the h2
element so that the value of this
variable or the property that I have
defined over here should be displayed on
my browser so for that what I will do I
will do interpolation so for
interpolating any property that you have
inside your component class you go ahead
with double curly braces and inside that
you put the property name in our case
which is heading 2 so as you can see we
are having the same content being
displayed over here and if I make some
changes over here
I love interpolation so you can see the
same has been displayed on our browser
basically in interpolation all those
property that can be resolved in the end
to a type string can be interpolated
apart from that you can also go ahead
with expression such as for example what
I want now is I will go ahead with Akane
its to tag and this time what I want is
I want to display one plus one and if I
run it you can see that one plus one has
been displayed over here equals two then
I am going to do interpolation and Here
I am going to go ahead with one plus one
so if I do this you can see that that
expression has been evaluated and then
finally the final result has been
resolved to string and then displayed
over here similarly what I can do is I
can go ahead and give the name of a
function that I will define inside my
component class that returns a string
for example what I can do
suppose I'm creating a function called
as return string and there I want to
return
this value and then I want to call that
function over here so green as you can
see the same content is being displayed
so that string has been returned for our
function first the function is called
and a string value has returned and
finally interpolated so as to display on
your browser so again if I make some
changes string return so you can see
that that is being displayed over here
so that is the reason that since the
flow is from your component to your
template it is in a one direction that's
why it called as one-way data-binding
we have three types of data binding that
has only one direction the first one is
this interpolation then second that we
will learn is called as property binding
the flow is saying again from competent
to your template now the third one is
different in terms of direction but
again that one is also a one-way
data-binding
only the direction differs that is the
direction is from your template to your
component class so for example you want
to capture some event such as clicking a
button and you want to execute certain
course that is there in your component
class then you use event point we will
see all of them one by one so I guess
you have understand interpolation it is
very easy to use guys all you have to do
is put your property name inside your
double curly braces and it will be
binded with your template so that is the
mark-up that you have to use for
interpolation that is double curly
braces now the second one is property
binding as I discussed as a name
suggests again it is the same you are
binding the property that is there in
your component class with that of the
property of some HTML element in your
dorm or in your template so let's go
ahead and perform a simple property
binding so what I have done I have
copied an image inside my assets folder
at rekha underscore logo dot PNG and
what I want to do is I want to display
this image on my template so I'll go
ahead and I'll use something called as
image tag let me put a ruler they'll go
ahead with image and this image element
has a property called as source where
you give the path or URL of the image
that you want to display so in our case
I'm going to go ahead
acet and then a tarika logo dot PNG so
now if I go ahead and check my browser
you can see the image is being displayed
over here now what I want is instead of
providing the hard-coded paths I want to
use one of the property that I will be
creating inside my component which will
be set to the value of the path that
where the image is residing so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
have a property as image URL which will
be of type string and I'm gonna go ahead
with the path so this is the path that I
am talking about if I copy a table and I
put it inside and I put so now what I
want is I want to buy in this property
this image URL property to the source
property of my image HTML element so
here what I will do first I will use the
syntax for your property binding that is
square brackets so you put the property
of your HTML element inside square
bracket then you provide the property
name to which you want to bind it so in
our case we're gonna go ahead with image
URL so now as you can see the image has
being displayed over here now one more
thing to notice over here is we can also
go ahead and use interpolation instead
of property binding so for that remember
as I said in interpolation the property
that you put inside your double curly
braces is resolved to string and finally
displayed so what I can do if I
interpolate this again this value will
be resolved to a string value that will
be the value that we have provided over
here this value and finally our image
will be displayed so as you can see the
image is again being displayed so it's
up to you where you want to use
interpolation or you want to go ahead
with property binding it totally depends
on you
both can be used interchangeably
wherever you feel like you wanna go
ahead with property binding and go ahead
with that or you can use interpolation
at the same time so I guess we have
covered interpolation and property
binding now let us discuss about event
binding so in case of even binding what
we wanna do is we want to create an
event that is click of a button and then
we want some codes to be executed once
that button has been
so let's go ahead and do that so for
example so as to understand if the value
of a property gets changed and you have
interpolated it so the same change will
be reflected on your a browser or not
let's go ahead and check that so we'll
create a function over here as change
value alright and then what we want is
we want to change the value of heading
two and set it as this value has been
changed all right now I want to go ahead
and create a button and I'll name it as
change value and then I want to add an
event click event and whenever that
click event happens whenever I use a
clicker button I want to execute the
course that is defined in my change
value function inside my component class
so I'll go ahead with change value as
you can see and the thing that I want to
change is let's go ahead put an HR and
then h2 tag and here I'm gonna go ahead
with heading two all right now if I
check my browser you can see that this
is the heading 2 tag okay I did the
mistake I didn't use interpolation so
now you can see that I have this I love
interpolation string value your heading
2 has been binded with your s2 tag
that's why you're seeing the value that
has been initially set to you're heading
to property and now whenever I click
this button that value is paying changed
so that is what is happening that's why
it's called as data binding so basically
I pined in the property whenever the
value of the property will be changed it
will be reflected on your browser and
similarly we have also performed the
event binding so whenever you click on
this button and you want that code to be
executed that code that we have written
inside our change value function that is
done by your event binding which is
using your curve braces so if you go
ahead and you see that so what I did
basically I use the curve braces so as
to mention an event that I want the
event is click and then finally I pine
that event with that of your function
that I want to be executed so I guess
you have understood everything you have
understood what is interpolation you
have understood what is property binding
and you have understood what is event
binding know what we'll do we'll do a
simple demo and we'll again use all
these concepts that we have learned so
far along with that I also want to show
you how to create component using
angular CLI because in our previous
video we have manually created this
complementary class and then we created
a template file HTML then what we did
using add the red component decorator we
added the metadata for the competent
class so that it becomes a component or
it is decorated as a component but there
is an easier way to do that so again I
am going to go ahead with a new terminal
RFP if you are again using atom and this
same package platform you then can
toggle between or switch between
different terminals that you have open
up using hard shift J if I do that you
can see that and for opening a new
terminal you go ahead with all ship T so
now inside my project folder for
generating a component you have to go
hit with ng generate command followed by
component because we want to create a
component and then the name of the
component in our case it will be G ot
character all right now hit enter now
once you do that you can see that all
these three files have been created
automatically
apart from that your component
declaration has been added to your app
got module dot ts file as well which is
your root model and as we discussed
earlier that whenever you are creating a
new component unit to co-ed and
mentioned inside your module and there's
one more file that is being created
called as G ot character dot component
or spec tortillas that is the file for
testing so now let's go ahead and see
our new component
so this is the compliment guys as you
can see over here that has been
generated by your CLI now here you can
see we have a function called as
constructor which I wanted to talk about
so basically whenever your comprehend
this component will be loaded on your
browser this function will be executed
so this is the first function that will
be executed and also the ng on in it on
initialization it will be executed so
whenever you want to put such a method
or such course that has to be executed
in the first place whenever your
comprehend get instantiate it you need
to go ahead and use these two functions
so let's go ahead and do something over
here so first let's go ahead and create
a string array so I'll go ahead and
create an array as Quixote character of
type string and which will be an array
now I will have one more array as G ot
character first name which will be of
type string and it will be an error
initialize the value as the first name
of the G ot characters so the first one
is John then we have Arya then we have
Cersei and then we have Denarius and
then again I want to copy this string
array and this will be the last team
I'll set it as snow
Stark Lannister
targaryen now as I told you if I put
something inside our constructor
function then that line of code will be
executed in the first place so let's go
ahead and do that so I'll be using a
JavaScript function called a set in
Tower what it does is it executes your
code whatever code that you have written
inside it the function it will be called
in an interval that you specify for that
the first argument will be of that
function that you want to be called and
the second one will be the time the
interval that you want to have for your
function calling so for that I'm going
to go ahead with es6 function so this is
a simple way to declare or to define a
function now this arrow six function is
similar to what we'd go ahead and create
a function for example if I go ahead and
create a function some function and then
I go head like this it's pretty much
similar to that now inside my function
I'm gonna go ahead with this dot G ot
character equals to the store G ot
character first name alright and then
what I want to do is I'm gonna go ahead
and create one more variable and
initialize it with zero and then I'm
going to put some if method over here
and there I'm gonna go ahead with if I
modulo two equals to equals to zero
basically I'm going to check whether I
is even or not I forgot this and then
I'm gonna put ahead my distort g.o.d
character equal to this dot utica to the
first name inside my if block in case it
is odd I'm going to put this as the
start G ot character goes to the store G
ot character last name and then I'm
gonna iterate over or increment my I
each time again this thought I all right
whenever I'm inside my if block
I want to console that I am inside F
block and here I want to console
that I am inside my else block all right
now let's go ahead and provide the
second parameter which is the interval
time that I want over here is let's go
ahead for three seconds that is 3,000
milliseconds yeah so we are good to go
now let's go ahead and use our
template hey what I want is I want a
list which will show the character or
the value of character array that I have
created inside my component so for that
I'm going to go ahead and create my list
and this Li tag and inside that I want
my character array to be displayed now I
want to copy this four times and this is
0 this is 1 this is 2 and this is 3
now again I'm going to use interpolation
so I'm going to go ahead and do that
if I go ahead and check my browser you
can see nothing is being displayed over
here because we forgot something we
didn't nested this Quixote character
component inside the component that is
being displayed over here so we're going
to go ahead with my first component and
I'm going to delete all this and then
I'm going to use my select attack app -
duty character
now if I see we have this list over here
and as you can see the value is being
switched in every three seconds because
I have wrote the code in such fashion
all right now what I want is I want to
put a button so whenever I press that
button
I want this value to be switched so
let's go ahead and create a function
switch first and last name this is my
function and then I'm gonna put all this
code over there
now let's link this function using even
binding with the button that we want to
have so you're gonna go ahead and I have
a button and I'm gonna say switch names
and then I'm going to bind it using
event binding and remember we use curve
braces so as to find an event so I'm
gonna go ahead and bind my click event
with that of my switch first and last
name function now as you can see right
now nothing is happening because that
code that we did which was inside
constructor has been put all inside my
function so once I do that it will start
executing that function and then finally
the name will be displayed so what I
want is I want the character to be
displayed initially so I'm going to go
ahead and copy this I'm gonna put it
inside my constructor now once I click
this button that switch will start
happening as you can see
now the second thing that I'm gonna show
over here is I'm going to show you how
to use bootstrap so let's go ahead and
use that I'm going to go ahead and add
bootstrap class over here so the first
class that I'll be using is called as
list group and over here I want to use
class as list group item let's copy this
and put it inside all my Li tags
now as you can see the bootstrap has
been added I'm going to go ahead and do
the same with my button so let's go
ahead and use a class and provide button
primary so the button has been changed
the blue color of background has been
added now let's go ahead and use
property binding as well so what I want
now is suppose if I click a button I
want one more button that will stop the
switch to happen okay so whatever switch
that is being happening over here
I want that button to stop this
switching and the second thing I want is
I want that button to be activated only
when this first button switch names has
been executed or has been clicked so
let's go ahead and do that as well so
for that what I'll do I'll go ahead and
create one more button and I'll name it
as stop and then let me add bootstrap
style so I'm gonna go ahead with button
danger this time and I'm gonna add an
event stop switch first and last all
right now let's go ahead and create our
function stop switch first and last no
what I want is hey I want to stop that
execution of that set interval method so
what you said and double method does is
it roid you or it returns you an object
using that you can stop that set into a
method from being executed so I'm going
to go ahead and create an object over
here and I'm gonna name it as stop
switch alright which will be off type
any and then I'm going to retrieve this
return object that will be returned from
your set interval method and I'm gonna
store it in my stop switch variable over
here so I'm going to go ahead and do
that stop switch equals to set and tower
so I'm going to go ahead with my clear
interval method
there I'm gonna provide my this
start/stop switch alright so we have
done the first part see if I go ahead
and do this and if the switch has been
started then I can go ahead and use my
stop method to stop this from happening
and whew inspected on the console you
can see we are going ahead with my if
block has blocked an if block but this
stop button should be activated only
when the switch names has been clicked
or when the switches happening so let's
go ahead and use our property binding so
I'm going to create a property known as
stop switch status I'm gonna set it as
true alright now whenever this method or
the first button hasn't clicked I'm
gonna put it as false the start/stop
switch status and I'm gonna put it as
false and here I want it as true now to
bind this property with the property of
my button element I'm going to go ahead
and use one property known as disabled
all right
so if you set this value as true over
here the button will be disabled and
same you can observe over here it has
been disabled but I want to disable this
button dynamically so I'll use property
binding again and I'll find it with my
switch status stop switch status now as
you can see the button is disabled over
here now once I click this button this
will become enabled so that you can use
it and I can use it like this manner so
now we have learned how to use this
property binding event binding and
interpolation here you can see for
displaying the array we have used the
indexing the index of the element
explicitly this is not the good way or
the best way to do it in the next
section when we will be discussing about
our directives I will show you an easier
way or the preferable way to iterate
over an list and finally displayed now
the only form of data binding that is
being left over here is two-way data
binding so remember in the first
component what we did is we first
a property we set it with some of the
value then finally we displayed it then
we created a button event and once you
click that button the value of that
property that is being interpolated got
changed right so that is what two-way
data-binding is now there is an easier
way to implement your two-way
data-binding so what I want over here is
I want my one input placeholder and then
let's go ahead with some value all right
two-way data that's name our variable
and I'm gonna again use property binding
over here and then I'll go inside my
competent closet that function two-way
data and I'm gonna set it as akkadian
now as you can see we are having the
same input placeholder over here now
what I want is I want at f-type over
here and inside this div tag I'm gonna
go ahead and put this input element and
I'm going to interpolate that property
that we have just created the value
property so I'm gonna interpolate this
over here all right so as you can see
this is what is happening now if I
change the value the value of that
property is not being changed so let's
go ahead and implement two-way
data-binding and then we'll understand
what does it mean actually so for that
please use something called as ng model
which is a diet if that is used to go
ahead fit two-way data-binding
I'll go ahead with ng model and the name
of the property that I want which is
two-way data now in order to use ng
model you need to import forms module
that is the module in which your ng
model definition resides so I will go
ahead inside my AB dot module and here
I'll import forms module from add thread
angular slash forms once you have
imported certain model you need to Co it
and put that module name inside in ports
as well so I will go ahead and do that
alright now as you can see fear having
this error over here there is any same
because just now we imported
now if I change the value over here for
example I go ahead with my name you can
see the same thing is being displayed on
your template so the communication is
happening in both ways so whenever this
event whenever that I am using this
input placeholder that event is
happening so the event binding takes
place so I'm gonna go ahead with this
time to weigh that event is changing the
value of the property the property that
we defined that is two-way data and
finally that two-way data since it is
being interpolated the value that we
have entered just now the modified value
is being displayed over here so that is
what two-way data-binding is so I guess
you have understood all the forms of
data binding over here you have
understood how to perform two-way data
binding how to go ahead with property
binding for property binding you have
square brackets for event binding you go
ahead with curved brackets for
interpolation you go ahead with curly
braces now in case of tufa data binding
you go ahead with curved bracket inside
square bracket thus you are having
property binding and event binding at
the same time now one more example
property binding is using property
binding you can pass the data from your
parent component to your child component
let's understand what I am trying to say
so suppose you have your parent
component as you can see over here this
is your parent component and you want to
pass some data the data that is there
inside your parent component you want to
pass it to your child component let's go
ahead and do this parent-child
communication as well so for that as you
know we have put our QT character
component selected tag inside first
component so if you see the first
component HTML or template you can see
that we have nested our geo tag
character component over here so
basically it means that the first
component is the parent component of
your QT character component now here
what I want is I want to pass some data
that is there in my parent component to
my child component that is your D
character so let's go ahead and do this
now for example what I want is I want to
send this part that is there inside my
first component to my child company so
I'm gonna go ahead
and pass this value to some variable
called as image you are a child and I'm
gonna bind it with my image URL that is
there inside my parent now if I go to my
child component my g OT character
component for getting the value that has
been sent from my parent component i
need to use something called as input at
the rate input so go ahead and use that
input and I want to input something
known as image URL child as you can see
this is the same property that we have
passed or that we have binded in our
parent component so as you can see the
name input cannot be found because we
haven't imported it let's go ahead and
do that as well now let's go inside our
template and here I'm gonna use that
data that has been passed from my parent
component in order to display the image
son go ahead with image and here I'm
gonna go ahead v image you are a child
now as you can see the image is being
displayed over here and in fact let's go
ahead and do something else so I'm going
to console it out console dot log and I
want to console the start image URL
child now if you see the console as you
can see we are having this path being
transferred to my child component that
is geodetic Harter component the path
this dot dot slash dot dot slash asset
slash erica underscore the dog Phe so
now you have understood this constructor
and this ng on init method gets
initialized in the first place whenever
your complaint gets instantiate it and
you have also understood how to use
property binding for passing data from
your parent component to your child
component all you have to do is you have
to use this at the rate input function
and there you have to specify the
property on which you want your data to
be passed and then in your parent
component you pass your data inside your
selector tags there you use the same
property name which is there in your
child component and there you finally
you use the property binding to bind it
with the prop
that is defined in your parent component
so it is pretty much simple to use so
that said guys it was all about data
binding we learned all forms of data
binding destroyed by anger now in the
next video we'll be talking about
directives where I'll show you how to
use your structural directive those in
build directives then we'll also learn
how to create our own custom directive
till then have fun bye I hope you
enjoyed listening to this video please
be kind enough to like it and you can
comment any of your doubts and queries
and we will reply to them at the
earliest to look out for more videos in
our playlist and subscribe to our in
