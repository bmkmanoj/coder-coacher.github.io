eureka and welcome to this eddie acre
live session on understanding bitcoin
and blockchain now unless you've been
living under a rock
i'm quite sure you must have heard about
the ongoing busts about bitcoins and
blockchain even people who haven't heard
about cryptocurrency before today are
quite interested to know about bitcoins
well this concern is definitely genuine
because the value of Bitcoin has had an
astonishing growth of over 700 percent
in just the last year now moving on with
respect to today's session we'll begin
by first understanding what is Bitcoin
as well as how does a Bitcoin
transaction take place then we will talk
about the code technology that helps us
perform Bitcoin transaction which is the
blockchain technology once you
understood this we'll talk about the
various features of blockchain which
makes it a revolutionary technology
which can be used across different
domains apart from the banking or
transaction domain finally at the last
part of this session we'll also be
looking at a Bitcoin transaction demo
wherein I'll help you understand how you
can buy bitcoins through the Zippy
application as well as perform your
first transaction now this is a
fundamental session so it would be for a
short duration so I hope you guys are
quite excited with respect to today's
session moving on to the first topic of
today's session that is what is Bitcoin
now Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency
introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009
now the idea originally came from a
white paper published by Satoshi
Nakamoto with the name Bitcoin a
peer-to-peer electronic cash system now
this is the paper as such this talks
about how a cryptocurrency can be used
and how it can revolutionize the present
system now this came at a time when the
current financial system that was back
in 2008 was facing the financial crisis
so this became a key idea as to avoid
how this financial crisis can be avoided
in future and can change the current
existing system as a whole now apart
from using apart from being the first
cryptocurrency it is also a digital
currency that is it exists
electronically as such
now there may be concerns if our money
exists on the digital platform so to
avoid any misuse we use various
cryptographic as well as mathematical
algorithms which ensure that the
creation as well as management of
bitcoins are completely secure as well
as non manipulate now using these
techniques we can ensure that no person
can't create fake bitcoins now we've all
seen the issue of fake currency notes in
our system so these techniques ensure
that no fakes is fake bitcoins are
introduced as part of the system now one
thing that you need to be aware of is
that while introducing the Bitcoin
system it was said that the Bitcoin
limit that is they can only be 21
million bitcoins globally now don't
worry because there can be only 20
million bitcoins because you can own the
smallest Bitcoin which is 100 millionth
of a Bitcoin known as a Satoshi and
still be part of the Bitcoin system now
you may be wondering it's a digital
currency where is it going to be stored
similar to how you store your money in
your p.m. or your paypal wallet
this can also be stored in a Bitcoin
wallet now this wallet can either be
present on your phone it could be
present on your system it could be
present online or even on a hardware
device as such for your convenience ask
a coordinator now the system or the
ledger where all the transactions that
are added with respect to the Bitcoin is
known as the blockchain system this is
an electronically distributed ledger
system that is distributed across the
globe now before we go into the
blockchain system and talk more about it
let's first try to understand how a
Bitcoin transaction takes place to give
you a better understanding of how a
Bitcoin transaction takes place let's
take an example here here we have seven
people
Thomas Lily James Matthew Meili Adam and
John they're all part of a peer-to-peer
network where each of them are connected
to each other now here Thomas wants to
send 400 bitcoins to Matthew so what he
needs to do is that it needs this
transaction that is needs to be
initiated so he would send a signal that
I want to send Matthew 500 bitcoins so
what happens is special nodes or miners
are such these are people who verify all
these transactions
they get the signal that Thomas wants to
sent 500 bitcoins to Matthew so they
immediately begin validating this
transaction they begin to check if
Thomas has sufficient balance and is it
Matthew that he wants to send this they
want to check if this is not a false
transaction as such now if this
transaction is a valid transaction it
needs to be stored somewhere and that
place is known as a block a block
basically is collection of different
transactions that are verified as such
now at the same time you have a
competition between John and Adam as to
who will create the first block with
Thomas's transaction once either of them
have verified this transaction they're
going to suggest to everyone else as
part of the network that this is a valid
transaction and the amount can get
deducted from Thomas's account and can
be sent to Matthews occur now you may be
wondering why would John actually spend
time as well as Adam wastes their
resource in verifying these transactions
that's where the blockchain system or
the Bitcoin system surprises you for a
block that is going to be created by
either John or Adam or any miner this
system in itself gives them a reward of
12.5 bitcoins now this is an incentive
which the system gives the miner for
creating the new block quite surprising
right definitely now what you need to
understand is that for all the effort
that these people put this is basically
how the system pays back but you also
need to be aware that this is exactly
how a new Bitcoin gets created so in
case if you wondering how bitcoins are
getting created this is the only way
unless and until a miner completes a
block the new bitcoins would not get
created as of now of the 21 million
bitcoins we've created close to 16 16
point 5 million bitcoins as a whole now
I hope with this explanation you've got
a simple understanding of how a Bitcoin
transaction actually takes place now
before we move into blockchain system
I'm quite sure you also already have an
understanding of what the blockchain
system is because in the blockchain in
the Bitcoin transaction example that we
had taken we had talked about the
peer-to-peer network where this
transaction was taking place
that's exactly what blockchain is it's a
technology which revolutionized the
Bitcoin system it became a platform
where people could create as well as buy
and sell bitcoins as per their
requirement now as we had mentioned
earlier a block basically contains all
the transactions that have been verified
and validated in that time span
now once you've completed this block you
begin the process on the next block and
you keep going on so forth all these
blocks are connected to each other and
so forth comes the name blockchain now
the blockchain technology is not
something that is restricted only to
transaction management or the banking
domain as such now how you're storing
transaction details you can use it to
store any other kind of details as per
your requirement and this is one of the
key factors which has led to the growth
of blockchain technology being used
across different domains
I hope you've understood how effective
blockchain technology is moving forward
let's talk about the various features of
blockchain why does it stand out with
respect to all the other technologies in
the market now if any technology is
coming into the picture the first thing
that we are concerned about is the
security blockchain technology uses an
sha-256 encryption algorithm now here
what happens is you're using a hash
algorithm so what you need to understand
is that once you've given an input you
generate a hash output but from the
output you cannot regenerate the input
that is it's a unidirectional process so
even if you have the output you cannot
determine what the input is
and this encryption algorithm is so
complex that even if you make a slight
change with respect to the input the
output completely change so let's take
an example let's say I'm gonna encrypt I
love blockchain through the hash
algorithm it's going to give me a
corresponding hash value same input I'm
just gonna add an exclamation mark and
pass it through the encryption algorithm
but the output that gets generated is
totally different if I look at both the
outputs I would not be able to identify
that it's the same input just with an
addition of an exclamation mark so I
hope this gives you a simple
understanding of how the hashing and
correct
hashing algorithm works then comes the
distributed public ledger now as I had
mentioned earlier all the transactions
that you would be performing using
bitcoins is going to be stored on the
blockchain system so therein you have a
ledger but this ledger is not a
centralized ledger like how you have
inbox this ledger is completely
distributed and anyone who becomes part
of this blockchain network can get
access to the Bitcoin transaction
details as well as the blockchain ledger
as hope so everyone who becomes a part
of it gets their own unique copy of
their blockchain ledger but you don't
need to be considered you know you don't
need to be concerned because this ledger
is available to anyone little details
with respect to the transaction that are
present in this ledger are completely
secure they are encrypted as well as
they are passed through the hash
encryption now one thing you need to
notice is that the user details are not
specified as part of this only the
transaction ID is present in the ledger
so this in turn also provides the
anonymity to the user as well as you are
not completely aware who holds how much
bitcoins and this makes the system
completely decentralized as well as open
although it gives you a complete open
idea of how much is being used in the
system it is really helpful to come
across with respect to the other domains
that are pressed now we also talked
about the Third Point wherein the
bitcoins is the blockchain system that
is it rewards you for the instant
rewards you for creating the new
blockers the incentives that you get now
twelve point five bitcoins is the
present rate as such this would keep
varying as such now don't think just
because you can create a block you get
this reward because it's not as simple
as you think there are two parts to this
you need to verify the value you need to
verify all the transactions that are
present as well as you need to identify
a mathematical while now I'm not going
to talk about the mathematical value
here we'll be talking about that ahead
okay
so what you need to do is that you need
to create a block in a fixed time frame
because the present time frame is ten
minutes for creating a block so unless
and until you can you cannot create the
block in that time you cannot get the
reward at the same time you're computing
with all the miners who are present
across
so it basically is a race against time
the final key point which makes the
blockchain feature quite popular is the
proof of work
remember the mathematical solution I was
talking to you about this basically is
what a miner needs to compute apart from
verifying and validating all the
transactions that he has he needs to
identify this mathematical solution you
may be thinking okay it's a mathematical
solution I can run it on my computer and
find out it's not that easy there's
always a fixed value that is set for
every block that is going to be created
let's say you're going to create the
next block which is 500 block as part of
the blockchain system so there's going
to be a specific values that you need to
identify with respect to that specific
block but what you need to do is that
you need to guess this mathematical
value it's just a hit and run method
given the present scenario you need to
at least try somewhere between 20
quadrillion to 30 quadrillion values
that's a huge number at the same time
you need to remember that it's a race
against time so you need to verify all
the transactions you need to compute
this mathematical solution hour and all
this should happen in 10 minutes
timeframe and this is exactly why the
way incentives are also given out there
- because they do all this work within
this fixed time frame and once you've
computed this mathematical solution then
no one can tell that this reward that is
given to you is unjust because you've
put in your resource you have put in
your time to compute the block you've
put in time to verify all the
transactions and the system is rewarding
for all your work so this proof of work
in itself is a very valid signal sending
across to everyone that I have done this
work I have validated all the
transactions that were given to me as
well as I have created the next block so
I hope you guys are clear with respect
to the features of blockchain now there
are different features of blockchain
that come into picture but we are not
going to going into that as far as this
session we'll be talking about them in
the upcoming sessions now moving forward
we'll talk about how a Bitcoin
transaction can take place and how you
can purchase a bit card now meanwhile if
you do have any questions I would
request that you put across to my team
and they'll be able to answer all your
questions
such so this is the application that we
will be using so this is the application
known as eBay that we will be using for
buying bitcoins as well as selling
bitcoins and trading as such now I'll
just give you a simple overview as to
how you can perform transactions using
this app a application now once you
install the application from the Google
Play Store you just need to click on the
option and verify yourself there are
three things that you need to provide to
them first is the details with respect
to your pan card you need to provide
them a copy of your pan card as well as
fill in this form then you need to
provide them details with respect to
your bank so in case if you're selling
any bitcoins the money needs to be
transferred to your bank account so that
details needs to be provided here apart
from that you need to provide them with
your address details once you've done
with this they would go ahead with their
verification process and this would take
somewhere between a day to three days as
such finally once if you got the
confirmation from the deputy then you
can begin to purchase bitcoins and sell
them as well now here as you can see I
have low already some money as well as
some bitcoins in my wallet so first
thing what you need to do is that you
need to load some money into your zap a
wallet so for that just click on deposit
option okay here you need to specify the
amount and then you can transfer the
amount either using RTGS any FDI MPs or
to net banking now I would recommend
that you go through net banking because
this is faster in comparison to the
other means now as you can see here I've
already loaded some money into my
account okay I already have close to
0.026 bitcoins and I'll show you how you
can purchase bitcoins as well now if you
click on the buy option here you can see
the present rate of our pies they pay
for buying bitcoins and this is
constantly changing rate so let's say
I'm going to use to all my amount that's
two thousand five hundred and thirteen
rupees okay so below that you can see
how many bitcoins I'm going to get now
the minimum amount that you need to
spend while buying bitcoins through step
pay is thousand rupees and the maximum
at present is seven point five lakhs
beyond that you can contact the zepa
team and they will be able to assist you
now once you specify the amount click
by and the transaction is about to get
initiated before that you need to set
your security pin so let me confirm this
and the purchase has begun now this
transaction is almost immediately
because they pay in itself holds certain
amount of bitcoins and they release it
to you immediately and as you can see
I've also got a message notification
telling me that bitcoins have been added
to my account so here you can see the
present amount I have close to zero
point one Bitcoin present in my account
which is also equivalent to three
thousand three ninety four rupees as
such at any given point if you feel that
you want to sell your bitcoins as such
just click on the sell option and you
can sell any amount of bitcoins you want
let's say you want to sell all of it
just click on sell all and all the
bitcoins are going to get sold now let
me show you how you can perform a
transaction using bit card so this is a
example of a Bitcoin wallet here my
Bitcoin are this present in my Bitcoin
is they pay wallet as such so from this
wallet I'm going to send it to a
different wallet as such okay so click
on the send option here and it's going
to ask you whether you have the Bitcoin
address or do you want to scan it now if
you click on the bi bi can present in
the bottom then you have option to
either manually enter their address or
you can scan a QR code now most Bitcoin
wallets today come with a QR code so you
can directly scan it in my case I
already have my address so I'm going to
paste it here so I'll just set it a name
as Bitcoin demo
and I'll save it so Kiera you can see it
it has asked me how much do I want to
say so let's say I want to send it all
so I click on send all it shows me how
many bitcoins are going to be set but if
you see just below that there's an
option known as Bitcoin network fees so
if you click on that you can see the
fees with respect to the amount that
you're sending now although the Bitcoin
and blockchain technologies were
initially introduced with the idea of no
transaction fees but certain wallets do
add a specific transaction fees to
increase the priority of your
transaction now here once I click on
send the transaction is going to get
initiated
so I've also got a mail notification
that the pay has sent my bitcoins to my
Bitcoin wallet now let me show you what
my Bitcoin
now while I'm waiting for this let me
just also show you another feature of
the blockchain wallet let's say you've
sent a transaction or you've received an
amount from someone and you want to
verify or you want to check the status
of it okay so seems like I've already
received my bitcoins okay so let's say
for any transactions if you want to
check the status okay so once you click
on the transaction you get the details
so here you can see the transaction has
been confirmed this was a transaction
that I had performed earlier today okay
so to see more status with respect to
your transaction just click on this
option and you're really directed to
blockchain dot info here you can see the
details of the transaction that I have
mentioned this is the address this that
is my blockchain wallet address and this
is sent to my Bitcoin wallet address
okay so this is a different account that
I'm setting it to so you can see the
details with respect to this and this
can be viewed for any transactions this
is open to anyone who's part of the
blockchain so any transaction that you
want to verify or validate can be seen
on the blockchain dot info website as
such okay so here you can see apart from
getting transformation confirmation it
also says spending three confirmations
this basically is to ensure that the
strands transaction as such is not a
false transaction so there's a certain
delay with respecters although the
amount is credited into my account I
cannot use it right now okay so with
that we come to an end of today's demo
session I hope you at least have
understood how you can purchase bitcoins
and how you can perform a transaction
now say pay is not the only means for
you to buy bitcoins there are multiple
ways so I would recommend that you
explore them all up finally coming to an
end of the session let me just summarize
what we have discussed today we started
off with a simple understanding of what
bitcoin is and we saw how a Bitcoin
transaction would take place then we
talked about what exactly is blockchain
as well as various features of
blockchain now I hope you have had a
good understanding of what bitcoin is
and what blockchain is as well as we saw
a demo on how you can buy bitcoins as
well as perform a transaction so with
this we come to a conclusion of today's
session you can always check
in Eureka blockchain cause the link is a
Da Capo slash blockchain - training my
team would also be pinging you the same
now here if you calm down you can find
all the details with respect to the
upcoming sessions so you can see we have
multiple sessions both on weekday as
well as weekend we also have a few
upcoming batches now if you're looking
for more details with respect to
blockchain you can check out our plot a
