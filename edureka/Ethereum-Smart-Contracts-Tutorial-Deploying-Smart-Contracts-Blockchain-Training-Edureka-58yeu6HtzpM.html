and welcome to this interesting tutorial
on etherium now before we move forward
let's have a look at our agenda for
today so we're going to start by
developing an understanding of what a
theorem is then we'll move on to talk
about the types of the theorem accounts
following which we'll see what smart
contracts are well these contracts have
been made popular in the recent years
due to their implementation in
blockchain after this we learn about the
EVM on which these contracts are
executed then I'll also tell you how to
practically deploy smart contracts on
the theorem blockchain under a test
environment and towards the end of this
session we'll talk about the real-life
use cases of the theorem blockchain
these are the decentralized applications
and the decentralized organizations now
before we start with our first topic let
me just brief you on why a theorem is
needed well most of you here might
already be familiar with the Bitcoin
blockchain bitcoin is the original
doctrine entity for providing a
decentralized system to facilitate
peer-to-peer exchange of values a
theorem on the other hand came up from
the idea that blockchain could be used
for a number of purposes beyond the
bookkeeping of financial transactions so
we can also say that it theorem
maximizes the usage of potential
blockchain applications now coming back
to our original topic that is what
exactly is aetherium so guys a theorem
is an open source distributed platform
that allows decentralized apps to be
built on it with the help of smart
contract functionality it was developed
by with solid butyrin as an extension to
the original core blockchain concept let
me give you an analogy think of the
etherium network as a collection of
decentralized and distributed vending
machines now you go and you put in
tokens inside these vending machines and
then specify the action that you want to
be taken by pressing in the numbers now
whenever each number is pressed a
certain code gets executed inside the
machine these are the smart contracts
and then a service is provided to the
concerned user
on the network now the tokens that you
had put inside the machine were actually
ethers ethers are the cryptocurrency
token of the e theorem Network and
they're used to pay for the transaction
fees there's also another parameter
called gas about which we'll talk later
that is used to pay for the
computational services on the etherium
Network now since we're still talking
about transactions over here I'm sure
some of you might be wondering why was
there a need to develop a theorem in the
first place when Bitcoin blockchain
already existed so I'll give you a clear
understanding on how a theorem differs
from the Bitcoin blockchain on various
fronts now firstly both these block
chains are conceptually different from
each other while bitcoins core idea was
to bring a decentralized digital money
that is not governed by any one theorem
although a derivative extends beyond the
realm of cryptocurrencies that is why it
is also referred to as the second
generation of blockchain now talking
about the cryptocurrency tokens bitcoins
crypto is the inductor itself and it's
called Bitcoin cash whereas a theorems
crypto token is called ethers like we
just discussed now coming to the
scripting language a theorem is a
turing-complete scripting language
whereas Bitcoin is a simple stack based
language and it is not during complete
what I mean when I say the word
turing-complete
is a language that can solve any
computational problem by itself given
enough time and energy now next we come
to the Consensus algorithms Bitcoin uses
the sha-256 hash algorithm while a
theorems algorithm is called ëthe harsh
both of these are proof of work
currently however a theorem will move to
proof of stake in the near future as a
part of its scalability plan the proof
of stake is still an algorithm with the
same purpose as proof of work but unlike
it where the miners are rewarded for
solving the mathematical problem with
the goal of validating transactions and
then creating a new block with proof of
stake the creator of the block is chosen
depending on its wealth or stake so more
the number of tokens you own more would
be your mining par now even the coin
release method of both the block chains
were different
while Bitcoin came through the mining of
the Genesis
so the first miner earned some bitcoins
as a reward theorems coins were released
through initial coin offerings to raise
funds for the new cryptocurrency the
average block creation time of both the
block chains very red takes around ten
minutes for each new block to be created
on a Bitcoin blockchain in the etherium
blockchain a new block is formed in
every 15 seconds this is quite faster
now since we're talking about aetherium
we have to discuss about the types of
etherium accounts as we can see here
there are two types of etherium accounts
the externally owned accounts that are
owned by people or organizations and the
contract accounts which are autonomous
in nature
now these externally owned accounts are
controlled by private keys which are
owned by individuals but on the other
hand the contract accounts have
associated contract codes and these are
triggered by the transactions or the
messages received by other contracts or
other externally owned accounts now the
contrast that we are talking about here
are actually the smart contracts
contract accounts operate on codes which
are written in smart contracts and the
users can create a new contract by
deploying code to the blockchain
now guys smart contracts are basically
immutable pieces of codes that run on
the etherium network to perform a
certain transaction or task and when
these contracts are running on the
blockchain they act like a self
operating computer program that
automatically executes when specific
conditions are met let me give you an
example of this a contract between two
parties is written as a code on the
blockchain now the individuals involved
are anonymous but the contract is public
to everyone on the blockchain so when a
prig ring event occurs which in this
case is a bet on an ongoing cricket
match the contract executes itself
according to the terms of the code
therefore if England wins the match Bob
will receive ten Ito's but if England
loses the match and you will receive 10
eaters and both their wallets will be
updated accordingly now the codes in
these smart contracts are written in a
special contract specific language
called solidity a question will
naturally arise over here that
was there a need to develop a contract
specific language why couldn't we just
use the already existing languages like
C C++ Java instead so let's see why
solidity is preferred over other
languages now solid the t's syntax is
very similar to JavaScript it was
developed because using the mainstream
languages on a public blockchain won't
really add value because firstly there
are security requirements you see
anything that gets recorded on the
blockchain becomes immutable so there is
absolutely no window for bug fixes and
secondly it costs money for executing
each instruction on the program so if
you were to use C language or serpent
for example to write a smart contract
then you may end up with a very
expensive contract and not even know why
if you guys want to create your own
smart contract then you can do that by
using the remix IDE now this is a
browser-based IDE and it's widely used
for developing the smart contracts since
it has an integrated debugging and
testing environment now here's what a
remix IDE looks like the contract codes
are written over here this is the
compiled tab now whenever a new line of
code is added to the contract it gets
compiled automatically this is the run
tab under which we can specify the
environment the account addresses along
with the Associated number of ethers the
gas limit and the value in ways now
every time you write a code here you can
create a contract by clicking on the
create button now guys will be writing a
demo contract to understand better how
all of this works but before that let me
talk about the EVM where all of these
contracts are actually executed EVM or
the etherium virtual machine is a
turing-complete software that runs on
the etherium network it enables anyone
to run a program regardless of the
programming language and even non
specialized programmers can create a
program on the EVM let me tell you how
all of this works a user requests two
ethers for example from the sender now
the sender initiates a transaction
message code and must pay for each step
of the program that they activated
including the computations and the
memory storage
now this fee is paid in ethos which is
taking from the wallet of the sender
then this transaction fee is collected
by the nodes in the network that ran the
EVM now each and every node of the
network runs the EVM to execute the same
instruction and this is how the
blockchain database is maintained and
updated by the many nodes connected to
the network now all of these nodes are
actually the minor nodes that execute
and verify the transactions and then
update the state of the accounts on the
etherium blockchain in turn they're
rewarded with ethers for each successful
block mining now once the transaction is
verified and recorded the user gets two
ethers in his wallet
now I'm sure some of your programmers
out there might be wondering the same as
what our little guy here is thinking
about that if the EVM is running the
application code then what's preventing
a piece of code from running forever and
overloading the network well here's
where the term theorem gas comes in now
gas is basically the execution fee that
the sender pays for running a program on
the EVM it's called gas because the fee
acts as a crypto fuel driving the
execution in smart contracts so every
contract specifies the gas limit which
is the maximum quantity of gas that can
be consumed if you guys want you can
just go to your browser and type in the
eth gas station and click on the first
link now here's where you can see the
gas used for the current transaction you
can also see the gas price and the top
10 miners that have mined blocks you can
see the cheapest gas price and the
highest gas price and also the
conformation time by the gas price now
gas price is specified at the start by
the initiator of the transaction now as
a transaction starts the gas used times
gas price number of ethers are
subtracted from the sender's account so
when a program crosses the gas limit the
execution rewards and the ethers are not
refunded so guys it's very important to
keep your program well within the set
limits of the gas
okay guys now we come to the most
interesting part of a tutorial that is
how to deploy smart contracts so we've
just learned that smart contracts must
pay gas for the computations on the
etherium network hence if you rent the
etherium network to run a contract you'd
have to pay for it
so before deploying an actual contract
on the etherium blockchain we need to
experiment because we cannot afford to
make any mistakes as anything deployed
on the blockchain becomes immutable and
cause gas so we use test nets for
developing demonstrative smart contracts
and these test nets simulate the
etherium network with providing free and
unlimited gas so this allows the
developers to test contracts without
having to pay real money for the
execution now I'll walk you through
setting up a development environment so
that you can deploy and test your own
smart contracts on the etherium test
blockchain we're going to create a test
environment on the Ubuntu Linux platform
and since I myself have the Windows
operating system I'll be using the
Oracle VirtualBox to run Ubuntu
now let's open the CLI to run a network
we need a server so we need to install
nodejs and the node package manager
since no J's will simulate the test
server on our local machine NPM or the
node package manager is a command-line
interface program to manage the node.js
libraries now we'll run the following
command on our terminal to install
nodejs
sudo apt-get install nodejs we'll type
in the password
it's asking for confirmation tap Y and
now we'll just wait for our node.js to
get installed
you
now we'll also install the NPM package
for that we'll use the same installation
command sudo apt-get install NPM
do you want to continue yes and now
we'll just wait for NPM to get installed
as well
you
alright let's just check the version of
the node.js and the NPM that we have
installed so we'll type in nodejs - V
the version is four point two point six
and NPM - V the version is three point
five point two now guys this is not the
latest version so we need to upgrade our
node packages since we need the upgraded
versions for running the further
commands for that we need to install
call first so we will type the
installation command sudo apt-get
install curl now curl is a tool that is
used to transfer data from the server
now we have installed coal so we'll just
pull the entire note package from coal
and for that we'll use the following
link
now note that the six point X here
denotes the version of the nodejs that
is six that we want to install
you
now we install the latest node.js
package using the same installation
command sudo apt-get install nodejs
do you want to continue of course I do
and now we'll just wait for a latest
node.js package to get installed
now let's check the node.js version no
J's - V
the version is 6.13 so it's cool now
let's upgrade our npm as well and for
that we'll use the following command
sudo NPM upgrade NPM - gee now - gee is
used for the global installation so that
we can access it throughout a system now
we'll just wait for our end PM to get
updated
you
so guys our NPM has upgraded to version
5.7 which is great now let me just clear
the screen for your convenience
okay now guys we need to run the test
RPC on our terminal to deploy and test
our blocks in contract now test RPC is a
node.js based aetherium client for
testing and development for that we need
to create a test RPC file so we type in
the following command
sudo npm install' - g ganach CLI now
note that sudo is used so that the user
has an authority over the existing files
ganach CLI only runs when our node.js
version is at least greater than 6.11
and ours is 6.13 which looks good so now
we'll just wait for it to get installed
this might take a little while
now to install the test RPC file we'll
run the following command
sudo npm install - ji theorem j/s test
RPC with this command will add all the
node packages on a local machine
so now we have created our test RPC file
now let's run it and see what happens
alright looks great the test RPC is
running and listening on localhost eight
five four five now guys you can see the
available accounts as well as the
private keys over here and we'll be
using these for a contract deployment
okay now we just open a new terminal
because our test RPC is running on this
one let me increase the font
okay now next what we need to do is
install the block Explorer to help us
keep track of the information on the
blockchain for that we first need to
install git now git is a distributed
version control system that holds the
repository of our block Explorer in this
case so for that we'll use our
installation command that is sudo
apt-get install git we enter the
password
and seems like I already have get on my
system but anyway you can use the same
command to install git on your systems
as well okay now we need to get a copy
of the Explorer on our local machine and
so we use the following command
git clone HTTP github.com / ether party
/ Explorer now we can see that it's
cloning into Explorer now it's basically
pulling a clone of the repository from
the cloud to our system okay so it's
done now we'll just change the directory
to the Explorer by using the following
command CD Explorer now guys CD here
stands for change directory we'll just
press ENTER and now we can see that our
directory has been changed to Explorer
okay now guys if you want to launch the
block Explorer you'll use the following
command sudo npm start now this command
will install all the packages on our
system okay so we'll just wait for it to
get installed
now we can see the Explorer running on
port 8000 over here alright
now guys if you want to view the blog
explorer you simply need to go to your
web browser
I installed Chrome because it's
preferable to me and then type in
localhost 8080 AB now here we can see
the ether block Explorer page has been
opened and this is where all the
transactions are being recorded on the
etherium test network so now that we
have set up a test environment let's
create a demo smart contract to deploy
it on our aetherium test blockchain for
that go to your browser and open the
remix IDE
now go to the run tab and specify the
environment as web 3 provider they'll
ask you if you want to connect to an
etherium node click ok our web 3
provider endpoint is localhost 8 5 4 5
click OK again now guys if this message
pops up that it's not possible to
connect to the web 3 provider then all
you need to do is go to your browser tab
click here and load the unsaved scripts
now we go to our run tab again and
specify the environment once more click
OK click OK now we can see the
associated accounts that were in a test
RPC file that we created
along with the associated number of
eaters as well okay if you want you can
go to your file location and just open
the test RPC file now these are all the
account addresses and this is the same
as you can see over here
okay now we will create a demo contract
so that you guys get an idea about how a
smart contract is executed now we'll
write a contract to increase and
decrease the value of the variable let's
say named counter so we just open a file
and let's name it my contract 0 0 1
now these contracts are basically a
collection of code functions that
correspond to a specific account address
on the blockchain as you can see here so
now we will start writing our contract
for that we'll first specify the source
code version so we'll type in
pragma solidity version 4.1 now guys
note that the latest version of solidity
is four point one six but that won't be
supported by our system so I'm using
four point one if you want you can use
four point one six that will not really
make any difference in the program that
we are writing right now okay now pragma
is the instruction for the compiler
about how to treat the source code now
since we are creating a contract we'll
use the keyword contract and let's name
it as my contract now our entire
contract would be written within this
scope now we'll specify a state variable
that is counter with the value five so
we'll type in you in 256 counter equal
to five don't forget the semicolons guys
now you into 256 is basically the type
of the variable that is unsigned integer
of 256 bits now this creates a slot in
the database that can be accessed
whenever a function in the code is
called now also note that we need to
keep the state variable outside of all
the functions so that they can be
accessed globally now we'll write a
function say add
which will increment the value of four
counter by one
counter plus plus okay
similarly we create another function
let's call it subtract
and this function would be used to
decrement the value of counter by one so
we'll write counter - - okay now note
that the access modifier in both these
functions is public guys although public
is the default modifier when no
visibility is specified typing all the
function visibility is a good habit so
you should always do it now there are
other access modifiers like external
internal or private but we do not need
to know about them right now what we
need now is a function to output the
value of the counter as it changes with
the functions called so we'll just write
a function and we'll name it get counter
get counter the access modifier is
public here as well and since this
function is going to return a constant
so we'll use in the constant keyword
return counter
now guys know that we must tell our
function the type of the state variable
it will return so we have specified you
in 256 over here since this is the type
of our counter state variable now
whenever a function is called a small
amount of gas is pent but no gas is
required when returning a constant
function alright so guys we've just
finished creating our very first
contract on the remix IDE now let's test
our false contract by clicking on the
create tab here you can see all the
three functions that we have created
just now now if you tap on get counter
we get the value of a counter as five if
you tap on add once and then again on
get counter you will see that our value
of counter has incremented by one and
has become six now
now let's tap on subtract twice and then
again on get counter we see that the
value of our counter is four now
alright now we'll open our block
explorer to see the details of this
transaction here we'll just refresh it
and as you can see here a contract has
been successfully deployed on the
etherium test blockchain so now we have
seen how the etherium is used as a
platform to create smart contracts now
guys once you start creating your
contracts and deploy and execute them on
your blockchain you will be ready to get
started with creating full-on
decentralized applications now we're not
gonna go into details of the dab
development but I'll introduce you to
what dabs are well a decentralized
application or a DAP is a set of smart
contracts that operate on the data
stored in those contracts now an
application qualifies as a DAP only when
it is open sourced when it's
decentralized it has tokens fueling for
itself it generates tokens and has an
inbuilt consensus mechanism now these
tabs enable direct interaction between
the users and the providers and the
comprised of various organizations that
work together to create an application
now these organizations are basically
the decentralized autonomous
organizations or the Dow's now guys a
Dao is very similar to a normal company
now the only difference is that in a
normal company there is a third party of
course and the rules are not enforced
digitally but the Dow's have their
business decisions made electronically
through the codes written in the smart
contracts or through the word of their
members now the priority of these words
depend on the percentage of the assets
that the entities within a dar hold let
me tell you in detail how all of this
happens people add funds to the Dao and
are given tokens to represent their
percentage of assets so more you invest
more number of tokens you would hold now
when a Dao begins to operate the members
propose on how to spend the funds and
based on the words the proposal status
is decided this way you do not need a
third party to depend on and hence more
effective operations can take place a
number of possibilities RUP tved apps
have already appeared in the market and
are continuously being deployed on the
etherium platform a few of them being Y
Fund for G capital store should I
and the KYC chain now these are a few of
the most famous taps and doubts that are
in the market currently why font is a
DAP that uses the smart contracts to
enhance crowdfunding services like
GoFundMe and Kickstarter 4G capital is
the Dow that provides micro loans for
small businesses in Africa store shot I
Oh provides censorship free secure cloud
storage by sharing data among a
decentralized network of computers and
last but not the least the KYC chain
allows the users to maintain a private
identity wallet that can be used to
authenticate the identification in
finance and commerce settings guys with
this we come towards the end of our
session so let's summarize what all we
have learnt in this tutorial now we know
what if theorem is and about the types
of etherium accounts we learned about
the smart contracts and the EVM we also
performed a practical demo on how to
deploy the smart contracts and towards
the end we talked about the future of
aetherium now if you guys have any
queries or if there is anything more you
