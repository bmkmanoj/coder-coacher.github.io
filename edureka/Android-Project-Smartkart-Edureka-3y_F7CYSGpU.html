course on android development from a
tracker dot in I must say that is an
excellent training the it has very rich
content and instructed emission what did
an excellent job in explaining the
concepts of Android programming as part
of this training I developed an
application an Android application which
will allow customers to choose select
books and buy them online using their
android mobile phone so i will show you
a demo of that app today so what you are
seeing on the screen right now this is
the login screen if you see like there
is a logo here this is a logo that I
have designed using spreadsheet so in
this login screen existing users can
sign in on users can sign up i will show
you how an existing user can sign into
the application and then buy a book
online so I provided the email id I
provided the password then I will click
on the Sign In button when i click on
the Sign In button what it does is it
calls a PHP program that I have written
the PHP program it will take the email
id as the input and will query a
database and get the password for that
particular link to that particular email
id if the password matches with whatever
I have entered into the login screen it
will load the list of books that are
available in that database now here one
thing you wanted to have highlight is
like if the user is logging in for the
first time my application has a
capability or intelligence to know that
the user is logging in for the first
time it will then what it will do is it
will load the all the data from the
database in my website and it will copy
it to a local cycle light database in
this application this I have done to
increase the performance of the
application to reduce the response time
so that if
once user logs in for the first time in
the second time when he logs in does not
have to go all the way around to that
database in the website the data can be
directly fetched from the sequel light
database I have done this using a
versioning concept so when a user logs
in it just checks the version of the
sequel I'd database is same as the
version of the database that I have in
my website if it is same it uses a
sequel I database if it is not then it
will load the data from the website and
then we'll show you this screen with all
the details of the books available so
let me now choose a book that i want to
buy let us say i want to buy a java
programming book i'll then click on Add
to Cart in this screen I can mention the
number of copies that I want to buy let
us say i want to buy 12 copies i will
say i calculate which will calculate the
price of the 12 copies then i click on
payment details and in this screen the
pavement little screen i will enter my
name my credit card number and address
so let me put my name first
ay Jay
I
me so I put my name and then let me put
the credit card number the credit card
number is a numeric field and I let me
enter some random number here now let me
put address address i'll also put a
random number or random address i will
just put the city name let me choose
bangalore
so once I have provided all the data i
click on proceed to checkout what it
does it again call say a PHP program it
gives all this data or disorder to the
PHP program the PHP program creates an
order number and stores our order
details in a database in the website and
if everything goes successful it will
throw you this message saying that the
order has been successful and it will be
shipped to you in the next business day
and then when i click on ok it will take
me back to the screen from where user
can again select another book and
specify the number of copies of that
book and then again buy that book online
so this is a very short description of
my demonstration this are the various
java ports that i have written and these
are the layouts that i have used for
this application due to paucity of time
i will not be able to walk you through
all the the entire port but if you have
any questions or if you have any
clarifications please write me mill my
email ids rajeev 76 @ yahoo.com thank
you and have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
