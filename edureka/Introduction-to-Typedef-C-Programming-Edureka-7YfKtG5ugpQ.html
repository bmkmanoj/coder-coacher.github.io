okay so now let's talk about a simple
operation but a very useful one and C
called type def type def is used to
create synonyms for data types it's
pretty much like renaming or giving a
different name to a particular data type
I can say type def int number so now
instead of declaring variables int a int
B I can also use number a number B it's
simple so I'm just giving out the name
int is a keyword I can use in to declare
integers same time now if I say type def
int number I can also use number as a
datatype similarly at the example shown
here you have type def cash star a
string so automatically if I want to
declare a variable STR 1 which is going
to be or the typecast star instead of
using cash star I can use the word
string but type tips are most popularly
used for structures this is because if
you've noticed let's look at our program
again where we've used structures a lot
everything you know declare a structure
variable we have structure of the type
node we have chuck node and every time
we need a variable like temp or PTR we
had to always repeat the keyword struct
we had to say struct node star temp
struct node star PTR so it becomes kind
of long so what people generally do is
use a type def and rename or give
another name to struct node and
something else so we're gonna say type
def struct node as node you can see a
difference right now I'm calling it
capital node so I know it's a type def
now instead of calling struct node I
directly say node because node also
means struct node so everywhere I can
just say node
doing here to sizeof node let's modify
all of this
we don't know anymore struck notes let's
compile this
you know I know the warnings let's run
it there it works fine
we haven't modified the algorithm or we
haven't changed the code really so it
should work as usual you can insert a
number you display it you'll see it and
if you delete it 12 delete again degree
234 display it won't display anything
you can quit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
