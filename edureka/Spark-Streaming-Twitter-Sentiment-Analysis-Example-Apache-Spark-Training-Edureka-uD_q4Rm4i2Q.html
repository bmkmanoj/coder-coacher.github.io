interesting session of pathway nee-sama
dareka what is path trimming is it like
really important definitely yes
is it really hot definitely yes that's
the reason we are learning this
technology and this is one of the very
spot things in the market when it's a
fasting means in terms of job market and
talking board so let's see what will be
our agenda for today so we are going to
discuss about past ecosystem where we
are going to see that ok what is pop how
fast am interested in our particle
system by start screaming we are going
to have of overview of spot streaming
and of getting into the basics of that
we will learn about B screen we will
learn also about these themes
transformation we will be learning about
caching and persistence accumulators
broadcast variables checkpoint these are
like advanced concept of path swimming
and then in the end we will walk through
a use case of twitter sentiment analysis
know what is streaming let's understand
that so let me just start by a example
to you so let's say if there is a bank
and in band definitely I'm pretty sure
all of you must have used credit card
debit card all go start what bank
provide now let's say you have done a
transaction from India of that's not and
within an art and as if your card is
getting tried the u.s. is that even
force Mills for your card to weaken and
ask us definitely know now how that bank
will realize that it is a fraud
transaction because banks cannot let
that transition happen they need to stop
it at the time of when it is getting
swiped either they can block it give up
all to you ask you whether it is a
genuine action or not do something of
that sort
now do you think they will put some
manual person behind the scenes that
will be looking at all the transactions
and you will block it manually
no so they
wire something of the sort there the
data will be getting streamed and at the
real time they should be able to catch
with the help of some patterns they will
do some processing and they will get
some pattern out of it which if it is
not sounding like a genuine transition
they will immediately as a blockage or
give you up all maybe send your OTP to
confirm whether effect the new
connection but they will not date till
the next day to kind of complete that
transaction otherwise which what happens
nobody is going to process that's right
so that is the how we book on Timmy now
someone has mentioned that without cream
processing of data is not impossible in
fact we can see that there is no even
big data which is possible we cannot
even talk about Internet of Things right
and just this is a very famous statement
from Donna Sandhu are some sequel speak
lot of companies like YouTube Netflix
Facebook Twitter I twins of Pandora all
these companies are using spot screaming
now what is this we have just seen with
an example to kind of got an idea about
spinning facts now as effects with the
time growing with the internet doing
these streaming technologies are
becoming popular day by day it's a
technique through strands for the data
so that it can be processed as a steady
and quantum exchange means immediately
as and when the data is coming
you are continously processing it as
well in fact this real-time streaming is
what is driving creative big data and
also Internet of Things now there is a
lot of things like fundamental unit of
skin will be a stream we will also be
transforming our spins we will be doing
it inside the companies are using it
with their business intelligence we will
see more details in further of the
spikes but before that we will be
talking about
Oh sister when we talk about past
ecosystem there are multiple libraries
which are present in it first when it's
passed people now in fact sequel is like
Wellington as people develop broken by
the quarry in a sequel way and it is
going to get our work into a starfish
and then going to give you kind of
analogous to hide but it is going to be
faster in compartment to hide when we
talk about past minutes that is what we
are going to learn it is going to enable
all the analytical and interactive
applications for your life streaming
data
Emily Emily is mostly for my money and
insects the interesting part about Emily
is that it is completely replacing Mouse
integrator almost the first Mouse all
the core contributors of the house have
moved in to work go towards them
indexing because of the faster response
performance is really good in handled it
graphics graphics okay let me give
example everybody must have used Google
Maps right now what you're doing Google
Maps you search for the first you put
your source input your destination
now when you just search for the part it
searched multiple paths and then provide
you an optimal path right now how is
providing the optimal path these things
can be done with the help of graphics so
wherever you can create a kind of a
graphical structure we will say that you
can use graphic but up now this is the
kind of a package of provided for art so
R is a open tool which is mostly news my
eminence and now start submitting want
in fact I'll handle this kind of to move
towards the spaz single and at the
reasons they have recently sat
supporting pop where all the analysts
can now execute the query using pop
environment just getting better
performance and they can also work on
big data that's that's all about the
ecosystem part below this gave way to
have a four engine or engine is the one
which defined
all the basic gossip ideas are all the
agony delicious coconut is going to be
defined in your pop port engine moving
further now so as we have just discussed
the fact we are going to now discuss
spot cleaning in the quickest way to
enable analytical and interactive apps
for light streaming data not by fastest
if I talked about by custom indefinitely
we have just gotten a the different is
very important that the reason we are
learning it but this is so powerful that
it is you snuff on a lot of companies to
perform their marketing they kind of are
getting an idea that what our customer
is looking for in fact we are going to
learn a use case of similar to that
where they are going to use fast
screaming not where they are going to
use a pretty sentimental analysis which
can be used for your crisis management
maybe you want to check all your
products on Abhijit service I just think
target marketing by all the companies
around the world this is getting good
in this way and that's the reason start
screaming is gaining the popularity and
because of its performance as well it is
basing on other platform at the moment
now moving buzzer Lexi start streaming
features when we talk about performing
physics it's very easy to scale you can
place the ribbon multiple nodes which
can even run ten and a sophomore
it is going to be very quick means in a
very short time you can see masculist
processor data fault tolerant event or
it make sure that even you are not
losing your data integration with your
back panel real-time processing is
possible and it can also be used for
your business analytics it is used to
track behaviour of your customer side
you can see this is so powerful light in
its life we are kind of getting to know
so many interesting things about this
path limit not
let's quickly have and overview so that
we can get some basics of passage not
let's understand how it works so as we
just discussed it is for real-time
streaming data it is useful addition in
your path for 80s so they have want to
be seen at the base level we have that
park or another ecosystem on top of that
we have fast in it in that fast limit is
kind of adding pinata of advantage to
Sparkle maybe because a lot of people
are only joining fast communities you
kind of use this fastening it's so
powerful that everyone wants to come and
want in English because all the other
frameworks which we already have which
are existing are not as good in terms of
performance or not and and it's the
easiness of moving fast swing is also
good if you compare your program to let
a few orbits form which is useful the
assigned sort of things you will notice
that it is much easier in terms of form
a developer point of your headset that
is a lot of people are showing interest
in this domain now it will also enable
of ice snow foot and fault tolerance so
that to screen your data and process all
the things up and the fundamental unit
for past clinic is going to be feet
thick what is missing let me explain it
so this thing is basically a business of
our disease to process the real-time
data what we generally do is if you look
at this right hand side when you take
the data it is a continuous data you
divide it into practice of input data we
are going to call it as micro batch and
then we are going to get back this of
process data though it is real sign but
still how come it is back because
definite thing you are doing processing
on some part of the data right even if
it is coming at a time and that is what
we are going to follow that microbes
batch moving further now let's see few
more details on it
now from where you can get all your data
what can be your data sources there so
if we talk about data source until now
we can see in the data from multiple
sources like packet of pasta
even if you have patent holders like at
best mobile disease which other node
people may be enacted first mostly
people plastic file formats you can get
all the data from here now after that we
can also do processing the bell of
machine learning you can do the
processing the bells of your spots
equals and then give the output so this
is a very strong thing that you are
bringing the data using past image by
processing you can do by using some
other framework as well right like
machine learning we can apply on the
data what you are getting at the DSM you
can also apply your pass sequence on the
data which you are getting at the real
time moving further position of single
thing now in fast
teaming you can just get the data from
multiple sources like from tarkov room
SPSS kinases twitter bringing it to the
spot training doing the sort of things
and storing it back to your HDFS then
you can bring it to your DB you can also
publish your do I - course like tableau
angular there lot of UI - put order in
which you can publish your output know
how it was let us just break down into
more fine ground until now we are going
to get our input data stream we are
going to put it inside of a spa
streaming going to get the baptists of
input data once it executes tourists
pass English we are going to get batches
of processed data we have just seen the
same diagram before so the same
explanation for it now I am then
breaking it down into more granular part
we are getting at D string these symbols
what was smaller than either beta
multiple set of modeling so we are
getting a D string selected here getting
an agony at the rate of time but because
now we are getting real stream data
right selected in two days right now I
got one second they may now I go to one
second in one second I got more data now
I got more data in the next black space
so that is what we are talking about the
affiliating data we are getting from
time 0 to time one digit say that we
have an RDD at the rate of 10 bar
similarly it is this through feeding the
design starting and getting both we may
be not in the next thing is extracting
the words from an input stream so if you
can notice what we are doing here from
where let's say we started applying
linear operations as we started doing
over any sort of crossing so as and when
we get the data in this time since we
started doing some process it can be a
black pipe operation it can be any sort
of operation you're doing it tells me
when a machine learning or person or
whatever you're doing and then you are
generating the work in that kind thing
so this is how we are real sense that
how gladly we can kind of see all these
parts at a very high level this book we
again went into detail then again we
went into more detail and finally we
have seen that how we can even process
the data along the time bending our
streaming our data as well now one
important point is just like path
context is a link entry point for any
spark application similarly to work on
screaming or sparkling
you require a training context what is
that when you are passing or input data
stream you when you are working on the
spot engine when you are working on this
path giving in death
you know how to reduce your singing
context excuse in training context only
you are going to get the batter's of
your input data now so scrimmage context
is going to consume a stream of data in
a party spot it is register and input B
string to produce or receiver object no
it is the main entry point as we
discussed that like past context is the
main entry point for the spark
application similarly your streaming
context is an entry point for less
fasted now does that mean now pass
context is not a ninja point no when you
create paths limit it is dependent on
your
our communities so when it makes this
giving context it is going to be
dependent on your path of contact only
because you will be not able to create
Union context without a caucus so that's
a reason it is definitely require staff
also provide a number of default
implementations of sources like single
data point little a factor
Vigo and Q which are accessible from the
context fatal supporting so many things
right now if you'll notice this what we
are doing is spinning convex this is
just to give you an idea about how we
can initialize our stable context so we
will be importing these two libraries
after the thinking I am passing for
context epic quests some partial with
every second we are collecting the data
then collect the data for every one
second you can increase this number if
you want and then this is your ethnicity
and everyone again whatever going to
happen I am going to perfect this is
what we are doing in this case let's go
to the B screen top o'clock now in this
screen it is the full form is
discretized screen it's a basic
abstraction provided by your path limit
your book it's a point in your stream of
data and it is going to be received from
your source and from crosses premium
context is related to your red path
Winnipeg mark context is belonging to
your passport at you remember the equal
to some local in the ecosystem we have
that path context right now cleaning
context is big big helper path context
and in fact using streaming context only
you will be able to perform your puzzle
the Flex without fat content you were
not able to exist use anything in space
application the application will not be
able to do anything
similarly with cows streaming content
your streaming application will not be
able to do anything it does that premium
context is built on top of our context
okay so now it's a quantitative stream
of data I can talk about these things it
is the system source of on the bottle
data generated by the transformation of
interesting if you look at this part
internally or desync can be represented
by a continuous series of our DV this is
important if now what we are doing is
every seconds remember last time we just
enum example of like every section
whatever is going to happen we are going
to do pause so in that every second
whatever data you are connecting and
you're performing your operation so the
data what you are getting here is will
be your deeply means it's a Qantas you
can say that all this thing will be or
be stream part it are representation by
a continuous series of already given C
so when you are doing is getting box
because I said right knock in one second
what did I got collected I indicated it
in the second second this data is
happening here okay okay sorry about
that now in the second time also of the
it is acting up third second also it is
happening here on the corner I'm not
servant enjoyed now right so in the
story second auto if i jig something it
am processing it affects if you see does
this diagram itself so it is every
second whatever data is getting
collected we are doing the focusing on
top of it and the whole quantities of
our DB was be a stranger it will be
called that D string okay so this is
what your D string moving further now we
are going to understand the operation on
B string connected oh you are doing this
operation on this d thing that you are
getting the data from 0 to 1 again you
are applying some operation on that then
whatever output you get you are going to
call it as both pieces and this is the
thing what you are doing you are doing a
passion for fashion that reason we are
calling it is about these things now
similarly whatever thing you are doing
so you're going to get accordingly and
output B screams for it as
so this is what is happening in this
particular example no slack Mac slack
Mac is a API
it is the very similar to Mac it's kind
of flatten up your values okay so let me
explain you with an example what is
black back so let's say if I say that hi
this is a deulgukhwa welcome
okay let's say this in return now I want
to apply a platform selectively into the
form of RDD also now on this RVD let's
say I apply flat apps let's take our DD
this is our D flat map flatmap
capitalist class matter
and then let's say you want to define
something points so let's say you say
like okay or you are defining your
bearable sales so let's say a a dot now
after that you are defining your split
click here splitting with respective it
now in this case what is going to happen
now I'm not showing it exactly here just
to get a spinning flat back just to kind
of give you an idea of what it is going
to lighten up this pipe with respect to
the let what your mention is means what
it is going to largely get each and we
meant as one board but there is going to
create like this
hi as one word and one element this as
one word or one element is as another
word or one element at Garissa as one
border and the limit welcome F 1 both of
them so this is how your black pencil
kind of flatten of your whole body so
this is what we're doing in our free
network here ever but this is how this
will go
now so we have just understood this part
now you understand input be slim and
receiver gets what are the letter this
benefice okay so what are the input
these impossible
there can be basis proof advances in
basic tools we can f5 with them
soccer's connections in advances we can
have kappa no calluses okay so your
input these things other these things
representing the themes of input data
received from screaming sources this is
again the same thing okay so this is
there are two type of thing so generate
assistance one is your basic and second
is just advanced with more brother
now what we are going to feature if you
notice let me here there are some events
often it is going to your receiver and
then in the restream now i babies are
getting created and we are performing
some steps on it so the receiver sensor
data in 233 their needs back is going to
contain doc rdz so this is what your
this thing is doing a receiver is doing
what now moving further transformations
on the ds3 let's understand that what
are the transformations of elaborate
there are multiple transformations which
are possible the most popular let's talk
about that we are map flatmap filter
reduce group by so there are multiple
transformations available here now it is
like you are getting your input data now
you will be applying any of these
operation make any transformation step
is going to happen and then on you this
thing is going to be created okay so
that is what's going to happen select
explore it one by one so let's start
with now if I start with map what
happens with Mac
it is going to create batches of data
okay so let's say it is going to create
a map when you operate like this so let
the X or not to be my giving those
cookies that is giving the whole the big
site so in this similar for my this is
going to get map so I am going to
whatever you're performing it is this
where you get backup of input data that
you can execute it state return our new
DC by passing each element of the both
be linked through of function with Yuma
different
let this does this backpack that can
give them sister it is going to flatten
up the things but in this case also if
you notice the other kind of flatten off
it is very similar format but each input
item can be mapped to zero or more
outputs in store items here okay and it
is going to return our new deep sleep by
passing heat source element through a
function for this part we have just been
an example of black hat anyway so the
skin is infinite and remember back that
will be more easy for this you kind of
see the difference between with Marcus's
now moving for the prism as the names
which you can now filter of the bubble
so let's say you have a huge data you
are kind of you want to filter out some
value we just want enough box with some
filter data maybe you want to remove
some part of it maybe you are trying to
put some logic on it does this line can
take this right or does this line
contains that well that gives it is
really only with that particular
criteria so this is what we do you but
definitely most of the signs to output
is going to be smaller in comparison to
your input reduce reduce is it's just
like it's going to do kind of
aggregation on the work letter in the
end you want to sum up all the data what
you have that is going to be done the
Delta with you now after that group by
group back is making it going to combine
all the carbon done that is what goodbye
is going to do so as you can see in this
example all the things which are
starting with people through back all
the things they've starting with j-bot
grow back all the names starting with
see God's group five not so again what
is this same window now to give you an
example of this Pinto
everybody must be going to turn right so
now what happens into them let me go to
my bank but in in this example let's
understand how this window opens up so
let's get in initial perspective an
initial per second sense again let's say
the trees not happening in the specific
hash chain
as a half-day now which is the trending
twitter definitely is right
stalemate really good maybe in the next
10 seconds in the next 10 seconds
now again hash it hash b HB is always
between the sending with being happening
here now let's say in another sense
against now this time let's say HB HB
for cash me I should be
cash me that is now the defendant build
of it but now I want to find out which
is the trending one in last certificate
actually right because if I combine I
can do is really now this is your been
drilling operation example means you are
not only looking at your current window
but you are also looking at your
previous window phonetic current window
I am talking about like this 10 second
top slot in this 10 second plot let's
say you are doing this operation on hat
we actually has there is no current
window now you are not fully computing
with respect to current window but you
are also considering your previous
window now let's say it just says if my
assets when you give me the output of
which is sending a last 17 seconds will
you be able to answer why because you
don't have partial information for
sensitive you have information for your
10 20 30 makes multiple of sense but not
in certainly yes one so keep this in
mind okay so you will be able to perform
when during operation only with respect
to your window size if not then you can
create any partial value and can do the
window operation now let's get back to
this way now it's simulating so now I've
shown you that we are not only
considering the current window but we
are also considering the previous window
now next understand the output operators
of operations of the v6 when we talk
about output operation the output
operations are going to allow the deep
same data
to be pushed out to your external system
if you notice fill me but whenever
whatever processing you have done with
respect to whatever data you are doing
here now you're all tails stored
in multiple set against loaded in the PI
system you can keep in your database you
can keep filling in your external system
so you can keep in my crystal slipper so
that is what being the test area now so
if I talk about output operation these
are the ones which is the cortex you can
print out the value we can use save as
text file menu save as text file it
saved it into your defense if you want
to can also use it to save it in a local
psychosis you can see with our as object
file also you can save it as a Hadoop
file or you can also apply for me add
any function now what are for each are
dealing from selective is example so
normally they spin on the spot in detail
one big issue for integrator sessions
but just to give you an idea now this is
a very powerful primitive that is going
to allow your data to be sent out to
your external systems for using this we
can send it across here of the
resistance we have just seen over
external systems that you can give
hypothermic and anything for using this
you will be able to transfer it you can
you will be able to send it out to your
external system now let's understand the
caching and processes now when we talk
about caching and persistence so this
string is also allowing the developer to
cache or to perfect the print data in
the Mauri means you can keep your data
in memory you can attack your data in
the model for longer time even after
your action is complete it is not going
to delete it so you can just use this as
many times as you want you can simply
use the process method to do that so for
your inputs link bitter is giving a data
for the network maybe you need kappa no
socket the default persistence level is
set to the the click here the data to
school
for the court honestly it is also going
to be duplicate in the data into two
parts so you can see the same thing in
this diagram let's understand this at a
later broadcast where it doesn't take
point now these are mostly for your
performance part so this is going to
help you to kind of pop off of to
calculate the performance part enough so
it is accumulated investing but
environment that are only at this
through and associative and commutative
operation
lutely which we are coming from Hadoop
background if you have done listed in
MapReduce programming you must have seen
something about counter sex that there
is news to ever counted six and offenses
to debug the program at this and you can
perform some analysis in the console
itself now this is similar thing you can
do with the exterminator server so you
get implemented well test this excess of
the fact you can also some of the things
which decide now you can do more to
track through UI you can also do that as
you can see in this UI specifically on
your excavators aspect now similarly we
have brought back wearable now broadcast
paribus allows the programmer to keep or
meet only better they can on all the
machines which are available now it is
going to be kind of passionate on all
the machines now they can be used to
give every note of copy of a large input
data set in an efficient manner so you
can just prove that each part will also
attempt to distribute the distributed
broadcast service using efficient
Rostock and got them to reduce the
communication book as you can see here
they are passengers broke up a little
going to pass contest and then it is
broadcasting to this list so this is
what how it is working in this
application generally when this piece in
this classes are not consisting the
advanced concepts we kind of what kind
of crisis training with the fact it is a
lot right now we just want to give you
an idea about what are we think so
go with the practicals of all these days
that how isolated be honest enough we
know they're getting broadcasted things
become more and more clear at that time
right now I just want us everybody has
these data high level overview of things
now moving model so what is that point
the second pointer finger to your check
point of the gimme no no they can stop
they make it run 24 verse segments make
it president to the failure unrelated to
the explication love it so as you can
see this diagram we are just clicking
the set point fast in the metadata test
point agency it is the singing of the
information which is defining the
streaming computation if we talk about
data from checkpoint
it is taking of the generated led to the
reliable so that so this is this both
are generating up checkpoints now now
moving forward we are going to move
towards our project where we are going
to perform our precious sentiment
analysis let's discuss a very important
case for Twitter sentiment analysis this
is going to be very interesting features
we will just do a real-time identities
on Twitter sentiment analysis and they
can't a lot of possibility of this
sentimental assessments but we will be
taking something for the Twitter I am
going to be very interesting so
generally but we do all this in in our
course it is more detailed because I
it's not improving are definitely going
in deep is not very much possible but
during the training of a director it
will learn all these things between the
charge of some day which may something
which we learn it during the session
exit now we talk about some use cases of
Twitter or as I said there can be
multiple use cases which are possible
because there are solutions behind
whatever the something you are doing
make sure the social media and I saw in
these days are very activated right in
once we know the thing that even
politicians have such as using data and
this with all the fields of being shown
in the Meuse tournament in specific of
our eyes increased
start talking about positive negative
any politician do something and if you
talk about anything is given if we talk
about like Chinese food
three four whatever is going on then you
will notice always Twitter will be
filled up with lot of sweets right so
how we can make use of it or we can do
some analysis on top of it that's what
we are going to abundance this so there
can be multiple sort of sentiment
analysis but it can be done for your
practice management service adjusting
target marketing we can people talking
about when and you really need now even
the movie maker kind of good I predict
okay how this movie is going to perform
so they can easily make confident
beforehand okay just movie is going to
go in this kind of range of profit or
not interesting like a little set for
actual possible here is the political
company interests we must have for that
in unison the presidential election was
happening they have used the impact on
of social media of on this analysis at
all and then that have been buried a
major role in winning that election
similarly how whether investors want to
predict whether they should invest in a
particular company or not whether they
want to change that whether of we should
target which customers for advertising
because we cannot add it every one
problem with targeting everyone is if we
try to target everyone it will be very
costly we want to find or set a target
of it is the wheel instead of purple
boom I should finish magnetized meant to
be more effective and well as a letter
physics going to be cost-effective isn't
if you wanted to do the Protestant
services also in that case we can also
do this now let see some use cases like
now in terms of ups I will show your
capital house one so first of all we
will be importing all the required it is
because we are going to normal form or
to the sentiment analysis so we will be
requiring some packages for that so we
will be doing that as a first step then
we need to check all our authentication
without authentication we cannot do
anything up
now here the challenges because on that
if we put your username in perfect don't
you think it's really attempted to put
your username is not straight so Peter
came up with something many things what
they did is they came up with something
authentication tokens so you have to go
to dev
twitter.com login from there and you
will find character for all this
authentication tokens available to you
for will be the very to taste effort and
put it here this as we have learned the
deep information you will be doing all
that computation tip so you will take or
having the dstingle of transformations
then you will be generating your sweet
data I'm going to save it in this
particular data screen once you are done
with this then you are going to extract
your sentiment once you extract it and
you're done let me show you quickly how
it works and above here now one more
interesting thing about it later would
be that you will be getting all this
constellation machines duty not worry
about from where I will be getting all
this is it like very difficult to
install when I was awake in this open
source location it was not working for
me and my operating system was not
working so many thanks you have 70
seeing people of safe issues to resolve
everything up be a big kind of provide
all this fear pushing from the whole VM
has free spot yes that's what it has
everything free installed whatever will
be required for the clinic so that's the
best part what we also provide but in
this case your eclipse will already be
built we need to just go to your Eclipse
location let me show you all you can
also both there if you want you can see
when mr. there we just need to go inside
it and double click on it is that you
need not go in kind of installed acute
or not even this part will already be
installed for you let us go in our
project so this is our project which is
in front of you for this little project
which we are going to go now you can see
that we have first imported all the
libraries and we have set all the
authentication system and then we are
moved and kind of expected that these
things and formation expected a tree
right and them stable could finally
right so these are the things that we
have done in this program also now let's
execute it to learn this sugar
it's very simple go to run back and from
run and click on scale application you
will notice in the end it is reminiscing
that
ray good to see that so it is executing
the processor let the state pick you and
we are looking at acting for term so
using forums anyway the trees are going
to be negative right so let's see them
because anything you do for some repute
of integrative clump is anyway the hot
tub is modest let me make it a little
bigger also you will notice a lot of
negative week coming up oil yes now I'm
just stopping it so that I didn't show
you something
yet the trickling liquid water so we
have actually well written writing the
program except we have given at one
location from using that we were kind of
asking for a split open now here we're
doing analysis and it is also going to
tell us whether it's a positive to a
negative mood and this is simply
negative it is going upset with herself
first run everyone will not reach
positive edge to match them something
which is good so that's what he said
you're finding this is a negative it so
similarly if there will be any other
tweaks which will be getting a spectacle
right now if I keep on moving yet we
will see multiple negative tooth which
will come off so that helps this
programmer so this is how so our program
will be executing within the first
package even the output address will be
getting stored at a location as you can
see in this if I go to my location here
this is my action for SEC spirit is
running so you can just come to this
location here our onion output all your
output is getting so this may be
mistaken to answer yes so if everything
is done by using fast thing before me
okay
that's what is being right drop that we
were seeing it's or with respect to B
stream transformations inner so they
have done all that with the help of our
technologies so that is and one of the
awesome part about this that you can do
such a powerful things with respect to
your with respect we know this but now
let's analyze our result
so as we have just seen that it is
showing a predator to positive to a
negative to it and all but this is where
your output is getting tuned at this
shown you up
Southwind appear like this
oh just love your output to expand
estimate it will also tell whether it's
a neutral one positive one negative one
everything which we have done it with
the help us pass the mean only now we
have done it for us as I just explained
you right we have put another program
extends from like we are put everything
up here and based on that Olivia taking
all the copper now we can apply all the
sentiment analysis and like this like we
have done so I hope you have found all
this especially this useful very much
suitable for you in terms of getting you
back yes it is getting done by half side
right gonna be a foot start from here
but if you want you can keep on putting
go hat step as well because that's how
we are doing it you can people changing
her tap movie you can tell your purpose
let's say for people what's up is going
on a cricket match will be going on you
can just put the streets according to
that to speak to inductors and set up
front you can put for any slave named
Olivia or team name and you will see all
that I need with some more coffee
okay so that's how you get riveted now
this there are multiple eastern Pacific
which we can play and this new skill can
be able a board for multiple other type
of users you tend to sleep on transform
again according to your all these cases
so that's just about passed them in
which I wanted to discuss so I hope or
you might have found it useful do we get
these kind of projects in the spot for
yes you will learn it during the session
listed and usually at the end you will
be finding multiple projects to practice
as this by doing the patients also
trainers kind of give you a good
overview of all this project how to work
on it because at the time you are
loading it so a lot motive is when we
are teaching or something
they kind of explain you with our usage
so that makes you kind of learn in a
better way resume telling you will
students build to that if you see tool a
use case you kind of learn enough and
that's a great way of making good us
what if we get stuff English project we
have a 24 by 7 support from a Gallagher
side if you get stuck at any moment
yes dropping email give them a call and
you will be immediately
let's see can't see ourselves in this
light but if you are not going to be
left out Amen if you are made of leaves
with the end of a project even with the
traders also you can kind of have the
sessions we will be helping you with the
first at all back so that's not a
problem is it fantastic thanks a lot
further when the position
