Rica and welcome to this in Eureka live
session on power bi dashboard now
obvious gained a lot of popularity of
recently and we've already hired a
session that had a fundamental
introduction to power bi in this session
let's look at what we're gonna be
covering as part of it will first try to
get a summary of what power bi is we'll
just revisit the concept of what bobby
is after that we'll talk about what is a
dashboard moving on from there we look
at how to create a dashboard in power bi
and how to use power bi to solve a
real-time scenario now let's first
understand what is power bi now to
summarize power bi is a cloud-based
business intelligence tool introduced by
Microsoft in 2013 which was basically a
combination of most add-ons that were
given to Microsoft Excel so Microsoft
thought okay why not have a separate
tool in itself which can help solve all
these issues so they came up with power
bi now Poppaea has a lot of different
features and talking about the various
versions of power that are available you
have power bi desktop we have power bi
cloud service and then you have power bi
mobile Bobby a desktop is basically
going to be the platform where you will
be creating all your reports analyzing
your data integrating your data and
playing around with your data Bobby a
cloud service is mainly for viewing your
dashboard working around with your
reports and getting an insight with
respect to whatever has been created
waha bi mobile basically helps you with
all your reports and dashboards while
you're on the go and is one of the
easiest ways for you to keep track of
all the changes that happen with your
data as well now moving on let's try to
understand what is a dashboard now a
dashboard in bar b are basically is a
single page or most often known as a
canvas where in a visualization is used
to tell a story now to help you
understand better let's take it from an
organization's perspective in terms of
Finance now I want to know what my sales
numbers are I want to know the overall
expenditure that is being spent there I
want to know how my marketing is doing I
won't know how much is being spent there
I
the revenue that I'm getting I want to
know how much is being spent on my
employees how much I'm spending to my
third party and so forth
now if I have one single page which
gives me all this information then I'm
happy and that's what exactly is
required by the higher authorities in an
organization they want a brief overview
to understand how it works out and
Bobbie helps you do that when I have all
this data present in a single page it
solves most of the questions that comes
up to anyone's mind as such now moving
forward let's try to understand how
power bi dashboard is to different from
a report in power bi now will mainly be
looking at these major factors which is
in pages the data sources whether the
capability of pinning how we can filter
the data whether we can set alerts
feature natural language query whether
we can change the visualization type and
customization now firstly talking about
pages a report is mostly a detailed view
with respect to the various insights
required so it usually has at least more
than one pages in argument present
scenario
whereas a dashboard is restricted to
just one single page which gives me a
complete overview with respect to what I
where I wanna understand now coming down
to a report aspect now with respect to
the data sources present there usually
it's just one single source of data that
you would be working around with where
and what you would be doing is that you
would be presenting different views or
different analysis different
visualizations from that single data
source but when it comes to a dashboard
here it's a overview so you would have
multiple reports being integrated
together so that I can give a gist or a
story here so thereby I can include
multiple data sources here as part of my
dashboard now coming to pinning aspect
what pinning basically is that I'm if I
wish to place a specific visual on to a
dashboard I can do that but when it
comes to a report I can only pin the
entire report on to my dashboard I
cannot specifically pin an individual
aspect as such now again coming down in
terms of filtering the data then what
happens is that it's quite easy for me
to filter my data highlight my data
slice my data
and process this data as well while I'm
working with reports but when it comes
to a dashboard I cannot manipulate the
existing data on which the
visualizations are built now this is
basically due to the code difference
with respect to how these views are
available in a report usually it's a
edit access that you get but whereas in
a dashboard it's mainly a view related
access that you get now coming down to
alerts that you can set now let's say I
have a data I have I want to understand
with respect to a certain change let's
say I hit a revenue of 5 million so when
that happens on my dashboard I can set
an alert to give me a reminder or send
me an email a message or a notification
as well and all this can be configured
on my dashboard itself but whereas when
it comes to a report this is mainly not
possible coming down to the feature
aspect now while I'm working with
different reports and different
dashboards feature feature mainly helps
me identify which are more important
reports which are my essential which are
on priority so feature option helps me
categorize all this data as per my
requirement now talking about natural
language query now all of us love to
mean all of us love to analyze our data
now would it be easy if I did not need
technical assistance if I could just
write my query and the system would give
me back that's where power bi dashboard
has a huge advantage in comparison to
any report that is present I can
directly write my questions and I can
get my output in form who will be seen
that as part of this session as well now
in terms of customization as I had
mentioned to you earlier dashboards are
mainly view only access so you cannot
manipulate the data or the visualization
as such but you can reorganize them move
them here and there or even delete them
as such but whereas when I come into a
report there I can play around with it
as much as I wished now coming down to
power bi now if you wish to get started
then you need to install either power bi
desktop or what you can do is you can go
on to power bi as website and then get
started let me just show that to you so
this is power B eyes website okay so
here just so this is basically power bi
or Microsoft com
and here if you can just click on the
option start free which in turn will
give you the access to download power
BIA on to your system now you can either
do that or what you can do is that I'm
sorry ok you can either do that or you
can directly sign up here wearing you
can access power bi service so what I
would recommend is that you download
power bi desktop onto your system and
begin working on it ok now let me just
go on and launch my power bi desktop
just give me a minute
meanwhile if you do have any questions
you can put it across in the chart box
either me or my team will be able to
pick them up and give you a complete
answer to your questions
okay so I see a question here from Sadat
so Siddharth is asking is programming
required to learn power BIA no proof so
that you don't need to learn programming
to work with bar BIA because it's very
easy to use tool now using power bi you
can create radius visualizations you can
work with respect to your data analysis
and is one of the most easiest tool to
work around with so you don't need to
have any specific programming language
as such okay it's mainly you'd be
working on drag and drop operation and
while you're analyzing analyzing your
data some fundamental knowledge of SQL
would be helpful but again it's not a
hard prerequisite asset so anyone can
get started with power bi
okay so this is what my power bi would
look like okay so once you install power
bi on your system this is my power bi
desktop and this is the home screen that
you get so again one thing that I would
recommend is that you create an account
on bobbya because the reports that you
would be creating need to be published
on power bi service where the dashboards
would be created so make sure you have
signed up with a user ID and then logged
in in your power bi desktop as well okay
so you have the option to log in here I
have already left logged in at present
so first let's get in our data let me
give you a glimpse of the data that we
are going to be working with as part of
this session now before that let me go
back to my presentation and here let's
try to understand what exactly are we
trying to achieve with respected today's
session now we'll be working with a data
set of a superstore and this data has
been collected from a superstore in US
and it's spread across different states
and different countries as well now
apart from that this data was collected
from 2011 all the way to 2014
now we'll mainly be trying to gain for
insights as part of this session
now the first insight that we are going
to try to get is the overall performance
what I need to understand is the overall
trends of the sales and profit of the
superstore as well as understand the
performance in different regions as well
so let me go back to my power bi and
here you have the option of importing
different data sets so this comes when I
select on get data so these are the
different data sources from which I can
load my data okay now for this session
I'm just going to be using an excel file
so let me just click on Excel
okay so this is my global superstore
data
okay so when you've selected your data
so the first thing that you get is you
get a preview or a glimpse of your data
now this in turn is very useful when you
can understand how the data looks before
you load and work with it now there are
mainly three tables present in my excel
file so I have orders
I have people and then I have returns
okay now here there's basically a limit
set for the number of rows that you've
taken okay by default it's set to a
limit of 100 okay now here what happens
I get a glimpse of whatever is present
in the table so I know there's a row ID
I know already ordered ate ship date and
so forth apart from that I have people
and I also have the option of return now
the reason that this view is really
helpful is that sometimes while loading
the data there may be some
inconsistencies now if you notice with
respect to people table as well as the
return table the first row is not picked
as the column header so what I want to
do is that before I load these tables I
want to ensure these are the column
headers so what I'll do is I'll just
select all these three tables and then
I'll click on the edit option now once I
do that power bi basically gives me the
feature to edit my data before
completely loading it into power bi okay
so automatically the power of query
editor has opened up so when you want to
manipulate your data into power bi this
is the place where you will be playing
it playing around a lot so I'll be
coming back here a little more okay now
what I'll do is let me just select the
option now you can either select each
column and drag it or there's this
option present here use first row as
header so I'll just select this and
automatically the first row gets
promoted to column headers similarly let
me do that to my returns table as well
okay now once I'm done with this let me
just close and apply these changes
so it may take some time so I request
you to be a penetration
okay so my data has been loaded so that
I can find out with respect to the
columns present here these are basically
my tables and then once I click on them
I can see the brainiest columns present
in each of the tables as well now I'm
quite sure some of you will have
attended our previous session on power
bi but let me just give you a simple
overview of power bi desktop as well
okay so they're basically three they're
basically three major workspaces that
you would be working around with okay so
there's your report workspace which is
the default workspace that you are
seeing
okay this workspace mainly is used to
create various visuals and identify
which requirement and manipulate the
visuals in itself then you have your
data workspace this is the second
workspace and this is the place where
you can see your data that is present in
power bi now if you wish to add new data
to this or if you wish to manipulate
this data then you have the option
present here to edit queries okay once
you hit on this the query editor gets
open so remember how we had seen the
same window earlier so this is how you
reach to it through your power bi okay
now here you have the option to
manipulate at play around with your data
and do anything that you wish now I see
some of you asking how is power B are
different from tableau as such now
tableau mainly is a data visualization
to empower B apart from data
visualization you also have the access
to data integration and data
manipulation as such you can create
whatever that you want with the data
that is present you can change it as per
your requirement you can filter it you
can process it you can merge it you can
even write a query present here to
convert the data as per your requirement
so here you have the complete access to
manipulate the data as well so it's not
just a data visualization tool but it's
more power it's more effective as a data
manipulation tool as well okay so let me
just close this and talking about the
third workspace the third workspace is a
relational workspace now when you're
working with multiple tables then
there's usually a relationship that is
present between these tables so what
happens here is this table gives you a
simple overview with respect to how the
tables are connected to each other now
by
default what Barbara does is that it
identifies the relationships and then it
Maps it automatically but this may not
always be right so make sure that you
verify it now here you can see there's
already a relationship being maintained
between the returns table and the people
table based on the region present here
so again power BIA has automatically
detected this and created this so this
is a really helpful workspace when
you're working with multiple tables now
coming back to our report workspace now
the first insight that we had to get was
the performance inside so let me first
begin by renaming this sheet let me call
it overall performance okay now what do
I need here if I need to identify the
overall performance then there are
basically two things I need my profit I
need my sales so first let me select
profit sorry about that okay so when I
select a specific column in itself well
we are automatically determines which is
the most apt visualization for it and it
creates a visualization by default okay
now to the profit let me add sales as
well okay now I have profit I have my
sales now I won't understand the
requirement here better so what I do
here is that I'll bring in my order date
as well so this in turn will give me an
easier access to identify how it works
you can either select the option here or
you can drag it and drop it to the
visualization as well okay now what it
has done its is that it's actually
create give me in repeated sorry
it's given me a visualization in terms
of the profit and sales as a clustered
bar chart with respect to different
years as well okay so I don't want this
I want it as a line graph so what I'll
just do is I'll just select the line
chart option here and automatically it's
going to get converted so this is
something that's more easier for me to
understand so I have the data from 2012
all the way up till 2015 okay now what I
need to do is that
wanna add in the region data also okay I
want to identify the regions which are
performing well so I'll bring in the
regions I'll drop it here okay
now what happens is that I don't see any
change here this is mainly because power
pair has actually created another layer
here okay so it's actually created two
different layers here what I'm seeing is
the profit and sales by year and if I
drill down then what happens is that it
becomes profit and sales by quarter now
this is basically because there are
different dates let me just remove that
from here album month day okay and let
the euro just be there now your quarter
and this is with respect to the
different regions as well okay so here
this is profit and sales with respect to
the different regions and what barbier
has done is that it's summarized all the
data over the four years that my data
was present and then it's given me the
profit entry and sales date okay so this
is a very interesting visualization now
same visualization I've used to
represent two different things I have my
sales and profit by here I have my sales
and profit by quarter I also have my
sales and profit by reach this basically
will give me a very good analysis with
respect to my overall performance okay
now let's go back to our presentation
let's see the next inside that we are
trying to get okay now let's try to
identify the performance of different
states I want to identify how each state
is actually functioning okay now this
data although is collected from a
us-based superstore it's spread across
different countries so what we'll do is
we'll try to understand the performance
of each state in United States alone so
let me go back to my power bi let me
create a new sheet where I'm going to
store this data now let's say I want my
sales
I want my profit and let me bring in my
region as well okay now again it's
creating a bar chart for me so this is
not
I wanted let me just change it to a
graphical map so what I'll do is I'll
use a map visualization and then the
same data that I had seen earlier is
going to be represented here ok so
there's an issue here let me just reach
change this ok so it's changing now ok
there seems to be an issue with power bi
let me just close this
okay so we will take a different
approach here let me create a blank
visualization first so for that just
click on any visualization okay now to
this what I'm going to do is that I'm
gonna add regions so my regions is going
to be my location so regions comes into
the picture here then okay okay what
I'll do is rather than regions let me
bring in states okay I have states here
I'll bring in my sales and I'll bring in
my profit
okay let me just use a different
visualization for this I think there's
an issue with power VRA because I have
just updated it today so okay what I'll
do is I'll just filter this data as well
okay mmm let me bring in a country
filter now if you want to add a filter
to any visualization then you have the
option present here basically below
itself so let me bring in the country
filter here and this is going to be a
visual level filter now talking about
the different types of filter that you
can add here there's visual level filter
which basically is going to be applied
on one specific question then you have
page level filter a filter that is going
to be applied across the complete page
so let's say you have multiple visuals
on a say on a page then you can use a
page level filter and then there's
basically a report level filter so this
filter is going to be across a model
across all the pages in every report so
let me come down here and as you can see
there are different countries here so
let me just make sure I have United
States checked
seems like an issue that well not a
problem let me try the third
visualization here okay so this is
working so I think this is an issue with
power beyond that but don't worry again
when you talk about visualization power
bi gives you multiple opera options in
itself so here itself you can see I have
maps for geographical representation I
also have a field map basically the
filling is based on the values present
and then I also have a geological
specific map now here by default it is
for United States okay so let me just go
back now here the location is based on
the states the color saturation is based
on the profit the sales I'm sorry okay
and I'll bring in profits here as well
okay now okay sorry I am that know what
is doing is that it's setting tooltip to
be my profit now what do I mean by
tooltip to be profit is when I over over
any specific region then I cannot see
the profit also in that specific region
okay so let's say I want to change this
little more okay I want to identify
which I want to I don't like the color
present here so for that let me go into
the next tab okay which is the
visualization tab present here under the
visualization you have the second option
present here now here if you go into the
data color option here you have the
option of adding different colors to
different states as well okay apart from
that if you come down you can change
with respect to the border you can set
the background for this as well let's
see if you want to add a background
image you can do that as well so that
also can be specified
now I'm not specifying anything as such
as the moment okay and you can set a
zoom so again with any visualization
there's a lot that you can explore on
there's a lot that you can work around
with okay so with bobbya even if we take
a three yards or if you take a five-hour
session we would not be able to explore
it completely as such okay now the third
tab present here is the analytical tab
analytical feature is not available with
all the visualizations but we'll be
seeing that on inner third visualization
okay so there we'll try to understand
how this analytical tag will help us get
a better insight on our data okay now so
this is coming in terms of a graph which
were know okay this also does not meet
my final requirement I want to change it
to a scatter plot let me select scatter
plot and here what it's doing is that
it's specifying a scatter plot details
in my x-axis it is taking to be sales
and let me bring in my profit I think
profit is going as tooltips let me keep
my y-axis as profit okay so it's going
to plot it across sales and profit so
this is my final image that you see so
it's a completely detailed scatter plot
here now what I'll do is let me draw a
line here to identify regions which are
in profit and which are in sales so let
me go to the analytical tab and here you
have the option of X constant line and Y
constant line okay now if you see here
my values for sales are in millions okay
I see this ice the text seems a bit
small so let me just increase that there
I'll make this 20 okay that seems better
just let me do that the same with y-axis
as well okay so I have my sales starting
all the way from millions again and my
profit is not exactly in positive I have
regions where I have negative profit as
well so this is bad now to help me
understand this better let's draw a
constant line okay so my X constant
let's say I want to keep it at 100,000
so this is just a random value okay now
it's going to be at 100,000 okay so any
region that has profit more than 100,000
is definitely something that is helpful
for me it could be in terms of profit it
could be in terms of
to us as well now again I don't want
negative profit so what I'm going to do
is that I'm going to add an y Y constant
line as well now here let's say I'll
keep it at about 22,000 okay and let me
close this so here what you can see is
that my entire scatter plot has been
differentiated into four different
regions okay now what this helps me
basically understand is that if I have a
region above both the lines then this is
an ultimate region this is a very useful
region where I have very good sales I
have very good profit okay now basically
in this category there are only three
regions okay I have California where my
sales is about 450 to 7,000 and my
profit is about 76,000 same time I also
have New York and I have Washington now
when I come down okay
Texas gives me a sale of about 170,000
but it's a region where I have minus
profit that is it's minus 25,000 so
definitely I need to think little more
so I need to understand and invest this
area better same I can see with respect
to Pennsylvania okay now if you look at
the left top quadrant okay
these are regions that are okay they are
slightly above the giving me profit but
they're not bringing in much sales so
these are good regions where I can
improve my sales as well the fourth
quadrant are regions where I need to
invest some time these regions are not
meeting my minimum sales requirement nor
are they bringing me necessary profit
requirement as well although this is not
a negative profit for Virginia but still
it's not crossing my threshold of 22,000
so I need to invest more time I need to
identify so these are just some of the
real-world instances what are visualize
creation or Wharton report or even a
dashboard can help you understand as an
organization okay let me go back to my
presentation let's take the third
understanding when we will try to get a
segment wise
over you to understand how my superstore
is doing in different regions now I have
different segments in which my products
are going to be sold so let me
understand how this works out in
different regions okay let me come back
let me add a new report okay before that
let me just rename this let me call this
region by is profit sales and this is
going to my segment okay now here what
I'm going to do is that I have two
categories here okay I can either take
my segments or I can take my
subcategories so sub category seems a
little more better for me so let me pull
in my sub categories okay so this by
default is giving me a table form
wherein it's just showing me all the
values present in my sub categories to
this if I will bring my sales and my
profit again it stays in the same form
but yes it is good but it's not very
visually appealing so let me change it
let me bring in a clustered column chart
okay this seems a little more
interesting okay so now I have my profit
and sales based on different sub
categories now to this if I bring in my
categories as well
let's see what happens now what has
happened is that again it's created to
less it's not rejected there is new
field that I'm adding to it it's just
basically converted it to a new layer
now if I go to the next level then it's
giving me my sales and profit based on
my different categories aware oh now I
just have three major categories I have
furniture I have office supplies and
technologies I think again the text is
too small so let me just increase that
okay yeah that seems better so I have it
I have furniture is as my major category
office supplies and technologies okay
this is a just and simple over but if I
go our layer up then I can actually
identify based on the subcategories
which are doing well and which art okay
so this is basically again a different
representation not again if you want to
change it one of the other cell
visualizations that I would use is a
tree map I get tree map basically
differentiates it completely okay so
here what happens is it identifies the
most popular subcategory and then it
gives me a review but at the same time
it shows me both profit and sales here
which is not very clear so let me go
down to the next level now here again I
have my technology furniture and my
office supplies again the
differentiation is with respect to those
sales and the profit but again this
basically is the overall division that
happens with my numbers as such so again
not always every visualization may meet
your requirement so let me go back I
prefer a clustered column chart itself
okay so now I have a segment wise
overview of how my sales and profit I do
it again if you bring in segments here
as well this is just going to create
another new layer with respect to this
and here I have my segments as well
whether it's my consumer whether it's my
corporate or whether it's home office
space who have more products taken up
from me so again when you add new fields
power bi never rejects it there are few
cases wherein you cannot create a
specific visualization given the input
but this is mainly because power BIA in
itself tells you okay this is not the
right input for this visual try
something else
so in only such cases the power may
reject a specific input but more often
than not power BIA will accept most of
your inputs and if not possible on the
same level it will create a new level as
well okay so let me go on and let's look
at the final inside that we're going to
try to get as part of this now this is
basically a revenue generated option now
I need to identify the revenue generated
by each product and I want to also
understand
which is hampering my growth okay now
let me go back so last one let me add in
revenue no revenue basically requires
just two major things my sales and my
profit but to get a better insights let
me add in the dates as well I'll make it
quarterly okay I'll bring in my order
dates then what is doing is that it's
taking here quarter month and day I'll
remove month and day and let me do a
quarterly so here by default it's set it
in a descending order now if you want to
change it just click on more options
here okay and then you can change the
option here okay sort by quarter again
is set like that so again you can sort
it by sales number okay now it's already
changed so it's quarter one quarter two
quarter three quarter four okay that's
better okay this is my sales and profit
as per different quarters as such that's
great to see now what I want to do is
that I want to identify which categories
come into this picture
so which category is hampering my growth
okay now I see that I have furniture
that is bringing me this much input this
much sales but the profit is relatively
less I have my overall office supplies
that's bringing me good number of sales
and relatively it's going to be helpful
because it brings you a corresponding
trip profit as well when I come to
technologies yes this is the biggest
that I bring it but what is the profit
that it brings me so this is where
analytical comes into picture now here
what I can do is that I can set a
minimum line based on which I can
identify which are the read which are
the categories that brings that doesn't
bring me good revenue and I need to
invest some water okay this is on a very
overview level so let's say I'm going to
add a minimum line okay now what is done
is that by default it's
for sales let me do it for profit okay
now here you can see right it's
considered furniture to be below my
margin line okay now what I need to
identify is how I can grow this
similarly you can add a constant line
which is more useful when you have very
ating values and on a real-time analysis
basis constant line is what helps you as
well okay so with this we've completed
our report now comes the time when we
are actually playing with our dashboard
okay so for that what you need to first
do is that you need to save this report
so let me call this dashboard life okay
and then I'll just save it by default
it's going to be a PB IX for now why am
i saving this is that it's going to
create a local copy of this report so
even if you want to share this report to
someone else then you can share the PB
IX file and they can import it now comes
the chance to him to publish this once
you click on publish what happens is
that power bi desktop actually publishes
this report on to its cloud-based
service which is power bi service okay
yes it successfully published this okay
now let me go back to my power bi
service okay so this is what my power bi
service looks like
so once you've logged in to power bi
this is the view that you would be seen
okay now it's not showing me anything
let me just refresh this
now in my workspace I have a report
present here that is power bi that is
dashboard live okay now if I click on my
dashboard live option here then this in
turn is going to open up the report that
we have just created
okay so you can see here there are all
the four pages present here okay it's
taking some time so let's be a bit
patient meanwhile any questions you can
put it in the chat box
okay I see I'll pay asking can we
integrate power bi with cloud services
definitely you can okay you can
integrate it with most popular cloud
services that are available in the
market today okay so any of the cloud
services that are available you can
definitely integrate to them and
okay so I have another question is power
bi everywhere okay definitely you can
download power bi free of no additional
cost okay
Bobby also has a pro service wherein you
can actually share the report with
anyone that you want okay so if you wish
to create a dashboard and share it with
another person then you need to go with
the pro feature which basically is going
to cost you $10 a month given that you
compare it with tableau which costs you
about thousand five hundred dollars a
year
definitely power bi is one of the easier
and cheaper tools and this is one of the
reason that Microsoft is promoting power
bi as well now it's not just an
analytical tool it's mainly a
visualization tool that has a lot of
analytical feature associated with it
okay
now coming back to our dashboard now if
you look at our dashboard we have all
the reports present here now if you want
to modify any of the reports that you
have just created then you can edit the
report in itself okay so click on edit
report and you have the option to edit
this report now you might be wondering
okay if I can edit a report already on
the dashboard then why do I want power
bi desktop mainly because if you wish to
manipulate your data perform any
operation on your data then that can be
only done on power bi desktop it cannot
be directly implemented on power bi
dashboard okay here whatever
manipulation or in input that you
provide will be static you cannot
manipulate the Associated data to any
utilization
now finally coming back let's begin
creating our dashboard okay
so first what we'll be doing is that
we'll be creating a dashboard and the
easiest way to do that is by pinning it
to our dashboard so click on pin
visualization option here and then it's
going to prompt me whether I want to pin
it to an existing dashboard or a new
dashboard so here let me call it
dashboard life and then pin to it
same I'll pin all my visualizations to
it okay so it's given me a confirmation
okay so I've pinned the four
visualizations that we have just created
now let me go to the dashboard option
present here so every Dru port and
dashboard that you're creating will be
present under my workspace so again
usually when you're working with
different visualizations different
projects then you can create different
workspaces as well now by default you'll
have one workspace that is my workspace
here all the dashboards reports as well
as workbooks that you're uploading the
data set associated with your reports
everything would be available here so
this is what by default a dashboard
would look like now here is just a
simple overview with respect to the
visualizations that we have created and
these are some of the visualizations
that you use while you are working on a
real-world scenario but one thing what
you need to understand how a
visualization on a dashboard is
different from a visualization on the
report is that you cannot have multiple
leveled visualization present here okay
what happens when you create a multiple
level visualization definitely you can
see that on a report a report in turn
can be also distributed to someone else
you can share it across email you could
share it across cloud you can even embed
a report but on a dashboard it can just
be one single layer okay and again the
interactivity is also something that is
really helpful so if someone has the
access to view the reports as well if
they click on a visual it goes back to
the report okay let me go back to my
dashboard and here let me show you how
power bi dashboard has the natural query
solving ability so you see this ask a
question about your data so here let me
ask a question let's say which region
region has the
greatest
profit
okay so this is my query and if you see
here what Barbie has done is that it's
taken this input it's converted it to
natural language and then it's given me
my output also in a visualized form
okay this in turn makes it quite easy
for me or anyone associated to work with
this data and understand like better
inside let's say tomorrow you give you a
boss this dashboard and he feels ok
these all requirements do want give me a
complete insight or he gets a sudden
question then he can use power me a Q
and a and get this inside now power bear
in itself comes with a lot of tree build
dashboards and instances now I've
already configured my Salesforce
platform with papaya we have not created
any visualization here what I've
basically done is that I have a lot of
data present on my Salesforce platform
and once I integrate it to my power bi
then what it does is that it fetches all
that data and in turn it creates me
multiple reports and dashboards which
are based on my input data so these are
some of the most commonly used report
and dashboard associated to a Salesforce
platform so I have not created any one
of them automatically these were created
when I linked them to my partner ok now
any visualization that you click relates
you to your report as well so if you
want to see the report behind all this
just click on a visualization so a
report here that you can see is a very
more detail so it's basically a five
page report then I have my opportunities
my lead source okay now I also have my
close sales data a sales representative
data as well as my account data as well
so all this is automatically created by
power bi okay based on an existing
template of saw of Salesforce now it's
really helpful when you don't want to
invest a lot of time but you already
have your data present there and any
operation that you want to perform here
can be done now like I said if your data
is present on a cloud platform you can
definitely integrate your data and bring
it in if you want to have a constant
update with your data you can also
perform our data refresh
on that asthma we're in the data and the
visualization get updated on a real-time
basis as well so it's a really helpful
and easy-to-use - now I'm quite sure at
least some of you who are being part of
the session would go back home today
would definitely be able to try power
beer and get a good insight with respect
to it as well
