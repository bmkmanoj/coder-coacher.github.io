sure you most of you would know that PMI
is project management institute which
for from which we already have the one
of the most famous from one of the most
asked certifications PMP PMI where PMP
focuses more on the height higher level
of project management what is project
management as whole pmi-acp only focuses
on agile principle practices and tools
and techniques right it will this
certification talks from what is agile
how do you implement various methods of
agile it it gives you everything it
tells you how as a scrum masters as a as
an agile coach how you can mentor and
coach your teams and once your teams are
agile ready they start implementing a
child how you can improvise them so it
so it's it's an end-to-end certification
which we'll talk about all the
mythologies under the I'll umbrella like
scrum XP DSD em con man leaned it will
talk about all those principles and pre
mythologies it will talk about all the
frameworks which are available under
agile it will talk you how you get how
you can mentor and coach your teams it
will give you communication skills how
you can resolve the conflicts and then
once everything is in place how you
start tailoring your processes and you
improve your teams right so in pmi-acp
is a complete certification in itself so
one of the questions which i had is
after CSM should i go for pmi-acp yes
CSM is a very basic certification in my
in my in my eye because CSM only focuses
on one part of agile that scrum whereas
pmi-acp covers the bigger umbrella it
talks about everything it will talk
about lean it will talk about conv and
it will talk about scrum it will talk
about test-driven development behavior
driven development if we talk about
everything right it will
also tell you how as a coach you should
get into people come and people
management how do you tackle conflicts
but CSM does not talk about all those
things so CSM is a very basic
certification which will only talk about
scrum whereas a CP is a bigger umbrella
it will cover all the areas of agile
okay but yes pmi-acp from the agile
perspective pmi-acp is more focused
around that team level agile whereas it
will not talk about edge implementation
of agile at enterprise in a portfolio
level okay so pmi-acp is more from a
team level agile clear any questions on
this PM is a PR you clear ok let's move
on to appear for pmi-acp you need to
have 2,000 hours of journal project
experience and 1500 hours of agile
project experience so you need to
showcase total 3,500 hours of experience
out of which two thousand asked should
be journal project experience and 1500
hours should be agile project experience
you also need to have 21 pdos produces
nothing but the professional development
unit so 1p do is equal to 1 R of
training the pmi-acp certificate
training that a jew rekha provides
inside Eureka and our EP will give you
the needed one 21 oz of pd you this this
training courses for 24 hours which is
spread across eight weekends and is
almost 24 3 hours each weekend each each
day so you neyo sorry so this training
will give you the needy 21 knots and it
will talk about all the 11 13 modules
which pmi-acp has okay so also there are
11 recommended books which are given
which our list
down by PMI and they are known as
reference material so if you go go to PM
i dot o RG you can see the list of those
books but as a recommendation or as
agile coach my recommendation is if you
go through the training of edgy rica and
you just read even one book write one
book which is my Griffith it is more
than sufficient if we are very regular
with the training sessions this training
is very extensive the preserve the study
material which at Eureka offers there
are three mock tests so it is more than
enough for you to clear pmi-acp
certification and to understand agile
concepts okay and this certification is
only valid for three years after three
years you need to go through you need to
submit 30 BDUs to get this certification
renewed okay so the cost of this
certification is almost 4 $95 right and
you can appear for this certification at
any prometric center right so this
certification is only valid for three
years from 15th of July starting 15th of
July the pmi-acp exam pattern is getting
changed just in case if you are planning
to appear before it you will have to get
enrolled yourself at the currents a
batch of the pmi-acp training which is
going on post 15th of July the exam
pattern is getting changed so till 15th
our 15th of sep tember it will undergo
into a pilot pilot phase so as of now
there is no clear guidelines on what
what changes PMI is doing with our exam
pattern the currents patent which will
be valid till 15th of July is the
objective pattern for under which you
get 120 questions and only 100 questions
are marked 20 questions are the warm-up
kind of questions right so this pattern
as I'll repeat is only valid till 15th
of July as of now I do not have a clear
idea on what is the pattern a new what
would be the new pattern for that I need
some time and this pattern will be in
the pilot phase till 5th
of sep tember when you register yourself
at PMI website of PMI website there is a
good complete 45 page form so it asks
you to justify your 2015 hundred project
ours so it will ask you about the
project details company name it will ask
you about the supervisor details as well
number contact number and what did you
do in those projects so this is a
complete five page form which you have
to fill once you fill the form submit
the form it goes for review with PMI it
which is a ten to twelve they process if
there is some doubt which PMI guys have
they might take your form for the audit
where they will ask you to send the hard
copy of the of your form signed and
attested by the supervisors and the
managers name you have specified in your
reforms so please make sure whenever you
fill that form the information that is
given in form is completely legible and
completely correct so just in case if
you get it just so in case if you get
stuck at audit you are able to justify
those you don't mean need a letter till
the time you get stuck in an audit you
just need to fill the form of the form
has project name company that details
which form has complete details project
details project description managers
name and managers contact details okay
okay so one confusion I think even you
guys have that do you need to be PMP
certified or do you know if you are or
maybe you are in two minds it should you
go for PMP or pmi-acp certified ACP
certification so as I mentioned earlier
as well PMP is a broader set of broader
set which talks about the concepts of
project manager project management in
general it does not focus on any
specific terminologies like either agile
or may
be the waterfall or maybe remodel it
talks about the journal concepts of
project management so even if you are
not planning to stick to software
industry if you are not from software
industry and you are doing some kind of
project management you can still go for
PMP but pmi-acp is more from a age I'll
point of view so if you are into a
software industry and your projects are
either planning to move towards agile or
maybe you are already working in agile
you do not need to be there a project
manager or something even at development
or a testing professional can get into
pmi-acp if you don't intend to become my
childhood in this even in that case
pmi-acp a certification for you because
it will help you understand agile in a
better way and as a team member as an
individual contour individual person you
can you can contribute better right so
PMP is certification is for people who
are into hardcore project management or
who are not a deep into how teams are
performing that they are just into
stakeholder interaction and they are not
interacting with teams on the daily
basis the MP is for those people why
pmi-acp is for people who are doing both
stakeholder management and are
interacting with teams and they are
involved in day-to-day working of beans
right this is more about the in nutshell
this is the major difference between a
PMI PMP and pmi-acp I will request you
to please go through the ppt just in
case if you have any question please ask
me please go through the differences
which I listed down in the ppt though
you will also have the copy of this ppt
and also this webinar with you but just
in case if you have question please feel
free to ask me after you go through this
ppt a jamaica support will share this
ppt and the link to this video where
this webinar is stored and you guys can
see that edge rekha support
would share the link with you after the
webinar is over so there are 11
reference books which I listed down you
can go down a goat at PMI dot o RG and
go through all those books okay but one
book that I recommend is Mike Griffith
i'll just type the name for all okay
Mike Griffith is a book having said that
but you still need to have 21 p dues
even if you have read that book you
still need to have 21 pd use in or in
order to give this certification ok
let's go ahead ok so once you are
through your pmi-acp certification you
have you have registered yourself you
have applied for the date you have paid
the 495 fees of 495 dollar and you have
appeared for the exam this is a kind of
a certificate that you get from pmi-acp
all you get is you have cleared the exam
when did you clear and when it is due
for renewal the exam results are based
on the three levels of proficiency a
grow across six domains which are
defined in the pmi-acp curriculum so and
after once you are done with it you are
you would you can you are eligible for
applying for scrum master even if you
are a technical guy you are eligible for
handling the agile architectural way I
mean you would understand how as a arc
or maybe as a technical person how your
design or architectural evolves around
in agile methodologies so you would even
as a testing professional you would know
how testing should be carried out in an
agile way so after the certification all
the people from different fields would
be able to do so so as I mentioned if
you plan to go enroll through the
website of edgy rekha for the
certification you would have live and
interactive sessions from the trainer
conducted sessions would be there and
you have lifetime access to all the
training material and three mock tests
and the session tests which are given
there you have 24 by 7 or technical
support even
after the training is over if you have
any kind of doubts you can feel free to
reach out to the support team and we
will make sure that all your questions
are answered and then you again you get
your 2121 pd use in case if you are if
you have appeared for the pmi-acp
certification and you need 30 pretty use
for renewal at eureka conduct keep
conducting various webinars from which
you can get one pdu so using those pure
webinars you can earn bdus okay just in
case if you have more questions please
feel free to reach out to edge rekha and
or maybe you can connect with me my name
is Xu cheese singla you can just connect
with me over the link it in and I will
be an agitator and I will be more than
