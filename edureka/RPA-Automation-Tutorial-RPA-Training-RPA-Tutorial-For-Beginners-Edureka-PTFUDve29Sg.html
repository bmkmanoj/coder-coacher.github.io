to this session on robotic process
automation today in this session we are
going to learn about what does robotic
process automation and why it is used so
without wasting any more time let's move
on to the agenda to see what all we'll
be covering in today's session so we'll
start today's session by first
discussing why do we need our PA and
then move on to what it is exactly after
that we are going to discuss a use case
where and we'll see how RP is actually
used in the industry right after that we
are going to look at the RP 8 tools
which I used to implement the RP a
technology and towards the end we'll be
doing a small demo where then you will
get to see how RP a actually works all
right so guys this is our agenda for
today I hope it's clear to you now guess
any doubts that you have during the
session please put it down in the
comment box and my team is here to help
you out all right so let's start off
with our session with the first topic of
today's session which is why do we need
rpm all right so let's understand this
topic using an example so let's take the
example of calculating numbers all right
so before we use to calculate numbers
manually right so we used to pen down
the calculation that we had to do and we
used to do it all right but as time
progressed we came up with complex
calculations and it became very
difficult for us to do them in a very
short time right right so the time
increase and at the same time the
probability of committing errors also
increased right so this had to be solved
so in 1966 we came up with a brilliant
invention which was a calculator by
Texas Instruments so right so this
calculator we automated the task of
calculations all right so now all we had
to do was feed the family that we wanted
to calculate and we'll get the results
in microseconds all right so that's how
fast the calculator is now we as humans
we like to clip and we said ok
but we still need to feed these numbers
right and it's still a manual work we
still have to feed these numbers and
then only we will get the results so
because of this because of this thought
came our behave now what is the
difference between automation and our PA
let's give a quick look so automation
was basically where you automated the
task of calculating by the use of
calculator by inventing a technology
alright but what does our PA our PA is
basically applying a layer of robotics
on top of the invention that you have
calculated right so there is no human
involvement in our PA anymore so if you
look at it closely if you look at the
figure very closely you will understand
that the technology the underlying
technology didn't change right the
calculator is still a calculator but the
task of entering the numbers on the
calculator became automated alright so
our PA basically remains replaces humans
right so these numbers and can be these
numbers can be put inside the calculator
without any human intervention and the
bots can mimic the humans exactly as
they're told to now this is the power of
our PA guys now you'll be understanding
what I exactly mean when you see our PA
in real demo but for that time just be
patient for this session and we it'll be
clear to you towards the end of this
session all right so let's move ahead
now and understand what it is exactly
what is our PA so our PA is an acronym
acronym for robotic process automation
so let's understand these three words
one by one what is robotic so any entity
which can be programmed to mimic the
human actions is known as robotic
alright
then comes process so any sequence of
steps that can lead to a meaningful
activity is known as a process so it
could be the process of making tea
wherein you just pour some boiling water
then Tilly's and then milk so these
three steps contribute towards making of
tea alright so becomes
then comes automation so automation
basically means without human
intervention so whenever you are doing a
process without human interventions and
it is done by computers which are just
mimicking human actions it is known as
robotic process automation - so to
summarize this mimicking human behavior
to execute a sequence of steps without
human intervention is what RPA is all
about right so that is robotic process
automation now moving on let's let's
understand how RP is actually used in
the industry alright so let's take the
example of a data entry employee
alright so a data entry employees main
task is to get data from various sources
and aggregate them inside one excel file
alright this is the task that he does
every day and every task that given to
him is contributes to these steps that
have to be done so ok so when these had
to be done
this could be solved using using RPA now
how could it be solved so if it told the
computer to do these same steps one by
one and then put them inside an excel
file
it became automated alright and this is
possible using RP a not using code not
using some advanced algorithms it is
possible by a simple drag-and-drop this
is how simple it is and this can be done
and I can show you guys how it is done
today in the UI power tool that I am
that is the tool that will be using it
for the hands-on today all right now
moving on guys now we discussed that
what is RP a we discussed how it is
actually implemented in the industry
let's see what are the advantages of RP
a why are people searching for RP a
these days
alright so businesses require RPM
because of reduced costs because as you
saw in the use case you replaced a
complete human right so you don't
require that salaried employee anymore
that those tasks can be
and by our PA now so you have reduced
the costs you have improved the accuracy
because humans are tend to make errors
right and machines they don't make
errors guys they do exactly as they are
told to so it it has improved accuracy
there are no down times because it is
24/7 up and running so they don't work
in shifts it will not be like it'll work
for eight hours and then shut down it's
not like that it can work 24/7 and hence
no downtime and towards the end like I
said there is no code required to
implement up here all right it's a
simple drag-and-drop and you can do any
kind of task inside our PA which a human
would have done all right so that's how
powerful our P is now while believe me
let's let's look at some facts that
experts have to say that they will
replace the humans right so this is a
McKenzie research which was conducted
last year it says it will our PA will
have an impact of five to seven trillion
dollars by the year 2025 all right so as
you can see there's a huge market for
our PA in the world right now and by the
year 2025 which has just eight years
down the line it will have an impact of
five to seven trillion dollars all right
after that there was one more statement
that came out from McKenzie that it will
touch more than 230 million knowledge
workers that is 9 percent of the global
workforce that is there right so that
does not mean that 230 million workers
will lose their jobs that basically mean
means that to 30 million knowledge
workers might get a change in their job
profile so the kind of work that you're
doing today might get changed to
something else because that work will be
replaced by our PA and you might be
required somewhere else to do some other
tasks right so this is this is where our
PA is going to lead us guys because
everything is going to change in a
couple of years now this RP technology
guys it's it's a technology right it is
implemented using some tools all right
and these tools are available in the
market you can buy them
you can actually work on them so let's
look at these tools which are there so
the leading three tools which are there
in our PA are UI part then you have blue
prism and then you have automation
anywhere all right now these there are
many tools which implement the rpi
technology but these three tools at the
top tools which around which are out
there right now now what is the
difference between these three is this
that if you were to learn RP a if you
are a person who wants to learn RP a you
cannot do that using blue prism because
blue prism guys they don't know they
don't give any trial version for you to
practice on they are strictly for
enterprises and even the trial versions
that are there for blue prism you will
not find them on the internet you have
to request the company and if the
company feels that you are the your
prospect buyer they might give you the
software then comes automation anywhere
so automation on anywhere again guys
there is no proper defined trial version
for automation anywhere you do get a
30-day trial version if you search a
better on the Google on Google right but
there is no defined trial version for a
machine anywhere but the case with UI
parts as different uipath guys have been
very generous for this these guys they
give you a Community Edition that
basically means a free tool to practice
on as long as you want so you can go on
their website and download the uipath
tool and get on with RPM alright so
uipath is a savior in our case so today
in our session i'll be using uipath
because i know you if you guys want to
practice you will be practicing on your
ipad so we'll be using the UI power tool
and be going ahead from today's session
so let me tell you quickly how you can
install the UI power tool so first you
have to go to this following link which
is uipath comm slash community alright
you go to this link and then you will
get this screen on the screen you have
to click on get community edition
once you click there you will get this
screen where you have to fill in
registration form where you have to give
your name your email address and that is
it right so once you do that you will
click on request Community Edition and
once you click on request Community
Edition you will reach this page this
basically
thanks you for your request and then you
your download will start automatically
and if it doesn't you can click on
download it here and it will download
your file once it downloads you're fine
you will double click it and you will
get this screen so this is the
initialization screen for your iPod so
there is no Vizard which is there which
will I mean the general setup use case
very new press next and then you reach
the N screen and press finish that it's
not like that you will see the screen
and after a few moments you uipath will
be installed on your computer and the
next step would be to enter the details
as you enter on the registration page
alright so this basically activates your
RP a tool at the Community Edition
version right so you will enter the same
email address that you go that you
entered in the registration page and
click on activate and then your UI path
tool will be successfully installed you
will get this acknowledgment screen
after that and you can be assured that
your UI pod tool is ready to use alright
guys so this was it this was the process
of installing UI part now let me quickly
go to my tool and let let us start
working with the UI part now alright
I'll be quickly doing a demonstration
for you guys so what we'll be doing is
I'll show you how you can configure UI
power to work exactly as you want
alright so let me go to my UI power tool
alright so once you open your UI parts -
this is the screen that you see guys
right so once you have seen your screen
all you have to do is click on blank
alright so once you click on blank you
will be presented with the screen right
so you have to create a new project in
UI path right so to create a new project
you will type in the name of that
project which is this right and hey
create alright so once you would create
a new project will be created for you
and this is the screen where you will be
seeing your this is the workspace where
you will be designing your project now
what is the use case that I am trying to
design for you is this so what I'll be
doing is I will be going to add eureka
website which is like this I will type
in google.com on my Chrome browser
alright so this is the screen that I
will be reaching once I come on Google I
will type in and Eureka and hit enter
all right then I will click on this
particular link and once I've clicked
over there I will reach this page which
is my Eddie Aikau home screen and now I
will click here in the search box and
type in IPR PA hit enter I reached the
search results page I will click on the
our PA automation course and I'll be
able to come to my course all right so
these are the steps that one that I want
to do in my UI path tool so let's see
how we can do that how we can configure
our UI power tool do all of this in say
three four seconds alright so the first
thing that you have to do is go inside
the activities pane which is here on the
left side type in sequence I'll type it
again for you right and hit enter so
once you hit enter you will get this
activity which is basically the search
result you will drag and drop this
activity over here right so you have got
a sequence now now the next step that
you have to do if you think it logically
is to open a browser right so you all
you have to do is search over here open
browser you will get this activity drag
and drop this activity over here and you
are done
now you have to specify a URL where you
want your browser to and browse to right
so let's specify the URL as
www.google.com all right now any string
that you enter in your iPod guys has to
be
has to be there inside quotes right so
you put it inside quotes and you're done
all right so W it will go to
www.google.com now what next
next I have to like I have to write it
write something inside the search bar
right so over here I have to write
something so for that the comfort
telling computer that that go inside the
search box I have to write type into
after search for an activity called type
into alright so this is the type into
activity I'll drag and drop it over here
and done right so now I have to indicate
where that typing has to take place so I
click on indicate element inside browser
I'll specify over here that I want to
type something and it takes the
screenshot of it and understands okay I
have to type there now what do I want to
type I want to type in at Eureka all
right so once I type I do they occur I
will hit enter
all right so for hitting enter you again
have to go into your activities and
search for hotkeys right so you have an
activity called send hotkey you can
search send and you will get the
activity over here drag and drop it over
here and that is it all right now you
have to specify which key you want to
enter once you have entered your text so
I want to send the Enter key
so let me specify it here and you have
to specify where you want to send the
Enter key so let me specify it again
here all right so once it has entered at
Eureka it will come to this activity
which basically will hit enter all right
cool so once I've done that let's see
what will happen so I'll enter ID Rekha
and hit enter I will reach this page now
I'll have to click on this particular
link so let me tell my RPA tool that I
have to click on this link so I'll go
here I will type in an activity called
click alright let me drag and drop the
click activity over here
now I'll have to tell my RP a tool that
what to click right so let me click on
indicate element inside browser and I
want to click this link so let me click
on this link now and the computer
understands it that I have to click on
that link once I've done all these steps
that were done before alright so once
have clicked on this link I have to go
to my Eddy rake our website alright and
the cool thing guys about our behavior
is it will wait until all your web
elements are loaded onto the page
alright so sometimes it happens that
your internet is slow so you don't have
to worry about that RP has this built in
feature or uipath has this built-in
feature wherein it will wait until all
your webpage components are loaded and
only then it will deploy the robot onto
it to do the things alright so now what
I want to do is I want to type in for a
course right so all first I have to
click here try to type something so I'll
have to include an activity which clicks
so let me put in an element for click
and let me indicate the element where I
want to click in so this is the element
alright so now it will click on the
search bar and now I have to type there
something right so I have to search
again for an activity called type into
let me copy it here and Rob alright and
let me specify where where do I want to
type so let me specify I want to type
here and what is the thing that I want
to type I want to type RPA right so let
me give the search term which is our PA
and that is it now what I do is what I
just hit enter all right so again I have
to send an hot key so I search for hot
key and drag and drop it here indicate
where I want to send the hot key which
is here and specify the key as enter all
right sounds simple till now right now
it will go here it will type in our PA
and
hit enter all right so now it will reach
the screen so now it has to click on
this particular element so let me
specify that as well so let me search
for an activity called click right drag
and drop it here indicate the element
inside browser which is this and it will
click the element whew alright so all
this done guys nothing else has to be
configured now all you can do right now
is specify what kind of browser you want
to open alright so you'll go to your
open browser activity and inside the
open browser activity you will see
there's a properties pane on the right
side so over here it is asking us what
are the browser type so by default it's
ie you can change it to whatever browser
you want I'll change it to Chrome
alright and that is it so let's run this
sequence or a project and see if it goes
on where so I'll hit on run now it will
initialize the process it has gone to
Google it is type in AD rekha hit enter
it will go to the idea rekha link right
now the page is loading page loaded
enter RPA got into the course page
clicked on the our Pecos and it's done
so once the process has been completed
it will again come back to your UI bar
tool but if you go back and see the
browser you can see I've reached my
uipath page automatically that is the my
computer browse to this page alright so
this is they they mimic exactly what you
would have done on your computer and
that is why it is so powerful so this
was a very simple exercise guys now
imagine what you do every day on a
computer can be configured inside your
UI power tool alright so it can go
anywhere it can do anything that you
guys are doing on your computer every
day alright so this is how powerful your
RPA is alright so with that guys I will
end today's session so this was an
introductory session I hope you like
this session guys and before signing off
let me quickly show you some of the
things that we have an RPA alright so we
have a course on our PA guys if you are
