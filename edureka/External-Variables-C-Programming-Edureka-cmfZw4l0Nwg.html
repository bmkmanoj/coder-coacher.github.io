now there's a type of variable that we
haven't spoken about which is the
external variables or they also called
global variables all this while we would
declare variables within the function
main or in the factorial program we had
a variable I and a variable num within
the function factorial these are all
called automatic or internal variables
like I said automatic or internal
variables can only be seen by that
particular block or function some other
function cannot access the other
functions variables but external
variables of global variables are
different they are not declared within
any particular block or within any
particular function they are declared
along with your hash includes all your
function declarations you can declare
external variables and these variables
are global throughout the program which
means they can be accessed from anywhere
in the program let's look at an example
let's quickly write include stdio.h
let's say int main let's say I have a
variable int where equal to 20 say
printf
% HD
system pause and stern zero let's have a
dummy function let's call it void funk
so he does not return any value nor does
he accept any arguments so in this
function let's say I say we're plus
equal to 100 so I'm changing a value of
the variable Val 220 before I print
where I call the function func so if I
say F UNC funk now let's see what
happens to this program and I try to
compile it so as you can see it says in
function func that undeclared first used
in this function so he does not know the
variable Val as it has not been declared
within this function he also has another
error
this is implicit declaration of function
T cleared the function func item so I
need to declare that so when you do void
func now the variable bash has not been
declared so for the function func I need
to have another variable called where
let's call it - and I initialize it to 0
so now in this function
where is zero so when I increment it by
a hundred the value is hundred so let's
see what happens
so in Maine where is first twenty we
call the function func VAR in the
function func becomes 100 function func
returns now you print a flash
now this VAR is nothing but this
variable which was 20 initially and it's
still 20 the value of this variable has
not changed as this variable stays
within the stack space for the function
main when we call the function func
this function was added on top of the
stack and within his memory another
variable where was declared and that
memory space was used let's look at a
memory diagram again first year the
function main in which he said in 2 bar
equal to 20 somewhere in the function
main memory you're allocating some space
for the integer calling it VAT and
you've stored the number 20 next you
call the function func so you add this
time for the function func on top we
call this funk now here again you've
declared a variable called bad so in his
memory space again he's gonna allocate
space for where and here initially var
was 0 then later you incremented valve I
100 so Y becomes 100 here and finally
when this function finishes execution
this memory is all freed up and the
execution returns to main from here so
let's say we called from from here so he
X so he reaches this point and continues
execution from there so after this point
we print the value of that
so within this function main the value
of that is 20 so he's gonna print 20
isn't that simple let's look at our
program let's compile it now
there's no ahead of the warnings and you
see 20 now let's make a slight change to
this program instead of having local
variables if I had not declared Vash
he's giving a compiler error saying it's
been undeclared so I'll move both the
declarations and I'll declare it outside
any function in fash and I would say
it's equal to 20 in this case the
variable VAT is called a global or an
external variable he is not internal to
any function here so both the functions
main and the function func can use that
variable and they'll be referring to the
same variable now so let's say what
happens now we call the function func he
comes here we increment the value of the
variable var1 hundred var was 20
initially incremented by hundred become
hundred and 20 we're done now he prints
the value or the variable var as be
sharing the same variable it's a global
variable as just being shared by both
the functions its value is 120 now 320
there you go 120 so as we had seen
external variables are declared outside
of any function and they can be accessed
by any function using its name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
