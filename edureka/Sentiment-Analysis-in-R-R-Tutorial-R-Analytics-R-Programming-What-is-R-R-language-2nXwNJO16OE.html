years of experience I worked as a data
scientist and a lot of companies and I
was very much part of the sentiment
analysis which was performed in R so I'm
here to take you forward on this
I have overall 13 years of experience
just to reaffirm on that what is
sentiment analysis all about and why is
it so much required in the current world
if I were to ask you that question
what would your answers be obviously one
of your answers is the sudden burst in
the data we have this buzzword going on
which says big data there is humongous
data which is getting generated over the
Internet 80% of that information or
sorry data which is getting generated is
coming through your textual format
probably a product review social media
messages LinkedIn posts
Facebook Likes shares all this is
generating a lot of data and most of the
data is textual data and the main most
important thing is this is unstructured
data a few of you might say yes which is
grammatically the right you say a few of
your might say yup feel feel might say
why for years how should the system
recognize all these words and try to
bring about some meaningful inference
out of that absolutely gitanjali you're
right on that the better we understand
the sentiments within data we can do
better service by the seals absolutely a
few of the case studies which should be
discussed over the period of this one
hour would be taking you through the
finer nuances of few of those
both which we're looking to running this
word cloud and sentiment analysis live
on our hopefully no package got updated
since I've last ran that that's a hope
let us move forward we are going to
discuss about what is sentiment analysis
we are going to discuss about a few use
cases what are the various tools in the
market which can handle sentiment
analysis and why is are so different
these are the wages things which we are
going to discuss as part of the next one
hour meanwhile in between if you have
any doubts any questions you are free to
shoot questions I believe there was one
question around they did not duck that
but I did not get timely there was a
question already which was asked on
which one is better when it comes to
complexity either our or sass are within
our you can do a lot of programming and
our is meant to deal with complex data
it can handle better than your sense and
there are no doubts about that so
sentiment analysis is all about opinion
mining what do you mean my opinion a few
of y'all might have a positive opinion
about probably iPhone 6 a few of y'all
might have negative opinion how do I
capture all that opinion and how do we
mind that opinion and make sense out of
that right how do you extract opinions
how do we extract emotions and
sentiments from the data a few of them
might be sarcastic when they say how are
you doing when you ask a person how are
you doing you might be circling in
signal I am great but he might mean that
he is not good how do you
up with or try to segment these kind of
sarcastic words into proper buckets on
whether a person is positive or negative
as you can see the Smiley's here
emoticons and this sentiment analysis
can be used to gauge the performance of
your products of your services of your
brand's are people happy or dissatisfied
or what is going on in the market with
respect to any of these products
services or brands and here are a few
use cases of sentiment analysis it's
used in a line industry Delta is an
American airline which monitors tweets
to find out how the customers feel about
delays obviously there must be unhappy
upgrades in-flight entertainment and
more the moment people tweet for example
recently sachin tendulkar has been to us
right and then he tweeted negatively
about a specific headline not sure how
many of y'all have seen that he has gone
to play cricket all-stars cricket match
and then he has tweeted negatively
because despite seats being available on
the flight he wasn't given one so that
was his complain all about and don't
care attitude is what he has mentioned
in Twitter
that was a headlines response to him
when he tried to tweet about that or
probably discuss about this availability
on the flight right so all these kind of
negative tweets would actually help you
gauge the performance of your pilot
performance of your flight attendants
performance of the ground staff
performance of the airlines as a whole
it can be used to compare different
airlines and there are a lot of startups
which we which do this
they actually do the sentiment analysis
by collecting the data from multiple aid
lines
Twitter handles and tweeter tags and
based on that they give a score saying
that this a lines easy based this
Airlines is the worst this headlines
does a great job whenever there is a
delay this airline does a great job in
providing superior service to their
customers frequent fliers by upgrading
their by upgrading from economy to
business class mail so all those
interesting insights can be drawn from
this Macy's is a leading retail store
retail chain rather a Macy's uses
sentiment analysis as one of the way to
improve customer experience and business
growth here also there are multiple ways
right forums to capture your information
to get the feedback there are multiple
ways of getting the feedback there are a
lot of surveys which are connected right
and there are a lot of question aids
which go into this service each question
might be having hundreds of questions so
the amount of data that you capture as
part of your surveys as part of your
questionnaires as part of your Twitter
as part of your Facebook is amazing not
just that whenever you purchase a
product you can leave your review
comments then and there and the moment
you leave your review comments
it gives wealth of information for the
organizations to analyze and determine
on whether people are satisfied or
dissatisfied which product is doing well
of course there was an article which was
recently written on economists which was
speaking about falsifying your review
comments companies are hiring employees
to write paw
sweets about products bath tea of course
Amazon doesn't do that they have had a
robust audit perform and it so happened
that they are not resorting to these
kind of small practices but I believe
Yelp and a few others or resort to these
kind of practices
unfortunately huh what are the various
tools which can be used to gauge the
sentiment of the people not by talking
with them or not by looking into the
facial expressions but by looking into
the text that they have provided in
terms of reviews or tweets or comments
on social media whatever feed Salesforce
has once it's sentiment analysis
component within that which is called as
radian6 which identifies the
conversations which are going on on
social media about any specific comp
company about its own products or its
competitors they then analyze and try to
find out what are people tweeting about
and this let me yeah and this that
you're seeing right this is called as a
word cloud and this is what we are
trying we are going to do hands-on on
our and try to come up with this how
many of you were or how many of you are
aware of the Nestle incident which
happened in India is anyone aware of
that yeah Maggi incident a lot of light
content was there in that absolutely
Maggie you're right
so most of y'all are following news good
to know that supposedly there were
people tweeting about this on Twitter
supposedly people were posting about
this on social media
if sentiment analysis would have been
performed on an ongoing basis - Lee it
would have say
a lot of damage right and they could
have actually taken necessary actions
even before it has become a big news
halting the ER or hampering their sales
sorry let me close this question window
on similar lines you have this tool from
Thomson Reuters econ they also use
sentiment analysis to gain competitive
advantage who is performing better than
us who is not performing better than us
who is feeding negatively about a
different companies who is tweeting
positively all these various things do a
lot of information meaning information
meaningful information
now the list does not end because the
text analysis text mining is the
preliminary analysis which any company
which is into analytics would be
performing and this is the mass no skill
must-have skill from far for any data
scientist for anyone who is into
analytics that is how seriously this is
considered right you have social mention
swip SAS has its own sentiment analysis
too right you have IBM content
management system right wherein you have
the text analytics component once again
within that so there are a lot of tools
which are specialized in performing
textual analysis let us look into what
happens when it comes to sentiment
analysis in our
below the steps to perform sentiment
analysis first load your data set into R
then create a positive word cloud create
a negative word cloud you get these by
applying the sentiment algorithm and how
do you get these
would you get okay let me go to the
hands-on and then let me explain that
and let me come back before I show you
hands-on let me show you on how it's
going to appear I've tried to extract
review Commons for Xbox from Amazon
once I've collected all the review
comments from Amazon I felt that it was
extremely tedious for me to perform an
analysis just by reading line by line
there were thousands of lines right so
let me quickly show you one Amazon here
you go these are all the review comments
this is a review comment posted by one
person this is a review comment posted
by another person and this is a review
comment posted by some other person look
at the amount of review comments that
are available and tell me one thing how
much time would you spend if I give you
a chance to analyze this data there are
244 such pages would you even dare to
read line by line and try to come up
with interesting insights on what
features are people dissatisfied about
and what features people are satisfied
about would you be able to invest so
much of time and read 244 pages so long
and try to come up with some meaningful
inference based on that what do you
think how many days would you take one
week one day mayor would you be able to
read entire thing in one day and tell me
244 pages and tell me how many people
are speaking negatively about what
components it might take a week or more
than a week but look into the amount of
manual effort that you
going to put in maybe if you're smart
enough and fast enough probably you'll
be able to do that much faster no doubt
about that is there a question now okay
no doubt that you'll be able to do much
faster however if you do this analysis
using our yeah at least one day I agree
with you me at least one day but if you
generate this kind of a word cloud using
are the bunch of advantages that you
have are plenty for example look at this
I can quickly look into this and say
that I mean the bigger the word maximum
number of times it has been used if for
a person like I mean for a layperson who
doesn't know what X boxes you instantly
come to know that that's a gaming tool
you can also play music on that it has a
provision for USB here is USB here you
have music here yogi the bigger with the
word maximum number of times it has been
used and someone is saying speaking
about Netflix but what are they speaking
about Netflix for that you need to read
it in the context open your text file in
which you have all the review comments
and then try to make sense out of that
you can generate a positive word log and
a negative word clap now if you see
everything is positive all the words are
positive here for example someone is
saying it's silent you need to spend
some time by the way it's I mean you
should not just go by the word which is
the biggest for example like that
doesn't give you any meaningful
inference but if you spend some time you
come up with these kind of interesting
insights which say Xbox is silent Xbox
is quite here someone is saying it's
quite someone is
it's fast it should be there somewhere
here and one or a lot of people are
saying it's free of a surprise man I've
seen this but when I've read this in the
context I mean when I've done a ctrl F
and try to find this word free in the
text or in the notepad where I had all
the review comments I've seen this free
xbox live for one month now this is
important for you just this word free is
giving a different picture altogether
but if you read it in the context you
get to see that xbox live is here is
free for one month we know for a fact
that it's stylish it's compact and all
that a lot of amazing information
insight is what you can wrong and what
can you do you can probably provide this
information to Xbox manufacturers and
say that hey these are the top strengths
of Xbox so try to include these features
even in your future releases at this and
the moment you say that probably Xbox
manufacturers would say all this is fine
can you also tell us what are the
features which people dislike and that
is when you come up with a negative word
cloud and the one word which is standing
out is hard when we have read this in
the context we have seen that the
console is hard the console which is
used to play the game on which you have
the keys that's hot probably this is a
good insight for Xbox manufacturers in
their future releases maybe they want to
get rid of this hard and probably have
some kind of a soft console and every
word is everybody used here is a
negative word a few of them were
speaking about memory issues a few of
them was saying that they got defective
consoles
here we have defective someone is saying
there is memory issues so need to search
a lot to find out that where it's hiding
in this word cloud someone was saying
that there is no optical displays
someone was saying errors during game
and all that if you give this
information to the Xbox manufacturers
they would probably fix all these top
issues in your next version now does
this make sense or do you have any
doubts here I'll just pause for a minute
and ask me if you have any doubts yeah
you're right rajesh someone might say
it's hard to play xbox is not hard to
play maybe absolutely hence we do not
the zero in on sorry we do not zero in
and say that someone is saying hard so
console is hard we do a control F for
example here I do a control f and I
search for the word hard how many people
are speaking about this word hard and
then I read it in the context I read the
entire word that's called as reading in
context only if I read in context I can
conclude on what people are speaking
about and that's a very very valid thing
that you have raised so it probably it
might come in negative only because
someone is saying it's hard but only if
you read in the context you'll be able
to determine whether it's positive or
negative now can you let me know what
what is your name because it just
appears as SSN here is your question on
how to find out positive or negative
based on the English dictionary based on
the English dictionary we know for a
fact that what words are considered to
be positive what words are considered to
be negative and all that and there is a
lot of research going on on identify
which word is more negative which word
is more positive than a positive word
and all that a lot of work is going on
on the natural language processing print
any other questions at this point of
time I would like to take those before I
proceed further there are algorithms
this analysis question is there any
logic in determining what is a positive
word and what is a negative word there
is an algorithm for that you need to
write a code in our there are inbuilt
packages and functions which will help
you accomplish that I mean that
obviously I cannot do a deep dive in
that at this point of time because it
will take a lot of time nevertheless I
see that there are not many questions
coming in so let us do this so these are
the packages that you need to install
before you do a word cloud right within
our people who are aware about our this
might be sounding familiar for you all
so let me run it line by line and see
where we have the problem this is NLP
there you have a Java oh my god sorry
for that I have to reinstall our Java
let me see whether it's going to operate
well or not without that or yeah it's
dependent on Java once again again is
dependent on Java so I'm a little
skeptical now on how it's going to work
just in its English dictionary
how does it differentiate positive with
negative from dictionary hate I say hate
is it positive
negative jet in this satisfied is that
positive or negative
everyone would say that and if you say
you're angry
what does it notify reading along with
context means do we read all the word
which has come in a cloud rajesh says no
when I say read in the context you would
not read each and every word which is
appearing here only those words which
have been used maximum number of times
would appear with a bigger font and that
is a word which you need to read in
context if you say I'm not satisfied
it would probably classify as a positive
word and then you need to read it in
context so reading in context means go
to your raw data do a ctrl F and try to
find out that word satisfying and if
someone is saying they're not satisfied
that means it has to be a pause sorry a
negative thing so Jatin has this
question how does a computer know if
it's definition for a positive sentiment
or negative sentiment dictionary does
not give any context for I didn't think
Cindy it is going to do a positive word
cloud and a negative word cloud from
this positive or negative word cloud you
have to make sense your word cloud will
only say that this word silent has been
used maximum number of times this word
quite has been used maximum number of
times the word excellent has been used
maximum number of times now you need to
read that in the context quiter has been
used maximum number of times read it in
the context someone might say it is not
good they might have used not when you
read it in the context you'll come to
know that someone is saying it's not
good but this word cloud is
just saying you that rather than read
line by line this entire information
which is available quickly look into the
word cloud look into the words which
have been used maximum number of times
which is bigger and then analyze these
words further getting me getting me here
says by only seeing the font size or any
other measurement is there like hundred
times absolutely just in your right
so the algorithm cannot identify
sentiment but just classifies the
sentence based on the pre-existing word
clouds if you are doing a unigram if you
do by graph this is all called as
unigram one word word cloud if you do by
Graham two words then you'll come to
know it's not quite it's not fast if
someone is using that since you get to
know that when you use a bigram in that
way you can have multi grammar you can
have a trigram
and all that in that word quickly you'll
come to know on what's going on but
there's a lot of research going on in
the natural language processing and
there are a lot of complex algorithms
which does even this job for you on
which word is more negative and all that
ok mayor asked this question by only
seeing the font size or is there any
other measurement like hundred times you
can specify in your code itself which
says show me only those words in my word
cloud which has been used more than
eighty times or more than hundred times
you can specify that mirror and there
are a lot of complex algorithms friend
this is only term frequency that I'm
speaking about how many times the word
has been used there is something called
as term frequency inverse document
frequency what does that mean if I'm
ravine if I'm reviewing review comments
about X Box obviously the word X Box
would have been used maximum number of
times that doesn't mean the vertex box
should appear there right if I'm going
to review say for example Nokia Lumia
that doesn't mean the word nokia lumia
should appear Mike as a bigger word it
doesn't make sense
Shrinivas has this question can't get
the word we said a positive word and
check if it's negative yeah that's what
is a bigram Alba SSN has this question
to find chromatic graph than easy fine I
didn't get you sorry can you rephrase
that yeah absolutely
I am with you in saying that silent can
be used in positive or negative sense
silent might mean your Xbox is silent or
someone might say it's not silent the
only thing that I'm telling you is it
will not do you 100 percent of things if
you are assuming that 100 percent of
things should be done for example read
the entire sentence then decide on
whether it's positive thing or negative
thing then no that doesn't happen it
neat it requires some intervention from
humans and that is where your data
scientists are required that is the
reason why data scientists as a
proficient cannot be automated jetan has
this question how how does classify the
negativity of the words for example one
word may be higher on the negativity
scale than another yeah this is also
considered taken care by your algorithm
itself which word is more negative than
the other word once we deep dive into
text mining right you will understand a
lot of the finer nuances there are a lot
of enhancements they enhance algorithms
available and this is something which is
readily available nor you can use that
within our it identifies on which word
is more negative than which word
polarity is what we call that it's
happening as we speak now any other
questions are on this is everyone ok
Jatin is that ok I'm demonstrating it
using everything using what sentence
jetan it's a bigger algorithm and
probably
would not be feasible to show you the
entire enhanced algorithms also as part
of this session but I'm going to run
through this code just try to make sense
out of this if you can right so these
are the various packages which we need
to install and I'm going to load another
our file which has a lot of text
functions which have been written load
this text functions now I'm going to
read a file as an input and just going
to show you how to generate word cloud
okay so just bear with me on that stop
words let me show you the head of the
stop words these are the stop words oh
sorry this is a file which is Amazon
Nokia Lumia reviews that have been
loaded into our and now I'm I've written
a very elaborate code of course the code
would not be shared with you now I need
to load the stop words what are the stop
words a the right and let me show you
that that would make motions these are
the words which are called as stop words
which I just used to connect two
different alphabets two different words
and these are the words which are used
you see your English the TM package has
another word list there so you can use
that right I'm combining these two and
then I'm trying to get this let me show
you the head of the stop birds these are
the stop words wherever these words are
there in your analysis in your raw data
they will be excluded from your word
clock generation
and then you need to cleanse the data
what do you mean by cleansing the data
you remove the stop words right and then
you are going to create a term matrix
please do not get into the finer nuances
of the code just try to understand that
these are the radius things which are
possible right as part of the analysis
forget about the errors those would not
impact us in any way then let me have a
new window let me have frequency
associated with that I think because of
the our Java it's not running let me see
whether term document English document
frequency is going to work the tm-2 is
not there window your work loud title
there alright that's okay that's okay
because our Java is not installed that's
the reason probably it's throwing that
error but look at this this is what
polarity means right which word is
having average polarity which word is
more positive than the other positive
words which words are more negative than
other words right all this can be
printed using this analysis let me
quickly check on whether you can get
this or not
Oh everything is pertaining to that
package right because of java package
there are a lot of additional packages
which were not installed but just give
me two minutes
let me pull up an interesting document
or analysis which i've performed and let
me show you that document just give me a
moment meanwhile shoot out your
questions i see that someone has raised
the hand Habiba do you have any
questions just give me one
more minute I'm almost there
because a lot of y'all was saying about
negative words positive words a word
used in a negative sense and all that so
let me actually show you one such key
study which I've been part of and then
it might make more sense for you so this
is a clinical trial data what do you
mean by this online r2r available like
pass yeah our tool is available online
it's free for installation now if you
see this this is a word cloud which I've
generated using the clinical trials data
and here these words were standing out
accrual enrollment low slow lack all
these are the single words here you see
safety but when I look into these words
as standalone words it wasn't making a
lot of sense for me because these are
the standalone words I do not know
whether there was low accrual low
enrollment because low and enrollment of
different words but when I've used this
in conjunction with the cluster
dendrogram it was making sense this is a
cluster terminated because of slow
enrollment slow accrual now it was
making sense for me that hey this
enrollment is slow enrollment dark role
here is slow accrual using this Indra
Graham but using only word cloud this is
what I was speaking about this is called
as by Graham you see low enrollment slow
enrollment slow accrual low accrual
right study terminated now it's making
sense that these are the words which
have been used also have supported that
using the semantic network if two words
are used together for example you see
your safety and concerns
that means these two words were used
together and here also there is that
word called safety concerns and when
I've read this in context it show
happened that people were saying that
there are no safety concerns getting me
so stand alone words as ease will not
help you we require people with business
knowledge we need to read this in
context only then comment about that
right so these kind of interesting
things can be brought about instead of
by graham you can do trigram you can do
multi gram yeah
don t there would be a recording share
this is called as a elbow plot or the
scree plot now rather than looking into
the entire document and trying to
generate a single word cloud we can do
clustering right we can group Related
reviews together and that is where you
use this screen and wherever there is a
steep bend here there is a steep bin
wherever there is a steep Bend you have
to select those many clusters but when
I've done it using four clusters I
wasn't getting any meaningful clusters
hence I have done it using two clusters
here also I see that there's a bed but
though there is not a steep band there
is a band and these are the two clusters
right I have generated two clusters so
this is the word plot for the cluster
one and the associated dendrogram is
there now if you notice closely this
dendrogram shows this word accrual
enrollment slow right these are the
radius
words which are popping up from this
word cloud so probably you can say that
this entire cluster is speaking about
something related to the number of
patients using the study or clinical
trial this might be the team for this
particular cluster and there's a word
cloud done for the second cluster and
here most of the words if you study
clearly it speaks about premature
closure of clinical trials so you can
have a team for the second cluster which
says premature closure of clinical
trials and you can also second your
thoughts by using the cluster dendogram
if you see these four words form a
cluster low accrual closed because of
safety reasons whatever be it right in
the same sense if you look into this
probably poor funding these two words to
form a cluster because of poor funding
probably there was some kind of a
termination which happened
right accrual was due to slow enrollment
this forms a cluster so you can make
some sense out of that so in this way
you can complement your word cloud with
a dendrogram or a semantic Network and
try to make more sense out of your data
now this might answer questions of most
of you folks right because most of y'all
was saying that what if it's not used in
the context what if someone was saying
funding but I'm not sure what funding is
hence if you do our diagram
it says lack of funding now this makes
sense rather than using a unigram it's
very very exploratory exercise text
mining do a single word cloud try to
bring about meaningful inferences
complement it with a dendrogram
if that makes sense alright or try to do
a bigram try to complement it with a
semantic network try to see whether you
are getting any meaningful business
inference and rather than using
everything together it makes sense for
us to cluster all group related ideas
together and then perform a word cloud
on top of that once again you second
your thoughts using your dendrogram here
also you do the scene Jatin asked this
question are the work loss available
online what do you mean by that Jatin
are you saying that are there any online
tools available to generate the word
clouds yeah there are a lot of tools if
that's a question there are a lot of
free tools available online pre-existing
data set of positive and negative word
clouds from dictionary there must be
jetan there must be a lot of
documentation available online if you do
a google search you will find the list
of stop words Shiva such as if suppose
you are referring to this sentence right
from this are and these are all the
words which I do not want in my analysis
yeah you can download you you'll easily
get that list stop words list from
online so Shiva says do we need
statistical background for analyzing yes
sheeni was we need statistical analysis
a background because our code wasn't
working otherwise I would have shown you
that not working in a sense I haven't
installed latest Java now it will take
some time for me to install that and so
I'm not showing that but anyways the
underlying intuition is explained using
this case study additional case study
yeah you require statistical background
because sometimes you might want to look
into the log transformation of the
values sometimes you want to look into
term frequency inverse document
frequency there a lot of variants to the
Al Gore
for generating work loud jetan says each
word has an Associated dendrogram or is
it optional for few words no it's only
for those words which have been used
frequently absolutely Krishna this is a
complete process of sentiment analysis
that I've shown you now of course during
the actual training there will be a lot
more explained to you all and here is
the information about that so just go to
triple w dot a Eureka dot ku and look
into this course which is master data
analytics with R as part of this we do a
deep dive on understanding what do we
mean by term frequency what do we mean
by term frequency inverse document
frequency right what are the variants of
the algorithms to generate the word
cloud how to determine which word is
more positive than the other word how to
determine which word is more negative
yeah all that code etc will be explained
to you as part of this program and we
have a batch which is starting on 30th
of November and there are a lot of other
programs also a director has launched
spark and skaila which are doing the
rounds now across the globe and these
are the various techniques which are
going to learn as part of mastering data
analytics you'll learn about k-means
clustering random forest sentiment
analysis with r and all that this
session is lively instructor-led
which will be for 24 hours in addition
to that you would be provided 30 hours
of assignment and 25 hours of project
work the good part is you'll have
lifetime access to LMS and 24/7 support
