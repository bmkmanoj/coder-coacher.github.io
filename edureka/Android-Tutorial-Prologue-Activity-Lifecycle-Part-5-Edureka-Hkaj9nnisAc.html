has a lifecycle which has a starting
phase a running state apostate a stop
state and a destroyed state so if I talk
about the activity in terms of Android
this is the starting phase as you can
see here I'll just use the spotlight
here this is the starting phase of the
activity which starts with the oncreate
method which in turns calls the ons on
start method and then the activity is
said to be in the running state so if I
take an example of the last activity
that I showed which was the login to
Facebook activity at this moment of time
this activity is in the running state
but then what what will happen if this
activity is in the running State instead
suddenly a call comes up in this
particular frame what happen is if the
call comes up on the activity it goes
into the paused state because the call
has always a higher precedence than the
activity so you need to pick up the call
so by the time the call is coming up and
you are talking on the call and you
finish the call this activity is said to
be in the posted as soon as you finish
up the call or you remove the call then
this activity enters into the onresume
state or and it again becomes running at
any point of time when the Android
system feels that the activity is not
worthwhile using or has lost focus an
activity is not visible to the users as
I talked about say if I have an
application that makes use of certain
activities
I cannot have all the ten activities on
top of the screen every now every let
say any instance of time alright so I
will be having one active or one running
activity at any point of time so in this
case the throught law the left over main
activities are said to be in the stop
state let it depends on the Android
resource allocator how he wants to wipe
off these activities like at my daeun is
there might be an instance well where
eight activities might have been stopped
and the ninth month would would have
been just running in the
so this is how the Android system deals
with the attribute and finally the
activity is going to the destroyed mode
but there's one more I had left over two
methods here on restore instant state
and on save instance state at any point
of time if I try to switch my
orientation of the device say I am using
the device on the portrait orientation
and I change the orientation to the say
landscape mode at this particular moment
of time what happens is it starts with
the starting it gets running then it
goes into this top state and then again
starts running which happens with the on
restart method so during this moment of
time I need to save all the data that
was filled in if I take an example of
the login activity
I might have key in the username I might
have gained kid in the password so as
soon as I change the orientation I need
to have these fields filled so I use the
on restore instant state or on save
instant state in this particular
scenarios is this clear to everyone you
can try it on the chat window if
activity lifecycle is Creole cleared
welcome because this is very important
when when I talk about activities the
managing of the activity lifecycle is
very important okay they want me to I
think these students want me to take it
again so I'll take it again an activity
lies like every human being has a life
cycle an activity 2 has a life cycle
which has a starting state when I create
an activity I call it in the starting
state but when my activity is visible to
the user it is sent to be in this
running state at any point of time
suppose I am in fromyou looking at the
activity and suddenly a call comes up in
this particular state the activity will
move into the paused state because it
does not interact with the user at this
point of time and the activity moves
into the posited as soon as I finish up
with my call
I again resume the activity and this
again starts running
at any point of time where the system
wants to free up the memory suppose I am
I'm creating an application when and I
have created five activities at any
point of time only one activity is
visible to the user or said to be in the
running state so the rest four
activities should can be stopped by this
Android resource allocator and then
further destroyed so I have a question
which says they could not understand
this save instance state so if I talk
about the same instance state I told you
suppose my device is in the portrait
mode and I have some field and some
values in the Edit Baxter's text boxes
now I change the orientation of the
device so I need those values to be
persisted with the change in the
orientation so that is where I use the
on resources listed and on same instance
state so these are how I'm using it is
this clear to everyone now the activity
lifecycle you can try it on the chat
window quickly so that I can move with
the rest of the slides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
