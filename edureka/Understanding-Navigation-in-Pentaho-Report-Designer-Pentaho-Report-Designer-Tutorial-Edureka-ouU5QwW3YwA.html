reporting wizard now we will dive deeper
and start with our new empty report so
let's how do you go to new report so one
option is from welcome screen you can
click on new report that will take you
to empty report window or is you can
click on new control n so it will create
empty report and the canvas is of yours
whichever you want you can put elements
so let's so now this new report is open
you can see in the center can was page
header report header details are there
and the report is empty on the top you
can see main toolbar be little mental
were there are toolbars sorry on menu
bar below menu bar there is toolbar and
this arrow Green Arrow you can see which
is typically used to run execute the
report not only report this is standard
across all Penta her tools to execute
your data integration job transformation
again the same similar type of button
will be there on that you I you have to
use it to execute rest of the tools as
and when we are working on the example
you will be found getting familiar with
below the toolbar there is tabulated
view as you can see there are two tabs
open untitled report and untitled report
one if the report name is same then it
will keep appending 1234 chronological
order
then on the left side you can see the
palette of elements so these elements
you can drag and talk on your report
reporting canvas depending on your
requirement you can put it appropriately
in respective band whether it is page
header element or reporting either
header element or it can be component of
details like chart so depending on that
you were to put it in the appropriate
bucket appropriate band so there are a
bunch of pallets available you can see
it on the left side then you can see
this wherever this red border outline is
there that is the portion that
particular slide is explaining so just
focus on that red bordered portion now
this particular slide is depicting the
canvas report workspace where that work
space is divided into bands and you can
have you can add your custom band as
well so within details you can add your
beds so band one band to band thing and
within that band then why why to add
band because one band you can assign one
layout type so that is why you may need
adding band on the right side you can
see this two tabs structure and tab
structure and data structure pen is used
to show exact hierarchy included in the
report and data tab contains data
related information like what data sets
you are using then what are the
environmental variables in if it is data
set has query then you you will double
click on that and it will open that
query as well at the bottom you can see
style and attribute two tabs style as
name says you can configure formats
style sheets on the right side another
one is attribute attribute used to
configure data mapping
so if you want to connect that
particular field with proper data which
is coming from data tab then this this
particular attributes will be used other
than data you can also configure styles
like you can assign style class which is
not available in style tab so few
configuration are available in
attributes tab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
