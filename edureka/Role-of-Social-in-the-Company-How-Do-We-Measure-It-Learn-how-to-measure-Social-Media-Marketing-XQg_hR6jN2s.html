economist whatever that means we deal
with numbers right so you can imagine
that when you get an economist dealing
with social media there's some finance
and data going going on and actually
along my 15 years of career I have work
in several roles so I started my career
in management accounting so I'm burst in
finances but at the same time I had to
train myself in marketing and strategy
because I was working as a senior
manager in an industrial company so when
I started working as a consultant years
later I actually realized that companies
do not understand the value of data on
how to really analyze that really good
mind they have they have gold and they
don't know that's why us electro years
after my career as a consultant I just
decided to start training about the
benefits of having a good knowledge of
your data can bring you today we are
going to be standing or trying to learn
what is this about social media are Y or
return on investment what it means for
the company via social and how can we
measure this return to the company so
what we going to be seeing during this
next alpha nova
is the Rose chlamydia then we will try
to understand it and we will need to go
through the concept of conversion how
important a CRM and sales for conversion
is for actually having returned from our
social activities and then we will see
how not only conversion is paramount to
make a return to gain a return to obtain
plus gate from social media but as well
how cost savings are important so if
everyone is ready let's start with that
because it's going to be half an hour of
really compressed knowledge now I don't
know you know much about the strategy
about how things work inside a company
but you should if you are in marketing
you should know everything a lot of
company if you are in finance you should
know what instead company if you are in
data analysis if you are a business
analyst if you are in communications PR
even if you are in production warehouse
you all have to know how a company makes
money it's very important otherwise your
CEO the company owners the shareholders
are not going to do making the most of
social media according to the theory of
value chain with functioning the company
has to add value to increase the value
of the organization so how best to be
able to create value if you know how is
your
role within the organization and that's
why when I see someone asking me how can
i generate value using social media the
first advice I give is get to know your
company so this model it's from Michael
Porter and he was actually dividing the
dividing the company operations into two
different sets of value or two
activities the primary where the email
logistics operations are good outbound
logistics marketing and sales and
service and then you have like secondary
or support activities which we consider
those summarized into the firm
infrastructure human resources
technology and procurement now if you
manage to embed social media within
every function in the company then you
might be able to leverage the brand's
value and finally increase the company's
profitability for instance McKinsey &amp;amp;
Company which is one of the biggest and
most important productivity consulting
companies in the world publisher
research in 2010 and they were
considering three main benefits that you
could get from using social media within
your organization notice that at the
time we were still talking about web 2.0
that nowadays it's kind of a dated
concept and we have evolved towards a
more social consideration of activities
so no one
uses or almost no one uses nowadays web
2.0 but my kings and company were still
using this in 2010 it's five years ago
however the three main benefits they are
still present like internal improvements
so better access to knowledge cost
savings and communication or innovation
better customer service which is dealing
with your customer base that will
improve marketing effectiveness customer
satisfaction and we'll reviews the
support costs and finally they were
accounting for improvements in the
relationship with third parties like
partners notice that the three this main
three benefits are all about
relationship and maybe you were thinking
that would only allow you to improve
customer satisfaction well even
internally let's think of how you work
together between departments between
different branches a multinational
company that its operating in several
countries social media can be really
used as well internally to improve the
efficiency of the organization the
problem and this is sad is that
companies are not always embracing this
holistic approach and they just focus on
front of these functions like marketing
and communication so if you want to
become an evangelist of social media and
reorganization you should actually start
using it internally and you should
actually start to spread the word that
social media can improve your internal
communication
so from the external perspective I guess
that you will know tata docomo which is
an indian telecom company but acts a lot
in the social media when years ago they
decided to launch the brand they wanted
to convert the first users in advocates
of the brand I mean that's the aim of
any brand that launches in social media
and we will see later it's part of the
sales funnel really further he wanted to
use social media to solve problems and
issues they wanted to gather ideas where
like preferences under customer or users
they wanted to know with new services
they could launch but at the same time
they wanted to increase the loyalty
through high engagement they wanted to
create personal relationship with the
users and I have to say that it's been a
good success between the young users
years ago for instance i went to social
mention calm and cloud calm and i
managed to get the following indicators
or KPIs keep four months indicators
about tata docomo brands its strength of
the brand was one percent that may seem
low however the sentiment it was off for
every one negative comment in social
media the brand had 12 positive comments
so that reflects how well they were
doing to get into their user base how
their users we're actually saying good
things about them
the passion level it was fifty two
percent the reach of the brandy was
sixteen percent and the cloud index it
was 82 notice this goes up to 100
currently this cloud indicator for tata
docomo just in case you are checking
online it's 81 but you know if you are
aware of how cloud measures the brand
karma it may change from one day to the
other now what tata docomo tried after
getting these very good indicators was
well increase sales and the link now we
have a good grant let's get a return on
it and that's what every brand should
aim from social media the broadcast is
now starting all attendees are in
listen-only mode social media at the end
it was it is a matter of getting more
business and getting a financial return
so if you have understood that social
media is a very important part of the
company now you have to understand that
these roles of management will have to
be covered by people developing those
functions and you might have heard a lot
about the social media strategies the
community manager social media manager
maybe you don't have very clear what
these people or these functions have to
do within the company well the social
media strategist should develop a
strategic role and if to plan actions
with a long-term horizon I mean social
media it's not something that you can
start using today
a and then abandon the following day and
then you start moaning that you haven't
had a result it will have results if any
in the longer term it needs an
investment of time and resources
including human resources so if your
boss or your client is saying oh I want
results tangible results in a week or a
couple of weeks well the first thing
that you should advise them it's very
difficult to achieve so the social media
strategies we work in a long-term
horizon and this person shouldn't
understand business I mean if the social
media strategies doesn't understand the
global strategy of the company then it's
nothing to do social media strategy has
to work together with the corporate
strategy and that means that this person
will have to work very closely with
senior managers including the financial
manager however the community manager or
community managers in bigger companies
you might have a bigger a bigger team
it's an operational role right so it's
the person or people that will develop
the activities that the social media
strategist has developed let's call it
that way the social media strategist is
the planner is the general on the
community manager is a soul here
so these are guys my advice is
understand what a social media
strategies is what a community manager
is what they do what are the roles which
are the different orientations and then
you will start understanding that they
need different metrics to monitor the
results at the same time they will use
different monitoring frequency you are a
social media strategies you better take
monthly or quarterly reports however if
you are a community manager you
depending on the activity of the company
and the community you might need to
monitor daily or even early the tools
will be different as well however if you
want to talk strategy and you want to
talk money you need to understand what
return on investment is ROI means return
on investment and eat the main financial
concept that you will ever see because
it's measuring the net profit that a
company project or campaign is
generating in comparison with invested
costs some people will call it
profitability right and you will always
see it expressed as a percentage
actually it's a percentage that
indicates the net profit that has
generated the activity has generated
from every invested dollar so
if you know what the return on
investment is on your campaign you will
understand if that campaign have been
successful because if our Y is positive
if that will mean that there are more
benefits and costs however if it's
negative that means that you have lost
money but at the same time you know that
if you have two different campaigns
those campaigns with higher ROI will be
more successful because they have more
money generated for every dollar that
you have invested so you can imagine how
important this is if you have three
different campaigns running at the same
time and you know the ROI of three to
three of them you know which one is the
best campaign because will be the one
with the highest ROI but at the same
time if you have different campaigns
which are no social because our why it's
nothing to do specifically with social
video I mean marketing traditional
marketing has been using our Y for a
while actually we call it ro IM return
on investment on marketing activities so
let's say that you have the return on
investment of a TV ad and you want to
compare that TV ad with another campaign
well you can because both our wise are
comparable you have to invested five
thousand dollars in your facebook
campaign and you got 5% ry then you
invested five trust in dollars in your
TV ads and you got three percent ry well
Facebook was more profitable you see
actually I'm not
it's always doing this type of activity
and that's why until not very recently
they didn't start play paying for TV ads
because they need some testing because
you can do a be testing as well on
special media and in marketing even in
traditional one and they found out that
it wasn't as profitable as they were
expecting that's why amazon doesn't make
or doesn't invest that much in TV ads
very little really so how can we
understand the company's strategy
because at the moment we have understood
that we need people running social media
strategy running the activities on the
day-to-day we have understood that we
need to learn about color / corporation
SATA G but how well I i'm going to
advise you to learn about the balanced
scorecard because it's great to monitor
the strategy what is the ass it divides
the strategy in force for perspectives
learning and innovation internal
processes customers and finances and all
four perspectives are interlinked so if
you improve any of the areas there will
be a knockout effect on the rest of
areas let's see with an example let's
see that you are improving the learning
of new technologies will increase the
inversion in hardware the investment in
hardware in your in your company you are
improving the learning and growth
perspective but that will improve your
service efficiency which is an internal
process well we all know that service
efficiency improvements will improve
customer satisfaction which it's a
customer
spective well now you tell me that
customer satisfaction will not increase
income and profitability in the company
which is the financial result or
perspective so what we have had is that
learning new technologies and or
increasing the investment in hardware
has increased our turn old man our
profitability now let's think we were
talking before about the value chain so
if we learn how our value chain works
how our strategy works and we can do
that with the balanced scorecard and we
embed social media within these two
structures we can learn how to add value
to our company how to at the end final
target make more money obviously the
financial manager or the CFO the chief
financial officer will ask you for one
value which is return on investment so
the first thing that you will start
looking at is benefits and some of the
benefits of social media is getting more
conversions and you may be thinking what
a conversion is if you are not into
marketing you might not know it but a
conversion is when the consumer has
known about your proverb and ends up
doing something about it like buying it
right now a lot of people say that
conversions in in the age of social
media have changed a lot that the cycles
are different well I don't think so I
just think that social media has just
contributed to make this relationship
more dynamic unstable
however monitoring and reacting it's now
better so yes the environment with
social media for selling it's now more
difficult but if you make a mistake you
can amend it quickly R so if you want to
learn about conversions that's my other
buys learn about the ida model i write
an acronym and it's from awareness
interest desire and action plus advocacy
and these are the different perspectives
of the different stages that a customer
will go through they learn about your
brand they are made aware then they are
interested in your brand they desire it
and finally hopefully they will buy it
obviously not everyone that knows about
your brand will buy it and that's why
that funnel-shaped because a lot of
people at the end but really very feel
at the bottom now you should make
yourself this question can you use
social media to get more people aware
interested desiring your brand and
finally buying your product well
companies like SI p thought the same SLP
is a company that i would say it's one
of the biggest sellers of erp erp it's a
software which is enterprise resource
planning his management software and
they wanted to use social media to
increase their conversions so what they
did they focus in facebook twitter and
england
they ended up closing 24 accounts after
a restructuring and they kept for
facebook accounts for Twitter accounts
and two ling-ling accounts and they work
on a plan to grow critical mass for
creating a community well they amassed
ninety-five thousand followers in 11
months right on one of the account ASAP
Latin America for example ranked 19th in
followers and engagements they had a
17-percent interaction rate with an
increase of 25% in subscribers and they
actually never measure ROI at this stage
but they know that this campaign is
speeded up the process of sales
conversion that is from when someone
discovered the brand until they decided
to subscribe they actually spend less
time so they managed to increase the
speed at which sales were closed then in
consumer packaged products toblerone a
it's a well-known chocolate brown from
craft and in philippines they try to
link the concept of gratitude to the
brand it's like you want to express
gratitude you have to actually give
Toblerone a right and it seems that they
were really successful because they
managed to increase sales by 132 percent
that's what i call our wine right
because they increase sales by that much
another brand that managed to get a lot
of conversions it was just in birds they
invested hundred and twenty thousand
dollars for a campaign in facebook
twitter myspace and bleep God FM and
they exceeded the sales started by
thirty percent and guess what social
media attracted like ninety-five percent
of the total sales so quite good
campaign then another brand that did
well using a YouTube campaign it
Blendtec I mean you can you can search
on youtube Blendtec and you will see a
massive amount of videos they started
with just a budget of fifty dollars
right and what they do is they show how
powerful the blender is just by blending
you know everything and these are the
guys that are blending iPads well they
multiplied sales by five and they
launched a new merchandising line of
products so they increase sales overall
so what are these companies really
measuring or what do you want to measure
if you want to know your ROI well you
need your benefits and you need your
costs so you're investing thousand
pounds in a campaign that allows you to
gain 1,500 in profits well 100 500 minus
thousand that's inept $500 / 1000 that
you invested then multiply that by 100
well you got an roi or fifty percent now
this is just a calculation that I just
made that obviously with all these
figures being so strategic very few
companies are actually releasing
how much are they making from social so
what I say always is you need to
experiment you need to test you need to
measure and then adapt and change your
strategies to make the most from your
money so what should you measure in cost
you have your personal cost you have
your technology costs and you'll have
all the costs like design computer
programming your ad works contains
facebook ads okay that's easy your
problems may we are measuring conversion
cost savings and branding so maybe you
are willing to know which is your
conversion benefit and here the problem
is no how many you convert it well I
know of some techniques to measure
conversions at the moment just keep the
advice you need to be good at tracking
unless you want to crunch numbers using
statistical techniques you are going to
be very good at tracking you know like
what would you would do in an e-commerce
but you are tracking where your
conversions came from that kind of thing
then which is the percentage or how many
of the visits you convert it times the
customer lifetime value and this is a
very important kpi a very important
metric because you are not making money
only in the for sale if you manage to
get that customer to buy from you time
and again the value of the customer is
even higher the thing of coca-cola's for
instance and you could get
calculation that may be two thousand
dollars in what a customer from
coca-cola is and that's all but if this
person will be drinking in coca-cola
every every time you know it's a long
its life as a consumer in my be spending
that or a General Motors customer that
General Motors good value in three
hundred and forty thousand dollars
because usually if you buy one journal
motors car when that one runs out then
you have to buy another one you might be
buying another General Motors car well
that's the idea behind CLV or you might
be looking at media equivalent value
with it when you are saving in
advertising and promotion because you
are not paying for social media beware
because if you are paying for your
facebook ads that's not a cost-saving
what I'm saying is you post the link in
Twitter and someone finds about you
because of that link so how can you
estimate this cost saving well media
equivalent value could be calculated by
a theoretical CPM CPC and CTA so get all
those estimate your number of
impressions your clicks and your total
leads that have come from social media
and here you are you can calculate your
media equivalent value or you can save
money right for being improving your
customer satisfaction lenovo which is a
computer company managed to reduce by
twenty percent the number of phone calls
it increased the productivity of there
with agents I eat reduce the resolution
cycle measured in days at the end that's
not only saving money in the call center
but at the same time is improving
customer satisfaction the same thing
with the carphone warehouse a UK company
it's receiving about 8,200 tweets per
week and thanks to how it's dealing with
its customers using Twitter it improved
the brand sentiment and has reviews the
resolution cycle which again it's
increasing customer satisfaction and you
are you thinking how can we actually
measure the cost reduction in customer
service well an American company pitney
bowes by setting a social media way of
dealing with customers managed to reduce
call center calls by thirty thirty
thousand per quarter they estimate that
every call is costing them tempah ten
dollars so they saved per quarter three
hundred thousand dollars there you are
that gives you Roy or Infusionsoft a
company that is a CRM an e-commerce and
sales optimization and they use social
media for informing the customers about
update news well at the beginning they
were having one agent where each 55
customers now they managed to triple
that and every agent it's capable of
dealing with 172 so not bad or you could
get cost savings as well by generating
content you might have heard about
user-generated content and these are
launched in Mexico our campaign which
managed to get 350 and 55 new facebook
fans 64 new videos and almost
twenty-nine thousand people voted but
the good thing about the campaign is
that visa payments that's a credit card
increase by nineteen percent during the
campaign which it's a very good thing
for visa since it generated more
business or you could get cost savings
from online reputation I don't drink
bourbon that's period but in America
maker's mark seems to be a very
important brand and they actually made a
mistake and they decided to water down
its main product I mean makey they
wanted to make it less pure what
happened social media was a revolution
every consumer was really angry about
the decision and they went to social
channels to complain about hopefully the
company was listening they reacted and
they revolt a decision you know even
what happen is sales improved by
forty-four percent on the Prophet
improved by forty five percent so that's
why people and companies and brands
should be listening to what the users
and consumers are saying in social media
in 1985 when coca-cola made a similar
mistake with new coke it took the months
to react and millions of dollars in lost
sales so maker's mark by using social
media and listening to it managed to
avoid a catastrophe now how do you
measure the strength of your brand
that's another thing to take into
consideration
so we have gone through different ways
of acquiring benefits we have got
conversions or sales conversions we have
gone through cost savings from user
generated content from brand implant
improvement we have gone through call
centers savings so basically that would
be the main important ways of getting
benefits from social media so any
questions well if there are no more
questions then going to thank you for
having listened to this webinar and
please note you can actually have a look
to the different courses that that we
are offering that my actually let you
advance into the different concepts that
we have been talking today thank you
very much have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
