Rekha today we will learn how to install
Jenkins which is a continuous
integration tool on st. OS so there are
five steps to install the Jenkins first
we need to install latest version of
Java that is Java 8 once Java is
installed we need to install latest
version of Apache Tomcat that is Tomcat
9 if you have installed a version of
Java that is older than Java 8 it won't
be compatible with Apache Tomcat 9 so
you need to install Java 8 or version of
Java that has been released after Java 8
now the third step is to download
Jenkins word file and once you have
downloaded this word file you need to
deploy this particular file our fifth
and final step is to install a relevant
plugins so let us proceed with the first
step that is to install Java 8 to
install Java I'll type a command sudo
yum install Java one point 8.0 open JDK
and here we go it is asking for password
press Y it is now downloading packages
so Java
stall now I will clear my terminal and
to check the version of Java that we
have installed I'll type Java - version
and it will display the version so it is
a correct version that is one point
eight point zero let me clear my
terminal again now our first step is
complete that is to install a Java
version eight so we can proceed towards
the second step that is to install
apache tomcat version 9 so let us go
ahead with that now to install apache
tomcat
version 9 I'll use a double you get
command to download the tar file for
Apache Tomcat version 9 but before that
I need to install this WK tool first so
I'll type sudo yum install W get and
here we go press Y let me clear my
terminal as I've told earlier I'll use
this w get come on
to download the tar file for Apache
Tomcat version 9 so to get the link for
this particular tar file I'll go to my
browser and I'll open this particular
website which I'm highlighting right now
this will give you all the versions of
Apache Tomcat available I'll proceed
with tomcat version 9 over here I'll
click on V 9 point 0 point 0 M 10 I'll
enter the bin directory now and I copy
the link location for this particular
tar file which I am highlighting as you
can see it is available for Windows
operating system as well I will proceed
with this and I'll copy the link
location go back to my terminal and I'll
paste it here and here we go
so the tar file is now downloaded let me
clear my terminal and I'll show you
where it is present in my machine here
it is Apache Tomcat 9 point zero point
zero point M ten Todd or GZ let me show
you in my UI is well I'll go to ad Rekha
home and here is the tar file now let me
go back to my terminal I need to
drag the contents from this downloaded
tar file for that I'll use star Chabad
I'll type @ r XZ f about say Tomcat and
here we go now to make it simple I'll
copy this file to a new directory Tomcat
9 using move command it is not mandatory
if you don't want to do that you can
still go ahead so it is totally up to
you I'll do it so let me show you how to
do that first let me clear my terminal
I'll type sudo MV about say Tomcat nine
point zero point zero point M ten and
move this file to a new directory Tomcat
nine and here we go so let me show you
where it is present in my machine the
storm-cat nine directory here it is a
tomcat
and nine I can show you in my UI as well
here it is Tomcat nine so let me go back
to my terminal i layer it first now I
need to provide username and password
for Apache Tomcat for that I'll use
Caban G edit Oh
a Eureka Tomcat 9 cars
Tomcat users door XML on here we go
over here what I need to do is I need to
first remove these notes it is not
mandatory but I'll just do it and I need
to replace it this particular block with
this block I'll tell you later why I'm
doing this but let me first copy it and
paste it over here now what I am doing
here is I have defined several rows as
you can see I am highlighting with my
cursor these are the rows that I've
defined and for all these roles I've
given one single username and password
so if you want you can give different
username and password for all these
roles but I've given them one single
username and one single password and I
separated all these roles with comma so
for the time being I'll keep it like
this I'm going to save it now I'll go
back to my terminal let me first clear
it now I need to change my directory to
tomcat nine so I'll type change
directory Tomcat nine and we are now in
Tomcat nine directory so what I need to
do is I need to start this Apache Tomcat
for that I'll type come on then
startup dot Sh and here we go so Apache
Tomcat has now started I will clear my
terminal oh now what I do is I'll open
my browser and over here I'll go to port
8 0 8 0 which is a default port for a
partial Tomcat so let us proceed with
that it is localhost:8080 and here we go
as you can see that apache tomcat is
working on port a 0 a 0 so Tomcat is
running successfully now our second step
is complete that is to install apache
tomcat version 9 so we can proceed
towards the third step that is to
download jenkins a word file so I'll go
ahead with that now I need to download
Jenkins word file for that let me go
back to my terminal let me clear it to
download Jenkins war file I'll use a W
gate command to download specific
version of Jenkins word file to get the
link for this war file I'll open my
browser and I'll go to this particular
website I
it has all the versions of Jenkins
available so I'll just proceed with two
point seven point three I'll copy the
link location go back to my terminal but
before that I need to change my
directory to home so let me just type
change directory and I'll use this W get
come on
to download the poor file here we go
so Jenkins war file is now downloaded
let me clear my terminal now we are done
with the third step that is to download
a Jenkins Word file so now we have to
deploy this particular Word file so let
us proceed with that to deploy this word
file I go to my browser once again I'll
go to port 8 0 8 0 I'll just refresh it
once and over here there's an option
called manager app where my cursor is
pointing I just click over there now it
is asking for username and password that
we have specified earlier if you can
remember that different roles we have
given only one single username and
password so I'll just type it it is
Eddie Rekha in this case and here we go
so over here when you scroll down there
is an option called deploy all right so
you need to provide the context path for
that word file so I'll just type that
and the directory URL where it is
present in your machine or just so it is
present in home ad Rekha Jenkins dot
what and finally you just need to click
on deploy as you can see Jenkins version
2.7 point 3 is available so we have
successfully deployed this Jenkins word
file so now we are done with the fourth
step that is to deploy Jenkins war file
so let us proceed with installing
irrelevant plug-ins for Jenkins now what
I need to do here is I'll click on
Jenkins and I need to unlock it first so
I'll get a one-time password to unlock
this to get that one-time password I'll
copy this go back to my terminal and I
use
cat command that will actually read this
one-time password and displayed on the
screen let me paste it and here we go so
this is a one-time password that we need
to use and I'll copy this go back to the
browser I'll paste it here and finally
we need to click on continue so now it
is asking for plugins so I can just go
with installs adjusted plugins if you
want to select any other plug-in you can
just click here that is select plugins
to install I'll just proceed with
install suggested plugins and here we go
just click over there and it will
automatically install all the suggested
plugins for you so we have installer
suggested plugins so our fifth and final
step is now complete that is to install
relevant plugins so let me go back to my
terminal once again now I need to open
the browser and I need to fill this form
it is asking for username so I'll type
it password confirm it full name and
your email address finally click on save
and finish so Jenkins is ready let us
start using Jenkins so we have
successfully installed Jenkins thank you
