android so now let's talk about the
widgets I have an important widget here
which is the toggle button budget as you
might have seen a widget which actually
has a green button if you click on it it
actually fills up the color in it and if
you dig again click back on it it
actually deactivates see button for you
so let's take an example for it we'll go
to New
application project and I say toggle
button sample
and I choose an API
click on next click on next click on
next finish it up once i do that it
should get automatically loaded up for
it so let's start here so i have already
created an activity here in the activity
i have a relatively out under the
relative layout i have text textview so
I'll just remove this text you hear hear
you I I can just see if you you can all
can see here at this widget particular
widget toggle button can you all see
that
you
ashish comes up with a question here and
what is the cursor cursor is something
which is used in database and fractions
ashish so when we will be covering
database interaction will be talking
about curses either I can just drag and
drop it here onto the screen which is
not the way that I would prefer all of
you to do so here I will just delete it
up and I'll create my own I say toggle
button give it a height attribute I say
hi to say rock on
layout I it is the attribute that i will
be using here I say wrap content once
i'm done with this i also define the
width attribute I say I'll just prop it
to content because it will just stretch
up the toggle button here I say text on
I say if it is on I should display the
text on all right and similarly if it is
off I should display the message off
I'll see the graphical representation to
n here I have a button which is in the
off state at present so I will just run
this up for all of you to see how the
toggle button behaves so I open up
so it has got the launch to the activity
now I have to click on here it
automatically changes text to on and as
you can see the color gets filled here
similarly off on off on so I can do this
for as many number of times as I do
you also do is I can also check in my
application whether this particular
button is on or off so here i will
create a new item here i say private say
toggle button here I say button toggle
create this Stan she ate this with the
help of eczema layer I say r dot ID dot
I think I haven't given it an ID yet so
i'll just give it to it I say ID I say
under 8 + ID / I say toggle now to get
referenced from the main activity I say
toggle all right and here i can just say
button toggle dot is checked or not so
if it is checked I say it is on if it is
not if I say it it is off toggle can be
done only with button or the radio
buttons can also have toggle features
are so the radio buttons as you all
might have known are they mutually
exclusive things so if I click on any
one I actually click on any particular
radio button which is not the case with
the check boxes so you can click on and
off with the check boxes but you got to
do so with the radio buttons for radio
buttons if you want to do like switching
between the various views on off select
one out of three and all then you have
to place those radio buttons and at
radio group I will just cover it up for
you Avinash Alka
I got it I got it similar to the radio
buttons we are similar to the widgets
let toggle button we also have
checkboxes and radio button we shall
just be just covering now if any person
has any doubts with the button toggle
example you can just try it on to the
charge window I'll be coming it up for
you Avinash I will be covering the
checkboxes and radio button sizable
any person having any doubts you can
just try
onto the chat window so I can just see
to it what is the problem that you feel
you
so this is an example of a typical
toggle button that we have in android
similar to our toggle button we also
have checkboxes so the checkboxes allows
the user to select one or more options
from a set of values so you should
present each box option in a vertical
list so you can i'll just show you an
example for it
here as I have created a toggle button
there instead of the toggle button what
I will do here is i'll just create
a check box instead of the toggle button
here so what I do here is just remove it
up say change it to a checkbox keep
these values I don't actually use these
attributes in a toggle chick boxer do it
an ID I say check all right once I am
done with this I go to the main activity
create a checkbox object here I say
button check and then I check this up
with at a friend set up with the ID
ashish shah has asked me a question here
can we add components from activity
ashish can you just elaborate a little
what exactly is that you want to know
their how we can add components to an
activities that you want to know here
it's like you are talking about runtime
execution of the activities right yes we
can also do that ashish so for the time
being i am just keeping it to layout XML
but we can also do a runtime execution
of the various checkboxes as you as you
might be aware of because you evolve
also have been working here in TCS so
let me just take you like tell you if I
can create an object here so I can also
create an object like new here I hope
you might be aware with this
here I give at others so I can also
create a new object to it and then I can
add it up to my layout ashish we can
also do it like that so here i have the
button check on the button check what I
do here is on checks changeless none I
will create a new unchecked change
listener
do the necessary importer
done with it so it will give me a value
here so i will just use the complete i
will just copy it up the toast message
here so that i can use it here instead
of typing it up so once i do that i go
to the toggle button where and i'm
actually creating a list check box n 20
control V here and I'll just output the
value of the check that as if the
checkbox is checked or not so this is
what I am just doing here so I'll say
here the checkbox is add it up to this
particular string alright so what I have
done here is I have created a checkbox
so here let's go to the main activity
activity may not XML here you can see
the check box here I haven't given it a
name yet so i'll just give it a text
here i say check status once i do that
you might be seeing here some text here
which says check status and a box you
need a box just to the left of it as you
can see here to the left of it so let's
create now try to run this particular
sampler so i have just
the same sample that I was using for the
toggle button i have just made some
changes into the toggle button example
and created a checkbox for it so here
you have the check status so if I click
on here it should say the checkbox is
true that is it is checked if I click on
it again it says the check box is for so
it is not selected then similar to the
check boxes we also have radio buttons
so if I'm using a single radio button it
allows the users to select one option
from a set so radio buttons are actually
mutually exclusive that as you can
select only one out of it so here you
can see i have a check box i have a
radio group I have a example compactly
it example for all so let's see an
example here so i have created a
checkbox already right now let's create
a radio button here
I give all the attributes here I just
shift ended
just change the ID and on I say ID is
ready or not alright so here what I have
done is I have added a radio button I
say radio status alright but as you can
see I have created a relative layout so
in relative layout the elements are
actually not assigned one after the
other it is with the linear layout that
we have the vertical or orientation or
horizontal orientation so here what i
will do is I'll place this item below
the checkbox
alright so once i do that go to the
graphical representation you can see
here a check checkbox and a radio button
to our run as here
similar to the check box I actually
forgot to ads
t-check radio button here so I'll just
do that that till the diameters loading
up
ah she is asking me a question so if we
have more than one check box we can have
multiple checkboxes Ashish we have the
references of all those various
checkboxes and we can set all set the on
checks change listen to all the
checkboxes and get their status whether
it is true or false or what you can also
do is you can just click I will just
show you how you can also do that you
can also check with the object itself so
if i say button check dot is checked
this is the value which actually returns
me the same field which i'm actually
getting by the click listener
you
here I will be creating a radio button
now I say radio BDN I say radio button
equal to radio button and what I Casting
then I do a fine view I ID and I find
view by any of the radio button here
similar to the check box I can also
click set the chick change listener
there I seen you on check change
listener and once i'm done with this i
can raise a simple toast here and the
toes should say the radio box is checked
all right so let's take look at the
sample here when i do one run has
android applications here i have the
example with me just run so if i click
on the radio button it says the radio
box is true i cannot click back on it as
you all might be aware of with the help
with the radio buttons what we have the
process with reading boots now let's
change this complete activity may not
examine I hashish has come up with the
question here what is get application
context so if I'm having I am running an
application on to any device I have a
particular runtime or the context of the
application so whenever i am using some
axioms d if i say i have instead of say
i'll just show it to you
instead of the gate application context
here I can also show main activity not
this alright so this is like I can also
pass in the applications context or I
can also pass in the activities context
to it avinash Ashish I just yes ashish
so this is how we can do it so let's so
I had shown you how to how will be
running it now i will be adding up
multiple radio buttons in a radio group
so be me below that what i will do is i
will just create a radio group here
ashish singh know the gate application
context is not the first activity in the
manifest file it is just the complete
applications context ashish don't
confuse it with the particular activity
because for the activity i have shown
you how we do it but if you want to have
the complete applications context to run
anything so you have the application
context for it
it is always better to use the
activities context because as soon as
the activity gets destroyed so you can
your context also gets destroyed but if
you are using the gate application
context the application will get
destroyed only when the complete
application gets destroyed so you can
decide among this particular behavior in
this particular manner ashish so here i
have created a radio group i say the
radio group has a particular height I
say wrap content it has a particular
width I say Phil parent and it has got
it has to get an ID
I say it our radio group all right and
I'll just go control x here place it
here because I need this radio button in
the radio group and this particular
attribute what I will do here is unjust
control x because this I need to have
the radio button beneath the check box
now I don't have one the radio button
beneath the check box I need to have the
radio group as you can see this is a
radio group now so i can add multiple
radio buttons to the radio rope which
i'll just to keep adding here you can
see i have created three radio button
same radio static radio static radio
status so I'll just check them to one
and two radio static on radio status to
and radio status three so once I'm
this I go to the main activity here i
have placed the on CH exchange listener
on to the radio button which i will
remove because i don't need it now and
here i cream
Radio group
just name it up I'll drop copied up call
it radio crop the idea has to be radio
group now and I say our group dot set I
say on click listener I create a new
onclicklistener do an import here
towards which case I guess this won't
work here so I'll just
the exact method that we can utilize
here
in the sample for all of you so if i do
or run as here i have to actually find
those referenced ids of each particular
radio button and then only i can utilize
in my application but now i can select
all the three later if i want to select
i can select any one of the three here
as you can see 83 any to just see what
it's happening here so i had to
run hair I think I've chosen the wrong
project here I do Warren ass I have the
various radio button so i can choose any
particular radio button out of the lot
so that is the advantage that radio
crops gift to me since i have n number
of radio buttons in the radio radio
group so if i have check to say 10 then
i can reference those from the xml and
then gets their check status checked and
then utilize in my application
I hope this is clear to everyone how we
can use the radio group how we can use
the radio buttons how we can use the
checkboxes all right then so this is an
example of checkboxes and radio buttons
that I had for all of you here
you
you
ashish as i told you if we are using a
radio group here alright so we can have
the util we can utilize the radio groups
in a manner that we can have multiple
selections from the radio group that is
what I told you from the very beginning
that this is the difference between
using a radio group individual and using
it with a radio but radio are using a
radio button and using it with a radio
group
you
then similar to the other things we have
also a smidget which is the spinner
widget in android so spinners provide a
quick way to select one value from a set
so in the defaults pay state spinner
shows it's currently selected value so
let's take an example of a spin area
so I use the same similar example that
as for the listview here and just
convert that example for the use of
spinner
you
so now I
created list view instead of the list
view i will be using a spinner now i
already have created a spinner complete
spinner example for all fear
you
you
you
you
once I have
done I'll just show you what I have for
you all of you in store here you can see
as you can think of spinner as a
drop-down that you normally get in any
application alright so i will just go to
the activity mania
I'll just open it up for all of you here
in the activity mean I have created
linear layout under the linear layout i
have placed a text view which just says
hello then i have placed a spinner here
so in this spinner i have given it an ID
i have given it a width and a height
attribute now if i go to the main
activity just open up for all of you
here i have placed a set content view to
the main activity then i have created an
array of cities took the reference from
the xml item created an add air adapter
here set the array adapter to the
spinner and set the ONS item selected
listener onto the spinner and just
raised a toast here you can see I have
chosen a different layout with respect
to spinner which I chose for the
ListView let's see what this layout
contains as you can see this is the
chicks checked textview type of layout
here so which gives me a style which
gives me a single line which gives me a
breadth attribute and it gives me the
list item it also gives me the mark you
so let's take an example here
so here I have
Louisville spinner here so let's just
run it up again
so you can see here the current item
that is selected in the list is New York
if I click on it if I click on any
particular item it says Denver the
second item gets selected if I say click
on this it gets launched a los angeles
so this is how we can utilize a spinner
in android this is one of the very
important widgets which is the drop-down
widgets that we have in android so if
any person wants to use a drop down in
their activity they can utilize the
spinners act spinner in their activity
and just get their work done
I hope this is clear to everyone how we
use the spinner items in android you all
can just try it on to the jack window so
that I can just understand
this is an example here of the spinner
which is the various items and I can
choose any one so this is an example of
a spinner hands then you can also what
you can also do is you can customize a
particular button that you want to look
like in an application so you can
control exactly how your controls are
styled using a theme that you can apply
to your entire application so if you
want to truly redefine the appearance of
your button you can specify a custom
background so here I will just show you
an example how you can utilize the
various key button press events on to
any particular application so i will
create a new example here I say test
button selector choose an API here
click next click next next finish it up
another source
I have the main activity totally layout
here I have a text view so what i will
do here is I will remove this text view
create a button here all right give
give it the width will use the layout
height instead use it to trap content
then i have the width I use it to wrap
content all right then I give it an ID I
say at the rate plus ready / button now
what i'm doing here is i will be telling
you how you can utilize the various
button pressed events and how you can
change the various drawables when you
press any button in android so i'll just
take a few images that i have for up
here i have a few images are I just
place copy these images go to the
project folder under the resources
tribal I just placed it up as you can
see these two buttons got added here now
what I need is I need a selector for
this particular item so I need to create
a new selector here so I create a new
create a new I go to other go to an xml
xml file i choose create click on next
and I say selector button click on
finish so i have already got the piece
of code that is used here so i will just
use the same one here i have create i
have to create a selector for it so i'll
just do that duo controls here imagine
up to OV here so what I have done here
is I have created a selector item so
what a selected item does is if my axe
it's like if my button is pressed so I
have to draw display a sink is similar
ashish as i told you if i am referring
to any particular item in the in the XML
I actually assign a and I ed to it so
similarly if I have if my droid blue
button to just as the button to all
right so this is the normal driveable as
these buttons should look like but as
soon as the button is pressed I should
change it to draw everyone this is the
brit button press statement so now what
did we need to do here is I need to
assign this selector to the button so i
will just go to the main act main dot
XML I say background and I say at the
rate drawable because that is the folder
that i have created the selector in and
select a button it is very important
that you understand here that the tribal
that is created here should be selected
that has created here should be selected
placed under the droid folder because
that is only when you will be able to
assign it to the background I'll do or
run as and where Anna's Android
application ok it is actually giving me
problems here with the button naming
conventions because it does not allow
you
can he make to be like this so I'll say
button one button another 20 k here and
this selector button has to be renamed
because it has to be all in lowercase I
selects a selector button once i am done
with this it should wipe off all these
errors here now I should
answers for it button and one up button
another what is the problem here okay
now i have to change the name again once
i do that i think it should be good to
go it's again giving me some problem
here okay i think now it should work
Scott had cut it ashish alright so now
let's test it up how these selectors
work in android so if you want to change
the various drawables when you click on
it when it gets focused you can use the
various items now so here this is this
normal but if I click press on it it
changes its background as you can see so
this is the event that I have pressed it
on so as soon as the button is pressed
the drawable should change so this is an
example of a simple selector that we can
use the two lies with the various
buttons and we can customize the buttons
that we have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
