recognition of angular I welcome you all
for this demonstration in which we
intend to cover most of the sections of
a globe in quite some pace and in case
you are interested you're welcome to
join one of our course materials in
angular and I hope to see you that so
let's get started for the day today in
this particular session we will be
concentrating on few aspects will
actually look at some aspects of
JavaScript we understand what a single
page application is how angular fits
into a single page application what is
angular why we choose angular and then
we'll look at a quick demonstration of
how to get started with angular and work
across with the basic building blocks of
angular so having said that our focus
our agenda is going to be page and Dom
manipulation we will talk a little about
jQuery and JavaScript we'll look at why
angular what is a single page
application in the first place and then
we'll look at an introduction of angular
with its features and installation after
that we'll cover basic building blocks
of angular and then look at the angular
architecture great so web page and a
dorm is something we all are aware of if
you're not it is a single simple page
where you can define data or some tags
to display that in the UI and the UI is
going to be your browser so hypertext is
display a UI in the browser it will
actually create a Dom tree if you notice
from the HTML tag to head and a body and
the body will go ahead traverse to an h1
and a paragraph tag or a span tag or a
div tag etc this particular Dom tree is
something that we might want to remember
because this is exactly what we are
going to take out pull out and
understand the concept of angular as
well Dom manipulation there have been a
lot of libraries across for Dom
manipulation you could actually do door
manipulation from pure JavaScript there
was a library called Azure Creek and
still is it does a fantastic job of
manipulating zone and then came angular
which changed the scenario in which you
do door manipulation not just Dom
manipulation actually it changed the way
in which you create applications of web
and taking that into consideration what
basically Dom manipulation is Yuko had
take the Dom structure the Dom tree that
we created for an HTML page make some
changes to it go ahead put that back in
the browser this particular process of
changing one particular section into a
different section is basically called a
store manipulation there are a few Dom
manipulation API is available in
JavaScript which have been used and
exploited by jQuery as well as angular
at this particular point of time we are
going to focus on JavaScript and jQuery
for Dom manipulation and they do Dom
manipulation pretty well for very simple
page applications very simple
applications of very simple pages
javascript is going to be the best that
you can do because then maybe you know
one line or two line you can do the
basic change that you need and you can
get away with what is going to be your
requirement but in case you want some
extended features like adding a
classroom in class looking at it
lossless etc doing some scaled Dom
manipulation jQuery is a suggested
library and in that particular scenario
you would definitely want to have a look
at jQuery as well if you have not used
that before but then UI is one of the
most simplest form of view or it can be
one of the most complex form of you the
reason why I say that is because UI is
never tested UI is never created with
maintainability in mind and it's one of
the most abused but things changed with
single page applications or single page
application frameworks like angular
started coming in and making a change in
which we actually do Dom manipulation we
actually show the view or we actually
change one particular view state to
another so a lot of changes started
happening and during that change change
actually be
very simplistic change actually became
more maintainable and change became more
testable because of the way change was
being managed but let's look at
JavaScript and jQuery in a quick view
javascript is a scripting language for
the browser it is used to manipulate Dom
one of the best examples of Dom
manipulation is document dot body dot
style very change the style or you know
with a background or background color
and then assign a particular red color
to it you could also do the same thing
by capturing that particular Dom element
using the body dollar-sign body dot CSS
and then provide that particular section
to it so these methods we're available
with angular as well but what is the
basic difference between angular and
JavaScript that's exactly what we are
here for so what does jQuery do Dom
manipulation yes
animation support yes Ajax and Jason to
get data yes
but it does not work pretty much in a
scaled manner with rest areas does not
have routing does not have a lot of
thumb form validation appears and it
definitely does not provide you two-way
binding or something that we call as
property or value binding to HTML so
what is a single page application what
does angular basically two well if you
have noticed Gmail when you click on the
mail it actually opens the mail section
and it does it quite fast without
reloading the whole page without
reloading the whole page was something
really important because without
reloading the whole page basically
avoided you loading the static CSS files
static J's files etc which can be
actually used once it is loaded and now
that we know that a single page
application does not reload single page
application provides you a few benefits
one it saves you Network because your
static files are not really rooted time
and again it saves you a lot of
processing in the server that is needed
for processing your HTML page and then
with static pages as well as JavaScript
to your browser it saves a lot of server
resources as well as Internet bandwidth
which can actually be utilized lot more
for other purposes and your client
resources are used here to the maximum
so that any kind of change of view or
any kind of change of view sections are
processed in your client browser and the
client resources are used for that any
kind of interactions you can actually
use javascript which changes with you or
you can use JavaScript to trigger off
xhr requests to update the data or get
the new data so that's exactly what what
is happening here a single page
application is a single HTML page that
never reloads it comes across with all
the HTML files all the GS files and once
it has loaded it just makes specific
changes to the places where a particular
action has happened and a particular
change has been requested for so that's
what angular is all about angular is
going to create a page for you which is
not going to reload which is going to
save you a lot of network as well as
server resources which can be used for
something else and it is running in the
client side after being served from the
saga what was the traditional way of the
traditional way of getting a particular
page was making a request getting the
whole page from the client making a
request again and getting the whole page
again from the collect the page would
actually include your CSS GS and HTML
files all together it was most often the
not never just rest api and rest api
back so that was the traditional way but
in this particular case where you are
working with a single page application
you serve your HTML GS and CSS files one
once second you actually make Ajax like
requests or xhr requests in the form of
JSON to send data or to get data and
going forward it will always do requests
only with a JSON as well as xml type of
but most of them the North GSM is
preferred because of low footprint quit
so let's look at a glove framework in a
little more detail angular is basically
an open source client side JavaScript
framework it is created by cuckoo but
angular 1 did not stop that angular 1
started with two people starting the
framework and then Google took it over
and started maintaining it but angular 2
angular 4 has been rewritten by Google
to make it compatible with future
bleeding leading edge technologies of
JavaScript and was created with a lot of
issues in mind that were prevalent with
angular 1 point X applications and
something that was needed for the future
they clubbed in to create a good design
and an application framework that helped
you create scalable applications or
enterprise like applications so it
accomplishes a lot by doing a very
simple thing it takes HTML Javascript
CSS takes all the concepts of it mixes
then in such a way that your static HTML
is converted to a dynamic HTML and that
creates your application but the
application is created in such a way
that it is more maintainable and it is
also a lot more testable introduction of
object oriented web development using
typescript was one of the best thing
that happened and typescript not only
introduced a lot of modular design
pattern for application development but
it also introduced a lot of typing
across JavaScript applications that
helped you detect errors help you manage
your application much better static
typing makes a lot of difference when
you do application development and we'll
have a quick look at that as well
angular is useful for building complex
applications in the browser and beyond
because it can be used for creating
mobile applications as well so that's
angular in a quick view so let's look at
angular features there are a lot of
angular advantages there are a lot of
angular features that come with angular
2 4 and above one thing that you might
really want to understand is most of
people
say that angular is actually now angular
for what is happening with angular
angular was angular to six months back
one year back and suddenly it has become
angle of foo
well let me tell you antler is going to
reuse a new version every six months and
it is going to keep the entire framework
updated with the newest concept and it
is going to maintain it in such a way
that you are always working with
leading-edge technologies and you can
create scalable application with angular
you don't need to fred because even if
there is an API that is going to be
downgraded it is going to be available
for next two versions of angular and you
should still be able to manage across
with the same code or maybe change it
over a period of time by the time it
gets you know pulled out of that new
version but all said and done you really
don't have to worry about the versioning
because versioning is just a method of
providing you or letting you know that
things are changing API is all changing
but if ap has to change the older
versions will still stay for next two
versions that is something that you
really want to understand angular has
been created with a lot of new
JavaScript support in mind and it
actually suppose a s6 and typescript you
can do development in simple plain es6
or you can do develop and in typescript
it's a choice that you want to make I
would strongly recommend typescript at
least basic some amount of typing for
your application but if you don't want
to do that if you want if you're averse
for using types in JavaScript and you
prefer pure JavaScript you can also do
that it has been built with speed and
performance in mind and it manages
memory quite well once loaded it
actually is very performant and very
fast let's understand that speed is not
equal into your load time load time will
be a little different because a basic
application of angular going forward
might be somewhere you know 250 KVA
nabob which is quite fair in today's
network scenario and speed is something
that I wanted to refer
when working with any kind of changes or
any kind of actions in the webpage so
that being said angular is also very
modular
it is so modular that each of the files
adhere to systemjs modularity pattern or
common J's more latley pattern each of
the files will be modular on top of it
all these files can be clubbed into one
particular angular module which is
provided as a model functionality by
angular so you have two types of
modularity out here one is file based
modularity that is provided by file
based mode lightly libraries like
systemjs or common J's and one
modularity was just provided by your
angular framework we will look at that
in quite some detail with some
demonstrations you will also have
support for mobile tablets etc all right
great so let's quickly look at a very
basic demonstration of angular where we
will be able to install angular in our
system and get started there are a few
ways to go ahead get your angular setup
ready
remember angular development four to
four and above was required note yes why
no disk well you can do development
without node.js as well but I I prefer
you have node.js installed because it
provides tremendous amount of pooling
around angular development the tooling
may include you know providing your
tether conserver tooling may include
providing your testing environment
tooling they include any kind of build
process or in kind of tasks etc and when
we talk about tooling I'm going to
introduce you to one tool called as
angular CLI on which we are going to
base our demonstrations here so let's
quickly go ahead and look at angular
website and understand how your angular
is provided for installation and there
are two ways one a is to go to quick
start
you can go to quick start go to quick
start seed either clone that particular
repository or download that particular
repository has a zipper this is one
option but I definitely myself prefer
something called as angular CLI angular
CLI is a command line tool that
help you set up a particular project
work with a particular project make
changes to a project generate new
sections in a project build the project
for production and create a distribution
for it as well as well as test the
project that you are doing so it is a
comprehensive command-line tool that
will help you work with angular but for
installing angular CLI you need
something called as notice if you don't
have no J's install or if you are not
aware of no gist no J's is a v8
JavaScript engine that is going to
understand JavaScript and you can run
JavaScript in the server we need no
Jesus because the CLI learn runs in the
JavaScript environment and that is the
one which provides you tooling around
angular development so having said that
you can actually go and install download
and install your binary for your purring
system the installation is pretty clean
and once you have installed that when
you go to a particular folder or a
particular party you should have two
commands available to you node - should
be which should provide you with the
version of the node and there should be
another one that is called as NPM - free
NPM helps you manage your packages for
notice and notice the one that runs your
JavaScript environment so these two
commands are something that needs to be
there and once you go ahead have node
setup you will be able to install two
things the first is angular CLI and the
second is ad script to install angular
CLI please go ahead and do NPM install
I'm going to go ahead and get angular
CLI and I'm going to install it in the
global environment that's exactly the
command that annual essays needs to be
that if you want the latest version you
can actually go ahead and mention at the
rate it s and it should install the
latest one you or if you are installing
it for the first time
really does not matter if I hit enter
CLI would be available in the global
environment and there are a few commands
that are going to be available I'm not
going to hit enter I just demonstrated
that particular command for you but you
can go ahead and install I already have
it installed and it will introduce you
with a new command in your system and
the command is ng if you type ng version
and it provides you a version and then
you are actually ready to run your CLI
to see like that I have right now is the
latest it is 1.1 1.0 version which has
just been released some time back and I
am going to use ng CLI for any kind of
installation any kind of project setup
etc so I'm going to do the demonstration
with this apart from that I also have a
command called as PSE to get this
particular command you would need to
install typescript and the way you
install typescript is NPM installed
typescript - G so you would basically
type NPM install typescript F G it
should install type script and make the
command tac of lability
I am NOT going to hit enter the command
is going to be the same for Linux Mac as
well as Windows so this particular
command is going to be common across the
node environment whether it's operating
system Windows OS or next offering
systems UNIX or Linux so tac is the
command that is going to be available to
you if you have this particular version
coming up then you do have TSE installed
so once your environment has been set up
you should now be ready to go ahead run
your application setup for angular so
let's quickly go ahead and set up our
angular application I'm not going to go
into QuickStart method of installation
I'm actually going to use ng CLI setup
method so I'm going to go into demo
folder demo ng folder which is the one
where I'm going to install my project
and I'm going to create a folder called
as maybe test or demo and within that
particular folder I'm going to create my
new at the command to create a new
project is ng new demo it will create a
folder named demo then it will create a
project within that particular demo
folder so let me just hit enter and get
the setup started once the setup starts
we will go ahead and start understanding
what all the other requirements and
needs for angular development and we go
step by step understanding each of them
so the setup has started let it set up
that particular project will understand
some more things so what is typescript
typescript is the language that we are
going to work with and typescript is the
one that NGC that provides you by
default most often then not a lot of
people actually Fred the change in the
environment that has happened in
JavaScript and they don't pick up the
new sections just because syntaxes are
different some particular naming is
different don't really worry about that
because the moment you understand what
that particular section does it's
actually easier to use than pure
JavaScript so let's quickly go ahead and
do some very quick demos here I am going
to demonstrate typescript to you and I'm
also going to let you know what sections
you might need to know well if you want
to get adjusted with angular development
quite fast so I'm going to go ahead
create a file called less requirement or
chase the first that you might need to
know well is basic datatypes of
JavaScript and a good idea of basic
datatypes with null and undefined is
definitely an advantage the second thing
that you might really want to know is
array and array manipulation this is
something that you really want to
understand and the
third is object and object manipulation
if you are okay with this
you should technically be able to get
across with angular development quite
well without any kind of hiccups and if
you want to learn a little bit more
about modular structures design patterns
etc I definitely recommend some design
patterns that you might want to learn
and one is singleton the second is
Factory and maybe you might also want to
look at constructor patterns oh this is
definitely not a requirement but it's
actually good to know wait so if you
know this you should be able to get
started with angular pretty much well
and you should actually be able to get
started with T is also pretty much well
what is this TS is nothing but tag
script I'm going to do one simple thing
I'm going to help you understand it is a
little bit more and I'm going to change
this particular file name to requirement
req dot eps the first thing that you
might want to understand about
typescript is that a script is a
superset of JavaScript which means that
whatever you write okay valid J's is
valid JavaScript so whatever you write
if it is pure JavaScript it is valid
typescript as well one second is since
it is a superset of JavaScript and you
use some features of typescript you will
be able to do something called as
transpile typescript into javascript
that is something that is provided as an
first thing that you would be able to
transpile typescript files into pure
JavaScript and you should be able to run
JavaScript from the browser one of the
biggest
differences between typescript and
JavaScript is that typescript provides
types it provides options for creating
interfaces it helps you work with
classes pretty much well you can work
with decorators in typescript or you can
work with modularity pretty much easily
if you want to work with typescript and
understand typescript I definitely
recommend the handbook alright it talks
about types it talks about classes
functions general in terms etcetera
everything that is possible with
interpret what I'm going to do is
quickly in a minute or two I'm going to
introduce you to different features of
typescript very basic features of
typescript so that you understand what
we are writing here edge script is
modular which means that every file is
going to be a module so to work with
objects in typescript if you want to use
a particular object from outside you
have to import that particular object
from that particular file so anything
that you want access with in this
particular module has to be imported it
can be either an simple object or it can
be complete set of objects one the
second thing is if you have created a
variable called as X and you want to use
it outside this particular type script
file you have to export it
if you don't export it no other file can
use this particular X that's one of the
biggest advantages of having five
modularity and your files are now
independent and since they are
independent they are more maintainable
and since they are more maintainable
they're actually testable as well the
second thing that you might want to
understand is you can create a class
alright a class can be created with
class name of the class since it's a
class like in all other languages it
also has a construct
talk which will instantiate anything
that you want here apart from that you
can actually go ahead and define
functions here and it should not proceed
with the name function that we generally
use in JavaScript you can go ahead
define as many functions as you want you
could also define variables that needs
to be before the constructor and
variables are defined also with out of
that order let here you can directly go
ahead and define an X and say X is equal
to test variable and it will be
converted to valid JavaScript with this
dot X once you have done that I told you
typescript is all about types you can
actually now go ahead and say X is of
the type string if you want you can say
X is of the type number to ensure that
only numbers are assigned to X if you
notice the moment I change it to number
it started giving me errors saying that
it's not assignable to type number I
will have to forcefully keep it assigned
with a number only the different types
that are assignable to a particular
variable is string second is number the
third is boolean and the fourth is any
any refers to any function any object
any array etc but if you want to define
an array of strings you can define an
array of strings something like this
which should have a set of strings if
you want to define an array of numbers
you can define an array of numbers which
is an area of numbers the moment you go
ahead and make it string it will throw
errors on the third is you can actually
do boolean arrays also or you can
actually do
any object areas also any area is going
to allow view string areas number arrays
or thick arrays or even mixed arrays for
that matter so work across with what you
need for types since it's a class like
other languages you will also have
access to public private and protected
this access modifier is available to you
and you will also have interfaces in
typescript you can create an interface
called as point where you can specify
that point X variable which is of the
type string endpoint has Y which is of
the type number and I can go ahead
implement point on a particular class
and if it wrote s is giving me an error
saying that it does not implement it
right because my X is private the moment
I make it public it will remove that
particular error and that's because of
the ring now it should remove that
particular you will also be able to use
point directly as what type which is
absolutely legal and you would be able
to work across with it apart from that
you also have an opportunity to create a
different class which extends a previous
class and if you want to incent she ate
parent class you can actually go ahead
and do a super it should implement the
parent class and you should be able to
use a parent class also and you can
access the parent class variables if
they are public so this was typescript
basics in a jiffy if you want to have a
look at advanced types if you want to
have a look at Adams definitely have
look at it if you want to have a look at
namespaces which we did not cover right
now have a look at it
decorators and mix-ins is something that
we do not cover so this is something
that you really want to work with quick
so that was basic support type script we
really don't need tab script right now
now we are done with type script so I'm
going to close it and I'm going to come
back to my demo section seems like
everything has been installed let's look
at it yes everything has been installed
so our project has been created our
project has been created with a few
files already so what is this this is
actually your angular CLI startup
project well seal either jason has the
set of all commands and metadata that is
required for angular CLI to manage this
particular project run this particular
project yes this particular project as
well as build this particular project on
linkers particular project you have
caramel corn tortillas which will help
you with unit testing protector confer
cheers which will help you with
end-to-end testing and TS config is a
one that tells angular CLI which version
of JavaScript it should compile to what
is the modularity that you want to use
and if notice target is es 5 so it is
going to convert your typescript code
into es5 code which can run on browsers
and if you want you can actually specify
two more pointers out here the pointers
that normally are provided or no
implicit any and suppress it implicit
any index errors now remember these two
if put if you put no implicit any s true
and suppress implicit index errors as
true you will be forced to use types but
if you don't put that you can actually
do es6 kind of coding with typescript so
that being said is a choice whether you
want to work with es6 or typescript
that's entirely up to you now that we
know what a stat script know that we
know what is endless here lie what is
going to do let's actually look at some
commands and understand what command is
going to run when you create a
particular project so we have created a
particular project the name of the
project that has been created for us as
demo so it has all the dependencies and
it has all the development dependencies
dependencies and development
dependencies are different dependencies
immediate for production development
name dependencies are not needed for
production and they are needed only for
development environment or for
development so that is the one that
keeps track of your project dependencies
and development dependencies and this is
exactly what NPM manages to have a look
at Indian commands go to node.js
documentation it provides you entire set
of npm installation an installation
process which should be pretty much easy
to work with if you notice there is a
set of files which have already been put
by NGC line the first is index or HTML
and there is absolutely nothing in it
other than something called as a pro now
this particular app root is a component
a component that we have created and
this is the core of angular the point I
am trying to make is angular is
revolving around the concept of web
components which means that angular
revolves around the concept of creating
your own custom components and creating
an application that uses these
components the whole idea is when you
create reusable components which are
independent and isolated you will be
able to create scalable applications
maintainable applications and testable
applications so your whole application
resides within your app root your second
file is main dot clears file which is
kind of a little important because this
file is going to go ahead and get this
application boots
we are going to create our application
as modules like we discussed before and
your module is kept in app dot module
dot PS if you notice this particular
file we have actually imported app
module and we are importing that to put
strap this particular app module once we
have imported and bootstrap you should
be able to run this particular
application but let's quickly look at
what is there an app body app module is
something that declares all your
environments for your application the
environment may be declaration of
components that you have created
equations or modules that you have to
use within this particular application
declarations of any kind of services
that you need and which is the component
that you want to bootstrap as a root
component that will indirectly bootstrap
other sections as well so I'm going to
stop here without explaining anything
else and I'm going to run this
particular project so that you are sure
we have set up this particular project
right so I'm going to type ng serve and
this should start a very simple
development server all right I'm just
going to go do a CD into demo because
that's how a root folder and then type
in G serve the shifts this should
basically start let's give it some time
this should basically start your
development environment for angular it
should open up your browser and in case
you make a change in your application it
will also go ahead and refresh your
browser recompile your typescript files
to JavaScript build it again and put it
into the process that's that's what it
basically does so it's in the process of
building optimization and now we should
have our application running in
localhost so when I run this particular
project
it says app books and that's all that it
basically does so let's quickly go ahead
and get this particular application into
a very simple application that we can
run and work it let's come back and look
at some particular conceptual sections
of angular and then go ahead continue
at this particular demonstration I'm
going to keep the server open so that we
can work with the demonstrations for the
as well so one hard dependency node.js
needs to be installed second hard
dependency PS needs to be installed once
you have these two installed you will be
able to install angular's here like once
you do setup angular CLI you will be
able to create a new project with ng new
project name there are a few building
blocks of angular modular so modules are
going to be the based on components so
component is one building block
component will have the functionality
the functionality needs to be associated
to dome right so that's the reason
template is there and the template and
the functionality of component is going
to be joined with something called as
metadata so you will have a component
annotation that will take a metadata and
it will join your component Clause as
well as your template which may be Dom
or it which may be your custom elements
as well so it's completely on you what
kind of template you're building it
provides you with something called as
data binding which will bind JavaScript
variables to template we'll have a look
at that so that we understand binding in
a much better fashion basically data
binding will provide you association of
component functions as well as component
models to the template and other way
around as well it also takes care of
change detection it takes care of
updating the views etc services because
you have a modular structure it makes
sense to go ahead keep dependencies and
manage dependencies from one place and
inject them only when it is needed
services are dependencies which can be
injected when needed and they are mostly
kept as Singleton's there are something
called as directives and pipes which
help you manage Dom manipulation great
so what is ng module and what is an
angular modeling the first place angular
body is not the file base mode lapping
dot PS is one single module but that's
one single file so it is not file by
modularity angle module is something
that encompasses all these file modules
combines all of the functionality is
provided by components directives pipes
services etc to create one single
functionality chunk that works
cohesively and will have a curse of
block of functionality that is the one
that will have your application portlet
or your application entirely each
angular app has at least one root module
and encapsulation of different similar
functionality is going to be there as
well as you also will need to understand
that each module will be encapsulated by
itself so within a particular singular
more single module the body will be
isolated nothing will be shared outside
that particular module until you specify
so and everything will remain scoped
within that particular body each of the
modules section will have its own
encapsulation because of file modularity
but remember it will be combined
together by angular modularity to create
an environment for angular modules to
create a complete cohesive block of
functionality we will be using ng module
with metadata to create an angular
mottling great so let's quickly look at
what ng module basically declares ng
module is is a very simple declaration
file basically so it takes all the
objects whatever is required for the
application and is going to declare it
within the metadata the metadata is
going to tell angular that okay this is
the root module this is what the
dependencies are this is what the
components are thisis what the pipes and
services are and you need to bootstrap X
component as a root component that's
exactly what it does the reason why I
said it needs to bootstrap one root
component that is because in our index
dot HTML you have one group component
that needs to be bootstrap it is going
to start a sequin
chill bootstrap we're app root is going
to bootstrap other templates or it is
going to bootstrap other components that
you have created so it is going to be a
sequential chain of bootstrapping so you
will be Boost shopping only one single
root company in the declarations you
will declare components directives and
pipes in the import section you will
declare all the modules that you need as
dependencies some modules are browser
module common module forms module HTTP
module etc there is also one more thing
called as providers where you will be
providing any kind of service that is
required as a dependency that needs to
be injected into your classes so these
are common places where you will keep
common data common functionality and
then inject it according to your
application sneaked bootstrap like I
said is going to be one single component
that you will be bootstrapping as a root
component so that is your module let's
look at our app module it is going to be
approximately similar and it is not
going to have any other things out here
this particular section is going to get
filled as soon as we start putting
functionality in our application at this
particular point of time it really does
not have anything it just declares app
component and bootstraps app component
that's about it your entire application
of app works is actually residing in
your app component great so what is a
component so whenever we look at a
particular component it's nothing but
single cohesive set single coercive
block of some particular functionality
maybe it's a NAPA maybe it's a new news
feed which will show you a list of news
items maybe it's a slide bar maybe it's
just the text that changes after a few
seconds maybe it's a footer
these are all different sections and you
can actually separate them and separate
these concerns separate this particular
section which you know is going to be
one single block of functionality so you
can take out navbar and create a navbar
component you can take out news feed and
create
newsfeed component you can take a slack
sliding ball and protocol component or
test and this can be used again and
again at a lot of places so that's
that's the whole concept of angular
angular says don't work with something
where you will have to create a
structure again and again or repeat a
particular structure again and again use
a reusable component where once you
create that you can just push that in
and that particular functionality will
come in just change the data and the
structure that will be shown will be
based on the data that's what components
are basically for quit so now we have a
sports component when we click on sports
component it will actually show the
sports section like ng component the
component is created as a class and a
template the one which joins the
template and the class basically is the
annotator annotation is also also
referred to as a decorator and this
particular annotation is the one that
takes the metadata which has details of
name of the tag which has details of
styles that your component will need
which has details of template that you
will be using etc the template will be
the Dom that you are going to create the
Dom can have plain pure HTML tags or can
have your own custom created tags
whatever you need in terms of creating a
particular term template if it's
completely on you if you notice the app
ash example that is the selector that is
actually your tag name that you are
creating so in our case the app
component will be created as app - root
if I go to app component if you notice
my selector is AB - rope which means
that I'm creating a tag called as app -
root which is going to have a
functionality associated with the class
this and which is going to have a
template this one and the styles which
are associated only for that particular
functionality is going to be a component
of CSS that's your basic annotation
your metadata is not very complicated
there is nothing complicated about
metadata if you notice it's actually a
simple object it's a pure JavaScript
object that has a key value pair the key
value pair will be selected template URL
sign URL etc your metadata is the one
that tells how the component should
behave your metadata is the one that
tells how the component should be
created and your metadata is the one
that tells your component how to make
change or how to detect changes whether
it's completely isolated with it's not
completely assorted etc anything that's
revolving around creation of a
particular component properties of a
particular component or functionality of
a particular component will be there in
metadata that's exactly what metadata
holds there are a few metadata is
available but one of the most simplest
metadata and the minimum metadata that
you need to get started a selector
template and style URLs if you want you
can avoid style URLs also if you really
don't want any CSS but just go ahead
with the Dom template that's about it
and a component class remember be are
always going to export a component class
and that is never going to be a
semicolon after the annotation remember
if you put a semicolon or annotation
component your code will break don't use
a semicolon export that particular
clause because you will be declaring
this particular clause in app dot module
right so let's quickly look at our class
our Clause is a very simple class which
has AB dot component or HTML and AB dot
component or CSS in it and I will have
just titled that and this is the one
that says app works let's change this
and say
Anglo works if you notice it's actually
recompiling it automatically compiled in
automatically these circuit this so your
mundane tasks which you know gives you
paint to your fingers or face at least
twenty percent of your time refreshing
the browser and making changes or
recompiling is taken off so that's one
of the reason why I recommended no tears
we're tooling will be available for you
when working with your application so
that was about companies let's quickly
go ahead and work with some more
components I'm going to do a very simple
demonstration of how to create a
component with the CLI what I'm going to
do is I'm going to use the command ng
and I am going to say generate
I am going to say component and then I
am going to give the part and the part
is going to be from the app folder
alright so I'm going to say create a
component called as two lists and I will
show you where it is going to create it
so if you notice it created a component
in source slash app slash list folder
and it also updated app dot motive oh is
it so what happened here it created a
list component it imported the list
component and it actually put it into
declarations into this component
components are going to be created and
it's going to be declared also in normal
scenarios you will actually have to
import it and declare it but and you see
that it takes care of it let's see what
is there if you notice NGC Ella actually
gives you the basic test bed that is
required to start off with testing the
only thing further you have to do is go
ahead to a unit testing so your
component has a selector your component
has an app list template URL style URL
etc you could actually go ahead and
start putting in functionality here so
let's work with some particular
functionality what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create and set of list
items and I'm going to say it's of the
type any and I'm going to create very
simple set of
movies
that I'm going to create
let us look at
some good features of angular during the
process
have an array that has for movies movie
one two three and four what I'm going to
do right now is I'm going to copy this
I'm going to go to HTML and within this
I'm going to put
you will and
I'm going to create a list what do I
have to do I will have to repeat that
and do a document dot get and then print
it here right that is exactly what you
do in JavaScript let's quickly look at
the JavaScript code that we might really
understand what JavaScript does in case
you want to do any kind of change you
will actually have to do document dot
get element by ID dot inner HTML makers
double which will
right so this is what you would do to
make a change and similarly in case of
jQuery
this is what you would be doing and
let's look at the jQuery example it will
basically capture your ID and it is
going to make it change there this is
what you would be technically doing in
jQuery as well as JavaScript but let's
look at how different it is in case of
angular I am going to use a directive
called as ng four which is nothing but a
simple dorm manipulator function alright
it is written as start in g4
this is a functionality which is a Dom
manipulator and it is going to give you
a very strong function called as for
loop it is going to loop the items and I
am going to say items of list items so
it is going to automatically pick up
list items from your component and is
going to print up that I am going to
leave it as it is before going forward I
am going to create another variable
called as title and I am going to say it
is a type string and I'm going to say
testing directives and
binding I'm going to
title and I'm going to print this
particular title in an h1 tag the way I
print directly is putting two flower
brackets and putting up this particular
variable name the same variable name
that is provided in JavaScript directly
so this is going to actually take the
JavaScript variable and is going to go
ahead put it into title in the HTML
let's look at what is the result of this
but before doing that I'm just going to
do one more small finding I'm going to
do a binding of item so what is
happening here it is actually taking
this particular list items it is going
to go ahead to a for loop is going to
take each of this it is going to assign
it to item and then it is going to print
this paraglide let's restart and see
what is a result of this
quick so let me refresh and if you
notice nothing happens it did not get
affected here why did it not get
affected here because we are just
bootstrapping one component called as a
fruit and a fruit leads to bootstrap
this component or it means to bootstrap
this component somewhere wherever it is
in the path of a draw a brute in
sensation the only way I can think of
right now because we only have one
particular component which is a root
component and there are no other
components associated I might as well go
to AB component and say HR and I will go
ahead and declare my component here now
if I look it will actually repeat the
sections of the for loop and to actually
put the title as well that so angular is
very powerful and you did not need a lot
of code to do any of these things this
is a very simple application maybe it
might be overdue if you use angular for
just this particular page the what about
applications where you really need to
work across with huge amounts of code
for the client application that's
exactly where angle a is going to come
handy because angular is going to help
you create codes that are going to be
scalable let's come back and understand
what all we did right now so we now know
that there is binding possible binding
is a way where you can take a JavaScript
variable and put it in the container
that is exactly what data binding is all
about and there are a few types of
metadata available from selector from
templates from Styles etc what does the
metadata do metadata is nothing but
something that provides you with the
opportunity to combine the functionality
of component Clause with the template
and tell the component how which needs
to be instantiated how it needs to
behave or is it functionality associated
and how change detection should work on
that particular application etc
that is exactly what
and does component annotation is the one
that takes the metadata and creates that
binding so an annotation combines your
class and your template annotation
module in G module is going to combine
your application module class as well as
your actual module metadata and create
an application so we saw select a
template URLs
style you are l's providers let's
quickly understand this particular
section if you notice we had a route
component and we had a route template
and what we basically did was in the
route template we used a set of
templates that were pure HTML tags but
we also did go ahead used something
called as a custom component that we
created which we created in Lestat
component or PS and then went ahead and
associated that with the declarations in
the module and then went ahead and
declared it within your company so if
you notice what is technically happening
is your route component is the one that
is going to be instantiated it is the
one that takes the child templates
whether the child template it may be a
custom component or it may be a simple
Dom component really does not matter but
what it basically does it instantiates
your application as a component tree and
that's exactly what your application is
going to look like the application is
going to be completely based on
components and it is going to be a
component tree and it will be based on
the interaction between the parent and
child components and between the
component tree branches but remember
components are going to be isolated
that's one of the biggest points of
angular and that is exactly what is
going to restrict us at a lot of places
and there are a few methods called as
inputs and outputs to work across with
parent-child communication and services
to work with two different branches so
interpolation or expression binding is
how you can take JavaScript objects and
put it into the property binding is a
method where you can take a particular
property and associate with the term
one method of property binding could
also be this this is also a method of
binding but a different way of binding I
might want to say maybe
src' where i bind it to a particular
variable maybe SRC path and copy this go
to my list component and i'm going to
declare it here i'm going to declare it
as a string and i'm going to make it as
a path from app slash or i'll actually
need to go ahead put it into s6 / logo
dot PNG
let me quickly get logo here so i'm
going to go ahead and put that local
within my assets quick so is this in the
part of HTML yes it's in the path of
HTML let's quickly look at what is
happening if you notice now the logo
actually has come i could actually have
put that at a different place completely
and
the crap
okay quick so there you go that is also
binding that very specifically is called
as attribute binding
remember interpolations and attribute
binding are a way to bind component
class to a template but you can also go
other way row which means that you can
work with click events you can work with
triggering of a particular function
after an event has a mouse over mostly
click focus these are all events that
are there in the top angler says apart
from these events that are user events
which are related to the term why not go
ahead create custom events and work
across with that so you now have the
opportunity to create your own custom
events and work across with them when
they're trigger so as soon as the
particular event is triggered you can
trigger a particular function and do
some particular action or any kind of
data change or maybe make an xhr request
on click of a button that exactly is
what we will quickly look at right now
so we looked at property binding it's
also quickly look at an event binding
out here so I'm going to close this
particular section I'm going to go here
and I'm going to say let's create a
button and I'm going to capture click
the difference between property binding
and an event binding is in property
binding you would use a square bracket
which is a red sugar that is needed for
angular it's a syntactical requirement
and even capture will be denoted by
round bracket event is going to go ahead
get your event send any kind of data
captures from your Dom to the class and
the class is going to attach to the dome
using your attribute binding so now that
your events already I can actually go
ahead and trigger a particular function
here I'm going to trigger an on select
function on click of a button which says
submit and let me quickly just go ahead
create a particular function called as
select and I'm just going to do a
console.log to demonstrate that
quick this is event binding
remember in angular given binding is
always from component to the template
and from the template to the component
it is one way binding component to the
template is through attribute as well as
expression binding or interpolation in
case of even binding it is going to be
from template to the JavaScript let's
quickly look at what has happened let's
open up the dev console let's look at an
error that has happened which is not
related to ours here
it's an xhr request that has come and
let me click if notice the button was
clicked so this is exactly how you would
capture an event in case there is a
particular change you can capture that
particular change from up form element
and then send it to JavaScript maybe
from the JavaScript you might want to do
some change in the application directly
or you might want to contact the server
get some data and then put it back into
your application that might be a process
that you might want to follow any kind
of process but definitely you have three
kinds of binding here the first is
called as interpolation the second game
is called as property binding property
binding is generated by square brackets
third is called as even binding which is
denoted by round brackets the only
difference is interpolation and property
is from component class to the term and
even binding is from the template to the
component or from the table to the
component it is always one day binding
you can mimic two-way binding using
something called as mimicking of two-way
binding and that will be denoted by L
square and round bracket ng model is an
example where you can associate a
particular property of JavaScript to a
particular input tag or a select form
tag work across with that if there are
changes capture the changes also in the
JavaScript with two-way binding great so
property binding is from component
clause to the template even binding is
from template to the component for
capturing any kind of changes maybe it
might be theta or any kind of user
events etc quit so data binding is also
important for communication between
parents and children
there is a metadata called as input
which will pass data into the child and
that is done with something called as
property binding all right in this
particular section we will be looking at
services very specifically services are
nothing but a very simple dependency
object that angular helps you create
where you can use that to either do some
kind of activity by putting business
logic or presentation logic or putting
common functionalities or any kind of
functionality like maybe authentication
or locking you can put everything out
there apart from that you can also use
these services as a configuration store
or any kind of data store where you can
access data time and again from that
critical section so that being said
about services services are created
generally as Singleton's in language on
the section or the class that you're
creating for service can move away from
singleton pattern you don't necessarily
have to maintain one single object which
is basically what refers to a singleton
pattern to work across with services but
the point is if you go ahead and need
some kind of default configuration at
the start that's when you might want to
move away from singleton but in case you
are looking at data sharing or you are
looking at business logic sharing you
really don't need to have multiple
copies of the same thing
in fact for data sharing it will be
detrimental if you actually go ahead and
use different objects for storing data
because in one component you will be
having one data shown and in another
component another set of data will be
shown so preferably in case of such
scenarios where you're sharing data you
would definitely need a singleton and
that exactly is what services two
services is a broad category
encompassing any value any data any
object function or feature that your
application needs and they are injected
into your components services directives
as a dependency this particular process
is generally termed as dependency
injection
and the purpose of dependency injection
is nothing but to resolve a particular
dependency or create and then resolve a
particular dependency depending on
whether the object is there or not into
your dependent objects the dependent
objects might be like I said directives
components or services concerns so you
can inject a service into a service as
well so that option is also up lipids so
having said that let's quickly go ahead
and look at how we can create a
particular service
remember service is created as a
singleton and singleton needs a
particular process of setup angular
makes it insanely easy for you by just
using a great injectable annotation and
it will be created as a singleton so
that is going to be what our service is
like a set injectable is the annotation
that helps you with creating a singleton
service so let's quickly go ahead and
create our singleton service I'm going
to stop the saga and I'm going to say ng
generate service and I'm going to give
the path from the app folder alright so
from the app folder I am going to have
maybe let's have a service folder so
services slash
movies list / movies list
remember if I don't provide the second
part it is not going to create a folder
and it is not going to put the
injectable into that particular folder
it will put it directly within services
so first I have to create a folder and
the movies list in the final section
actually refers to your service name
so let's go ahead and hit enter it
should actually be able to create quit
so this created your service if you
notice it actually created your spec
files also and the only thing it did not
do is it did not actually add this
particular service or it did not provide
this previous service remember component
can also provide a particular service or
the module can also provide the service
the reason why it has done so is because
if you provide the service in the
component level it will be available for
the component and the component repealed
and if you provide it at the module
level it will be available for the whole
application irrespective of whether you
are providing it at the component level
or at the module level you still have to
import that particular object and do a
dependency injection so let's quickly
look at how to go ahead and work across
with services so that it can be declared
so what I'm going to do is I am going to
now go ahead and get this particular
service from pork services movies list
and movies list service and I am going
to kit right it definitely says it is
not a module alright let me just check
okay it should have movies list up look
okay Tirico movies list
and I'm going to provide it for declare
it in the provider section for the whole
application which means movies list
service is now going to be available
here for the whole application what I'm
going to do is I'm going to now do some
small refactoring I'm going to take ship
this particular section out and I'm
going to go back and I'm going to
declare it with
my movies service I'm going to quickly
create function call as get movies and I
am going to return this particular list
items
there you go so we have our function as
well ready
I have already declared it here and now
I really don't need to declare it here I
will go ahead do it dependency injection
off this particular list and I am going
to get it from movies list
now that movies list is available within
this particular module I just have to go
ahead do a dependency injection of
movies list and it should be available
within this particular company if you
create another component called as maybe
X dot component or TS and you want that
particular movies list
in that particular component you will
also have to import it from there and
use it so at this particular point of
time even if I have declared that's the
only thing that I will have to remember
to get it explicitly this applies only
for a particular service it does not
apply for a component directive or a
pipe and I can go ahead to a dependency
injection dependency injection is
nothing but passing of a particular
object into the dependent object as
our dependency and that would be an
argument I just applied the movies list
service to movies list and I'm declaring
it as private so which means it is going
to be available only in this particular
clause I'm going to use the de notion
underscore which is the normal
JavaScript syntax for providing private
names and this time I'm going to say
list items is equal to this dot movies
list and it should get applied to that
particular section it is saying that
it's not assignable to the type any is
that because we do not have all right I
have done a mistake I am sorry about
that
it's actually or dependency I completely
node and forgot that particular part and
if you do get movies it will be
assignable because get movies is going
to return you the list the mistake I did
was I assign movies list to that
particular list items which was actually
an array and I try to assign a class
which was wrong
I should have basically done get movies
and then get movies should have returned
that particular list so now we have a
very simple application ready let me
actually go ahead and do an inky sir and
let us check if that gets reflected here
so at this particular point of time it
is going to build
you
right so we should be able to get that n
and at this particular point of time if
you notice that same thing works
even after refactoring that into a
different service so your service now
you can actually work with that
particular service in such a way that
you can add items to that particular
list item remove list items etc whatever
you want to do and even if you inject it
in another component the same list is
going to be available to you in that
particular scenario if you make a change
the change will also be reflected in
that particular component so that is
something that is going to be there and
there is something very nice about
services great so we quickly saw that
you can actually work across with
services and service it basically
creates an instance of a class and then
injects it as a dependency if it is
already available it is going to resolve
that already created object and then it
is going to do a dependency injection it
is used to provide services to a
component and use this dependency
injection process
dependency injection process is taken
care of by a library which is there with
an angular dependency injection library
which takes care of this particular
purpose quick so we looked at how to do
an injection and we also looked at how
to retrieve data from our section the
next section I am going to talk about is
called as directives we have knowingly
unknowingly used directives in our
application already and these directives
to one small thing they help you
manipulate data they help you manage any
kind of behavior of experiences and they
manage changes for that components are
also kind of directives but they are
directives with template structural
directives is a set of directives which
adds and removes Dom elements or they
change Dom layout or Tom structure does
reason structural directors attribute
directives are very simple behavior that
you provide to a particular tag or an
element when you apply it there it is
generally applied
as an attribute and it changes the
behavior but it does not change the
layout so it does not make any changes
for the structure of the Dom it just
provides you with some particular
functionality one of the best examples
of attribute directive is the image that
we discussed in some time
back this is an attribute directive so
an attribute directive is definitely
going to get associated and it is going
to fetch that particular variable from
your component clause and it is going to
associate it to your section remember
attribute directives these are
attributes normal attributes which
provide two-way binding but there are
attribute directives already there and
one of the best examples that I can
think of in case of attribute that is
called a CG model let me quickly
demonstrate to you in g model which
might be kind of very nice for you to
understand and learn what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go ahead use
something called as input which is a tag
and I'm going to use ng model which is a
directive that just provides with
two-way binding to the input tag with
the component clause so I'm going to say
ng model is of the type user and I'm
going to go ahead say ng model options
is a standalone forum item and
I'm going to get user defined within my
list so this time I'm going to see user
if a string and I'm going to assign
testing
tribute directors it does not change the
structure it just goes ahead and makes
change or gives some particular feature
in case of a new model the feature is it
provides you with finding of data to
your section let me quickly go to app
module there is one thing that I will
want to go ahead add to this particular
list of modules and I'm going to get
something from common and I am going to
get my common module and I'm going to
inject it in my list of modules that are
going to be there now that I have it
ready let me go ahead and check it as
actually recompiling it right now
great so if you notice this particular
value was a sign here so that is the
purpose of Mg model it's one example of
a directive if you want to see how
powerful it is you can actually do that
you will be able to bind it using an
expression like we did for the title tag
and if you notice that particular
section will now be available in your
dome as with so what I would change this
is two-way binding and remember you are
not doing a two-way binding you are
actually mimicking two-way binding the
reason why I say that is this attribute
binding as well as even binding together
in action it is always going to be one
way binding in angular 2 and you look
for and above and that's how it works so
it's basically a mimic of to the binding
so what is a structural director well we
have already seen that if you notice
this particular code we have already
seen a structural director ng if ng 4
which basically change the structure of
the term without taking it out from the
Dom putting into the Dom or repeating
sections so that exactly is structural
characters and let us also quickly look
at a very simple attribute directive
that we can create on overall what I am
going to do is I'm going to create a
directive that is going to change each
of the text to bold as soon as I move
over or over over this particular item
so if I'm over movie one it is going to
make it pull that it's a very simple
directive at least it will demonstrate
the use case of how attribute directives
are used and I'm going to use a command
called as ng directive and I'm going to
put it within directives slash I am
going to put it within pores slash hole
and I'm going to hit enter it is going
to create that particular directive is
going to make all right arms really so
sorry
ng generate is something that I
definitely missed and it should create
the directive and it should also update
your ng module that is there so now that
we have created our directive let me
quickly go ahead and so let it start the
so meanwhile we will go and understand
how to use it if you notice the director
is already created I am going to go
ahead to very small changes to it I'm
going to get something called as host
listener host listener is something that
will listen to the host or the parent
events so wherever you apply app bold as
an attribute that particular attribute
whenever there is some kind of action
the host listener will allow you to
listen to that particular event the
second thing I'm going to get is
something called as element drift we're
just going to help you get the reference
of the element this particular app hold
is provided to so I'm going to assign
underscore yield with element dress and
I am going to access that particular
element where this particular directive
is sign into L the second thing I am
going to do is I am going to use my host
listener which is also an annotation and
it takes one simple thing it takes the
name of the event that you want to
capture and it should also take
name of or the definition of the
function that you need to do with that
I'm going to capture not just one mouse
enter but I'm also going to do a mouse
out or wall sleeve event and I'm going
to change the names accordingly there we
go so I'm going to access this dot
underscore PL and the negative element
and I'm going to apply style dot font
weight I'm going to do the same thing
but this time I'm going to apply it to
null so as soon as it moves out we'll
set it back very simple changes if you
notice this is pure JavaScript this is
the only thing that you are doing to
capture references before in case of
jQuery you would basically do something
like dollar and in this dollar sign if
you want to capture something related to
ID you would do hash ID if something
later to close you to close name or
something like that to get the reference
of the element in our case in case of
angular you would be doing elementary
native element dot style dot font weight
that's how you would capture that
particular section let's quickly look at
whether it has compiled yes it does seem
to have been compiled and it has not
been applied why did it not apply
because we did not apply to the Dom let
me quickly go back let me check first in
the module if you notice board directive
is already there it is fantastic and I'm
going to apply to my list item let it
get compiled it did compile and now
whenever you hover that particular
section will actually change to put this
is what is attribute directive and that
is how it is going to be applied
attribute directive this is a custom
attribute directive because it's used as
an attribute with some particular
functionality attached this is also an
attribute directive the only differences
this is an inbuilt attribute and this is
a created attribute that's the only
difference
quick so that was about directors I
would definitely want to introduce you
to the angular architecture this is a
very simple architecture remember a
component can have
modules it can have components it can
have services it can have values it can
have functions modules will be declared
in imports components will be declared
in declarations services will be
declared in providers or component
providers wherever you want it values
also in providers because you will be
using value as providers directly and
functions or maybe you know something
attached to the service would also be
defined specifically you would be using
a great injectable annotation to create
services but remember you can have
components only services only values
only function solely modules as well
that is also possible so in everything
income pause together or everything
separate is also possible your component
is associated to the template using a
metadata which is provided by a great
component annotation and you do property
binding from JavaScript to template and
even binding from template to JavaScript
for changes directives are nothing but
simple functionality with metadata that
tells the directive how to be
instantiated how to work across and what
functionality to be provided it does a
very simple job and that is manipulating
at all so that was about angular
architecture I would definitely want to
show you a very simple example I'm going
to get this closed and I'm going to cope
back and introduce you to a very simple
demonstration where
check if I have that already installed
and one of my sections all right quick
so I think I will definitely have to
work across with this quick select me
quickly get this NPM install done so
while it is installing let me quickly
explain this particular project it's a
very simple project which actually gets
some data from the fiber service so this
particular fiber service is actually
connecting to firebase it does get movie
details from five days search movies
from the firebase get movies from the
private sector in the components we have
a very simple set of nav bar component
so now bar component provides you with
the functionality of creating navigation
bar and this is what it is and you would
have a movie search component which does
searching we have a movie details
component which basically provides you
with a list and it repeats that
particular movie list across in the
section and in case of the home it is
basically going to have the details of
the home section which is a route
available and the About section is an
abode section where details of a trigger
has been provided so it's a list of
components that are already available in
my AB component it's a very simple
component that I have used where it has
a router outlet router outlet is going
to push all the components which are
associated to a particular route into
this particular section so it's like a
placeholder and flash measures are going
to come in and sit here apni bar before
that so router outlet is going to
replace with each of the component
whatever applies when you actually click
on a particular nav bar link so if you
click on you know X link it will show
the X component that's what it basically
does so let me also show you the app
module so we have in that module movie
details about full text movies now power
home an app component and we are
instantiating our
Nakia so this was a structure these are
basically odd keys for five days
you
great so we are almost done with and
let me quickly show you the navbar
component it basically doesn't login and
logout that's all that it basically does
the movies is going to get the movies
list it's going to search the movies as
well and and movies details is going to
do what get movie details and the
instantiation which is NGO on it it's
basically a lifecycle book where as soon
as constructor is triggered and that
particular section is going to be
triggered and in case of movies
component it's just going to go ahead
call the login and click off locking
button quick so we are almost set up
with this particular CLI project and
right now that it has been installed
let me quickly start it using indeed sir
as providing me an error saying that
it's a older version
quit so let's quickly go back and
you load our movies list yeah I have
brought them with Google it does a basic
author with Google and visit the home
the movies list is going to fetch the
movies list as soon as it is instantiate
and each of the section will provide you
with the details of the movies
if notice the speed is kind of quite
good and it does do a fairly good job of
getting the data from the network and
one of the best parts is after starting
up this particular loading of this
particular application it becomes
insanely fast and if things are in your
gadget it just flies it just works
across pretty much well a very simple
application but absolutely great to
demonstrate or the use case of how you
can use in UCLA along with working with
angular and getting your angular up and
running great so that was about angular
we went ahead and looked at waters
angular we went ahead and looked at what
is typescript we did a quick start with
an NG CLI and we went ahead created a
particular project along the whole
course we learn how to create a
component understand what is metadata
how to go help across create templates
and how to work with templates we also
understood that the ng CLI is going to
generate spec files also which can be
used for unit testing and we learned a
few things along with the few things
that we learn along with that is there
are directives we use structural
directives as well as attribute
directives we created one custom
attribute directive as well as we went
ahead created a service which we used it
in our application so that was a good
nutshell I bought angular we do deliver
a lot more details in one of our
training sessions that is related to
angular to go ahead register for that
which I strongly like menu to do is go
ahead just click angular it would take
you to that particular course material
and you should be able to work across
with getting registered for this
particular session
and in case you have questions you can
anytime go ahead contact the support
team and you would be able to get the
demos of this particular demonstration
from the support team at support at IDO
record cope in case you have questions
related to sales and registering for
this particular training you can
definitely do that you can contact the
sales team at sales at today Cutco I
hope to see all in one of the session
and I definitely hope this particular
session was very informative so that you
can get started with angular quite soon
and in a much easier fashion you all
have a nice day
and I hope to see you in one of our
angular sessions I hope you enjoyed
listening to this video please be kind
enough to like it and you can comment
any of your doubts and queries and we
will reply to them at the earliest to
