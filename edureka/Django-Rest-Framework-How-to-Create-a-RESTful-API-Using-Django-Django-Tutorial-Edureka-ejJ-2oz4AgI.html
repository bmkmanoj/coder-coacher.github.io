Rekha and today we're gonna talk about
Django rest framework so without wasting
any more time let's look at today's
agenda so today's session is mainly a
practical session but before we begin
the path tale aspect there is some about
their pickle knowledge that you need to
have so we begin the session by first
understanding what is an API and how an
API fits into Django after that we'll
have a brief introduction to this
framework and what exactly is this API
and how does it work then we'll move on
to a demo part we will be building a
list for the web api from the scratch so
let's begin the session and discuss the
very first topic that is what is an API
from API refers to application
programming interface now let me break
it down into simple words so the very
first is application now you must be
aware of an application if you're using
a smart phone say the games are you
playing your phone or the social
networking apps that you scroll around
but any other software that you use in
your day-to-day life
so all these comes under your
application next is your programming so
programming is basically a set of
instructions that you tell a computer to
perform a specific task now using that
program you can build a software which
makes the life much easier so that is
what programming is last is your
interface now when interface is a point
where two applications or you can see
programs meet and interact with each
other now it basically allow us to
communicate with one another and hence
API is a way for programmers to
communicate with various applications
now if you go by the Google definition
it is set of different subroutines
different protocols as well as different
tools that you need to build an
application software so these are the
terminologies that a developer must be
knowing now if you look at the image to
the right you can see how different
environments that are running in
application are communicating with each
other through the API now for running
these API all you need is an environment
that supports the application and the
API if it is a part of an application so
with this I guess you've got a simple
understanding of what is an API now if
you have any doubts any query related to
any of the concept that I will be
teaching you can feel free to comment
below and I'll be happy to help you with
the same now let us move on to a next
topic that is an introduction to rest
frame book so
it basically describes an architecture
which stands for representational state
transfer it is used for the purpose of
web api is for data communication
it also supports some of the common HTTP
methods to make interaction between the
machines you can see applications now
some of the HTTP metrics that are
commonly used in this architecture are
get put post and delete so the very
first method is get now gate is
basically used to return the records or
you can see the data that you feel in so
basically get is used to retrieve a
resource next is your put so put is used
to change the state or you can say
update a resource which can be a file it
can be object or any block thirdly its
post post is usually used to create the
resource and last is delete which is
used to delete or remove that resource
so this was all about rest framework now
let us see what exactly is a REST API
now any web service that uses a rest
architecture they are called as display
API so you can see this TPX so you must
have heard about Facebook API or Google
API or maybe Twitter API so all of them
are a REST API similarly if you take it
on yourself
say for example you own a website you
have all your code you have your
database connection and everything is
working fine over there now suddenly you
have mobile users coming to your website
and then you decided to build an iPhone
app or maybe an Android app so now you
next one would be how to connect the
database online and now let's say some
more requests come in and you want to
make a soft FedExed of application so
again the same question arises that how
an iPhone connects or how an Android
connects or database online it means a
depth side data from there and update
the same over here so isn't this looks
confusing and extremely complicated so
what you can do here you can create a
restful api which will serve all your
purpose in one go now making a restful
api you need to have a device access to
website data through a common format so
here we'll be using json now json is a
data format and it is not at all
specific to any of the device so
basically use jason to communicate
within a specific format so that we can
build an Android app and iOS app or any
other software that you want to make
now one lucky feature that comes into
picture is that if you have an API to
perform certain operations then you
don't have to rewrite that as part of
your code and thereby it also reduces
the size of the code now I guess enough
of critical part so let's just directly
jump into the demo where I will be
helping you to create the first test for
API from scratch so for that you need to
first install the rest frame book so
everything can be installed using Python
package manager now if you're using
command-line it is very easy to install
as you just have to type in pip install
Django rest framework but if you're
using pycharm you can directly install
it by going to your settings and it's
the same thing you do it for other
packages now once your installation is
done you need to add this frame book in
your installed application so let me go
back to my project and explain you how
practically it is that so first of all
let us create a project so I am in my C
Drive users are you share my some
projects so when I create a new folder
by calling it by Django rest framework
inside this window creating a project so
let me go to my command prompt and I
will give this location
now once Rhonda this let's first create
a project so for creating project you
have to type in Django admin start
project followed by the name of the
project
in my case the name of the project would
be my project
now as you can see do I have my project
so once you click on it it has one more
file which is named as my project only
and one managed file so if you go and
click on my project it has some more
file save in it settings URLs and WSGI
so if you have any confusion or if you
want any explanation raided these files
you can go to my previous recording and
get the concepts here next what we have
to do we have to create an application
so for that lets go to my PyCharm and
open this project so this is my
community version of my charm
so let me open it it's in Mycenae users
camp projects zangulus rule and my god
tear it is
so this is my pie Chow now you can do
the exact same things over here as well
now for that you can go to the view to
windows and you can open up the term in
like this you first have to install your
Django rest framework so for that you
have to type in pip install Django rest
framework I can click on end of
for now I've already installed my Django
rest framework so it says that
requirement is already satisfied that is
like fine just my screen so now I'll be
creating a simple application say web
app now what are we doing in that
application is I be storing some
employers information say for example
your first-name lastname salary and all
that other stuff so for that you first
need to type in I can manage that py
startup and the name of your application
let's say it's better you can do the
same in your command prompt as well but
I feel by Chum is more convenient for me
so if you go on my project you see the
web app is initialized over here now
inside this it has different files it
has in it it has admin panel it has
application has models and many more now
if you remember I have already explained
you the presentation that first you need
to go to a project settings and
configure everything so I'll go to my
project this is my settings and inside
this I have to go to my install
applications an apple itÃ­d rest frame
book
next I also have to write in the name of
the applications that have just created
so once my product rating is configured
what I will do next and go to web
application and then go to my models so
here I will be creating a model or you
can say database very much filled in all
this this is the details of the employee
so here I create my first model I will
need this so and create a class over
here class employees
so here let me fill in some details for
the employee class let's say your first
name of the employee or the last name or
some employer ID to it so let me feed in
some details to it
but I'll mention the max length to say
ten next is my last name attribute
again Max and should pretend and let's
say one more thing I want to feelings
employ ID this should be an integer
field
next what we'll have will have a string
representation of this so here what I
will be doing and creating a method that
it turns all your fields
and it returns say self dot poisoning
next what can I do I can go to my admin
tour py file now here I can add and
delete employees from the admin panel so
for that we need to first import the
model that we just created so here my
arm is important
so hey I have imported my model which is
named best employees next happen
adjusted this model for that we need to
write admin dot sight to gesture and
your name of your water that is my
employees so once your admin panel is
created you need to first create a super
user so you can again go to your
terminal and you can create a super user
for that so here is my domion i can
directly write Python managed on a I get
super user
oops no head choose some error Oh
because I am not my grade in my table so
first we need to migrate a table so for
that we need to type in Python manage to
be wise and make my gracious so this
will basically update your table
structure so once your migrations are
done you just need to migrate it so you
have to type migrate
so it basically creates your table with
the current structure and it feeds in
all the details that you have written in
your model that is your employee glass
so where your project is been migrated
now let me create a super user so now it
asks me for username so let me type in
Yoshi demon address you can leave it
blank as well and have to give in some
password
make sure you have a strong password for
this so now my soubise are created
successfully so now I can run my server
for on my server the command is Python
managed on a vine and server
no it is successfully started so I'll
open my Google and I write it over
localhost
so here as you can see there is no
webpage that can be displayed over here
but we do have a suite admin page let me
open the admin bitch for you to ask me
for the username and password that I've
just created so my username is Yoshi and
I have some passwords so as you can see
here I have a babe app that I've already
created inside that I have created model
which says employees now once we go into
that it have an option to add an
employee so now let me add some details
to these employees so the very first
name is say swathi last name and it's an
employee ID is 1 now let me add some
more to this so it might be big
say to and I'll add one more oh my gosh
with employee IDs for and I add one more
that is neat
but I do spy
now here as you can see there is a list
of employees that have just added now
once you click on them you'll see all
the necessary information regarding it
the first name the last name and the
employ a detective assigned to it and
you can directly delete it from here as
well now while going back to it you see
again the list of the employees now let
me go back to my code and see what else
we have to do now let us create a
serialize a class now this class is used
to convert your model to your JSON data
so Jason hasn't already told you Jason
is a foreman and just know-it-all
specific to any application now Jason is
used because whenever a user requests a
website we usually send them back a
regular old HTML format or a stream
response now however we don't want HTML
it's only when you want information from
the browser so here we'll be sending
them JSON for that we need a way to
convert this model to JSON so hence the
C laser is used so I'll go to my
application and I create a new Python
file and emit a sterilizers
so you can see this file right here in
the web application so inside this we
need to import some stuff from this
paper so first I will import those
things from rest framework import
serializers
next I have to import my model that is
employees so here now let's create a
class so class employee followed by a
serializer
cheese's
so here this is my model name which is
my employees followed by a serial Iser
so whatever model you want to see the
lies just say the name of the class
followed by lines of keyboard next this
utilizes dot model serializer is your
inbuilt thing you don't have to worry
about this because you just have your
model as a blueprint which the
serializer needs to convert to a JSON
format so next what we have to do we
have to create a class meta and further
configure it so I create a class and I
fill in the Vegas fields that are used
in an employee model I create a class
metal and the hill I'll write model and
the name of my model is employees next I
have to configure my fields so if I open
my models and here I have first name
last name and employee ID so let's try
this neat first name as a response
so here what I'll do and he'll write
feels equal to your first name and say
if you need one more field let's say
last name you need first name you need
last name but you don't need employee ID
so you can manually write that you need
to display only first name and last name
or if not this you can do one more thing
to display oil field status feels equal
to underscore underscore fun and double
underscore again so this is basically
return all your fields present then your
employer model so now it will display
your first name last name and employee
so I have done this because I don't have
much field store will turn that's why
after all next let us go to the views to
be my file and see what we need to
display when we hit the API so this is
my views of me by file so in this side
what we have to do we have to just
request an API and get the JSON back for
that first of all you need some inputs
so I've already copied them so let me
just paste it over here this saves my
time now don't worry I explain each one
of them so the very first is by default
next is your HTTP response which you
have been using for any program written
the response next is your get object or
404 now if we get 404 wind object
doesn't exist
say for example your quiz some random
let's say Amit and this doesn't exist in
the company's database so what will
happen it will return a photo fool so
for example I show you practically so as
you can see here I have these many
employees over here and say I had
requested some different name let's say
Amit and this doesn't exist in my
company's database therefore it will
return the photo for now coming back to
my code next is your API view now APA
view is you so that the normal views can
return an API data next is your response
so this is where you get back the status
or a particular response now if
everything went fine it will return a
200 response or you can say two zero
zero response
similarly the 404 that we've just
discussed it says that you have
requested something but it doesn't exist
anymore so these are some of the HTTP
responses there are many more like that
say 401 is not found 500 is your server
error and things like that
next is your status which we basically
send back the status after that we have
the name of the model that is my
employees and then the name of
serializer that is employees utilizer
next what we have to do we have to
create a class-based view which
basically inherits from an api view say
let me create a class for it say class
employee list
and this entails from an API view so
here they will create to method get'
method and a post method so the very
first method that is your get method it
is used to return all the employees in
your model and then the second method
which is your post method it helps you
to create a new employee so let me
create these methods one by one
and the next method that is my post
so now what I will do I will go in my
first method and just remove this path
which basically means to nothing and
here I will pass in the request
now we'll create a variable which throws
all my objects so let me name it as
employees or you can say employees one
I'll have my model and the objects at
all
next we have to serialize them which
means that it will take all your objects
and convert them into JSON so we will
take to serialize so for that antics
utilizar
so this is the name of my serializer and
here I will pass in the employee which
means all your objects and the second
parameter would be many is it was too
cool so this second parameter that you
can see here it means that there are
many of them so here you don't have to
return just one JSON object next we know
every View Function to terms of HTTP
response so in our case it's JSON so
what we have to do we have to return a
JSON
serialized or data this is serializer
next is a post function which says
submitting all your data then as your
gate function is reaping or taking your
data now with this we have completed our
views fine now what we have to do have
to connect or link it so for that we
have to go to URLs file so here we will
go to a main project that is my project
and we'll go to URL store P my file so
here you have to add some imports which
are compatible with API is in this frame
book so I'll add here of this beam book
so this I'll be explaining it later as
we go on and have more functions to play
with so in my code you'll not be
requiring this as such but the other
thing you require is to input your view
so for importing you will you have to
type in input now as you can see here it
is only linking to my admin panel but
now we have to create an own URL to
display the view for that I'll just copy
the same line and I'll kiss to help so
you must be knowing that these are in
the form of regular expression so in
spite of admin I can type in employees
so that whenever I hit on employees it
will return my view so just to make it
easy I have to type in the you start
employee list that we have just created
so by hitting on employees it will
connect to my view and in my view there
is a class called as employees so I'll
go to my views and here I'll see I have
my list at his employee list and it will
turn these things as a view therefore
going on employees it will go to my
views and then it will turn the class
that is Employee List as view so in this
way we get two data in a JSON format
so with this of code is completed now
what you have to do you just have to
throw this URL and connect to any
website database and from that you can
get all the information from any device
in the world be it iPhone babe your
Android or anything so now let me go
back to my server and see whether this
API is working or not so this is my
localhost till I have to write employees
which is my URL that I've just created
okay so this is showing me an error that
named true is not defined so let me go
back to my code and see in my views file
now this will work so again go to my
local host and I'll refresh
so yes it displayed so as you can see
here I have all my employee information
I have their IDs their first name and
the last name so this is the format of
Jason which are basically surrounded by
curly braces having all your data and in
the script title to it now using this
URL you can check it anywhere and
retrieve the same information you can
get it using any device in the world be
it your iPhone Android or anything so I
just copy this URL I go to the browser
and I'll open my postman
so here I just paste my url so as you
can see here we have different types of
requests we have get we have post both
pass the lead and many more so here I'm
gonna simply make a get request so I
have already pasted my API and just I
have to send it
so yes this data is being displaying so
as you can see here I have my data in
JSON format which means that my API is
working perfectly fine so let me go back
to my presentation now so finally we
have successfully created a first
restful api in Django
so with this step come to conclusion of
today's session I hope you find the
session useful in case you have any
