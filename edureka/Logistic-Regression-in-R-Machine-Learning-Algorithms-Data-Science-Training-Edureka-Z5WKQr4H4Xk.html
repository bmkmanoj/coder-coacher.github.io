today's session is going to be on
logistic regression so without wasting
any more time let's move on to today's
agenda to understand what all will be
covered in today's session so we'll
start off today's session by discussing
the five main questions which can be
asked to you in Gator science now based
on these questions you decide which
algorithm to use right so we will see
how a regression fit into these
questions and then we'll move on to the
part where you will be discussing what
the regression is exactly after that
we'll move on to the topic of the day
which is logistic regression and then we
will understand the what and why of
logistic regression after that we'll see
how logistic regression actually works
and towards the end we'll be doing a
demo wherein will be taking the diabetes
data set and we'll be solving the data
set using logistic regression in the end
we'll be discussing the use cases as in
the real life scenarios where in
logistic regression is actually used all
right so guys this is our agenda for
today
are we clear with it all right I'm
getting confirmations so Denise says yes
others below we pilots current okay guys
so I'm getting confirmation from you all
all right so let's start with today's
session so our first topic for today is
the five questions the only five
questions which can be asked to you in
data science and based on these
questions you decide which will garden
to use right so the five questions which
can be asked you are this the first
question that it could be asked us is
this a or b is this an apple or is this
a pineapple is this a pen or is it a
pencil is it a mouse or is it an
elephant so when you have these kind of
questions the algorithms with these kind
of questions is the classification
algorithm all right our next question is
is this weird all right so basically
this question deals with patterns so
whenever there is a change in pattern
the algorithm detects and and the
algorithms which it deals with these
kind of problems are called anomaly
detection algorithms then you have
questions which are quantifiable when
you ask numbers how much or how many
right for example
what will be the temperature for
tomorrow or after how many days it will
rain right so all these kind of
questions are tackled by algorithms
which are called regression algorithms
then you have questions like how is this
organized right so basically these deals
with clustering and you have and
algorithms which deals with these kind
of problems are called clustering
algorithms then you have questions as in
what should I do next right so if you
don't know when you have to make a
decision so this isn't me
taking capabilities are are basically
done by algorithms which are called
reinforcement learning
so using these algorithms you can take a
decision as in what to do next right so
these are the five questions which are
asked in data science and these are the
algorithms which are made to tackle
these kind of questions now our topic
for today is the autistic regression so
as the name suggests it comes under
regression algorithms but with logistic
regression this is a scene that the
answer which comes is categorical as in
the answer is either a yes or a No it's
either a B or C or it's either true or
false right so it is classified the
values of fixed values are categorical
the dependent variable the output that
we are getting is like this all right so
it will also categorize under the
classification algorithms as well so it
is a regression algorithm because before
classifying the output you get a
probability and based on that
probability you decide whether it will
be a yes or a no or whether it will be
an A or a B all right so that is the
reason it is categorized under both of
these algorithms moving on let's first
understand what is the question right so
what is regression so regression is
basically trying to establish a
relationship between two variables so
what happens in this scenario is you
have an independent variable and you
have a dependent variable so the
dependent variable is related to the
independent variable so like in our case
Y is dependent
variable and X the independent variable
so as you can see in the graph as the
value of x increases Y also increases
but Y value is dependent on X X can
increase as much as it wants but Y will
increase according to X right so Y is
dependent on X so now where does the
regression comes into the picture is for
say an arbitrary or a random value of X
what will be the value of y so you're
predicting Y correct and this prediction
is done using regression algorithms and
that is what the regression is all about
all right so any doubts regarding to
what I've told you guys till now as in
what is regression so it is basically
estimating a relationship between a
dependent variable and an independent
variable alright so guys are we clear
with what is regression okay so Karen
saying yes okay guys let's try to make
this session as interactive as possible
because then it will be in the benefit
of both of us all right so since most of
you are clear let's move on to the next
topic we have discussed what is
regression and regression is basically
categorized into three sub parts right
so there are basically three types of
regression so the first type of
regression is the linear regression then
you have the logistic regression and
then you have the polynomial regression
today we are going to discuss about
logistic regression right so let's move
on to the part where we will be
understanding what a logistic regression
is but before that let us understand
where do we use logic regression or why
is a logistic regression actually needed
right so why logistic regression so
whenever the outcome of the dependent
variable is categorical or is discrete
so when I say discrete it means the
value is fixed can either be an A or a B
it can either be a zero or it can be a
one so if I'm asking your question like
is this animal a rat or an elephant so
you cannot say it's a dog because my
question is is this a rat or an elephant
are you getting me right so when you
have these kind of possible
it is when you have outcomes which are
discrete which are categorical as in
which Capri refined you use logistic
regression alright so now my next
question which can be asked is why can't
we fix the formula of linear regression
in this right so let's understand why
can't we use linear regression so guys
this is the best fit line that you get
any in a regression so if you guys know
about linear regression we have already
discussed what a linear regression is
but for the people who don't know about
linear regression let me give you a
quick summary you use linear regression
when you have the Y value in range
right but in our case our value is
discrete as in the value could either be
0 or it could be 1 so as you can see
these are the values for R voiceover ry
could either be 0 or be 1 but the best
fit line for a linear regression is this
right and as you can see it is crossing
1 and is also going below zero but our Y
value cannot be below 0 or above 1 right
it could either be 0 or be 1 if you were
to clip the line so the only solution
that we can see over here is that we
have to clip the lines of this best fit
line right so when we clip the line it
comes out to be like this so this had to
be solved because this is nothing this
kind of curve cannot be formulated this
is actually not a curve these are
basically three straight lines right so
this had to be formulated into a
equation so once it's formulated into an
equation it comes out to be like this so
this is a sigmoid curve right so it's a
sigmoid function curve and it is
basically very famous it's called the S
curve now we had to make an equation
which will make a curve or which will
come out to be like this right but why
this is the question so let me address
that so as you can see a value of y is 0
for certain values of X and our value is
1 for certain values of X as well right
now this is the transition that is
happening right so after for the values
are becoming 1 where the Y value is
becoming 1 right so this transition
has to be represented by a curve and
hence we came up with this s-curve now
in logistic regression how do we decide
whether the value will be a 1 or a 0
when we are predicting it through a
model so logistically agression
basically gives us a probability right
so it will tell me what are the chances
of Y being 1 so for example we have a
match going on right and we want to
predict which team will win so if my
team has scored 75 runs and I asked my
Dodge segregation model tell me whether
this team will win or not right so with
75 runs it calculates its probability of
winning through the values that we would
have trained the model with and it
calculates ok the winning probability of
your model is point 8 this is the
winning probability now we have to
decide what will be the threshold value
what will be the value above which we
will definitely win all right so we
define ok so if my probability comes
above say 0.5 if my value comes above
0.5 my probability whatever that
probability is above 0.5 let convert it
into 1 all right
so if my team has a probability of 0.8
it is going to win so if I ask my model
ok my team has scored 75 runs so what my
model will do is it will calculate the
probability of its winning which is
pointed and then it will apply the
function or it will apply the if/else
model as in if 0.8 is greater than 0.5 Y
is equal to 1 if yes otherwise it will
be equal to 0 all right so this is how
logistically agression actually works
now this is how you predict values
through the s-curve
right so basically we had to come up
with this kind of curve because this is
the curve which will represent a logic
regression because of the transformation
which is happening right so having this
kind of curve we should have a linear
equation right so for coming up with a
linear equation we compared our linear
equation to the straight lines linear
equation which is like this
now in this rvice range within the case
of straight-line advised ranges between
minus infinity to infinity and if we
talk about cladistic regression we get
probabilities and a wise value is
between 0 &amp;amp; 1
right so we have to change that we have
to change the range of our Y so that
this equation can be achieved right so
in this basically this part will remain
the same the Y will change and hence we
can come up with a linear equation which
will represent that curve all right so
our viols range for now is between 0 &amp;amp; 1
so we had to change the value of pi so
if you want to make our value between 0
and infinity what we can do is we can
divide it by 1 minus y if we do that if
Y is 0 it will be 0 over 1 minus 0 which
is 0 and if Y is 1 it will be 0 over 1
over 1 minus 1 which is 1 by 0 which is
infinity right so my bias range has now
become between 0 and infinity but we
want our wise range between minus
infinity to infinity and hence we do one
more transformation and we apply the log
function to it so log of 0 is minus of
infinity and log of infinity is again
infinity right so now when now this
function this particular element that is
log of Y over 1 minus y has a range
between minus infinity and infinity and
hence it can be compared now with this
wire whose range is between minus
infinity and infinity and hence it
becomes a linear equation so this is the
linear equation for this s-curve all
right so guys any doubt in whatever we
did
so current is asking me is this formula
used in our logistic regression are no
current so while you are working with us
you will not be implementing this
formula this is the formula which
happens in the background the reason I'm
telling you this formula is because
whenever you're passing a command you
should know what that command is
actually doing you should understand the
math behind it right so this is the
match exactly okay so any more questions
is anything that you didn't understand
in this part okay so you guys are giving
me a goal let's move ahead then guys so
we ever understood why logistic
regression is actually used now let's
move on to the what part but what is
logistic regression so logistically
aggression or logit regression or logit
models it's a loss aggregation is also
known by these names as well logit
regression and logit model so it is a
regression model where the dependent
variable is categorical
so whenever like I've been saying in the
previous slides as well whenever the
dependent variable is categorical you
use logistic regression and that is what
tall about is what happens in logistic
regression is you calculate
probabilities as to what is the
probability of Y being 1 and based on
those probabilities you take a call what
would be a threshold and whenever your
values above that threshold you convert
it to be a 1 and whenever your value is
below that threshold your probability
values below that threshold you
calculate it to be a 0 right so this is
what logistic regression is right so
categorical is when your values are
fixed they are discrete and your values
could be either A or B or C right
dependent is when your Y is dependent on
X right so X value is dependent what you
can fit any value in the X but your Y
value will be dependent on X and
whatever input you give to X Y will
change according to X Y cannot have its
own value Y will always have a value
according to it whatever relationship it
shares with X according to that
relationship it will take a 1 right so Y
is dependent on X so whenever our
dependent variable is categorical we you
aggregation and this is what the
logistic regression is all about you
have seen the graph card this is for
your understanding let's see the graph
again so this is our y-value this is my
value of y so it's between vo and one
right and my graph is like an s-curve so
my values are transforming from this
point till this point and this is the
best curve that can be fit according to
my water now in between this my logistic
regression model will come up with
values so for say this X it comes up for
this value so let me draw it for you so
if I give my model this value of x right
so my model will calculate which value
on the graph is my X pointing to right
so if my model will calculate this value
and will see this value corresponds to
what value of y right and this value is
actually the probability
right so this value is basically the
probability and when this probability is
converted whenever you get this
probability based on this probability
you decide whether your Y will be a 1 or
let's be a 0 and how is that calculated
you decide a threshold and based on this
threshold your model decides whether it
will categorize it under one a little
categorize it under 0 right so this is
what happens in your logistic regression
model now how does it work so let me
give you an example we have understood
the theory that this is the way it
happened so let's see it in a real-life
use case so I have a list of people's IQ
right so I'm a company and I want to
recruit people all right so I came up
with their IQs I have their IQs in my
hand and I want them to be selected
automatically using a logistic
regression 1 now we are not discussed
yet what a logic regression model is so
let us consider this to be a black box
ok so we don't know what is there in
this model what we will be doing is we
will be feeding these values to the
model right and a model will predict
whether this candidate will be selected
or not selected based on his IQ right so
for example 147 IQ has been selected and
107 IQ has not been selected right so it
is a calculation which is done in the
model so basically what would have
happened in the modulus we would have
calculated its probability of being
selected based on my past records and it
would have compared it with the
threshold and if it was less than the
threshold it would have categorized it
under the not selected part if which is
greater than the threshold would have
categorized under the selected part so
this is how it happens guys we now know
what logistic regression will actually
do we have an abstract understanding how
logistic regression function works but
what we do not know is the main part
that how is this model created how do we
come up with this model alright so now
we will be discussing how can you create
this kind of model in logistic
regression all right so let us take an
example in this
take a sample data set which is inbuilt
in the rstudio language which is empty
cause all right so you have these many
values don't get afraid with the values
that you are seeing all right these are
just values it should be clear to you in
a minute so you have these values you
have mpg cyl the ISP etcetera and the
focus should be here vs and a.m. so as
you can see the values of V s and M are
discrete or are categorical they are
either 0 or our 1 right so what we'll be
doing in our exercise today or in this
example is we will be predicting based
on these values what will be the type of
engine of my car will it be a vs engine
or will it be a straight engine so if
the value of my vs engine is 0 all right
so that means that car will not have a
vs engine hence it will have a am engine
or the straight engine if my value of V
s is 1 that means my car will have a vs
kind of engine and these values will be
calculated based on these inputs so
these are actually the parameters of the
car mpg and you can actually look at
what this means in the key for the data
set so mpg basically means miles per US
gallon your cyl is this number of
cylinders in your engine your D ISP is
it actually the displacement right your
HP is the horsepower the cross
horsepower of the car your dri t is the
rear axle ratio etc right so WT is the
weight now what we'll be doing is we
will not be taking all the values now
this is a step that you will be learning
in the demo part of today's session and
how do you select which values to take
in this model so as of now forget how we
select values we will be selecting D is
P and WT all right so while we are
creating a model we'll be filling in
only these two values out of the whole
model and we'll be predicting y what is
by Y is basically BS
all right so we'll be predicting vs
based on these two values that you will
be feeding into the model right so D ISP
is basically the displacement of the car
and WT is the weight of the car so based
on displacement and weight of the card
we will predict whether our car will
have a V s engine or a straight engine
now let's see how will we do that so
first before creating a model the first
step is to divide a dataset into
training and testing why are we doing
that we divided this data set into
training because this is the data set
that we'll be feeding to the model this
is how we will train our model right so
our model has to be trained for
predicting values now like I told you
guys in the starting of today's session
the regression means establishing the
relationship between two variables now
how does it establishes relationship is
by looking at the past the results are
looking at the past records what has
happened before right so in our training
day I decided to see like the Mazda our
export car when the displacement of the
car was 160 and the weight of the car
was 2.6 to 0 type of engine which was
used was straight engine that is V as
being 0 so it is straight engine however
when my displacement of the car was 108
and my weight of the car was 2.3 to 0
the type of engine you use in the car
was of V engine or of V s engine right
so this is how it establishes
relationships so we will be training our
model using the training data set and
once our model is created once a model
is made we will test that model using
the testing data set all right so this
is what we do we divide a data set
between two now the larger part of the
data set will be used in training and
the smaller part will be used in the
model validation so that we can come up
with an accuracy all right so we will be
dividing a data set and then this like I
said this data set you will be used to
create the model so once your model is
created this is what you get when you
look for summary of the model alright so
when you type in summary model you will
get all these values now these values
are very important guys
so this is the value that you need to
focus on as of now so the first value is
the intercept so this is basically the
constant value in your equation remember
in our estimated regression equations
our formula was logit of y equal to beta
naught plus x 1 beta 1 plus x 2 beta 2
plus X 3 beta 3 and so on right so over
here our beta naught will be the
constant value at beta 1 that is the WT
w2e is the independent variable that we
have fed to our model all right so the
coefficient for that is one point zero
nine four that is beta 1 B is P is the
coefficient for the model which is beta
2 that is minus of point zero two five
to nine right now these values are
calculated by are using them MLE method
what is Emily it is maximum likelihood
estimation but if we were to discuss how
are these values calculated it is very
complex and I can explain it to you guys
but it will take a lot of time so what
you can do is you can google Emily right
if you don't understand you can ping me
and I'll explain it to you in the next
session all right if you want to learn
because Emily would not concern you
these values are actually calculated
automatically that is why we have our to
calculate these values for but if you
are still curious as to how these values
are calculated you can google it and if
you don't understand it I will explain
it to you in the next session all right
having said that ok so we get these
three values and these three values are
actually the coefficients of the
independent variables next these
coefficients are actually fed into this
expression now how did we come up with
this expression when we solve log of y
over 1 minus y which is equal to beta
naught plus beta 1 X 1 plus beta 2 X 2
when we remove the log and if you want
to find y we come up with this
expression so this is basically
something like this equal to Y is equal
to this right so now with
expression basically you get the
probability of Y being one all right now
over here you will be feeding in the
value that are beta naught beta 1 beta 2
X 1 X 2 e he is the Euler's number which
is a constant that is two point seven
one right and beat a naught is the value
that you got from here this is the beta
naught value you have the beta one value
you have the beta two value and then you
will be feeding the X 1 value the X 2
value and hence calculating the
probability now again this is actually
in the background for getting the Y
value you simply have to type in predict
you have to type in your data which is
you have to type in X 1 and you have to
type in X 2 and it will automatically
implement it in this formula it will get
the beta 1 beta 2 values from the model
and it will predict the value for you
but you should understand what is
happening in the background and that is
the reason we have explained you this
expression so this is the expression
which is U which is logit of Y is used
to calculate the probability of 5 all
right now as you can see these are the
values that we got from our data set
right now these are the values that
we'll be feeding to us logit by function
all right now where did we get the x1
and x2 thrown
we took a value from the training data
set and right and the d is p value is
1.3 and the WT value is 2 point 1 4 0
right so we'll be feeding these values
into the function with the beta naught
beta 1 beta 2 and the e values and we
come up with the value which is 0.49 6-2
alright so this is the probability of Y
now as you can see in the data set if
the displacement was 120 point 3 and the
depth weight was two point 2 1 4 0 r vs
engine value was 0 alright so when we
are solving it in the equation for y is
basically the value of V s all right so
this probability is basically the
probability of V s being 1 all right so
the probability in the case when my D is
P and my WT values were this my
probability of Y being 1 or V as being 1
is this right
our threshold in this case or in any
case is 0.5 now usually in our
probability we apply the threshold is
0.5 so if my probability is greater than
0.5 we say it's a success and if we say
it's lesser than 0.5 we say it's 3 so
this value is actually lesser than 0.5
right so if it's lesser than 0.5 then it
turns out to be zero and that is the
predicted value of V s right so the
predicted value of V s from our
calculations is zero and if we compare
it with the testing gear set with the
values one twenty point three and two
point one four zero the value of V s was
again zero over here alright so as you
can see our model was correct our model
has predicted the right value all right
so our model is validated now so it has
predicted the right value for the value
of D is P and WT so this is what happens
in logistic regression now we have done
it manually as in we have applied the
formula manually and we came up the
dismember but hadn't been an odds we
would have simply type in the predict
command entered the WT and the D is P
values and would have came up with this
number right and then we would have
applied a threshold on to this number
whether this number is greater than 0.5
or not and since this is not greater
than 0.5 it would have automatically
reduced that value to be 0 and hence it
would have matched with the V s value
all right so this is how a logistic
regression function works right so this
is how it happens so let's move on to
the demo part now so now we will be
using a different data set a more
complex and more elaborate data set so
now we will be protecting our aim is to
predict whether a patient is diabetic or
not all right now how will we predict
that we have a data set wherein we have
values like these so we have n preg
which is the number of pregnancies that
that patient has add we have Glu which
is the plasma glucose concentration we
have the BP we have the BP levels of
that patient the skin that is the
triceps skinfold thickness this is the
test which is done right we have the
body mass index of the patient we have
the pedigree per function we have the
and in the end we have the type all
right so we have this data set wherein
if these are the values the type is one
meaning the patient is diabetic right so
he is in the diabetic type so if the
value is one it means I've patient as
diabetic if the value is zero that means
a patient is not diabetic all right so
we have to predict by entering these
values we have to create a model which
would predict whether a patient will be
diabetic or not all right having said
that let's move on so let's create this
model now so in our first we'll be
passing this command so first we would
have to import our data set right so let
me quickly go to my our console all
right so let's feed in this command and
see what we get so first we'll be
passing in this command and we'll be
including a data set in our environment
all right so I've passed this command
and this is my data set as you can see
all right so this is my data set guys
now our next step is to split our
database into testing and training all
right in the ratio 8 ratio 2 now let's
do that so basically this is a library
which first has to be implemented right
so we will include this library why is
this library use this library is used
for the split function which is there
right so for splitting our data set into
training and testing we have to include
this library which is ca tools once we
do that we will be splitting our data
set into training and testing all right
so that has been done let me explain you
the commands right so first my data is
split alright so this is the data that I
have caught from the CSV file in this
variable all right so this is that
variable I will splitting this variable
in the ratio point 8 right so what this
command will do is it will split my data
set on my data variable in the ratio 0.8
and 0.2 so it will be splitting it in
this variable right so when I will be
passing this variable whatever you do is
in the point 8 part of the data set the
value will become true and this values
they are picked actually randomly it's
not sequential random values of pick
and each value is assigned our value
which is like coup or false all right so
0.8 part of my real set will be assign
the true value and 0.2 part of my dredge
it will be assigned a false value now
what that means is you understand in the
next line
so once I've said split the next line is
training for my training data set I'm
saying the subsets of data where the
split value is true right so where the
point 8 part of my data which is true I
have assigned it to the training
variable which is the training data set
then I say for the testing data set the
subsets of data in which the split is
equal to equal to false that means the
data set which has been labeled as false
will be coming under the testing data
set there is a point to part of my data
set all right so this is how my
splitting of the data set happens okay
so once I have divided my data set the
next step is creating the model so let's
do that using this command all right so
my GLM is basically used for creating a
model in logistic regression right this
part specifies the formula that I am
applying right so my type is the by that
I want to predict right the still symbol
is basically the vs. part survived
versus X right on the x-pyr a specified
dot so dot means you have to take into
account all the variables right now
so type tilt dot is the formula comma
training is the data set that we will be
using so we have split the data set like
this in the a 2002 manner right so we
want the training data set and then our
family of Y is binomial so binomial
means basically it can take on only two
values that is yes or no true or false
or 1 or 0 all right so we have to
specify that as well so let's pass this
command now into R and see what will be
our model 8 so let us pass it so this is
our module let's run it and then we will
get this summary of the model now what
is the summary of the mortal the summary
of the model is basically something like
this so whatever value will be
calculated that value will be
phone away answer let's calculate the
value alright so this is the value that
you get when you look for summary of the
model all right so you get a lot of
values here don't worry I'll be
explaining you guys everything so
basically these are estimate is
basically the values of your coefficient
right so the beta naught beta 1 B 2 that
is saw in the previous example is this
so you have a lot of independent
variables here and hence a lot of
coefficients right so these are the
coefficients and these will be used when
you'll be predicting your value so you
don't have to worry about these values
these values will be also automatically
taken the next thing that you should be
focusing on here is this alright so this
is the significance code that your are
provided with so basically this tells
you how much significant that particular
independent variable is so in our
summary we have got these significant
codes right so these significant foods
specify how much significant your data
is all right so let's see what does this
actually mean all right so three stars
or three asterisks if they have been
specified in front of your independent
variable it means that a model is 99.9
percent confident that your specific
independent variable or value is
significant to the model it means it
will add on to the accuracy of the model
right if it's a 2 star or two asset that
means your model is 99% confident that
your particular independent variable is
significant to the model as and
contribute to the accuracy of the model
the prediction of the value will be more
accurate right if it's one star of one
astrick that means it's 95% confident
and if it's a dot if it's a simple dot
it means it is 90% confident right so if
you look into our data so our constant
is obviously significant right because
it's a constant then we have the beta
value so this particular value that is
the glu is significant
right and our BMI is significant a PE D
is significant and the rest of the
values it says are not significant so
basically what we are doing over here is
basically we are optimizing our model
right so now if this record is not
significant you cannot straight away
remove this record all right there are
other things that you have to see now
what are those things let's see that so
there are two more things over here
three more things actually one is called
the null deviance then we have the
residual deviance and then you have the
AIC all right so what is null deviance
null deviance is basically the deviance
that you get from the actual value of
your data set so if I'm saying I'm
passing these many values and this is
the outcome of this so my particular
model is 311 units deviant when it is
null so what is the meaning of null null
means when you are not using any of your
independent variables you are only using
the intercept this constant or if you go
by the equation when you're only using
the beta naught and not the beta 1 X 1
and the beta 2 X 2 and the beta 3 X 3
how much is the value that you will be
getting right how much your model is
going to be deviant from the actual
value so it is 311 units when we talk
about the residual deviance so your
residual deviance is basically when you
include your independent variables in
your models when you include your
independent variables this deviance is
actually coming down to a smaller number
right which is obviously the fact
because whenever you are using the
independent variables you are making the
accuracy of your model more correct all
right so this value comes down at two
twenty nine point three five from three
11.15 which is correct
now the third value is AIC right so this
value should be as minimum as possible
so this is helpful then when you are
actually removing the not necessary
independent variables from this data set
all right so now we will be optimizing
our model now how will we optimize the
model is like this we know that this
particular
or the number of pregnancies is not a
significant independent variable as in
it is not contributing to our model
according to its calculations our is
telling us that even BP is not a
significant variable skin that is the
skin foltest
is also not a significant variable and
according to our age is also not a
significant variable now how can you
double-check this is like this so we
will basically remove one by one the
independent variable then we'll check
what are the difference in the values of
this so basically your residual deviance
should not increase and your AIC should
decrease so if both of them is true then
your variable removal is right so let's
do that so let's call our model function
and remove age from it so if we remove
age and then we call the summary of the
model let's see what different values we
get all right so my residual deviance
value was two twenty nine point three
five before and now it has increased to
two thirty one point five seven which is
not right right
also my AIC value had to be reduced if I
am removing a variable right but it was
two forty five point three five years
and it has a actually increased to two
forty five point five seven that means
age is a significant variable hence it
cannot be as removed right so this is
the conclusion that we get by
interpreting the data the next not
significant variable is DP so let's take
BP from air right so BP is again not
significant let's try and remove PP so
if we remove BP let's see what are the
changes that we get let's now get the
summary of the model alright so if I
remove VP earlier mine residual deviance
value was two twenty nine point three
five and my AIC value was two forty five
point three five when I removed BP my
AAC value is going down but my residual
deviance value has gone up it has gone
up by one unit it is two thirty point
three three
and over here if you compare it it is to
twenty nine point three five so again I
don't think VP can be considered to be
removed and hence will not go ahead with
it we will not remove VP let's try the
other value so we what are we left it so
our n preg is not significant now we
have tried VP we are not tried skin as
of now right so let's try the number of
pregnancies now so we'll be removing
minus n prick from our model and let's
just get summary of the model now
alright so as you can see my value is
229 over here it's 231 so it's change
it's significant change and my EIC value
is also the same if I remove n plectrum
else we will not be removing n play
against then okay well let's try the
last variable with the skin so let us in
the skin so we'll be removing skin from
model now let's get the summary okay so
before my value of ASE was 245 point
something so it has reduced awesome and
my recital deviance was two twenty nine
point three five and now I am getting to
twenty nine point six four not a
significant change and my AIC value has
also reduced so this can be considered
right so we can remove the skin
parameter or the skin variable from here
and hence get a value which is like this
right we will go ahead with this we will
remove the skin variable and our model
seems to be now optimized all right and
I've removed the insignificant part now
right so let us go back to our slide
right so let's move ahead so as you can
see the insignificant field was skinned
which has now been removed so what does
not leave in screen I had told you guys
how well the response variable is
predicted by a model when it includes
only the intercept which is this and
what does is it will deviants mean it
means how well the response variable is
predict
with the inclusion of independent
variables so this is what we have learnt
right moving ahead
now let's predict values out of our
testing data set right and check out the
accuracy for our model so what we'll be
doing now is we will be predicting the
values in the model using a testing data
set right so let's pass this and let us
check what this variable has in store
for us so if I type in our es over here
gives me dis values
so these values are all probabilities as
you can see point zero four five one
point six two eight point two zero zero
point three six and so on so this is the
testing data set that has been predicted
and these probabilities have now been
attached over here right so the patient
number two has a probability of 0.05 one
of pink diabetic all right so if you
want to check this let's quickly check
this for our patient number two so if
it's point zero five one for a patient
number two that means it is close to
zero right so he should not be diabetic
so let's check out the real values so
for the second patient I type a zero all
right so our model is predicting right
the values are right in a model so
patient number two the type if you were
to have diabetes it would happen zero
and my model also says that he has a
point zero four percent chance of having
diabetes all right so so far so good
that my model has been corrected right
let's check one more value so for
patient number six my probability is 0.6
to eight all right so that is greater
than 0.5 that means he should be
diabetic right so if we check that so
yes my patient is eidetic so my model is
correcting writers when it is predicting
correct values now how will it check the
accuracy for your model right so we will
be checking the accuracy of the model by
this so now we have passed this command
as us now we have predicted the model
using the testing data set and we have
type and type is equal to response so
response means we want to get an answer
we want to get a probability out of our
predict model out of a predict function
right so we will be writing predict and
in our predict function we will be
passing the model the model that it has
to tell and predict a value from will be
passing the data set the values that
we'll be taking from the data set and
predicting the value and the type of the
answer should be response right and if
you be storing all of this in the our es
variable right so we saw the our es
variable it has all the probabilities
the next step is creating a confusion
matrix now what is it
using matrix it is actually very simple
once you understand it right it might be
a little complex to understand so let be
a little careful over here when I am
Telling You right so in my confusion
matrix is something like this this is my
actual value and this is my predicted
value alright so actual values is
something which is there in my data set
and my predicted value is something
which has been predicted by the model
alright so in my actual value my data
set had values which was 0 and 1 alright
so in the type MyType could be either 0
&amp;amp; 1 right so my actual value was either
0 or 1 so and my predicted value has
values which was either false or true
false means he is non-diabetic that is 0
and true means he is diabetic that means
1 all right so my confusion matrix is
something like this so let me draw
something here this is my matrix all
right
value was 0 and my predicted value was
also false that means when my patient
was not diabetic and the predicted the
model also predicted that my patient is
not diabetic this scene or this scenario
was 47 times found in my data set all
right which means 47 times in my dataset
it has occurred that my actual value was
0 and my predicted value was also 0
right and 13 times it has occurred that
my actual value was 0 that my patient
was not diabetic but my model predicted
that my patient is actually diabetic all
right so this is the error this is 13
times it has occurred again for the
value 1 for the patients who were
diabetic right so my model predicted
that the patients are not diabetic and
he was actually diabetic in the actual
value so in my model the patient was
diabetic but my model predicted that she
is not diabetic this has occurred 9
times in my month right and for the data
wherein my patient was actually diabetic
and my model also predicted that he is
diabetic has occurred 15 times right so
this is how you can read a confusion
matrix now if you were to find the
accuracy in this case so if you were to
ask me the formula the formula is
basically the right diagonal this is the
right diagonal right so 47 plus 50
divided by every record in the confusion
matrix now why is this let me explain
you that so when my action value was 0
and my predicted value was also false 47
is the number that I predicted correctly
all right so that is 47 again if we were
to ask when my actual value was 1 and
the predicted value was also 215 was the
number so 15 is also correct right but
when my actual value was 0 and my
predicted value was true this was 13 so
this is the error
similarly when my actual value was 1 but
my predicted value was 0 or false my
value is 9 so this is again the error so
if we were to find the accuracy the
accuracy is correct number of instances
over the
kögel instances right so the correct
number of instances are 47 plus 15
divided by 47 plus 13 plus 9 plus 50
right so this is what I've done in the
next step so for calculating the
accuracy I've written 47 plus 15 divided
by 47 plus 15 plus 13 plus 9 right so it
came out to be 73% let's check in our
model as well so we will be passing the
data set now
right so for passing the confusion
matrix this is a syntax I will explain
you the syntax in a minute let's see the
output first so I'm assuming my
threshold to be 0.5 as of now all right
so let's predict so this is my confusion
matrix all right now if you see my
actual value was 0 and my predicted
value was also 0 has happened 52 times
right and my actual value was 0 and my
predicted value was true as in my
patient was not diabetic but my model
said he is diabetic it happened only one
time in my model right so this is the
error similarly my actual value was 1
and my model predicted that he is not
diabetic but this is very dangerous
right if you are going through a disease
and he quoted the doctor and doctor says
you're fine you're actually been given a
wrong consultation which could be
harmful or it could be it could cost you
your life as well all right so this is a
very sensitive number this should be the
minimum right because it is okay if you
are not diabetic and the doctor says you
turned out to be diabetic that is ok
because you are actually fine but in
this case you actually have diabetes but
a doctor is saying you don't have
diabetes and you might end up costing
your life itself because this is
diabetes what if you this case or this
model was for cancer right you had
cancer no doctor said you're fine it
could have been a huge catastrophe right
so like I said now let's calculate the
accuracy per our model which has come
out from a confusion matrix so it is 52
plus 18 divided by
fifty-two plus 18 plus 12 plus one all
right so my accuracy now comes out to be
84% which is a very good number guys
right so my accuracy is 84% so we have
optimized a model correctly and they
have got the accuracy at eighty four
point three now we have assumed that my
threshold is to be 0.5 now how can we be
so sure about the threshold right what
if I increase my threshold and my
accuracy actually increases and also
this number has to be reduced right this
number should be the minimum what if
this number can further go down all
right
so for that we need to have the correct
threshold now one way of doing this is
by actually doing the hidden trial
method by trying each and every
threshold and seeing what are the
effects that we get in a model or what
are the effects on the accuracy of the
model or what is the effect on the
confusion matrix but is there any other
way through which we can find the
threshold let's think about that all
right so don't think too much our
actually has a method called the ROC
curve which is used to calculate the
threshold in your model all right so
let's see how that thing is done so
first you have to put in the predicted
values the predicted value should be
from the training data set because
you're basically calculating the
threshold from the training data set so
that they can be applied to whatever
value will be passing to your model all
right so your threshold will be
collected from it testing the innocence
so let us do that so our re s should
have the predicted values from our
testing data set so let us change our re
s
so this is our Aria skies so let us
change this to training data set
alright let's run this command okay now
next is running the ROC commands up
first the first step towards creating
your ROC curve is actually including
your library in your environment so
first you will include the library ROC
are in your environment and then you
will be passing your next line of code
so you have store the predictive values
for the training data set in the Arias
variable you also imported the library
for the ROC r package
the next step is define the ROC our
prediction and the ROC M performance all
right so prediction and performance are
parameters that the curve uses to
actually plot the graph so you have to
specify them inside the prediction you
have to specify the predicted result set
comma this result said that is actually
there right
so our es which is predicted and this is
the actual data center this is compared
and it is stored in our OCR print all
right after that you check the
performance so in this you are actually
passing the ROC up red so you will see
how good your prediction is and then you
will plot it against EPR and FPSO TPR is
basically the true positive rate and FPR
is basically the false positive rate
right so you will be specifying the t
PRF PR and you will be checking the
performance using the prediction that
you'll be doing today all right so let's
do that so we have included the library
so let's pass on these two commands from
them all right so my arrastia pride and
my roc a puff have been saved have been
executed a next step is plotting the
graph alright so for plotting the graph
I will be plotting roc RF right the
performance curve I will be plotting and
I can also color the graph so I have
said colorize equal to 2 so this
basically colors my graph in a way so
that when the values are changing the
graphs color is also changing and then I
want the cutoff to be printed in the
graph as well so this basically means
that whatever cut-offs experienced a
change will be
printed so that it becomes easier for me
to choose the threshold right so once
you execute this command this is how
your curve will look this is what is a
graph that you will be getting so let's
pass this command let us plot the corral
for an ROC are alright so this is a
graph that you get so as you can see now
how will you interpret this graph is
something like this this x-axis is
basically the false positive rate so
this should be the minimum and this is
the true positive rate and this should
be the maximum all right so if you go by
this graph as you can see between 0.3
and point 2 there is a lot of gap for
the false positive rate so if I give
point to asthma threshold I will be
actually going towards the false
positive rate and my model will go
towards lesser accuracy but my point 3
is going towards higher true positive
rate at the same time it has the least
false positive rate right if we compare
it to 0.5 0.5 actually had a less true
positive rate though it had a less false
positive rate as well but it has a true
positive rate which was less as well now
what does this mean this means that this
value which is dangerous because if I
was a cancer patient and the doctor told
me that I am ok it would have been very
dangerous for me right so we have to
reduce this value and this value can be
reduced by increasing the true positive
rate right so but this might also cost
you the accuracy of the model but in
that scene
our aim is actually to serve the human
kind right so your model should be able
to predict the right values and the
correct right values it is ok if a model
predicts that I am diabetic even if I am
NOT right but if I am diabetic and it
tells me that I am NOT diabetic that
actually is a dangerous thing and that
thing should not be there that thing
should be more accurate all right
and that is what we are trying to solve
here so it depends on your use case what
kind of threshold you will choose now
you may have some other use case where
in this particular value is not matter
right so for in that case you will
choose your preferable threshold but in
our case which is the medical case
wherein you are predicting whether that
guy is having particular kind of disease
or not you have to reduce this
particular number all right so according
to our graph I should be choosing point
three and not point two and if you
compare it with 0.4 actually so 0.4 and
point three actually have a very little
margin of false positive rate right so
I'll go with point three
all right now let us check the threshold
0.3 in our testing data set confusion
matrix all right and then see what is
the difference so we will copy this and
we will paste it here so our result
should be for the testing data set
predicted values right and then so let
me do it for 0.5 again and then we will
be able to compare our confusion
matrices so this is testing alright so
this is the confusion matrix for my
threshold point 5 for my testing data
set right now let us do it for point 3
okay so as you can see my value for this
valium which is when my patient was
diagnosed wrong in the sense that he had
the disease and he was told that he does
not have the disease has been reduced to
six by changing our threshold to 0.3 at
the same time we are accuracy I think
has also gone down
let's check so for the first confusion
matrix let me get their accuracy so it
is basically 52 plus 18 divided by 52
plus 18 plus 12 plus 1 right so it is 84
point three three all right now let us
check our accuracy four point three
threshold so it is 48 plus five
and then 48 plus 5 plus 6 and plus 24
sorry this is 48 plus 24 all right so
let's check
awesome so my accuracy has actually been
increased to 86.7%
and at the same time my predicted my
this value that is my true negative
value has also gone down right so this
has been a very fruitful exercise where
and we found out that whenever our
threshold is 0.3
we will get 86% accuracy and at the same
time our model has improved because now
my two negatives have been reduced so if
my patient is diabetic then the chances
that he will be diagnosed wrong has gone
down right so any doubt in this part
guys that we have reduced the true
negative part that is from 12 we have
gone down to 6 and at the same time
usually what happens is when you'll be
solving other data sets when you bring
down this value your accuracy might come
down a little bit but since this is more
important
you suffice or you let go the accuracy
and you stick to this number but in our
case I accuracy has actually gone up
which is a good sign all right so we
have 86 percent accuracy which is
tremendous for our model and we have
also brought down our number of two
negatives so awesome guys so my accuracy
for my testing guesses is 86 percent
which is awesome guys
now let me recap what we did we got to
learn how you can create a model right
and then we divided our data set in
testing and training then we trained our
model using the training data set and we
tested a model using the testing data
set right when we tested our model using
the testing data set using the point 5
threshold we got an accuracy of eighty
four point three three percent all right
then we were not sure whether that
threshold value is right or wrong so be
bent to the ROC R curve and also we
wanted to reduce the values of true
negatives right so we went to the ROC R
curve we saw that point three is an
optimum value for the true positive rate
and the false positive rate and we put
the value as point three in our data set
right and then we plotted and we then
came up with accuracy and accuracy
actually improved to eighty six point
seven four percent and at the same time
we also reduce the true negatives all
right so this is what we have done until
now so this has been fruitful all right
so we are done with the demo guys any
doubts in the demo part you can come up
with a question right now and I shall
explain it to you all right no doubts
okay let's move on to the next part of
today's session which are the use cases
so in 2005 we have this use case wherein
we have to predict which areas in Africa
were breeding grounds for malaria so
that we can provide their help and what
we had was a limited set of values for a
small part of Africa where in malaria
was actually present right now along
with geographic information system what
we did was we took the topography of the
areas where my Riya was there right so
malaria is basically is Devon where
there are dense vegetation right where
there is a lot of water so there are a
lot of mosquitoes over there and hence
you have malaria set over there so what
we did was using the geographic
information system we calculated the
topography of these areas where malaria
was more and at the same time we also
had areas where malaria was less and we
also had the topography for those now
this data was used to create a model
right and then we had to predict now we
had topography for the rest of the areas
right so let's say if we have the
topography for this area so this area
was then fed to the model and then the
model predicted whether this area will
have malaria or not and based on the
probabilities we came up with a plan
that which area should be given more
care first right so if this is orange
and as you can see this is yellow so
this has more probability of being
malaria prone right so our health could
first go to this area and then maybe
this area because this area might need
more help from us right so this is how
logistic regression was used
we felt the geographic infinite sense
data and we came up with the model and
then that model was used to predict the
other areas of Africa where in malaria
could be there right so this is how we
used a plastic regression in this use
case a next use case is used in case of
marketing so basically it is used in the
marketing research forms wherein you
have to know your customer so when you
have to predict whether your customer
will buy this product or not so that can
be done using logistic regression so
logit and analysis is used by marketers
to assess the scope of customers
acceptance of a product right like in
our company if we come up with a product
say we come up with a shaving gel right
and we see the past market trends that
what product has been more successful
what kind of product has been more
successful when it comes to the shaving
creams we can create a model and then we
can feed our values our new features
into that model and then that model can
predict whether our product can be
successful or not so it is used by the
marketing research firms and basically
it is also used in targeting ads so
basically whether what kind of data
should be fed to you right so say if I
want to predict whether you will buy a
pendrive or not right so that will
depend based on your search history
whether have you searched for a pendrive
in the recent days were you looking for
a pendrive on safe Amazon or something
like that and based on those values my
model will predict whether you will buy
a pendrive or not so based on all these
information marketing the search firms
they come up with data and they sell it
to companies which actually needs that
kind of data right so if I'm a company
I'm a commerce company right and I need
to know what kind of products I should
upload or I should display in my website
so that more customers are there I can
do that using the odd stick regression I
can actually ask the model bits product
would be more successful and hence keep
that product on my ecommerce catalog all
right so these are the two use cases
that we just discussed okay guys so with
this we have come to the
end of our session for today we are over
with Raja segregation any doubts in any
other scenes that we discussed today
all right so Denis is saying thank you
nice session you're welcome Dinesh okay
so since none of you have any doubt let
me wrap up this session for today then
so let me recap what all we did in
today's session so first we look at the
five questions which can be asked in
data science and according to that we
got to know which algorithms could be
applied and then we discussed what is
regression after that we moved on to the
part that logic regression what is the
degradation and why it is used and then
we saw what is the working of logistic
regression using an example after that
we move to the part where and we saw
with did a demo on diabetes use case and
we applied logic regression and we came
up with a model which could predict
whether you are diabetic or not based on
specific values and in the end we saw
use cases where in logistic regression
has actually been applied right so guys
this is what we did today any doubt in
any other part that we have discussed
till now again I'm asking you I can
repeat it all over again I have no shoes
all right so since none of you have any
more doubts so let's wrap up today's
session so thank you guys for attending
today's session it was a pleasure to
teach you guys and I hope you learnt
something new today assignments have
been uploaded to your LMS I expect you
guys to solve those assignments and come
in our next session also I would expect
you guys since this was a little complex
topic I expect you guys to go through
the recording again in your LMS right
and come more prepared in the next
session because our next session is
going to be on a topic which is
polynomial regression and it is actually
kind of based on logistic regression as
well right so be prepared with those
sick regression so that it becomes
easier for you to understand what
polynomial regression is alright so guys
this brings us to the end of our session
so thank you everyone see you in the
next session good bye
