today's session is going to be on
sentiment analysis so without making any
further ado let's move on to today's
agenda to understand what all will be
covered in today's session so we'll
start off our session by discussing what
is machine learning
right and then we will see where does
sentiment analysis fit into machine
learning once you're done with that
we'll move on to the part where we will
be discussing why sentiment analysis
actually came into the picture and after
that we will discussing what sentiment
analysis actually is all right after
that you move on to the part that will
be seeing how sentiment analysis
algorithm actually works and in the next
part we'll be doing a small demo alright
so we'll be doing an El Clasico
comparison between Real Madrid and
Barcelona for all the football lovers
out there it is going to be an awesome
demonstration wherein we will be
deciding a winner as in which team or
which club has more positive tweets
towards the end will be also be
discussing a use case for sentiment
analysis so guys this is our agenda for
today
are we clear with it all right I'm
getting confirmation so Dinesh is saying
is clear sort of sorrow alright guys so
I see most of you guys have given me a
confirmation okay so let's move ahead
then so let's move on to the first topic
of today's discussion which is what is
machine learning so machine learning is
basically a way of providing the
computers to learn explicitly without
the intervention of the human right this
so that they can learn themselves so
basically we're trying to develop
programs in machine learning which can
change themselves whenever they
encounter a new kind of data without the
human intervening or without B help the
humans they can change the coal
themselves right so this is what machine
learning is all about going ahead the
machine learning actually is divided
into three sub categories
we have supervised learning we have
reinforcement learning and then you have
the unsupervised unyk now let's talk
about the first subcategory which is the
supervisory so what is supervised
learning so supervised learning is
basically when you're training your
program with already existing outputs in
the sense you are training your program
with data sets so that it recognizes
what we are actually talking about for
example it's a one my
programmed to recognize how to
differentiate between different fruits I
actually have to train my program with
different kind of inputs as in I have to
train my program what are the attributes
of say and Apple or what are the
attributes of say a banana right and
once I train my model or once I train my
program then there is one more data set
which is called a testing data set in
the sense so we have trained a program
all right so we have given them the
inputs mega I've given them my program
the inputs of some fruits not all foods
but some fruits and this is how you make
differences or this is how you
differentiate between two fruits for
example if I differentiate between a
banana and apple so I say an apple is
actually round and banana is kind of
long right so now I want to check
whether my program is actually making
the correct decisions is it making the
correct predictions so what I'll do is
I'll pass a testing data set right now
for the testing data set as well I have
the outputs but what I'll be doing is
I'll be actually verifying the outputs
right so say I pass an image for a lemon
and if it's a is the lemon is an apple
that becomes wrong right so it made a
wrong prediction so it actually
decreases the accuracy of the program
now so this is the concept of the
training and the testing data set now
why did I explain you that is because in
supervised learning we are actually
providing the training data set to the
program right so whenever there the
training data set involved in program it
is called supervised learning comparing
it to unsupervised learning so
unsupervised learning basically means
that there is no testing or training
they're set in word right so you don't
give any data set to your program it
actually just starts making collection
itself now how does it do that
it actually makes classifications based
on clustering based on logic right
actually there is no contact with the
real world there is no training of the
program as in what is a fruit or how
does it look the program knows nothing
it is just pure logic it goes according
to clustering and then it classifies a
fruit as in it would be an apple or it
will be something else now how did I do
the class ring is something that is a
little more complex but
where you guys will be discussing what
unsupervised learning is in our next
session so don't spit if you do
understand what I just told you because
if you start telling you guys about
clustering it will actually take up a
lot of time right so just check the
unsupervised learning part for now if
you don't understand it the third type
of learning is actually the
reinforcement learning now what is
reinforcement learning so the
reinforcement learning is basically when
you're trying to make decisions when
your program tries to make decision
based on your past experience so
basically learning is based on
behavioral patterns of humans because if
we guys we humans we take decisions we
actually take it based on our experience
it based on our past experiences and
that is what this program does let me
give you an example for example if I ask
my program will it rain tomorrow right
so how we predict will it rain tomorrow
is like this so it will go back and
check been did it rain right and we'll
go back to the previous day and analyze
what were the parameters that led to a
ring on the next day all right and those
parameters will be checked with today as
in I'm asking whether it will rain
tomorrow right so it will check the
parameters with today's date and then
those parameters are actually matching
might give me a decision as in whether
it will rain tomorrow or not right so
this is the way it happens this is the
logic it follows it goes back into the
past picks of the data analyze it and
compares it to the present and then
comes up with the decision and this is
what reinforcement learning is all about
now we are going to learn about
sentiment analysis today which is
actually a part of supervised learning
all right so now like a pro you guys so
there will be a training data set right
so we'll be training our data and that
data will be evaluating so this is what
we'll be doing today all right now we
know there is something called sentiment
analysis in machine learning but what
does sentiment analysis exactly now
before that before understanding what of
sentiment analysis lesson why do we need
sentiment analysis exactly right so why
do we need sentiment analysis is because
of this so let's take an example there
say you have an application and it is
very famous that like that you have a
million or a billion you
it's lucky you right now you want to add
a functionality to your application now
whenever you add a function whenever
anyone adds the functionality to any
kind of application what basically
happens is you get positive and as well
as negative remarks as well on that
functionality all right now you have to
make a balance so if you are negative
remarks are more than your positive
marks so it actually becomes a bad
function it actually becomes a bad
update right so and if you're positive
marks are more than your negative
remarks it becomes a good update right
but how will you decide which comment or
which reaction is positive or negative
all right so that is why we have
sentiment analysis so basically what you
will do is you will have a comment and
you will analyze it and you decide
whether it's a positive comment it's a
sad comment or it's an angry comment or
if you talk and logically or if we talk
in terms of sentiment analysis there are
basically three kinds of emotions that
we get out of a sentence so it is
basically a positive comment it's a
negative comment or it's a neutral
comment right so this is what we decide
now this is why we use sentiment
analysis now what is sentiment analysis
exactly let's share light on that
so sentiment analysis is basically
identifying and categorizing opinions
expressed in a piece of text by a
customer right so your customer he might
tweet he might do Facebook he might put
the comment on Google Play so anyway
guys so wherever that comment is you
have to actually be able to analyze it
and like I said you have a million and a
billion user group and it becomes very
difficult you actually go through every
comment and decide that it's a positive
comment or a negative comment having
said that so that is why we use element
analysis and sentiment analysis is
basically identifying and categorizing
the comments as positive or negative and
neutral based on computational programs
all right now you might be wondering why
do we have these images right so these
images are actually from Facebook if any
of you guys would have recognizes so for
those of you would still then get it so
that is when every
like post on Facebook you actually get
these emo diagrams alright so if you
think closely about it you are actually
using sentiment analysis everyday on
paper because these are actually
sentiments right so if you look at the
first image it's a thumbs up so that
means it's a like image if you see as
the second image it's a love icon so you
love that post then you have an lol pose
that you're laughing on that post then
you have a surprise emote item then you
have a sad emoticon and then in the last
you have an angry mode icon as well
right so basically Facebook has make
their own work easier they made a smart
move in because they've already
categorized your emotions you are doing
their work they don't have to do the
analysis on whatever comment you're
putting or on your like they have put in
emoticons and you have made the job
easier by just putting in what are you
feeling on the post
alright so they are basically doing
sentiment analysis but in a very cool
way that they're not analyzing actually
anything they have already put in the
emoticons and they're just basically
categorizing based on the emoticon that
you put right so this is what sentiment
analysis is guys moving ahead now we
have understood war sentiment analysis
why do we use it but how does it work so
you might be thinking it's a very
complex thing but it's actually pretty
simple in the next five minutes you will
be thinking okay it was the kpop view
all right so basically you have two kind
of words when you are doing sentiment
analysis you have a list of words which
are positives and you have a list of
words which are negatives right there is
also a third kind of words which are
called the neutral words stock words so
neutral words the different softwares
are different but in our discussion
today we are actually counting them in
because we are just getting an outline
of what sentiment analysis right so
basically you have two kind of words you
have positive words and you have
negative words and the words which are
not in both of these lists are actually
the neutral words right so these
positive and negative words are your
data base so whenever there is a
statement involved in analyzing this
statement is match against both these
files or both these data sets that is
positive words and the negative words
and then we decide whether statement is
positive or negative how
we do that let's see so basically you
pass a sample statement all right and
that sample statement is matched against
the positive words and the negative
words that sample statement is actually
broken down into words right now each
and every word in that statement is then
massed against the puzzle decibels and
the negative list words and you then
assign a score to each and every word
now how to score a sign is something
like this so it's the positive word you
assign a plus one to the particular word
if that particular word is neutral you
assigned as zero and if that particular
word is a negative word you actually
give it a minus one now
for those of you we still don't get it
okay in the next slide you might
understand everything so what we just
discussed is what I've drawn over here
so basically this is a sample statement
so that algorithm what it does is it
basically breaks the words right so now
we have this as a separate word is it as
a prett word or in separate word sample
and then statement right now
each of these words will be compared
against positive words and the negative
words so for example first this will be
taken by they require rhythm and we'll
be checking whether it is there in the
positive words if it's not there in the
positive words it will check whether
it's in the negative words now if he
doesn't find it whether it's a positive
or a negative word is assigned as zero
but if it does if it find it's under the
positive words assigned it a value of
plus one if it finds that if it is under
the negative word it assigns it a value
as negative one and towards the end when
all the words are evaluated it
aggregates or it sums all the scores and
comes up with the final score so any
score which is above zero makes it a
positive sentence and any score which
less than zero makes it a negative
sentence so that is how we decide
whether a sentence is positive or
negative all right guys so are we clear
until here as in do you have any doubts
that you have until the slide we can
discuss it all over again any part that
I didn't get until now even if it was
way before it is okay we can do it again
any part that is in understand yeah so
look at this algorithm it's actually
pretty simple there's nothing to it
but then if you think about it in
complex terms you actually have a lot of
things incentive analysis right because
you have to increase your accuracy to
the maximum and for doing that you have
to put in a lot more conditions to
actually be more accurate how what are
we talking about I will be discussing in
a few minutes but then yeah don't be
scared but that part also is pretty
simple
any doubts until here is alright since
most of you are giving me a goal so
let's move on to the next section now
so our next section is talks about an
example so we now know how the garden
works right but now let's take a live
statement let's take a sample statement
and let's understand what its nature be
whether it will be a positive sentence
it will be a negative so let's do that
so our first example statement is the
iPhone 7 is awesome
all right ourselves we know that it's a
positive comment but how the computer
recognize it let's apply the sentiment
record amount to it all right so first
if I split the sentence into words right
each word will be separated and each
word will then be evaluated so it will
first look whether d is there in any of
the positive or the negative words oh
yeah so the blue ones are the positive
words and the red ones are the negative
words right so it will compare D with
the list of positive words so it's not
there and it's a neutral word iPhone 7
it's not there here it's not here it's a
neutral word is is not there it's a
neutral word awesome is a positive word
hence a plus 1 right our second sentence
is a little more complex so the movie is
not that great after the interval was
boring all right so not here is a
negative word great here is a positive
word and boring here is a negative word
right so you might ask me like there's a
possible here why it's not a positive
sentence so it is because we have to
calculate the overall score and we are
looking at the overall score to decide
whether a statement is positive or
negative right so it's a minus 1 here
plus 1 here and a minus 1 here that
comes out to be minus 1
so this statement is negative until now
we have discussed our algorithm is
actually working fine for these kind of
statements now what about the statements
with a little more complex now somebody
had a question here about some statement
now exactly like that Satan guys I have
a statement so what if we have a
statement just like this so it says the
service was terrible but the food was
great
now how will you evaluate this kyra
sentence in the first part of sentence
it was actually a negative comment but
after the sentence it is actually a
positive comment now it depends on the
perception if you're a guy who is into
good service you might find this whole
comment as native right and if you're a
foodie and you're not concerned with the
service you might actually find this
comment positive so it depends on a
perception but with computers
how will it identify whether it's a
positive sentence or it's a negative
sentence any idea race how does all this
okay don't be scared it's pretty simple
so this kind of case is called
constructive conjunction all right and
the wave is Allred is like this so
whenever there is a but in those
statement so for example in our
statement we have the service was
terrible but the food was great right so
whenever there is a but in the statement
we actually split our statement into two
sentences for example in this statement
we split in two the service was terrible
and the second statement is but the food
was great now once we do that we are
actually going to evaluate each
statement separately for example this
sentence will be native intense but this
intense will actually be a poison inside
so both of these schools will be
evaluated separately and will be listed
separately so instead of one school we
are actually getting two scores and
instead of one sentence they are
actually getting two sentences and that
is the reason this method of solving
particular complex sentence is called
binary sentiment analysis because you're
splitting yourselves intense into two
and then you are evaluating right so
this method is called binary sentiment
analysis now like this method we have a
lot many more methods which address a
lot many more complex statements but you
have to incorporate those as go
into your sentiment analysis algorithm
because if you look at this closely this
is actually a condition that if there is
a but please do this right but the main
idea the main it will call them behind
is the sentiment analysis is Valda which
is just discussed all right so if you
were to increase the accuracy of your
model you would do it in this particular
way and that is the reason because we
cannot predict or we cannot actually say
what kind of sentence may come up right
because English is such a big language
and it becomes very difficult for us to
account each and every condition into
our algorithm and that is the reason the
even the best sentiment analysis a
garden in the world have an accuracy not
more than eighty person right having
said that guys any doubts until here
anything that is ill to understand we
can repeat it again any part that he
didn't understand okay so I think we are
done here and thank you guys so much you
guys are giving me a go okay so let's
move ahead then
so our next section actually talks about
the demonstration part so now we'll be
implementing this algorithm in our
alright so let's check let's see what is
our problem stay tuned for today and
it's actually pretty excited so yeah for
all the football lovers out there we
have this use case so we'll be doing an
L classical comparison between Real
Madrid and Barcelona and we are going to
decide which one is better
alright so how we going to decide that
is based on Twitter so basically what we
are going to do is we're going to string
on the Twitter handles of both these
clubs the Twitter's and we're going to
evaluate which club has more positive
treats right which club has more number
of positive treats and the club which
would have that will actually better
alright so this is what we are going to
do and we are going to stream actual
live tweets from Twitter and it is
actually going to be very interesting
because I'm going to show you guys how
you can tweet how even stream tweets
from Twitter using our right so and I am
also going to tell you how we can create
an application on Twitter right sounds
interesting doesn't it
alright guys so since most of you are
giving me a goal let's do it in art so
guys this is our code that is that that
will be a securing today so these are
the libraries that you have to import so
don't worry I'll be providing you guys
to code in LMS let me quickly explain it
to you what the code actually does and
if it's in line with that algorithm that
we have set up all right our first step
was to actually split our sentences into
words but before that we have to clean
our sentence as and there should be no
punctuation our sentences should be in
lowercase there should be no control
words and there should be no digits as
well because digits they don't signify
any motion right then neither positive
neither they're negative so they have to
be removed right so whenever sentences
comment to us we have to filter them so
this is what our code is doing first I
will be removing all the punctuation
from the sentence all right so don't
worry I'll be explaining I'll be
actually executing each and every
sentence each and every line of code
over here so it becomes more clear to
you so basically first all the
punctuation will be removed all right so
jisub is a function from string R so it
basically means global substitution
alright so your globally substituting
the punctuation
this means the punctuation with the null
space as in you will substitute the
punctuation wherever this punctuation
will be you will substitute it with this
that is nothing all right
and where are you doing it you are doing
it in this particular variable so
whatever is there in this particular
variable if there are punctuation in it
it will be removed and this will be
substituted against them
the next line is substituting the
control words with the null space all
right so it will be substituting the
control words with a null space and then
will be substituting the digits so this
means the digits we are substituting the
digits within our space again all right
once we have executed once we have
removed the digits the control words and
the punctuation now we will be
converting a sentence to lower cases so
a sentence will be converted lower cases
and then once you are done with that
once the filtering is done once you have
converted our statement or sentense what
we'll be doing is we'll be
getting a statement in two words right
in two separate words so what this line
will do is it will split its end dense
in two words right and if you store it
in a list but we cannot pass a list so
this list will be converted into a
vector so that it can be passed
so each sentence each word will actually
be in a vector so that it can be
accessed easily and then that vector
will be matched against the positive
words right so these are the positive
word guides so these positive words and
the negative words again I will be
uploading into LMS you can download them
from there all right so once we have
come matched our words with the positive
words and the negative words what it
basically does is the place where that
word was exactly found what I mean that
that is for example my statement has a
word sacred all right and I match it
against the positive words and in
positive words say it was on the
thirty-seventh number right do you guys
get me that great was on 37th number and
the list of all the words so basically
it is not returning to me whether the
word is there in the list or not is it
basically returning the position of the
word in the list right so it will match
the words each and every word with the
positive words and if there is a match
it will return me the position of that
particular word in that list all right
so once that is done the output will be
something like this so whichever word
does not match will have any in its
place that is not applicable and
whichever word matches will have a
number which will basically signifies
the position of that word in that
particular list all right for those of
you who are not getting it please give
me a moment I'll explain it to you so
for example let's take a example
statement that the food is great
all right so this is the example
statement now I want to match this with
the positive word so let me include the
positive and the negative words in my
environment all right done that and then
let me match my sentence so before that
I have to convert my sentence into words
so let me do that so basically this will
be e^x so since our statement is in X we
have substituted e^x over here once you
are done with that we will convert our
list into vector done now we will match
it against the positive words
done now let us see what is the output
there were three words right there
basically three words in Jenna's food is
great so food is not there in the world
list is not there in the positive list
but great is there and it is at the
position 857 all right so this is the
kind of output that we get when we are
using the match statement now once
you've done that we basically don't want
the position right we basically want to
know how many good words are there or
how many was the words that they are in
the syntax so for that so what we'll be
doing is we'll be executing this
particular statement
all right so what this basically will do
is it'll basically see at what positions
na is not there so let me first show you
what it does when we have any if you
don't have the not what we'll do so
basically this command is saying none a
store in num whenever there is an na in
pause of matches store it in now all
right so what this statement will do is
whenever there is an na it put it true
and whenever there is no any they will
put a false let me quickly show you what
I basically just said and then all right
so as you can see any was this as I put
it a true again a name is there to put
it it's true and HP 700 days I put a
false right but I want that the positive
word which is the 857 which is actually
great should be a true right if I put a
not over here it will basically convert
every true into a false and every falls
into a true are you getting me guys is
this statement clear that if I put a not
over here it will convert that true into
a false and the falls into a true let me
show you how
so if I put a knot here right and
execute it and then I copy paste it here
so as you can see the truhair has now
been converted into a false and the
false has been converted into a true now
why did we do this is this we wanted to
calculate how many positive words do we
have in a sentence right so now what
else do is I simply write sum of none
right when I execute that it returns me
or one by did I do that is because when
I put some and I put in on a variable it
basically calculates how many truths are
there in that sentence
all right and when it does that it
actually gives out the number of true
values so the number of true value is
here is one right so it returned me a 1
and in my example or in a statement as
you could see there were one ball it is
intense in hence I got one not the same
process everything will be same what
I'll do is I will do everything same for
the negative list of words as well so I
will compare the same statement with a
negative list of words and then I will
get a number right so say I get a number
3 so that would basically mean is in
this particular statement I had one
positive word and three negative words
in the end what we'll do is we will
subtract the positive number of words
with the negative number of words and
the resulting number will be the value
of our sentence so for example in our
particular thing say they were one there
is one positive word and then there is
three negative words so if I do that my
number is minus 2 right so minus 2 would
basically mean that my sentence is
negative because it is lesser than 0 and
if you think logically it has three
negative words and one positive word so
it had to be negative right so this is
basically the logic that we are
implementing here so as you can see I am
doing the same for negative matches as
well and then I am putting a scorer so
the score is calculated by the sum of
positive matches - some of the negative
matches which will
actually be stored in score and the
score will be returned by this
particular function which is scored
sentiment all right so this is what we
are doing guys and then the list of
positive words and the negative words
are to be imported from here all right
so I will be putting in the code in your
LMS what you basically have to do is you
have to change the location from here in
this particular code you have to change
the location of your positive and
negative words and once you do that
everything is the same all right now
moving ahead I just explained to you how
the function works now let's look at
these lines right all right guys so in
this line as you can see it says be
score score at sentiment that is it is
calling the function it is passing the
sentences it is passing the positive
word it is passing the negative word and
then just passing the progress right so
this is what our function was we wanted
sentences positive or negative words on
the progress so it is calling the
function over here and whatever value is
returned it is storing it in D score and
our score all right
so what we are doing is whatever we are
streaming we are streaming it in tweet
underscore DF foil our Barcelona and for
a real Madrid we are streaming it in
feed 200 score DF all right and then we
are passing it to score dot sentiment
and then we are getting the score of
both our teams and when the score is
returned we will actually be plotting it
into a cross and by looking at the graph
we'll decide which team is doing better
all right guys so let me explain you how
will you do it with Twitter how will you
stream the Twitter tweets
so before that let me ask you do you
have any doubts in the logic that we
have applied in the code sentiment
analysis code because the logic part is
done we are just going to see how we are
going to stream the tweets from Twitter
all right no doubts okay guys so since
you guys have no doubt let me go ahead
so this is the code for interacting with
Twitter all right
so first you have to get the consumer
key you have to get the request URL the
excess URL the authentication URL all
right so these three things will
actually be the same you can actually
copy paste the same things doesn't
matter what matters is the consumer key
the consumer secret the access token the
access token secret and then this line
has to be executed with all the
parameters now what basically will
happen here is you are interacting with
Twitter and you have to first create an
application on Twitter now how will you
do that you will go on to dev dot beta
comm over there you will create an
application so creating an application
basically takes one or two minutes let
me show you what will be the scene all
right so this will go to dev Witter calm
all right and then you click on my apps
you will click on creating lap he will
put in the name of your application the
description now website is something
that you have to put if you want to post
it to something or you can put a
placeholder here as you can put in any
website google comm or Facebook or
content doesn't matter I just put it in
if this you just wanted to want it for
demonstration thing put in phase or calm
or google.com whatever leave this blank
as empty check this and click on create
your Twitter application so once that is
done you will see your application name
and it will be shown over here once you
click on it you can go to the key and
access tokens and you'll be able to see
your consumer key your consumers secret
owner and the owner ID your access token
the access token secret and everything
alright so this is what you will be
copying over here your consumer key your
consumer secret key your access token
the access token secret key and
everything else is the same
all right so once you have done that you
will execute this particular command and
this command together and once you do
that it will redirect you to the web
browser and it will give you a pill all
right so that pin is to actually
authorize your application that is
authorizing your astral you to interact
with Twitter right so once you enter
that pin you will be connected to the
Twitter and you will be authenticated
and then you will pass this line and
after passing this line you can actually
stream your tweets so I will be
streaming the Barcelona tweets in tweet
one and I will be streaming the Real
Madrid tweets in tweet 2 so the data
that I will be getting will be in JSON
format alright and I only want to access
that tweet text I don't want the other
information whether it was a tweet a how
many times it was retweeted and
everything I just want the part parent I
have the tweet that has to be analyzed
so what I will do is I will convert it
into a data frame so that I can pass the
data and go to
next column where the actual tweeters
right and I will pass the text column of
that width to these coded sentiment
right as you can see tweet underscore D
F dollar text means the text column
under tweet underscore D F pass it to
the scored sentiment function wherein it
will apply the sentiment analysis
algorithm to it and calculate a
particular score all right guys so this
is basically our code let's execute it
so first let me include all the
libraries let me clear everything from
here right and then let me include the
positive and the negative words awesome
now let me run this particular function
run awesome so there are no errors that
means it's working fine and then let me
connect to my Twitter so you have to
execute these lines first right so let's
run them now it will authenticate me to
a new page where I will have to click on
authorize app and copy this pin in my
ass to do
so I'll be copying the pin here in your
console all right so once I paste it
here I'll hit enter there will be no
errors so that means you have
successfully connected so once that is
done I will execute this particular line
once this particular line is executed
you are set
that means Twitter is working fine so it
says using direct authentication and it
gives me the arrow bar again that means
it has executed successfully all right
so now I can stream tweets so let me
clean tweets for Barcelona so I will be
streaming hundred suites the first
hundred tweets and the first hundred
beats for Real Madrid answer all right
let me do it for all of them together
all right so it has successfully caught
the tweets and then let me convert them
into data frames all right they have
been converted right so let's have a
look at ours
Barcelona to eat first
as you can see these are the tweets
Kyle's right so as you can see Diego is
GD but in front of the pores Messi no a
source all right so that this is these
are the tweets that we have streamed all
right now let's see for Real Madrid as
well so it is tweet
to undersquare D s dollar text
as you can see so Cristiano produced a
pinpoint cross we are back in the way at
one go yellow card focus bureau as you
can see we have all these streets right
so now what we'll be doing is we'll be
executing our function so we'll be
getting our function here will be
executing it for b-school and our score
as you can see it's a hundred percent it
has completed our school has also
completed let me show you the bus and
score first
all right
so it has categorized each
creak like this so the first tweet is
neutral second tweeters neutral 19 tweet
is negative twenty fifth weed is
positive 28 Wieters positive 37 tweet is
positive 40 second tweet is positive for
the third Peters - 147th is - 152 so on
alright so this is a score guys alright
let's do it for our score also let's get
this Real Madrid score
so that is this is the score for Real
Madrid as you can see second tweet is
one sixth Street is one nine tweet is
one so these are all the positive ones
minus ones 41st is minus 140 a tweet is
- this is very positive and then you
have 47 tweet for a ninth wheat let's
look at the 48 wheat rice let's see if
it is really positive or not
five hours to go hala Madrid
oh this is the 39th Street with one sec
it's first and then this one so what
year does this one yeah
attic winner from my user quarter-final
right and then so this also do all of
this happen what happened removed in our
cleaning so as you can see cleaning is
very important because if he didn't
clean it wouldn't have been able to
partial but we had cleaned our statement
our sentences and it would have got the
text out of it and it calculates that
this tweet is actually very positive all
right now we have got this course now
let's plot them on a graph to see which
team won right so let's get school for
Real Madrid first alright for so the
Real Madrid has a score of 0 to minus
0.5 so basically our number of treats
for 0 are more positive we have some we
have like 15 or so positive code so this
is basically 0 rise and minus 1 is
basically the same as 2 right but we
have a lot of ones and on Real Madrid
score let's check the be score that is
the Barcelona score let me take a
snapshot of this
all right so this is the Real Madrid
score let's get the bar square now this
is the bar score now as you can see guys
this is the real madrid score it means
women for you this is the buzzer score
and this is the real America so as you
can see the new truths are more for
Pasha when it is closed 60 but as you
can see the number of negative codes are
more for your parsha than your let me
zoom this as well let me take a
screenshot of this this is the Barcia
score
all right let me get the real matron
graph again so as you can see guys
comparing both these graphs it's
actually pretty evident what I'm trying
to show you that in the case of basa you
have neutrals as more but as you can see
the ones are also in the 20s range that
is the positive tweets are in the 20
frames but if you compare it with real
madrid again scores are in the 20s range
right the minus one is somewhere near
three or four right and this course
provides is something near six or seven
but my plus one the same as in this plus
one is 20 and plus one is 20 here as
well this is also kind of similar right
so what we can get from this is
basically Twitter has shown us that
there are almost similar guys but if you
look at it more closely basa has more
negative tweets all right and so as you
can see from the graph guys so Barcia
has more negative tweets so minus one
has around five or seven tweets and
minus one here has like three or four
tweets right so that means Real Madrid
won all right so this is something that
you can do with sentiment analysis so
according to the tweets on Twitter Real
Madrid is winning as of now so Real
Madrid is actually winning on Twitter it
has less negative tweets but if you
compare it to the positive feet so Real
Madrid and Barcelona are on the same
number neutral comments we are not
counting in otherwise Barcelona had more
neutral comments but Real Madrid is a
winner according to us so this was our
demo guys moving ahead let's discuss a
use case now in sentiment analysis where
and we will be seeing where
intimate analysis actually use in real
life for it so it is used to enhance
customer experience all right
like I said so our sentiment analysis
basically categorizes into three things
I see the positive it's either negative
or it's either neutral so companies can
detect the comments of customers based
on sentiment analysis based on their
products or based on the experience of
the service that they are provided to
their customer and they can rate it
according to positive negative and
neutral and they can actually improve
this service according to this feedback
because if you would have noticed there
are a lot of times when you are talk to
customer service people you are asked to
give a feedback later on right and that
feedback is actually to improve their
own service now if you were to do that
on social media you can ask the feedback
straightaway right so you have to go
through each and every comment that a
customer posts on your particular
product so you can enhance the customer
experience as and you can increase or
you can better your product by actually
going through the feedback that you get
from customers by applying the sentiment
analysis onto it and actually there are
lot of companies in fact most of the
companies that applause based companies
actually work on feedbacks and actually
using sentiment analysis in one day or
the other right so guys this brings us
to the end of our session
