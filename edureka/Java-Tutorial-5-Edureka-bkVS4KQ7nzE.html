one present today my name is vineeth and
I'll be the instructor once again so in
today's class we'll be going to a few
input/output streams that is how to take
input an output using the Java classes
as well as we'll look into the dynamic
allocation address how to store data
dynamically right using RLS hashmaps
hash tables right so first of all we'll
start with input and output moving on
input is the data of what we give to the
program right you enter the input using
your keyboard you just the program asked
you to enter a particular value or data
you just enter use your keyboard to
enter it and that is called input that
value is actually used in that program
itself output is the data what we
received from the program in the form of
result that is displayed on the console
window in case of Java programs what is
stream stream represents flow of Dada
Dada is sequence of data okay so entire
sequence of the data is actually
considered to be a stream now to give
input we use input stream and to give
output me use the output stream
Nichols's hello vineeth i hope i'm not
it not too late
no you are not late this is the first
page of this slide today okay moving on
how input is read from keyboard so this
is a small deck diagram to explain how
the input is taken from the keyboard
this is a system dot in class okay it
represents keyboard to read data from
keyboard it should be connected to input
stream heater using the input stream
reader what happens at trees data from
keyboard and sends that data to the
puffer Rita
it reads data from the input stream
reader and store start and buffer it got
methods so that data could easily be
accessed right so this is the diagram
these are actually linked like this
system dot n inputstreamreader and
bufferedreader whenever you create an
object of bufferedreader you write
buffer data within that you pass the
inputstreamreader and within that you
pass the system dot n
Nichols's the last night we had just
under understood what is input that is
what the user gives to the program what
is output that we receive on the console
window word is stream stream is the flow
of data and for taking input we use
input stream and for receiving output we
use output stream so this is the first
slide I hope you are clear with
technical and everyone a few piece right
down on the chat window are you guys
clear with it till now this diagram as
well you'll understand when we use
bufferedreader
what is this linking connected to or
send data to shows what it depicts okay
okay everyone says yes that's good
moving on reading input from console
input can be given either from a file or
keyboard input can be read from console
in three ways the first one would be the
perforator the second one is string two
tokenizer and third one is the scanner
okay so these are the three classes
using which you can take the input from
the console so we will go through them
each one each one of them one by one and
first of all we'll understand what is a
bufferedreader how to use it so I guess
guys you are quite in you're quite
excited to understand how to take input
from the keyboard right from the user
because since the starting of the class
that is Java classes this was the first
push this was the first question that I
will receive from you guys that is how
to take the input from the user and I
said that will be going through it in
the later classes right so first of all
you use the class that is bufferedreader
you create an object of thought equals
to new operator bufferedreader within
that as it is connected you write
inputstreamreader
okay you connect it to inputstreamreader
and within that you pass system dot n
that will be the keyboard whatever you
press comes to inputstreamreader like
that okay now if you let's say you want
to take an integer value write int age
equals two bufferedreader dot read read
is a method that is present with
bufferedreader using that you can take
in
value from the user string named
bufferedreader dot readline red line
will fetch a string from the user okay
so this is a method within that method
you can use these functions which are
present with bufferedreader
okay so let's go to eclipse without
wasting any time and we'll see the code
for bufferedreader okay
so first of all I come to
inputbufferedreader code so this is the
code right here that has preferred
reader buffer data you create the object
new buffered reader within that you pass
an input stream object and in that you
pass system dot n as an attribute right
so you have created an object of
bufferedreader using which you can take
the input from the user
now I print a statement that is enter
your name first of all second as I
create a string variable in that I am
storing bufferedreader dot readline that
means whatever string that has been
entered by the user is getting saved to
this name variable similarly I ask for
the age and age has been saved like this
that is integer dot parseint
bufferedreader dot readline I can anyone
of you tell me why I am using this right
this why I am writing integer dot
parseint all of you please write down on
the chat window why do you think I am
using integer dot parseint nickle says
typecasting ok
so what is the necessity of typecasting
over here
astro states convert string to indeed
your exactly correct
what is happening this bufferedreader
dot readline actually gives the output
as the return type is a string value but
you want to save it in integer so what
you are doing you are passing that
string value to integer value my anxious
to convert the string to integer Yogesh
a string to in convert Emmet raised by
default system takes everything in the
form of string ok that's good what if it
is not possible I didn't get your
question Nikhil I I think you are trying
to say that if it is not possible to
pass a string into an integer right okay
so for that what you can do let's define
one more h1 variable that is int h1
equals 2
bufferedreader dot read so this is one
more option for you read will give you
an output as an integer type so it is
quite easy to use I wanted to show you
that you can also pass the string and
save it in the H by H variable okay so I
hope it is clear now when I run this
code enter your name so first of all I
will give my name that is beneath now
enter you age my age is 90 I have a need
19 years 90 years old okay so I hope you
have understood how to use this
bufferedreader right here please write
down on the chart window each and every
one of you pronoun says yes run all
right you are right buying sends me
smiley Nichol says yes for about the
rest of you so I say yes yogi says yes
so you'll understand in a better form
when you start using it by yourself
okay expectant with it try to pass
different kinds of values try to take
inputs differently and you will get your
doubts clear okay I come back to my
presentation once again and I can't do
spring tokenizer
that is the second class using which I
can take the inputs it can be used to
accept multiple inputs from console in a
single line whereas bufferedreader
accepts only one input from a line okay
so you can only pass one name if it is
passed
if you want to pass it so in one line
you can pass only one name using the
perfect reader but if you are using a
string tokenizer you can pass many
inputs but just by using a delimiter
what will be a delimiter it could be a
comma side right so it uses a delimiter
space or comma to make the input into
tokens now you write buffer data you
create a buffered reader so that you can
take the entire line as an input after
that you define the tokenizer object and
you pass the entire string that was
taken by the buffered reader you pass
common where ever it finds a comma it
understands that this is the first token
and after the comma there is a second
touken present right so that's where you
can take multiple inputs so similarly
name in age is being taken so I go to
eclipse and I open the program for the
tokenizer itself so I have it here now
buffer reader you create the object but
simple to understand enter your name and
eight separated by commas so gamma will
be the delimiter and whenever this
tokenizer finds a comma it understands
that before the comma is one value after
the comma sign there is the second value
so once you create the object you pass
the string that you have saved using the
buffer data here and you pass the comma
that will be a acting as a delimiter now
you create a string object name equals
to tokenizer dot next token okay so it
will save the name first one into the
name again you declare a variable age
because you know that this after the
comma they will be H present so you
write integer dot parseint tokenized a
dot next token now why I am passing it
to integer right now it is because it
will return me an object type okay so I
have to convert it sorry this will be
also a string type that I will be
passing it back and saving in the H
variable when I run this code enter you
name it separated by comma so write
finis comma 24 and I press enter so I am
Vineet 24 years old okay I run this code
once again all right we need this time I
give my complete name with a space just
already comma 20 food anything okay now
tell me
just enter it will I receive an
exception or it is fine will it take the
output and print the entire result or it
will give me an exception all of you
please write down on the chat window
last time I only passed beneath I should
have said it's fine Nikhil there is no
error when say that's right absolutely
it has tried now I run this code once
again let's try one more thing the same
Winnie Joker baby , I give a space now
24 now will it give me an error please
write down on the chart Pinder everyone
Nikhil says no - no Ashraf says no what
about the rest of you yogi says no how
much what do you think my wish
promises I don't think so ok then so
I'll just press ENTER and this time I
receive an exception why exception
because you are passing the delimiter s
comma but in the console when what you
did after the comma you pass the space
so it is not taking that space ok does
not take it like that hence it is giving
an exception now if I put a space here I
save the file run this code once again
this time again I pass Winnie comma
space 24 now what happens this time will
it give me an error
everyone please write down on the chat
window man says no Oscar is no error
okay everyone say is no error exactly
correct this time it won't give me an
error any error
one more try ok so that's that is how
your doubts will get cleared what if now
will it give me an error
pratik says no errors what about the
rest of you - exception ok this time and
I won't go with you it won't give me any
other because now it can accept spaces
as well ok one final try I just got an
idea again
what what happens now if I press Enter
pratik says errors what about the others
Ashraf says no error all of you please
write down on the chat window man says
no error
Emmitt says no sign says chatter already
24 okay he says beneath won't be printed
it will be an exception why because in
the delimiter you pass a space okay so
whenever it finds a space now it is also
thinking a delimiter but the delimiter
is still not complete right so it gives
you an exception so these are a few
properties that are present Nikhil
you'll have to try it on yourself
putting the multiple telemeters
absolutely it is a string I placed it
now running part will be your duty okay
consider it as an assignment and you'll
get the answer and theoretically yes you
can use it okay I hope it answers your
query Nikhil okay so string cognize is
done now we come to scanner it accepts
multiple inputs from file or keyboard
and divides into tokens it has methods
to different types of input integer
float strength long double by via
tokenizer does not have okay so stanner
is the best way by using which you can
take input from the user it has got
different method for different kinds of
data types right as well as as you
receive exceptions in case of tokenizer
there are no such exceptions in case of
scanner okay you won't be receiving any
exceptions that is the runtime
exceptions okay because in the compiled
time the wrote a code brooks code in
case of tokenizer but when you run it
you receive an error but not in case of
scanner so I will show you the code for
scanner now it is the best way if you
have to take an input so I come here
quite simple
first printing a string that is enter
your name and age
string name is equal to scanner dot next
and 80 coldest nano dot next end okay
next we'll give you a will take a string
value and next end we'll take and teach
a value now before that you have to
define a scanner that is scanner scanner
equals to new scanner you have to pass
system dot end okay so that you are
mentioning the input is being taken from
the keyboard when I run this code
control f11 and there you name an age so
right we need enter 90
I am beneath 90 years old okay so this
way this looks quite easy than the other
ways of taking input from the user all
of you what do you think is that clear
to you P side down on the chat window so
I says yes simple mike says yes size
isn't clear yoga says yes' nicole'
Pranav says yes ashraf says yes it's
clear and condor per se is yes Emma says
yes pratik says best way of inferred
exactly correct ready fatigue sorry not
worthy
moving on writing outputs to console via
now we have learned how to take inputs
all right the output on console and we
have been using from the debug had a
system dot out dot print what this is
spread is this correct all of you tell
me we haven't been using this print we
are using println always system dot out
dot println what is the difference
between them that is system dot out dot
print and print ellen so he says yeah
prints on the same line amateur is right
now mine says yes ashraf says new line
Nikhil says it prints without new line
Bruno says prints println friends next
line fatique says Linda and means print
and goes to the next slide
exactly fatigue that's the exact
definition println means it first prints
the statement and then goes to the next
line okay it is not so that that it will
first
to the next line and then trade okay
kundo per says it gives a new line
exactly
now you using the right you can pass the
oscar values okay when you pass this
actually the oscar value is being passed
to the right it takes the integer values
and I will be printed using right so
let's see the demonstration as well let
us present an output me okay so system
hello println so what I will do I will
just change it to print I'll just copy
the entire sentence and roll seek and
vv3 statements okay Emmett says I agree
with the thing sorry
Leticia here two objects of system class
out and println please explain it are
you talking about println and this right
he's right down on the chat window
fatigue if yes okay
tilde time I will just show you I run
the score I receive hello hello hello
why is it so and then a okay because I'm
not using println as soon as I use
println in da last one what will happen
a will come in the next line that is
hello hello hello and finally a comes to
the next line
okay ready say system dot out dot
println out and println are objects nah
no println is a method in which you pass
the input and that returns an output on
the console window
okay print println these are all
different methods that takes some input
and gives you output Emmet says why a
comes to the next line it is because I
am using a function that is println
whenever you call this function println
what happens at first prints the line
hello and after that it goes takes the
control to the next
line so whenever you print a what is
happening a is getting printed on the
next line like this hello hello and then
after that moves to the next line and it
prints a say Emma it is clear to you
please write down on the chat window
every one of you are you clear with it
Emma says yes Claire okay I receive all
the aces that's good
okay then these were quite simple
concepts the quite basic ones moving on
now this is a small flowchart for you
okay you can go through it as as soon as
I upload the presentation or whenever
you receive the video okay so these this
is just the flow diagram input/output
streams it can be divided into byte
oriented streams and unicode character
add as the character or byte when you
are dealing with part you can use input
stream in that you've got classes like
file input stream data input stream and
for the output stream you've got file
output stream and that output stream
when you come to in case of characters
what happens you've got reader and
writer input stream reader to read the
data output stream reader to print the
characters on the output string that is
consoled okay so you can go through the
diagram and search understand it okay
this is just the theoretical part moving
on we come to a realist
now some action we'll be seeing some
good practical examples right here in
ArrayList now can anyone of you tell me
what is an ArrayList and if you guys
remember I posted a question on Facebook
community right related to a realist and
only a strap gave me the correct answer
and rest of you who are giving the wrong
explanation for the answer so tell me
guys what is an ArrayList please write
down on the chat window
Emma trace never studied ArrayList don't
worry I'll be telling you what is an
ArrayList today itself
after that you won't say this statement
again yogi says no idea pronoun says
collection of different kind of objects
and data mhh Thanks
okay different kind of objects and data
not the exact point I am not getting the
exact point what about you my and the
rest of you protein says list contains
arrays of objects okay give me the word
the exact word that is actually related
with ArrayList what is the significance
of ArrayList why don't we use array why
are we using ArrayList can anyone give
me the answer to this question all of
you let me know nobody is willing to
answer it okay then let's move on the
ArrayList is a class i LS class is a
concrete implementation of the list
interface ashraf say is dynamic sized
allocation exactly correct
from the per se sequence of data
produces elements the word is dynamic
dynamic sized allocation that is not
present in array if you are if you do
not require the dynamic sized allocation
there is no need for dynamic allocation
then it is always said that instead of
using array list you should always use
an array okay
the early list ILS class is a concrete
implementation of the list interface
allows duplicate values within it okay a
list can grow our string dynamically
that is the main advantage that is the
significance of an ArrayList that is it
can grow and shrink dynamically on the
other hand arrays fixed once it is
created that was big demerit of an array
now if your application does not require
insertion or deletion of elements the
most efficient data structure is array
as I said before right so I hope Hemmer
than each and every one of you now are
clear what is an ArrayList and what is
the significance of an ArrayList so this
is a small diagram that depicts an
ArrayList so you got ArrayList that is
present in you to Java size 5 the size
of the ArrayList is 5 right now because
5 elements have been inserted like Raja
Ravi dodgy make
Sonny and Arthur okay so it will come
like this index always starts from 0
that is 0 1 2 3 4 like this okay
now has anyone of you seen the source
code for an ArrayList the actual
implementation of an ArrayList please
write down on the chat window and on
this node I lost also ask you a question
regarding ArrayList Emma chase no what
about the rest of you so I says no yogi
says no Astro says yes pronounce a J's
mine says yes yes and no okay ashraf and
pro now can you tell me where i can find
in my system the code for an ArrayList
can you tell me
can you start in this from instead of
zero no conserva it is done in key given
that and it will be starting from zero
itself Ashraf says Java dot util
ArrayList package ok you are quite
specific but I would like to show you
maybe I have forgotten but still let's
try go to C Drive in your systems as
well go to users
sorry not users go to program files in
that go to Java folder the job folder go
to jdk now in the jdk half you can find
this RAR file that is SRC file that is
source okay just open it up in that
you'll find java you'll find util and
within that you can find ArrayList right
you can find out a list dot java so this
is the code so everyone can you now find
where is the code for a realist when you
open at top you'll find it like this so
just try to paste it somewhere do
something and try to find out how it is
actually implemented okay so everyone is
that clear to you this was just some
extra curves I wanted to give it to you
so that you can find out you can tell
someone that yes I know where is the
source code present on my system for an
ArrayList similarly you have got the
source code for each and everything
present on to your system in your JDK
okay moving on there are several methods
that are present with an ArrayList that
is like boolean odd you pass the object
you can add an object using the odd
function void art you pass the index and
you pass the element that has to be
added boolean add all you can pass the
entire collection you cannot entire
ArrayList like that within this object
not get you pass the index and you can
get the object of the ArrayList set you
pass the index you pass the object and
it will set the value now object remove
int index you just have to pass the
index you can remove the value or the
object or the element I traitor now can
tell can you tell me what is the
function of
this hydrator okay I traitor is used
fetching technique pronounced a is
exactly for fetching technique science
is maybe Luke yes it axle has a loop so
that you can retrieve the elements of an
array list using I traitor
let's try traitor index off index of
gives the index of a mine says repeater
now index of gives the index of a
particular element last index off you
can use all those functions and try and
see what are the desserts that you are
receiving right size gives the size of
the ArrayList clear clear CRLs okay so
first we'll understand what is an
ArrayList and we will see how to trace
the elements of ArrayList so I come here
in an ArrayList okay I've already used
in I theta right here
so I declared an array list of a string
type so RLS string is new ArrayList I
passed this string so this is the object
of an ArrayList that I created after
that I use the add function to add the
values so dot add Rose not at Lilly
tottered jasmine and finally root Rose
Akane so what you can understand
duplicate values have been posted into
the ArrayList as well as using the index
to I am removing a particular element so
if I pass to can you tell me if it's
element will get removed
everyone please write down on the chat
window if I pass to as the index which
will be the element that will get
removed my I stop say jasmine pronounce
I and yogi says jasmine exactly correct
Mary says just mean exactly now I make
an object of an eye crater which is
using the which is telling that a string
type will be there in the ArrayList so
you write R theta equal to ArrayList dot
I crater okay you task it I traitor with
here a list now using the I theta you
can access the element by using a
function that is passed next so in while
I theta dot has nest till the time it is
not
Falls okay it will go inside string
element I treat a dot next to string
okay you can convert the value to string
and save it in the element and finally
print the element so when I run this
code I receive the answer Rose Lily Rose
because I actually deleted the value
that was present on the second index now
if I write system dot out dot println
and I mentioned that is a realist
okay RLS dot index off and within that I
pass Rose but can you tell me what will
be the result that I would receive on
the console window come on guys mum
Ashraf says zero maybe say zero Nichols
a zero
maybe says two ostrov says zero and you
guys a zero Nichols a zero pronounced a
zero size is zero and three max is
yellow and petits a zero okay I run this
code and I receive okay since I am
printing in while loop it is getting
printed again and again okay around this
code again so Rose Lily Rose and I
receive zero in the end okay because Sai
says on an exception no it won't give
you an exception it will read the first
element at got the index and it will get
back okay it won't go for the second
element right now if I what I do I come
here or a list dot get index
now if I pass to itself
now tell me what will be the result that
I would see a chef says Rose do you
think is correct
Yoga says rose what about the rest of
you all of you right down on the chat
window be quick okay everyone says rose
so I will press control and f11 I
receive Rose once again that's good
so you similarly you can use different
functions that are available with an
ArrayList and you can try it okay can
experiment with it getting back to the
presentation now how to trace the
elements of ArrayList you can use for
each loop you can use I theta you can
use lists I traitor you can use
enumeration and of course you can use
for loop simple for loop while loop -
while you Condor per says how to remove
an element if we don't know the index if
you want to remove the element you can
just pass the name of the element there
is a method available okay when Delta is
that fine okay so we'll be seeing each
one of them first of all before each
loop its action similar to follow it
races through all the elements of array
or ArrayList okay no need to mention the
size of the ArrayList just you have to
write for bracket string s and you pass
the ArrayList underscore name now what
is the significance of this line no need
to mention size of an ArrayList you have
to mention the size of the ArrayList in
some other loop is that so please answer
my question and I have forgotten to ask
you a question that I said once you
answer this question I'll ask one more
question to all of you everyone please
write down on the chat window do we have
to mention size in case of re less than
some loop we need to keep track of index
to access them Nikol says ok the actual
significance is that in for each loop
you do not have to mention this size but
if you are using a simple for loop you
have to give the size of ArrayList as
well so you will be using the ArrayList
that is a realist underscore name dot
size function so
that you can get the size until that
time you can iterate the loop okay but
in case of for each cube you do not have
to do that you just have to pass the
structure like the RLS right here and
since you know this ArrayList is storing
the string elements so you create an
object string you create an variable of
a string back and datatype
okay so type of data stored in ArrayList
and finally the name of ArrayList this
is how you will be using science is
ArrayList dot length no in ArrayList
length is not the property in ArrayList
you have got a function that is size
using size you can face the size of the
array the length of the ArrayList okay
now a question for all of you a tough
one let's see how many of you know the
answer to this one what is the default
capacity of an ArrayList is it five one
zero it depends on programmer or ten
science is size with parentheses or
simple size I said it is a method not
the property of the ArrayList so it will
come with parentheses all of you cast
your answers what is the default
capacity of an ArrayList ostrov says I
think five okay all of you be quick
cast your answers pratik says depends on
programmer pronounced a is five what
about the rest of you guys be quick only
62% of the people have voted till now or
abouts are on mercy have you given your
answers please write down on the chat
flow
sighs is option 3 for both the rest of
you guys please answer this question
what is the default size of an ArrayList
a mole location I encounter per run of
nickel pratik sighisoara was he Yogesh
everyone give your answers
I request you to do that give a wrong
answer if you do not know the right
answer then yogi says it depends on
programmer 71% have voted after such a
big request ok I'll give you the answers
now out of the people those who have
voted 20% say is that five is the answer
70% says it depends on programmer and
10% says the answer is 10 and the
correct answer is 10 exactly where
vector array has capacity of 10 exactly
10 will be the answer 10 is the default
size because an ArrayList actually uses
arrays so that it can carry create
dynamic ArrayList okay so just go
through a research on Guardian and get
your answer Nikhil says I got right
though it was a case exactly Nikhil that
is the right answer 10 and when that was
a good answer
Emmett says lost internet connection
thereby lost 20 precious minutes of my
life okay
don't you worry you will be receiving
the recording of the class Emmett so you
can go through that as well as whatever
that kicked out you have you can just
post it on the community all these
people are present in the community
they'll help you out okay
I'm sure they'll answer your questions
okay then so you have seen a for each
loop let's go to eclipse and see how to
use a forest you four okay first let I
think that we should understand other
loops as well
now we come to I traitor okay how do you
use it
I traitor is an interface that is used
to traverse through the elements of
collection it traverses only in forward
direction with the help of methods so
just remember it can only go forward
if you want to move backward from one
position you cannot do that using an eye
traitor so it has got certain methods
like bullion has next element next or it
can remove the value switches which has
a return type that is void okay so you
can use Annihilator to traverse an
ArrayList which only moves in the
forward direction I hope you'll remember
this moving on displaying items using I
traitor you right I traitor create an
object or LS dot I traitor
while ArrayList thought has next it is
returning a boolean value because while
will take a boolean value so it is true
if the next value is present it will
move inside and you'll get the next
value and you'll save in the object okay
you can print the object after that so I
hope you are clear with an eye traitor
will be seeing the example of all these
I traitors and different loops for
accessing the ArrayList all together
okay so at any point of time if you have
any confusion or query you can write
down on the chat window every bar I come
to list right eater
now what is the difference between I
traitor and list I treated the
difference is a list right it can go
forward as well as in reverse direction
Sola started is an interface that
traverses through the elements of the
collection it traverses in both forward
and reverse direction the methods are
hash next next remove same as the I
theta but it has got boolean has
previous and element previous okay so
these are the methods that are available
with a list I traitor method right so I
hope you are clear with that in I today
you have got top three methods but in
list I tutor you have got two extra
methods for the previous element so that
you can reverse you can go in the
reverse direction as well moving on
displaying items using illustrator you
come here let's try to draw a list are
it a equal to or a Lestat list or a
traitor you open up the while loop
within that you passed has next if it
has got next if we go inside it will
face the next value even you can check
for the previous value as well okay
because in less started you can go in
the opposite
direction as well now this one is the
enumeration one using which you can
access the list that is a realist
so enumeration is an interface whose
action is similar to I traitor
but the difference is that it has no
methods for deleting an element of
ArrayList it has got has more elements
that is quite similar to has next method
and it has got next element that will
give you the element itself okay so in
that it was next in case of I traitor
but I theater has got one more method
that was removed but this enumeration
does not has that method so all of you
are you clear till now with all the
structures that we can use all the
methods that we can use to traverse an
ArrayList now enumeration example is
right here that is collections or
enumeration you pass the ArrayList
within that while enumeration has more
elements will check it you will just get
the element and you could use the
element in your program you can print it
out as well so all of you let me know
are you clear with it everyone please
write on the chat window I request you
to do it I stop says yes it's clear what
about the rest of you buying say yes
sunny says yes mhm is could you please
repeat one salmon if I repeat it on the
Eclipse itself with would it be fine
with you okay that's good so let's go to
examples now now this is the insertion
for another list let's see it afterwards
you have already seen the insertion so
this slide should be starting right okay
first of all I will show you the simple
ArrayList okay so you have got the RLS
this is how you are the name of your
array let's just list itself you add the
text that is element
and three into the ArrayList using the
art function now first of all you using
the normal for loop that is the simple
for loop you write for you past list dot
size okay so the it will run till here
and it will print the elements of list
that is the ArrayList I'll just comment
here at rest of the part and I'll run
this code when I run this code I will
receive text one two and three this is
the normal loop I hope you are quite
clear with it
control seven now I come to the second
loop right here that is the for each
loop for a for loop you do not have to
pass the size of the earliest you just
passed it less right here that is the
ArrayList and you mentioned which kind
of value does the ArrayList contain so
you write string and those values will
be saved in step one by one and you'll
keep on printing there when I run this
code I receive again the same result
that is text one two and three for each
loop okay so all of you are you clear
with this that is the forest loop right
down on the chart window you just have
to write Y for yes and n for no may be
says is ArrayList ring and list string
same no they are not okay actually list
ArrayList is the part of list right so
after that you are mentioning ArrayList
okay from the Perseids yes even if I
mention if I change it like this that is
ArrayList it will be fine okay so you
were using less because ArrayList is a
part of list itself I hope it clears
your doubt nervous okay so let's move on
to the next one
let me say yes I come to the third part
all of you guys keep writing try to be
interactive even I feel it good so
system dot println while loop the
one you initialize a variable you've
mentioned the size and greater than J
when I run this loop I receive the same
result that is text one two and three so
quite simple to use to get the elements
of the array layers printed on the
console window and finally now I will
show you the isolator we have already
seen the eye tracker as well nitrate are
you certain hydrated or the string I
traitor you set it to the list itself
that is the ArrayList and finally you
use the hash next and you print the next
value in the time it has got a next
value so I run this code again and I
receive the same output okay so these
are the ways you can use to access the
elements of a list now let's see the
other ones now how few methods that has
been demonstrated now there was a
question from hammer or I guess ponder /
that is if we do not know the index of
the item then how can we remove it you
can parse the string itself the item
itself it will directly remove from the
ArrayList okay you can use the card item
to get the element at a particular index
you can pass the item itself like this
you can use different methods now let's
come to enumeration and different
methods that are available for you to
retrieve the elements from a collection
so first of all I come to an iteration
main so I will be using enumeration
right here ArrayList
okay there're goes off now now ArrayList
ring I created an ArrayList a dead rose
just mean and do you live within that
after that I created an enumeration type
I used collections dot enumeration and I
passed the ArrayList within that that is
flowers okay now I run the while loop
enumeration Ladd has more elements okay
this is the method that is available
with enumeration and you just save the
object you save the value in an object
right here dot next element okay because
the value that has written right here is
an off is off optic type you want it
string so right string object it will
also save it it right here run this code
Rose Jasmine tulip I receive on the
console window since I am only using the
print command if I use the println I
save the file I run this code again I
use Rose Jasmine to live so all of you
are clear with enumeration then I will
move on to the next one everyone please
write down on the chat window it is
quite simple concept to understand I
should say yes I say yes
Nichols's yes what about the rest of you
from dipper says yes the teach a J's
when says today no two-minute break let
me just finish with all these things and
then I will take a two-minute break okay
and I will give it to you as well my ACK
so I hope you are clear with enumeration
still there are many people in the class
but I am NOT receiving a lot of yeses
from you guys
neither the nose okay so I would request
everyone to be interactive now creating
an ArrayList this time we'll be using
okay this is a simple forest you've that
we have seen all already I just simply
run this code again and I've seen the
same output if I change it to Ln it will
go to the next line running the code and
right here I go to the third one that is
the I traitor one how to use an
my theta we have already seen this idea
as well so I'll be sending all those
examples to you so you can use it you
can see different examples that has been
implemented this code Rose Jasmine tulip
Akane finally I come to the list
hydrator this is the new Bond all of you
please because please concentrate right
here so I will just add the
unimplemented okay so or a list that is
flash same inputs now I am using a list
I traitor that a string list I hit of
flowers dot list hydrator till the time
it is God has next Hillary T object okay
so I just just like to show you one more
thing that is the list I traitor dot has
previous okay if it has got a previous
value what it will do it will print that
value system dot out dot println and
within this I've used the list i tater
dot sorry not next previous okay and I
save the file now now tell me what will
be the result that I would receive all a
few please write down on the chat window
everyone a trick question for all of you
I will also tell you the answer I'll
also figure it out
okay Paris's rose - mint julep Rose
Jasmine tulip just mean rose okay man
says reversed output no man give me the
exact answer don't give me reversed
output or it has not the reverse fun fun
de bercy's Rose - spin all of you please
write down on the chart Filner it is
just for your test just to test your
skills okay you can see whether you have
learned something or not sign says Rose
Tasman give me the entire output sign my
on tulip jasmine rose
okay I'm not say study say Jasmine Rose
I am a chaste julep
jasmine rose mine says maybe - Monroe's
no guys you're not getting it right I'll
just run the code for all of you okay it
is giving me a lot of roses right here
let's see what is happening okay has
next
it will always has a previous value that
is what is happening okay so instead of
checking it okay
so let's change the code abet so
although everybody is wrong here great
testament says okay so what I'll do
okay if let's define a value okay in
teacher I equals to zero I pass it in
here I'm also incrementing the value of
I so introduced about debugging in
Eclipse also pratik says okay
so I come here if the value of I is
equals to first time it gets 1 the
second time it comes it will be 2 right
if it is 2 or if it is I equals to 3 0 1
&amp;amp; 3 in those time it will just print the
previous value as well I hope I will
receive a result this time and I receive
rose Jasmine Jasmine Jasmine Jasmine and
then again Jasmine and then I come to
you live okay so what is happening okay
just will try to figure it out and I'll
send you the code right and I want the
result that has all of you no doubt any
problem I need the result first of all
I'm entering three entry status Rose
Jasmine and you live right now I want to
use an ArrayList I will be using the
functions itself and I want to print
Rose jasmine then again rose 10 tulip
then jasmine okay so rose jasmine rose
kulick jasmine
so everyone try to solve this question
and post it on the community itself even
I will do it for you if it is possible
if it is not possible just write down on
the community and it won't be attained
and this is the result that could be
repeat that could be attained MHA is
repeat so the question is I a math
assignment would be you have to make an
ArrayList in that you have to enter
three elements Rose jasmine and tulip
first Rose will go then jasmine will go
and then tulip will go after that you
have to receive an output you have to
make a program that will give you an
output that would be rose first then
jasmine then Rose then to your left and
then again jasmine
okay so all of you are you clear with it
I clear with the problem please lie down
on the chat window Rose jasmine rose to
your lip jasmine okay Kondapur says yes
Claire if I just check for two
okay I equals 2/3 as per let's run it
once again Karos Jasmine gain Jasmine
Jasmine to them if I just simply remove
this Ana run this coat okay it will
absolutely go into the infinite loop
okay then we'll be trying it on our own
okay everyone so let's get back to the
presentation once again and these were
the insertion that is you can use the
add function to insert a value into the
array LS you can use the remove function
to remove a value either through the
index or using the element itself right
finally how to display it you can use an
eye traitor simply you can use a for
loop or any kind of loop you have got
numerous methods for doing this
particular job I hope everyone is clear
with that moving on we come to hash
marks now okay how to use a hash map in
Java so the hash map is a class which is
used to perform operation such as
inserting deleting and locating elements
in a map you have to create a map in
which you pass two kinds of values one
will be the key and the other will be
value okay using key and value pairs
you'll be putting those values in the
hash map and whenever you have to
retrieve a value you will be using the
key so that you can use the value right
so the map is an interface map keys to
the elements
maps are unsorted an unordered map
allows one null key and multiple null
values okay as I told you that the
values are stored in a format that is
key and value now the key could be a one
key could be null in the entire hash map
and there could be multiple values that
could be null in the entire hash marks
okay so remember this key act as indices
and can be an
the objects as well okay so this was the
overview of an hashmap moving on there
are several methods available with hash
maps as well so you have got put method
object key and value simple method
enumeration keys it will face the keys
enumeration element fetch the elements
object get of you pass the key and
you'll get the object and with that key
the value that is associated with that
particular key contains earth key if you
want to check whether this is present in
this hash map or not you'll be using the
contents key moving on contains value
you'll have to pass the key and yeah if
you want to check you'll be using this
method object remove you pass the key
and you can remove the object if you
want to sighs you'll be using the size
method and if you want to convert it
into string you'll be using two strings
okay so these are several methods that
are present that you can use along with
a hash map the diagram right here this
is the way the hash map gets created
these are the elements ideas right you
can place the key and there could be a
corresponding element right like this
that is Ravi Rocchi mega Sonny these
values can also be empty these could be
null multiple values could be null in
the hash map okay so all of you are
clear till now I hope you are because no
one is actually replying today everyone
is feeling sleepy I don't know why now
let's see how to use it ashraf says yes
same as associative array Nikhil says
Banksy's yes now create a hash map you
use the hash map keyword hash map equals
two new hash map putting elements hash
map but you pass the key and you pass
the value pass the key you pass the
value like this you are putting the
values inserting the values into the
hash map now how to display the values
you get an eye traitor I trade are equal
to theta equals to hash map entry set
dot i traitor this is the difference
than are less because the values are
actually present in a set right so for
that you'll be using entry set dot I
traitor okay you get the entry set and
then you run the I theaters you'll get
all the sets into the I theta after that
while I traitor has got next you right
map dot entry entry get an entry mapped
out entry I traitor dot next that entire
set will come here then using the entry
you can get the key separately and using
the entry you can get the value
separately and you can use it in your
program so all of you let me know do you
have any doubts right here please write
down on the chat window
all of you ashraf says no what about the
rest of you guys i'll just call out your
names a math a mole location my ankh meh
wish nickel protec roms sarah bossy
Yogesh pratik says what is a map map in
which you can store values using a key
you use a key you store values there is
a corresponding value available with
that particular key okay
amateur is clear ashraf says no sir
Astro visit it is not clear to you
please write down on the chat window i
will explain it once again i should say
it's clear okay then so before moving to
hash table but he says what here i trait
reducer okay let's come to eclipse and
we'll understand what does the isolator
do first answer my question what did the
i traitor do in case of a realist and he
tell me pratik show values pratik says
actually it help you do the to help you
to traverse the elements of the array
list similarly when you have to traverse
the elements of the hash map you'll be
using a knight
it will get the entire elements that is
the set elements into the I traitor and
then you can use the function that is
called that is has next and next and
then you can access the values that are
present in those sets is that clear
pretty please write down on the chart
interface ok pratik says ok now come to
hash m'a ok now we have got a hash map
that is taking this key as a string
value and the value that is the data
that is available that is associated
with the key is of double type okay so
string and double hash map equal to new
hash map and you put the parenthesis and
a semicolon after the hash mark dot
Portus of method using which you can put
the key value pairs into the hash map so
you pass Ankita
and the corresponding value is nine six
three four point five eight similarly
you put the second value vishal and one
two eight three point four eight
similarly the third one and the fourth
one finally in order to traverse the
hash map what you are using you are
using an eye traitor so what you write
eye traitor now can you tell me what
this question mark is representing what
value should come instead of this
question mark please write down on the
chat window everyone
ashraf says any class okay I guess the
ashram is trying to tell that it is
representing it could be any class
though can you tell me what should be
the exact value that you it should come
here in the eye traitor anyone okay then
I will give you the answer the answer
would be the string and double okay
because the eye traitor has been created
like that
okay I'll just incorrect number of
arguments for the type I traitor II can
be / maitre is with argument string and
the boo okay that's a mistake so if I
just changed it the string let's see
what happens okay that was the mistake
because it is a kind of entry right and
that entry will have string and double
values so I traitor will get objects of
entry and it will store those objects
now after that what you will be doing
you will be using the hash next method
you'll find out if there is a next value
present if it is true goes inside you
get the entry from the hash map using
the next method and then you use a
method that is get key entry dot get key
you display the key you get the entry
dot get value display the value so if I
run this code on the chat window you
receive we saw Misha Ankita
Virender okay so all of you are you
clear with it how to use a hash map the
declaration the putting values inside
that and then using an isolator so that
you can traverse the hash map please
write down on the chart window everyone
Amol say is no sir what is the problem
that you are facing a mole just write
down on the chat window and what about
the rest of you so if you can please
write down on the chart why the fourth
entry not printed okay I'll run the code
once again
okay we have got Krishna Vishal
uncle and Gurinder okay Graham says okay
and if I use collection start sort list
sir
let me just check whether I can pass the
hash map within this or not no sorted
order is this petit says no actually
this ordered order is not like this okay
I'll just tell you I will just find it
out why it is showing like this okay it
should come as it is entered right here
that is Ankita then this Vishal then
this could in the ran Krishna but it is
giving a result in an unordered way the
rest of like Vishal comes first K
constant V any and then good in the ash
maps are unordered exactly correct
Nikhil that is per absolutely thanks for
reminding me again there because they
are unordered that is why we are
receiving these kind of results so all
of you now you're clear Amol is it clear
to you you can say okay predictions
order order is this machine chisel also
I am late because of college practicals
you mind machine mind says yes clear
what about the rest of you all of you
please write down on the chat window you
clear with hash map which says yes you
guessed ACS okay then so we got the
answer why they are unordered why we are
receiving a result like that because
these has hash paths are unordered okay
now we move on to learn hash tables the
hash table is a class which is used to
perform operations such as
inserting deleting similar to a hash map
similar to hash Muhammad also has a key
and a value but there is a different
status it does not allow null Keys and
null values okay neither a key could be
nearly the value could be null in case
of hash table the only difference
between them is hash table is
synchronized whereas hash map is not by
default okay now how to use a hash map
you have got these methods with hash map
as well that is put keys elements get
contains key contain value remove size
and to straight okay
okay I'll give you answer predict just
give me a minute we'll come to that part
also okay how to insert the values into
the hash table now so you write the hash
table are stable equal to new hash table
you just use the put and you pass the
key and value pairs that is Ankita we
shall go render Krishna and you pass the
values right here okay as you did in the
hash table now to display the values I'm
using enumeration this time anything
could be used I theta could also happen
used in this case okay so I use
enumeration enumeration equal to hash
table dot keys you pass the keys to the
enumeration using the keys you'll be
fetching the items so enumeration dot
has more elements string key enumeration
dot next element to string and string
value is hash table dot get you pass the
key in that and you convert it into
string value and finally you print the
values all the elements that are present
in the hash table will be printed like
this produces difference between I
traitor and enumeration as I said the
only difference between hydrator and
enumeration is that there is no remove
method present in enumeration you cannot
remove a method using an enumeration
okay
so are you clear with this please write
down on the chat window if you are clear
man says you have Claire petite says yes
the peak says okay what about the rest
of you yogi says okay Ron says Claire
okay then let's get to eclipse now I'll
close this part and I come to the hash
table okay similarly I created a hash
table string double hash table called a
new hash table string double I put these
values like key and value right here key
and value now I use the enumeration okay
now I'm only taking string value because
I'm only saving the keys okay I'm only
saving the keys in to the enumeration
right here so these were the string
values the keys were strength hence I am
passing strings right here then I write
while enumeration dot has more elements
till the time it has got more elements
this loop will keep on running you go
inside the right strings key you get the
key that is enumeration dot eight next
element dot two string and using the key
I pass that key into the hash table and
I get the element I converted into
string using the two string method and
finally I print the string in the
console window so I run this code okay
and I received a result vishal krishna
Gurinder ankitha okay so this is the way
you'll be using a hash table please
write down on the chat window are you
clear with it can ash my job
Massena I didn't get your question
I stopped says Claire Rahm says okay
what about the rest of you and machine
if you can just explain your question
once again yes
pratik it is also an unordered list can
display multiple values I didn't get
your point displaying multiple values
means it will always be present in key
value format okay it will always be
present in key value format so you
always have to use it like this using
the key you can fetch the value in the
hash maps and hash table
so all of you figure if you have any
doubts you can ask me everyone
okay
I've got a question from fatigue any
method for sorting this yes there is a
method as are you as I was using that is
collection not sort you can use the same
method within that you have to pass the
hash map or the ArrayList okay you have
to make converted into a realist that is
you pass the map entries and then you
pass the type into that and then within
that you pass the comparator okay you
will be using that I will be sending a
post on the community itself on sorting
a hash map or a hash table okay is that
fine with you Preity you can go through
that that time everyone will can see it
the teks is okay let's get back to the
presentation once again just note it
down so that I don't forget it to post
so all of you can you all list me down
the topics that you learn today everyone
and if you want to talk about anything
any doubt that you have in your mind you
can just put it up on the chat window
itself everyone so let me know when just
pen down just list down the topics that
we went through in today's class and if
you have got any doubts you can write
down on the chat window itself
no doubts and nobody knows the topics
that you went through in today's class
I just know about hashmaps as I was late
machine says I'm all says use ok you can
actually make it whenever you have to
save two things right like two
particular things you made a
two-dimensional array when you have to
use two things simultaneously right so
in those cases photo will be doing you
can make a hash map right so key and
finally will be actually associated so
you can Simon it simultaneously use the
key to find the value as well are you
getting my point of mode okay mine has
listed few of the topics I must have
given me topics Yogesh everyone okay
that's very good at least guys you're
speaking at the end of the class okay so
since we have got some time let's try
something out okay not necessarily will
receive a result but absolutely will try
something okay I'm all set example let's
say I have to print the corresponding
lay names like I want to print the roll
number and the name of the student right
simultaneously I have to use it so what
I can do I can make a hash table or hash
map and can print the name
simultaneously one two three like that
okay one and then comes we need one then
comes some old sorry to come oh come
some old three comes fly and four comes
mercy in fifth counts pratik okay this
way in those cases you can use positive
is that fine them all okay so I've got
keys into my enumeration what I'll do
I'll create an ArrayList so write
ArrayList
alright string
equals I'll name it as list I'll name it
as Keitha
okay equals to new ArrayList and comm
semicolon right so after that key dot
add because I'm adding a value to the
RLS I've opened the braces sorry
parentheses and I close the
corresponding parentheses right here
so first all these values all those keys
into the ArrayList now this LS has got
all those values instead of using this
statement right here I'll just cut this
one ctrl X and I'll move the statement
out right here okay now I have all my
values present within that within the
key ArrayList
I'll call collections dot comparator is
one way I'm showing you one other way
using which you can do the head I just
got an idea so let's try it that is what
I'm trying so I passed my ArrayList into
that so this will this should short sort
the list okay that is the ArrayList it
will sort the key okay I have to move
this out right here so this would short
sort the keys in ascending order and
finally what I will do I run a for each
loop sorry
for each string strain I passkey and
within that I'll move this statement
ctrl V and then I'll move this within
that Alt key plus value now it will be
equal to string keep a string over here
that is right again I'll print the
string itself
E
and here also it will print string okay
let's save the file now Nichols's bye
thanks for today's lecture
Nikhil were just a while now as you can
see a GK and Rashad
so all of them has been sorted now right
so this could be one way using which you
can sort it so all of you are you clear
with this so what I did I save the key
that is on kita on the basis of key and
sorting each and everything so I save
each and everything in the ArrayList and
finally what I did I ran a collection
dot sort and I passed the key so it
sorted the Keen vehicle that is present
in the ArrayList after that I run a for
each loop in that I passed the ArrayList
and using the key I am fetching the
values and displaying the corresponding
key and value on the console you know as
it is right now so predict is a question
answered and rest of you let me know
are you clear with this what I have done
right now the experiment I did right now
pratik says yes k what about the rest of
you are you clear with it
Emma says yes Amol says he is - AJ's
never says yes machine say J's Aaron say
sir please repeat advanced yogi says yes
okay around what I did at the last time
what we were doing we were using the
enumeration and printing the entire
elements there and then when we are we
were doing that we were not receiving a
sorted result okay since it was not
after that what was done
I used a collection start sort and I
passed the entire ArrayList into that
okay so when I passed that this sort
method will sort the elements of the
ArrayList after that since all the keys
are sorted now so we have sorted on the
basis of the RLS now we run before each
loop in Folly to you by past since I
know that the values that are present in
ki are string values so I
make an object of string that is
spraying itself a past here Ellis I come
here in the forest loop inside that I
use the hash table dot ket I pass the
key not a string okay
and I converted it into two strings so
the value will get converted into two
string and it will be saved in value so
it will print the key right here that is
string and it will train the
corresponding value so are you clear
with it please write down only Aaron
says yes that's good okay pratik says
our idea of debugging please give me a
small idea now for debugging you can use
the debugging tool right here okay that
is available okay so you can run it and
this is the sort shortcut available and
I will be showing you a demonstration a
small one in the next class okay I have
a question well can we start with not
after 5 p.m. or if possible at 6 because
you two working days we have our
business and versity rooms actually this
time has already been decided for
dispatch so I am afraid that it won't be
able to change ok it will be from 4 p.m.
to 6 p.m. only I guess ok if you have a
still if you want it to be done just
send a request send an email on support
email id that is support at the rate and
delay card or 10 and if it is possible
it will be done and all of you will be
notified okay but for the next class it
will be from 4 p.m. itself okay Aaron
says I came late server hash table is
used now on in the cases where you have
you need the values in pairs that as you
want to display for the role numbers of
a class with the corresponding names of
the students okay so in those cases you
can use a hash table so one will come
then the name two will come so you can
save the roll number as key and you can
save the name as the values with that
key okay similarly you can find many
examples where you can use hash tables
Rahm says well the record of this
session can be found from where the
recorded sessions are sent on your email
ids okay on each and everyone's email ID
we send the recorded session along with
the code that was taken in the class
okay if it if you cannot find it in your
inbox so the problem is you would not
have added a new record or ten in your
contact list if you would have done so
sorry not a delegate or ten the ID that
is support at the rate at you record or
ten after I'd add that email ID then all
those emails that are coming from this
email ID will land in your inbox okay or
else if you are not finding it you can
go to your spam folders and check for it
you will find it there is that caroms if
you sp side down on the chat window and
says ok and the recorded session can be
uploaded on to other side except YouTube
because YouTube is blocked in many sites
sorry for so much questions that's fine
but the process is already been set in
this company that is we'll be uploading
the videos on YouTube and we'll be
sharing the links of those YouTube
videos okay so I won't be able to help
you with that
drums I hope it answers your question
around hash map is also used in a
similar fashion now in sometimes what
happens you need to pass null values
okay you can view in different keys you
have to pass different null values in
those cases you will be using hash map
because hash map can accept one null key
value and multiple null values
corresponding null values okay so I hope
it answers your question I don't now
please write down on the sharpened edge
yes
or given guys okay pratik says break
time actually it is going time okay
perfect
I have to cover all the topics aroun say
yes Aaron received the record you'll be
