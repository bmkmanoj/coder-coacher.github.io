development environment it's basically a
code editor so this is IDE I just showed
you up for a dinner which I had was
device krypter with a lot of code editor
so you can use any code edit editor
which you use so the one which we'll be
using in class is py charm
so I guess most of you must have
installed you buy a charm unfortunately
I did not install Peabody come I'll be
doing it today itself so that we all are
on the same page but you use it you use
anything it's one and same thing right
but I'll use py charm also because you
will also be using it so saying how can
you download so you can download P my
charm from the link given below
JetBrains dot-coms tasks evite charms
that's download and then you can
download it from the Community Edition
but I guess you don't have to download
py charm if you install virtual machine
and the Python entire package which they
have given you a look as given you and
run Python through the virtual machine
you have ey charm in that virtual
machine pipe and itself so all those who
have installed a virtual machine Oracle
Virtual Machine and are able to run
Python through virtual machine or Oracle
I guess you you are able to log in
through py charm or is it giving
something else because I have not
installed it yet I generally use coding
dot comma py descriptor say how to go
into Python C should have started from
here so how to go into Python just right
fighting and press ENTER you get the
Python terminal command line
so in your terminal even my Python us do
it again as this says so that you know
yeah and we got a pipe in command like
so Python is also interpreter basically
it leans reads other Python commands and
execute them they are compiled
automatically before it's kind by other
interpreter so once you're inside spy
then the command just type command to
not much he happen and you just then
right press ctrl + V to exit exit from
there just let's try something let's
write print under course
did you know welcome to the world of
Python so let's do this will write brain
so this is welcome to the world of
Python so please everybody do this so
first thing I did I wrote print
undercoats welcome to the world of
Python and present it will show whatever
was inside that quote and the second one
had wrote X equal to 0 1 2 3 4 5 and do
you write X it will show you the entire
box this is whatever you have you know
allotted to eggs so these are two basic
command which put it but it's very
important to the basis also</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
