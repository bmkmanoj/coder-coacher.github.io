all right so at present what we did was
we read something all right we that read
something back from the website all
right and what we read was an HTML code
now what usually we do is we actually
work on the JavaScript object notation
we always work on TS all right whenever
we have to read some data from the web
service we use make use of JSON object
so JSON if you all know is a JavaScript
object notation which is a data exchange
format
all right tell us that is you want to
send some data across you want to print
some data from web service to mobile
device from mobile device to web service
we always make use of JSON object all
right
there's all objects are the one that are
based on key value pairs so there is a
key and there's a value associated with
a key so whenever we are reading back
information we read it back with the
help of a key the key is a string and
the value can be a number it could be a
string it could be a boolean or it can
be an complete object so this is this
follows proper syntax all right
they found follows a proper syntax so
the syntax that it follows in that data
whatever data I have is in the name
value pairs the data is the one that is
separated by the comma all right curly
braces are the ones that pulls the
object remember curly braces hold the
object square braces holds the area
powers
can you all see this our one object
inside the curly braces multiple objects
inside our square braces can everybody
see this object relations here let me
show you something
I have already sounded here I have a
sample JSON that I got from that very
documentation it's free where you can
see that can everybody see the objects
and
in everybody see the JSON object said
that I got retrieved using the JSON
blackberry or sample data any person who
has any doubts understanding the data
exchange format can respond back on the
chat window anything that you have in
order to know about how the data is held
back in the JSON objects can respond
back on the chat window I hope everybody
is clear with sure I'll repeat it for
you Rahul if you see here a Rahul if I
talk about a JSON object notation what
happens is it data that we have to store
our stole as a name value pair all right
the data is represented by or say
separated with the terms of objects by
the help of commas curly braces are the
ones that holds the objects and the
square braces are the ones that whole
array of all you can see an example all
right example which holds a single
object an example which holds and carry
a hot and you see here I have a sample
JSON that I've got from blackberry
documents which holds multiple objects
inside this approved operators right and
if you see here from the top to bottom
there is an area for alright let's move
ahead then so here is my main activity
to take a look at my main activity what
is my main activity containing my main
actually contains a static your I hope
now you understand where exactly is the
use of JSON objects so what I'm going to
breathe back from the JSON object are
these values vehicle type vehicle color
cue and the thread type so these values
I am going to read back from the object
that I get from the JSON here if you see
I have created an analyst of hash map it
contains a spring or strength so
hashmap perilous which I call as
dishonest right but it's just that you
show was asking me about what all are
the exchange formats why we need JSON
objects vishna so I was just telling her
that whenever we get some type data
downloaded all right Tom declined to
from the server to decline tariff share
with you which is enough
so this is what we were talking about
then what we create is I created a list
view object so this listing or object I
am going to populate from the data set
that I get downloaded using the JSON
object set so here I have created a
progress task which extends the async
top three parameters can anybody tell me
what all are these three parameters here
everyone we have just covered the async
task um some time back
I need the sponsors from everyone spring
integer string URL the progress and
there is a that's correct Krishna
so the URL that I have to pass has to be
of the type of friend now if I talk
about the second parameter it is boy
that is I'm not using any integer
parameter here I'm not using this object
at all then the third parameter is the
queen
so the boolean is not going to be the
result it's something which will notify
me whether the download has got done or
not all right so this is something that
I have here now I create a dialog box
here all right
initialize the style of box on the basis
of the activity context right now say
see what am i doing on the pre executed
Krishna now you will be getting to know
what am i doing in the pxq I am sending
a message to the dialog box and I say
show the dialog box all right any person
having it without still here
person having any dollars
for everybody to respond back krishna
osha net pen any doubts
everybody to be interactive come on guys
I want every one of you to be
interactive
who should I need a response very soon
onto the chat window if this is clear
just respond with a why if it's not just
respond with the question that you have
all right I'll move on it then if I'm
not getting any responses back on the
chat window I'll move it
this is on post execute which will not
talk about right now first of all we'll
be talking about doing bad drop what am
i doing in the doing background we have
a JSON parser object right so I have
created a class which is parsing the
response for me you all see here after
the ridges on parse of class all right
so I have created a class which will do
the parsing for me I go onto the main
activity and see I'm getting a JSON
object analyst from this class object
not get JSON from you all a passing will
be URL from here and I'm getting a JSON
analyst let's see what this method is
doing for me pass then the URL to this
method we had a stringbuilder object we
had a Depot HTTP client
HTTP GET the quest response straightest
line let me tell you about them I'm
checking the straightest line here
because I want to know whether the URL
or the web services up or down if it
gives me a status code of 200 that means
we status is up everybody got my point
here what am i doing with the help of
this key this line let me know how to be
charged window any questions any queries
that you have here
and we'll start the cold reading again
sure I'll do that for you sir
which one from the very beginning or
this one you just tell me which one do
you want me to read up this method
object or do you want me to take you to
the main activity shop all right from
the method onwards see I have created a
stringbuilder object then what I have
done is I have created a default HTTP
client my HTTP client will make use of
the URL that is beep aha
so this method identity one from this
method create a response object by
executing it against a twist
Here I am checking for a straightest
line today's line I'm checking for
because I want to know whether my web
service is up or down just ask a does
check on to the web service or all right
whether the web service or say the
hosters up or down that is what I'm
going to do stay the same for any doubts
if you have we can respond back on the
chat window let's move ahead then then I
check whether my status code is equal to
$200 but whether the web services up
what am I doing here is I'm getting to
respond sent to be converting it was
input stream creating a bufferedreader
out of the input stream same method same
same everything that I did for reading
the HTML content all right
I can get the reader again reading it
from line by line and appending it to a
string builder once I have appointed
everything to this front builder see
what am i doing
I'm just converting the string builder
to a spring and creating an array of
JSON objects very simple create a new
JSON array and pass in the string to it
which will return you
and catalyst of this or not any person
having any doubts air finally returned
the JSON area from there let me have any
doubts that you have onto the chat
window
can I have responses back on the chat
window really quick pressure on a pen
the whole osha
let's move to mainactivity them so I've
got the drift on air LS all right from
this method now what I need to do is I
need to iterate through the object list
of the JSON and push information onto my
list view
so I say when I iteration till the time
I have objects in my JSON analyst create
object from getting the JSON object at
index I so I get the complete object one
single object get the values can be
values from the object which is way too
tight
vehicle color vehicle fuel vehicle trade
on the basis of he names you see here
I'm having a teen a male I'm having a
female associated with everything can we
just check this out so I know the ski
name because I have actually agreed upon
a data exchange format so I know the key
name these are the comedian's that I'm
making use of I get the values in the
various objects create a hash map all
right then I will be putting every
single value inside the hash map I've
placed you like hash map object list
with the help of key name as the value
inside the index and the value as the
value when we have hash map and then I'm
adding this hash map single object to
the JSON list of array hash map a create
a list adapter which is going to take
each is on list as an argument list
alright and r dot layout that list item
alright as you want that I need to show
the data on and you can see that what am
I having to show the data here is I'm
having a few text views I'm having to
text user to show the data in fact I'm
having four text fields to show the data
the data has to be filled up with tag
vehicle type way to color through tax
rate so these are the feelings that I'm
reading the values from and these are
the value all right so does what am i
doing
placing the integer or say the textviews
with the value that I have inside my
arrow and finally sending the adapter to
the ListView this is all the wrong way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
