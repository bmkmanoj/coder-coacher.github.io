classification algorithm that we are
going to see is Thomas decision tree it
is one of the more most fundamental
technique in classification and it's
widely used and typically gives very
good performance ok and we are going to
see how to be a machine learning model
for decision trees ok and then we will
also see how to use that model to make
predictions as well as how to build such
a model in our and then evaluate it
ok so we'll go through this entire
process of dividing the data set and
then building the model validating it
and everything in the context of a
decision tree Albert ok we already saw
what is learning so we don't need to go
into that so let's take an example ok so
what is the classification problem you
have bunch of records historically the
cuts and then you have some answer
associated with it which is called as a
class gravy and then we need to build a
model so that whenever a new record
comes in we need to be able to predict
predict the answer right predict the
class level now let's take let's be more
concrete and let's take an example ok so
I want to decide whether I should play
football or cricket or whatever it is
whether I should play the game tomorrow
or not ok that's the decision that I
want to make and the decision I'm I'm
going to make the decision based on the
weather conditions that are projected
tomorrow ok so I look at the temperature
I will look at whether it's going to be
clouded or not or whether it's going to
be rainy or not ok so depending on this
criteria I am going to decide whether or
I want to decide whether I am
I have to play or not ok and how would
you do that essentially the way machine
learning happens in this particular
scenario is that it takes a historical
data ok
did I play daily for Esther day and what
was the temperature what was the weather
training with it's windy and like play
four days back what is the temperature
what is the budget and rest of the
weather conditions along with the class
level which is playing or not playing
okay
I have bunch of Records record and then
I believe my a machine learning model to
to predict for tomorrow okay is it clear
forever the scenario and how machine
learning is okay great now I will show
you how a decision tree looks like okay
I mean let's say we build the model on
this historical data and we got the
decision tree and let's see how they
would look like and then we go back and
see how to construct such a tree okay
and that when you look at the tree
it's absolutely intuitive and trivial to
understand so let's look at that so this
is how such a tree would look like okay
forget about this numbers for now so
what is this tree is this essentially
first asking okay what is the outlook
for tomorrow whether it's sunny cloudy
or rainy is it sunny
if it is sunny then I go and check the
temperature if it is less than 30 I will
sit late if it is greater than 30 oh
it's too hot and I will descend don't be
okay and similarly if it is clouded then
I'll go ahead and say play and if it is
rainy then I'll check the wind speed if
it is to wind it and I don't play if it
is less windy I'll play so this is an
example of a decision tree and you know
exactly why it's called decision tree
because it looks like a tree and it is
helping you to
make decisions on playing or not playing
okay and these numbers are essentially
the historical records that are
distributed across across a tree okay so
in the historical data I looked at last
two weeks of data so there are 14 values
that means 14 records each with playing
or not playing answer okay and initially
there were nine play records and five
don't play records and then once I
looked at the outlook there were five if
sunny records for cloudy records and
five rainy records out of all 40 okay
and then similarly the in that five of
sunny records they were like two for
playing and three for don't play and
again if you divide based on the
temperature they were two for playing
when the temperature is less than 30 and
there were three don't play records when
the temperature is greater than 30 okay
so these numbers are simply the training
data which is your historical data that
is distributed across this decision tree
okay so this tree is very very easy to
interpret
right so tomorrow if I want to make
prediction I will ask you what are the
independent variables which are outlook
temperature and windy so you will say
okay outlook is sunny and temperature is
25 degrees centigrade and windy is equal
to false okay this is the input result
that you are going to give me for
tomorrow and then I will see okay I have
to go through the street to make the
decision right so first I will say
outlook what did you say for outlook for
tomorrow it's sunny so I go here and
then what is the temperature that you
told me for tomorrow it's 25 degrees
centigrade so it's less than 30 so come
here and then I will decide I will go
and I'm going to play so I declare the
answer to be playing
okay so that's the prediction that is
made by the model is that clear to
everyone
is a clear water decision trees we will
now go into the details of how to
constructing such a tree okay now given
this tree there a bunch of more
terminology so they're a bunch of things
there's something called the root node
which is the first attribute that is
evaluated and then there is a branching
node which are these intermediate nodes
okay and there are some leaf nodes okay
leaf node is a place where you kind of
made a decision right so as soon as we
saw temperature is greater than 30 we'll
say it's oh it's too hot and don't click
right so that is the decision node in
which you made the decision so that's
and it's it the last level in the tree
and therefore it's gold leaf node okay
now obviously in order to construct such
a tree what are the questions that comes
to our mind okay the first thing
foremost question is so we have three
attributes right outlook temperature and
windy or not now out of these three
attributes watch they choose as the
first attribute to spew top right so
here we are splitting our data set based
on the outlook but who tells me that
outlook is should be the first one why
not temperature why not windy right so
that's the first question given a list
of attributes how do I choose my
splitting attribute okay which one to
choose
a piece cloudy will be again leaves mode
because it's not going I mean it's not
branching out anymore because at this
point itself you'd be made the decision
and therefore its is to leave no okay so
the first question is which variable to
split up
whether in in the root node as well as
in the intermediate nodes and the second
question so okay you check the
temperature
you check the outer loop you need to
check the temperature and then you need
to decide should I check the windy also
all there am a happy to make a decision
right so how long should I go down to
make a decision right so again you have
a stopping criteria that we have seen in
chemins right when do we start our
process of building the tree in k-means
it was like when do we start the profit
when do we stop the process of updating
the clusters and here the stopping
criteria is when do we stop when do we
stop building the trip okay
and then the final question is that once
I reach last level okay how do I make a
decision here so I told you that if it
is less than 30 I am going to play if it
is greater than 30 I'm not going to
click okay but how did they make the
decision right why do they choose play
here and don't click it and why did I
choose don't play here and then play
here right so that is a choice or the
decision that you make in the leaves
nope okay so those are the primary
questions one needs to answer in order
to build a decision tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
