and I welcome you all to this session
today we are going to discuss top 10
reasons as to why AWS is an absolute
must when it comes to learning it or
using it to solve various business
problems so let us move further and take
a look at these reasons one by one
firstly on this list we have security
now there has always been a debate as in
whether cloud services are secure or not
but aid obvious puts all these debates
to rest it provides you with security
that meets the need of both small scale
and large scale businesses plus what it
does is it provides you with complete
security that means your business owners
can focus more on the business goals and
don't have to worry about the security
part now there are compliance programs
which help you set up your security
better and also provide you with
real-time security that means you can
have real-time insights on various
vulnerabilities and security issues
hence if security is your concern don't
worry it abuse will definitely help you
solve that next on this list we have API
interface provides with various
programming api's so if you are dealing
with different programming modules don't
worry it will take care of that as well
plus what it does is it helps you have a
strong infrastructure programmatically
you can launch instances you can take
backups and also focus on those ALW
resources which would help you save time
and money next we have recovery now I
just discuss security and yes security
is important but that does not neglect
this point that is recovery the quite a
few businesses in the market which
cannot tolerate downtime they have zero
tolerance for it in that case having an
application that serves a recovery
purposes well is very important now AWS
provides you with platform which is very
versatile and also provides you with
various recovery tools
hence recovery is also taken care of by
it appears next on this list we have
customization
now what AWS does is it gives you
various features to customize your
application send your infrastructure
much better features like tagging or
having user defined tags lets you manage
and monitor your resources
much better plus what it does is it
gives you various options where you can
track your costs you can automate
various things and what this does is
this helps you customize your business
much better hence if customisation is
your concern definitely again a device
will help you solve all your problems
now since I've mentioned the word
automation let's go ahead and discuss
this feature which is automated
scheduling now aw snails with various
instances and it is very important that
you know when to start and stop these
instances this is where automatic
scheduling comes into picture since you
can schedule instances much better your
services like ec2 and RDS can function
very well because you do not have to
worry about day being in a running state
when there is a downtime or when the
traffic is very low plus there quite a
few third-party tools which help you
eliminate coding or scripting completely
and these features go very well or very
hand in hand with your scheduling
features hence these two features are
very important when you talk about
choosing a very strong cloud service
provider and ADA obvious is definitely
one now next on this list we have
consistency and reliability
now aid abuse is an extremely useful
platform when you talk about backups and
disaster recovery that is why it is
highly reliable plus what it does is it
gives you negligible outage and very
less downtime yes there was a time once
when the outage was very high but it has
dropped down a lot and they have been no
outages whatsoever even the server which
was taken in recent times prove that it
provides you better reliability or less
or negligible outage compared to other
service providers like Microsoft or even
Google hence if you talk about
consistency and reliability
yes aid abuse is again the best next we
have pass offerings now aid abuse is
highly scalable and it replicates this
feature into various other services
which interviews provides you with say
for example we have database we have
caching issues we have data warehousing
transcoding storage and even application
management now all these things can be
scaled up and down very easily and very
using AWS and ADA based priority with
the pass platform that also helps you
solve various other problems what this
does is this lets you set your business
up very nicely or your application and
infrastructure very nicely plus this
means that you are spending less on the
setup and all those things and you end
up saving a lot of money now third on
this list we have global architecture
yes Erebus is a global leader when you
talk about cloud services and it has
achieved that thanks to its wide reach
so how does AWS do that when thanks to
its global architecture again now it has
various locations in the world where it
has set up its data centers and those
locations are called as regions and
these regions they have various data
centers or replications where they can
hold their data basically and these
replications or these data centers are
known as availability zones enon leader
base has somewhere on 16 regions and
around 40 availability zones all across
the world so that means no matter in
which corner of the world or which part
of the world you are based on you will
have some data center or region close to
you which you can have access to so that
when you talk about getting your data or
processing your data using all these
services you do not face any lagging or
downtime issues whatsoever
hence global architecture does come into
picture and since AWS has such a great
global architecture all the more reasons
why one should learn it or use it in
their businesses next we have another
very important point that has
scalability this is one feature on which
aw cedilla is highly because when you
talk about cloud services you are never
sure as in how many compute capacities
you need or what is your capacity for
your computation plus how much space you
would be using and these things they
vary on real-time basis so estimating
these things can always be an issue and
this is where a doubles comes into
picture what it does is it provides you
high scalability you can go ahead and
use those resources which you want and
if you want those in a more quantity you
can go ahead and you can scale it
further if you feel that there is
downtime or the traffic would be low in
these R's of the day you can scale it
down as well
that means it is highly flexible and it
meets all your scalability needs
basically last on this list we have
pricing now this is a very important
point money is important to everyone and
when you talk about businesses if you
can optimize your money there's nothing
better for you what a double use does is
it serves all your purposes think of
yourself as a student or person who
wants to get started with aid abuse you
have something called as a free peer
what it does is it gives you access to
all AWS resources and lets you use those
freely for one year yes there is certain
data limit or limits on all these
services as in how much can you use
these but they would definitely serve
your purpose when it comes to just
learning those for businesses don't
worry you have a model called as
pay-as-you-go what that means is you pay
only for those resources and only for
those are during which you use these
resources yes
AWS transition early basis and it
charges you very less that is the best
part plus this also something else
called as the more you use the less you
pay yes the more resources you use again
you would end up being very less so this
highly flexible pricing architecture of
AWS again salts and meets a lot of needs
of a lot of users and I feel this is one
of the very important reasons when you
talk about using AWS and all those
things so this was the last point in
today's discussion I hope you all had
something new to learn from this session
and I hope you are taking back something
from this one that's it from mine I
would be taking a leave now thank you
bye-bye I hope you have enjoyed
