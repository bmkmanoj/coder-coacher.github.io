welcome to a vegas series of
introductory videos on ServiceNow and
this one especially as a basic video
which covers on what is ServiceNow so
before we get into the nitty gritties of
what is ServiceNow let's deep dive and
see on a high level
what we're gonna cover through so as to
understand what is ServiceNow now
ServiceNow to be made understood we need
to go through some de-facto terms which
are in a buzz words these days in the
industry and one of the most important
words that you see these days in
computing world and technology is the
word cloud so we might as well get
accustomed to what cloud is and what a
cloud services which will kind of detail
on what the capabilities of the cloud is
and how ServiceNow fits into the picture
of the cloud services model and once we
get to know what ServiceNow is we would
kind of deep dive into the high-level
details of the ServiceNow architecture
understand a bit of the software
releases and versions of ServiceNow and
then end on a note of a demo on a
ServiceNow instance which I would be
talking after giving you an
understanding of how to get or procure
an instance for your own hands on
purpose so with that being said let us
understand what is a cloud
well cloud is anything or a resource
that is accessed over the Internet so
what do you need for a cloud well cloud
makes it so simple that all you need is
a browser and internet connection to
access anything over the cloud so now
that we understand cloud we can
understand how and what the capability
of cloud is right because cloud as we
understand is nothing but a connection
of servers or the so called computers
which delivers data and its
functionalities across to the user on a
simple browser and it depends on the
user
and the user base how much complicated
the cloud delivered is being the cloud
can simply be anything from a simple
Gmail like application or email like
application and it can be an enterprise
level application which has many
complicated functionalities depending on
the user now what we need to understand
here when I say cloud is this is solely
owned by a third party so when we say
third party let's come into the context
of whose third party the third party use
nobody other than the company who's
hosting it so in our case here you would
understand that it is ServiceNow so now
as a company or as an organization you
would have your own products and
services being delivered across to the
user and that is where we come into the
picture of cloud services so cloud
services can be any set or a piece of
resource that is delivered across the
customer in a very usable form so it
could very well be a simple email
application or it could be as
complicated as enterprise customer
relationship management application
well the complexity of all those kind of
applications is a talk of another day
but for now in simple terms as a normal
person who uses internet Gmail would be
a classic example of what is delivered
across cloud as a cloud service
now to understand ServiceNow we would
need to know about what are the various
fashions of cloud being delivered as a
service so that is rare and we come into
the picture of cloud deployment models
the cloud services and how it is being
deployed so that the user uses in his
own terms so the first simple model is
software as a service what is a software
to start with software is nothing but a
piece of application which has its own
particular functionality that the end
user uses so you can see very well there
are some examples like Google Apps which
consists of chat applications like
hangout Gmail and other video hosting
services like YouTube
so these are simple software's which is
completely taken care by Google at their
end including the functionalities of the
software as well as the various pieces
of hardware and its own requirements in
terms of even the physical premise
completely taken care by Google another
classic example would be Dropbox who
gives storage as a service you do not
need in your promis-- a particular hard
disk or a server farm so as to have a
huge space to store your service or
whatever your need is now depending on
the complication of the user and the
kind of users that is when we come into
the picture of platform-as-a-service
then it comes to detailed users who
needs a capability to build something on
top of an existing service that is
wherein we have the platform as a
service service now is a classic example
of platform as a service and force.com
also known as salesforce is another
company which is playing huge in the
market of pass or platform as a service
now what is a platform as a service
platform is a service do not just give
the software as a service yes they do
have out-of-the-box set of applications
or software being delivered across to
the user as in the case of Salesforce
for example they do give CRM which is
customer relationship management as a
software and they do give on top of it a
platform where an advanced or super
users or so called administrators can
make their own changes and customize it
in accordance to their own needs so that
is where in the power of platform comes
into picture and so is the case of
service now and in another fork of kind
of the as a service model in cloud is
infrastructure as a service which even
provides further more infrastructure as
a service which we do not have to go
into detail because ServiceNow scope
would come into the scope of a platform
as a service so let's dive in to
understand what is ServiceNow well as we
know that cloud based means that
anything that resides on the Internet
and as you know you need only a browser
and internet connection to access it
service now is nothing but a platform as
a service and it's a computing model
based on the cloud that helps in
providing the infrastructure needed to
Manly it's implement and run any
applications and service now as a
software platform it provides IT service
management applications and helps in
automating many organizational work flow
activities and this work is across an
enterprise and it can be any scale of an
enterprise it can be a small medium or
large scale organization and going to
the history of ServiceNow will service
now was founded way back in 2004 it was
then known as Glide
soft and in the end of 2002 was named as
ServiceNow and the founder is one of the
legends in Silicon Valley and his name
is Fred Larry he is currently the chief
product officer of ServiceNow he is the
founder as well and he has a history
working with many books la-based
legacy applications which came across
through companies known as Peregrine
systems and remedy corporations now here
is a model of how ServiceNow comes as a
platform power of service no platform is
that it provides an integrated suit of
applications to model and automate
various flows of activities across an
enterprise right so it can model it can
store data it can automate workflows and
help process improvements which also
combines the powerful reporting
capability and advanced analytics so in
short term or what we can say is
ServiceNow is a platform which is a
single system of record which is
delivered through one simple user
interface and the usability of all of
these complex organization and needs in
terms of functionality is delivered
across through a platform that's the
power of ServiceNow so ServiceNow is
being used by medium small scale and
large scale industries as you can see it
plenty amount
no one company's here Facebook being one
of them
Netflix most of the huge financial
organization across the globe use a
service now for their own
organizationally so that is a quite
interesting thing and ServiceNow
is actually currently as we speak
capturing a huge market on various areas
because of their capabilities now as we
understand service now and its cloud
model let's go into some details of the
architecture of ServiceNow now some
words and some terminologies for folks
who are closely related software would
know are pieces like server application
servers database engines so on right so
in a cloud model you would be
understanding none of these pieces of
software would be residing at the side
of the customer all of this piece of
software resides at the ServiceNow data
centers so ServiceNow doesn't have
anything in terms of a premised need all
of their technological needs are taken
care inside the data centers so a
service now is basically accessed from
the browser which you can see from this
diagram and the side their service now
takes care of is where you can see the
infrastructure is totally taken care by
ServiceNow including the database the
server on which the application servers
are hosted as in this case ServiceNow
uses Tomcat and Apache as their web
server and all the load balancing needs
even the security needs in terms of SSL
and the latest versions of it is totally
taken care by ServiceNow when we talk
about DB MySQL is by default chosen by
ServiceNow as your database service now
does give the customer his own choice of
database as well but that's a talk for
another day and the ServiceNow platform
all those built in Java gives the end
user or the super user various
capabilities of scripting and mostly
these scripts are in JavaScript and the
JavaScript engine being used to
interpret this is
a Mozilla Rhino based JavaScript engine
now that we know about the architecture
of ServiceNow let's go into details of
various releases and versions that
ServiceNow comes with we know every
software or application that comes into
picture would have their own way of
creating new versions normally these
would follow numbers or alphabetical
order here in the case of ServiceNow
they do follow alphabetical order but
that is along with the name of a
location as you can see way back in 2011
when they had version a it was named
after the place Aspen so on Berlin
before Berlin see for Calgary and the
recent version which came in 2017 July
was Jakarta and they already have in
place the name for the next version and
chronologically speaking we would have
Kingston which is the place that they
have used for the next version of
ServiceNow so these versions that we
talk about are what you call the feature
release which is the major release
including all the minor fixes and hot
fixes along with the various patches and
the new features so in between two major
feature releases you would have a lot of
small hot fixes which would be some bugs
or fixes that immediately require
attention and patch releases are the
ones which comes in between a many hot
fixes which would include all the
previous hot fixes along with some new
additions of bug fixes as well so now we
know about the various versions and
releases that ServiceNow goeth we would
be ending this video of it a
demonstration before which I would be
showing some static slides of screens
which you would get soon accustomed to
when you're gonna get your hands dirty
with ServiceNow so a ServiceNow login
screen is nothing but a normal login
screen that you see and this would be
accessed through the browser URL and any
ServiceNow instance being given to an
customer would have the instance name
dot service - outcomes now the instance
name can be
anything that the organization requires
which if is not registered can be used
which means if you already have somebody
using the same name you cannot use that
obviously so it would look something
like ABC dot service - now.com and this
is something that you're gonna soon see
when I am gonna give a demonstration on
how the screen of service now looks
right so you would see the URL as well
along with it in the demo instance that
you get which is the developer instance
you would have it's starting with dev
followed by a number dart service - now
calm and once you log in as an
administrator there is the standard
screen which obviously is customizable
according to your need but this is
something a normal administrator or a
ServiceNow aficionado would see the
first point when he opens up the screen
which we will go through now in detail
and see so before we go into the
ServiceNow screen let's start by seeing
and understand how you can get your own
personal instance of ServiceNow what do
you need to do for it first thing being
it is completely free you do not need
anything from your end
other than registering yourself with
your own personal email ID
after which you would be directed to
your login dashboard or your developer
dashboard so this is the screen that you
see right now which I have already
registered in my name and you can see
that there are various options that
service in our developer dashboard gives
me so once you get to the developer
dashboard and now that you need an
instance of ServiceNow all you need to
do is go to manage click on instance
after logging in once you create your
login ID so that would lead you to a
place where you would ask for an
instance in ServiceNow and this screen
that you see right now see is after that
I have got the developer instance so
once you register you will get a
personal developer instance which would
look like the name starting with dev and
followed by a number as you as I
mentioned before any instance would look
like and you need to understand that
this is a temporary in
since that you receive which obviously
you can have as long as you wanted but
if you do not follow any activity on the
instance so without no activity for 10
days the instance would be returned to
the pool of available instances so if
you really want to make sure that your
instance is always available make sure
you come into this developer screen and
the manage instance and refresh your
status or extend the instance now that
we have our service now on instance
let's log in now so once I log in I
would be redirected to my home page here
I have logged in as an administrator and
once I log in as an administrator you
would be going to the default system
administration home page now here is
where and we would understand the
various parts of the ServiceNow UI the
ServiceNow UI has three major parts one
that you see along with the logo the top
part which is called the banner area on
the left you have the application
navigator and in the middle you have the
content page and the banner part has you
know your logo which can be customized
by yourself through various
administrative options and the platform
provides you various options like the
connect sidebar which is a powerful tool
helps you chat with various other
ServiceNow users simple use case would
be a user who has logged in a ticket in
ServiceNow and he wants to connect with
the person who's working on resolving
his incident then he can just type his
name and start the chat pretty much and
you can drag and drop various records
here in ServiceNow so that's all the
bigger and the inner capabilities of
ServiceNow as a platform now as a system
administrator you would be doing various
administrative activities and all of
those functionalities are available on
your system administration dashboard
including user administration on the
left as I mentioned is the application
navigator so in case you want to log a
ticket as an incident
you would be going on the left and
typing in incident and you would get all
the corresponding modules and
applications related to it listed on the
left as you can see you can see all
incident module related functionalities
shown up and when I click on incidents
it gives me all the various lists of
incidents which were already raised and
mind you this is a view that you are
seeing as a ServiceNow system
administrator and your role is what
actually changes the permission so
currently as a system administration you
have an admin privilege or the admin
role so these are some of the simple UI
aspects and functionalities of
ServiceNow now for more details you can
very well come back for our next series
of videos you would know a lot about
ServiceNow starting from its very basics
as an administrator to various advanced
parts wherein we would be deep diving
into scripting and whatnot and so that
we can explore the platform's
functionality so by that let me end this
