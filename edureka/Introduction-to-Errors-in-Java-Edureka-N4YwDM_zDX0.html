through over look over errors what are
errors in Java now what about the errors
guys no one is telling me any answers
right now I'm saying design time error
these are the errors that occur while
designing the program so Allah says yes
these errors will be shown with a red
mark in Eclipse IDE so that you can
easily find and correct there so do you
get an overview of nl from these
statements and not just the semicolons
like in the main method if you make em
of the main method capital it will give
you an error in the static keyword if
you make s of a static keyword capital
it will give you an errors Java is a
case sensitive language hence it gives
you a syntax error ok let's see a small
example right here in only one project
that is the final one there's an error
present ok so I open it up static
keyword SS capital it gives me another
because Java is a center case sensitive
capital AB in the main method ok it does
not give you an error now but previously
it would definitely give you an error
maybe in the latest versions now it has
upgraded okay so I'll just change it
back to small itself
no trying time error these are the
errors that occur designing the I've
already showed you the example itself so
these are all the design time errors now
tell me if I place one more semicolon
after this will it give me an errors it
won't give you an error nothing's there
Jenny plus place a semicolon like this
it will it is already and then it won't
give you an error after this okay so
these are few practical things that you
get to know when you actually code
okay bye hit and trial whenever you are
coding sometimes you put two semicolons
at once and then you see oh my god it is
not giving any other so you find out one
thing when you place in the next line
even then it won't give you another okay
so you have understood what is the
design terminal he wants me to put
exclamation mark it will absolutely give
another sorry okay okay then so getting
back to the presentation I come to
errors logical errors these are the
errors turned by programmer that was
syntax errors because of our own sin
takes this does not give error because
is it is a statement terminator
absolutely so if you just put a
semicolon statement has terminated there
was nothing in the statement so it won't
give you an error the syntax is complete
okay that is why it does not gives you a
syntax error or you can call the design
error now what if the syntax is entirely
correct but the logic that you
implemented is wrong so that is termed
as logical error these are the errors
start my programmer the programmers the
programs with these errors will run but
does not produce desired results okay
you wanted something it will give you
something else because the logic within
that does not complete it is wrong okay
like example getting division of two
numbers as output but I expected his
multiplication of numbers okay so what
they actually put a wrong logic you
divided the numbers now these errors can
be rectified by understanding the logic
and checking whether it is it works
perfectly or not so let's see a logical
errors okay it could be many types
generally it happens in complex programs
they are not where you are not very
aware of the logic you are making a new
logic for the new thing so in that case
so when you implement it sometimes you
put a wrong logic and you receive the
errors now there is a program there is a
logical error so let me just run the
code and the answer is 6 right here this
is logical error program the program is
for printing 1 to 5 but it will print 6
okay it will be printing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
