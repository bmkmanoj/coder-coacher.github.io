Rica and in today's session we'll be
learning what is OpenStack thank you all
the attendees for joining today's
session so let's get started so in this
tutorial today we'll be learning what is
cloud I'll give you a brief introduction
to cloud so that you can all be in the
same page when in next topic I tell you
what is open stacks after that we'll
learn OpenStack and cloud and we'll see
all the deployment models of OpenStack
after that we'll take a look at the
OpenStack architecture and take a look
at the different OpenStack components
which are nothing but the key services
that OpenStack provides us and finally
we'll take a look at a use case so that
we can understand how different people
on different companies are using
OpenStack in real life so it's the
agenda here to everyone ok I need it
says yes jason says yes thank you guys
so let us move on to a first topic and
let me give you a brief introduction to
cloud well let us consider your current
scenario so you are using Google Mail
for sending out emails you are looking
at videos you're sharing videos on
Facebook and YouTube you're uploading
your pictures and Google Drive and
you're using Google Docs and
spreadsheets to share your data among
other people and you are accessing all
the services of this application in your
mobile devices or desktop but where are
they actually in well they are all in
the cloud you're accessing all the
services of this application and the
data inside the application which is
present in the cloud but the question is
that how do you actually create this
cloud and what does this cloud actually
have well cloud computing is a type of
internet based computing well because
when you're accessing all the services
and applications that are presenting the
cloud you need to have an internet
connection in your devices in order to
access it now where does all this
applications and all the software life
so how is this cloud
well there is a bare-metal server lying
somewhere around the world and what you
do is that you just lay a virtualization
layer on top of it and then the server
capacity is logically divided and the
services and processing are shared on
different devices for different people
to access it and use it and cloud
computing provides you with broadly
three kind of services where there are
others as well but they can be
classified into broadly three categories
and the first one is the IaaS which
means infrastructure a service there is
the second one which is known as paas or
path which is known as platform a
service and the third one is SAS or SaaS
which is known as software as service
now let me tell you what are these in a
brief way the first one that we're going
to learn is infrastructure a service it
means that it will provide you with the
server and it will help you in
virtualization and after that part of
installing some kind of operating system
laying out more instances or middleware
and then your application and data that
is all managed by you so they will
provide you with a virtualization where
you can actually create up your
infrastructure lay out your instances
install operating systems inside them
and build up your infrastructure the way
you like the next one is platform and
service it means that it will just
provide you with the platform in order
to develop your application and finally
software service is something like you
can say Gmail or Google Drive where they
give you a software that is in the cloud
any access that any you put your data
into it so this is a brief introduction
to infrastructure a service platform a
service and software service and let me
tell you that today's topic which is
OpenStack light in the category of
infrastructure as service so this is a
very brief introduction about cloud and
how things are managed and stored in the
cloud so we'll be learning more about it
okay so under it has a question he is
asking that isn't infrastructure and
service and platform service the same
was not exactly same but they're quite
similar I will tell you that because
when you actually take up infrastructure
and service kind of end up having a
platform only on which you can actually
develop your application but the only
difference is that in platform service
you get let's say operating system
already so that will be your platform
and when you have an infrastructure
service it is going to be some of your
choice or this is something that will be
under your control that whatever
operating system layer that you want to
use in your infrastructure you can set
it up when you have platform service and
either have to buy a platform which is
either let's say Linux or Windows like
that but in the end when you're building
up your infrastructure building up your
application you end up with a platform
only when you're choosing infrastructure
service and platform service so I hope
you have got your answer dude any more
doubt ok he says no doubt does anyone
have any questions about cloud computing
so I'm going to move on to the next
topic and our next topic is what is
OpenStack well in easy words if you have
to understand that OpenStack is nothing
but a kind of cloud service which falls
under the category of infrastructure a
service what open site does is that it
gives you all the components in order to
set up your cloud infrastructure and it
provides you with a set of tools and
different components and services so
this is what OpenStack is and OpenStack
was created in 2010 by Rackspace which
is a very big cloud hosting company and
NASA yes the NASA that sends people into
space and the moon
so they created OpenStack in 2010 and
let me tell you that the open side
community is actually huge there are
contributors like the Giants in tech
world they are all contributing to
OpenStack
like IBM VMware Red Hat Dell HP Cisco
every one of them are in the OpenStack
community and they're contributing
almost now and then in order to develop
OpenStack and the best part about
OpenStack is that it is open source you
can get it for free and you can modify
anything that you need based upon the
infrastructure that you want to create
so this is what we're going to learn
today I'm going to tell you all about
OpenStack and so this is just a brief
introduction and it has said that it is
the future of the cloud computing
because it's backed up by the huge tech
giants in today's era so any questions
on this slide ok no questions so we'll
move on and we'll see
OpenStack in cloud so what can you do
with OpenStack so like I already told
you that it is infrastructure as service
kind of a cloud service and you can
actually add and run instances on it
that you want to you if you can set up
different kind of nodes for different
purpose let's say you can actually build
up your entire infrastructure if you
need any kind of instances in the
development environment you need a broad
environment testing environment and you
want instances to run on each kind of
environment you can set it up all in
OpenStack and it also provides with a
platform like yes under your those
telling you that
you know it's called as infrastructural
service at the end what you're going to
avail is that it's going to give you a
platform on which you can actually build
up your own application and build up
your infrastructure so this is what you
can do with OpenStack and we'll be
learning more about what we can actually
deploy on the cloud and how can we make
up a development environment and cloud
we'll see more about that later in this
tutorial
so now let us move on and take a look at
the cloud deployment models that you can
have using OpenStack now there are 5
kind of deployment models that you can
do with openside the first one
is on permissions distribution now as
the name says on premises means that
your data center is lie in your company
they're your servers and then you can
lay out a layer of OpenStack on top of
your data centers that is what it means
then we've got an open stag based public
cloud and hosted OpenStack private cloud
on the third well let me tell you that
with OpenStack you can actually make
your cloud infrastructure both public or
private or it may be even a hybrid cloud
which is some part of it is public and
some part of it is private then we can
see OpenStack as a service and appliance
based OpenStack so let us take a look at
them one by one
the first one is the on-premises
distribution so what happens here is
that your data centers lie in your own
enterprise in your own premises and
sometimes it's also known as on-prem so
this means the same thing
prem means here premises so your data
centers are there so you just download
and install all the OpenStack services
on your own to create that cloud
infrastructure and these are resides in
your internal network only so this is
basically a DIY a do-it-yourself kind of
cloud infrastructure so you just have
your data centers you just download the
software install all the services get
them all running and then you have your
OpenStack cloud infrastructure and the
next model is a OpenStack based public
cloud so what happens here is that a
vendor provides a public cloud computing
system based on the OpenStack project so
there is a cloud provider who is
responsible for creating the cloud
infrastructure and lay out all the
services in them that you need so you
just go to that vendor you ask for some
services and he gives you with all the
services and all the data and everything
is stored in their servers in the cloud
provider service so this is a very good
example of a public cloud is AWS but if
you want at night let's say a OpenStack
based so you can just ask your cloud
provider or Intel vendor that what kind
of OpenStack services do you actually
require in order to lay out your
application or for your project so your
cloud better will take care of it and
provide you with all the services the
next one is a hosted OpenStack private
cloud now again let's say that you've
got some sensitive data that you want to
remain that you don't want to exposed an
outside world or you cannot rely on
other people's servers to store your
data so you can just ask for a person or
you can ask a cloud vendor to lay out
all the services for you in your
internal network on your hardware
and all the management will be done by
the cloud provider the person was
actually laid out all the opposite
services for you so that will be done by
them it will be fully supported by them
they will only charge you for support
for if anything goes wrong otherwise
everything else the data and the
application that you will be actually
implementing them on the cloud
infrastructure will be handled by you so
this is a hosted OpenStack private cloud
the next one is OpenStack as a service
so in this kind of deployment model what
happens is that your cloud provider will
install OpenStack in their system they
will actually have all the services laid
out in their own cloud and if you want
to avail any kind of services let's say
you want the compute service for your
development of your application so you
can just ask for the service from your
trunk vendor which is giving out
OpenStack services for you so you'll be
charged on the services that you of it
and finally there is last deployment
model which is the appliance based
OpenStack so there is a cloud vendor
which is called nebula and they are
selling appliances and appliances are
software that does not require our
operating system to run so this can be a
service which is like pluggable service
that you can avail when you actually buy
the service or that pluggable service
which is known as appliance and you can
use it in your open send deployment or
your OpenStack cloud infrastructure that
you'll just set up so these were the
cloud deployment models any questions on
that any questions guys okay so let's
move on to our next topic which is the
OpenStack architecture so these are the
components that actually make up the
OpenStack architecture so the first
thing that you'll see when you're
opening OpenStack is the dashboard so
this is a graphical user interface for
you to use so this is the dashboard
which is known as horizon and if you see
this component here this is called the
keys
and it is used for authorization and
authentication purpose so every service
is related to that so if you ever want
to avail any of these services or you
want to use any of these components you
have to get authorized and authenticated
first and that is done by this component
over here which is known as Keystone and
then there are the other layer of
services we have Nova which is the
compute domain then we have got glance
which is the service for launching up
instances then we've got swift which is
the object storage service the neutron
the networking service cinder the block
storage service then we have got heat
which is used for orchestration propers
ceilometer which is used for metering
and billing so this is a part of
actually the telemetry project of
OpenStack and filo meter here actually
keep on track of the instances that are
up and how much services for how much
sign have you advance from OpenStack and
this actually keeps a meter running for
every time your value service or every
time an instance is active or running
and it is used for billing purpose so
these are the components that actually
make up the OpenStack architecture will
now let us take a look at the OpenStack
components so these are the nine
components that actually explain you how
OpenStack works and services that each
component will provide us we'll see that
later in this tutorial so let me just
first give you a brief overview of all
the OpenStack components so first up we
have Keystone now ascending of that this
is the authentication service of
OpenStack now every service that you
want to avail whether it's an image
service computing network storage or
availing the dashboard you need to get
authenticated first and this is taken
care of by Keystone so you can add a
user and grant privileges using the
Keystone then we've got glands
now glands
actually the service that launches up
instances so this glance has got all the
disk images contained in them different
types of images let it be a bun to linux
any kind of linux a red hat or center l7
Center sakes any versions so this can be
all stored in plants and then you can
launch instances from the images that
are present in blocks then we've got our
computing domain which is known as Nova
so when you launch an instance you
actually avail the Nova zone so this is
where other computing and all the
processing actually happens then we've
got Neutron Neutron is the networking
service of OpenStack and Neutron is
actually responsible for communication
of the services with one another then
we've got our storage services the first
is Swift and the other is cinder
restrict is the object storage component
and cinder is the block storage
component and these are all connected to
a database or s3 storage and where you
can actually store all kinds of files so
insert it is stored as objects and in
cinder you can store both which is like
a pluggable storage in your system then
with Cosby horizon now even though I'm
explaining this component at the end
this is the first thing that we see when
you're accessing OpenStack where with
you're managing OpenStack
so the horizon is the dashboard with
which every tenant or every other
application user can actually launch up
their own instances manage their own
instances and get a brief overview of
their cloud infrastructure at one place
then we've got zero meter now ceilometer
is a part of the telemetry project of
OpenStack so the Phaedo meter is used to
check the uptime of all the instances
the kind of services that you have a
veil and at the end it will produce a
bill or log of all the services that you
have a veil and finally produces the
bill and heat is used for orchestration
now you'll be using multiple
applications on your open
infrastructure and for that you'll be
running multiple services also so you
need a process to orchestrate all the
services together in order to manage
your application and for that you can
use heat so these are the OpenStack
components okay now Varun has a question
he asked that will we be seeing all
these components as part of today's
session yes I will be telling you about
all those except for Sedo meter and heat
I will be actually telling you about the
primary components or the primary
services which is up till horizon encino
meter and heat will be covered up in the
coming session so this is just a brief
introduction to OpenStack and we'll have
a brief demo of all the services so for
now we'll be the only sustaining up to
horizon is that okay well okay he says
yes so now let us take a look at all the
services and the components one by one
now first up is Keystone so what is key
so a keystone is an openstack service
that provides API client authentication
service discovery and distributed multik
and an authorization by implementing
OpenStack identity API well that is a
very complex sentence but I will explain
it to you in a much easier way where
Keystone is an identity service used for
authentication and authorization now
it's more of like who are you and what
do you want to do kind of a service when
it's a authentication it means who are
using it will ask for your username and
password so that you can log it and
after it actually knows who are you the
next thing you need to do or next thing
you would want to do is to evade
services so this is the part when
Keystone asks you what you want to do it
will check if you have got all the
privileges all the rights to make
changes or available some kind of
changes so this is the purpose of
Keystone now Keystone works with a token
services gas lock service policy service
and assignment service
so with token service it validates and
managing so confuse for authenticating a
request once a user's credentials have
already been verified so it is a session
based a token management that Keystone
uses and then with catalog service what
happens is that it provides you with
endpoint registry which is used for
endpoint discovery now every other
service is an openstack is connected
through endpoints so with Keystone CAD
mark service you can actually avail and
have an overview of all the endpoints
and you can check whether if the
connection can be authorized or not for
a specific user and then we've got the
policy service now what a policy service
does is that it provides a rule base of
the reservation engine and it is
actually associated with a rule
management interface so there are some
policies or some kind of maybe legal
jurisdictions mentioned in rule
management so this policy service will
check if you're authorized to do that
if you're not actually breaking any laws
or any kind of policies any kind of
company policies when you are trying to
avail something or use something in
OpenStack and then there is this
assignment service so what this
assignment service does is that it
provides data about roles now roles are
nothing but these are levels of
authorization that end user can opt in
so if let's say a person has been given
an authorization to use three services
and there is one more person who is
authorized to use two services so we can
just define roles for each of them let's
say the first one can be called role 3
service and one can be called road to
service or any other role based you can
give them any name based on the road and
then you can actually manage the
authorization rights among other people
to by defining them with roles so this
is what Keystone is so any questions on
what is Keystone okay now questions so
now let's move on and take a look at
glance
so like how openside defines glance is
that the glance project provides a
service where users can upload and
discover data assets that are meant to
be used with other services now you can
think of glance as a repository for
images so this plant over here actually
stores all the virtual disk images that
you have added into OpenStack and from
there on from dings images which is
stored in glance you can launch
instances from there and these instances
can be used to set up your development
environment for your application for
your testing environment or prod any
purpose that you wanted to so what
exactly is stored in glance is that it
only stores images and the metadata
definitions of the images and just
actually has uses a restful api that
allows squaring of virtual image
metadata as well as well as retrieval of
the actual image so I'll show you and
explain you the glance architecture now
so that you can understand it better
okay so this is the user and let me tell
you before I go ahead and explain is
that in OpenStack every service actually
communicates using an API so every
communications that they do is through
API so they use both kind of API is
northbound and southbound so glance also
uses API to connect with the user and
other services as well
so after the user this is the user with
using gloves and it connects through a
glance API and it goes to the glance
registry which is going to trip to the
glance database and the glance database
will store all the metadata definitions
okay so Varun has a question
yeah also what is a north and southbound
API so you know that an a cloud
infrastructure there are service layers
right for them and then we use API is to
connect with each of the services okay
so let's say that I have a three-tier
layer I'm just drawing our rough image
so this is the bottom layer over here
this is the middle layer and this is the
top layer so if I want to connect from
the top to bottom I will use api's that
will connect it from top to bottom okay
so these are known as southbound api's
now if I want my bottom tier service to
connect with the top tier service I'll
use different ApS that we connected from
the bottom to the top so these are
northbound API so southbound means top
to bottom and northbound means from
bottom to top so this is just a brief
overview just understand what northbound
and southbound API is up so this is just
used for connecting with different
services as different tiers so is that
okay for you go okay he said clear
Thanks
okay so let's move on to our glance
architecture so the glance registry is
connected with the glance database and
the API also connects with different
file system with the object storage
service also which is swift and the s3
which is and the relational database
also so these storage systems will
actually store the image implant so the
glass registry will here contain each
entry of images or whatever images that
you have added into the Glantz
architecture if the metadata will be
stored in glance database the images
will be stored in swift s3 in different
file systems and from there on if you
want to launch images you can launch it
using blocks so this is just a very
simple layout of the glance architecture
so any questions on that ok so unusual
us images means always images right yes
of course I am talking about like
virtual disk images I mean like Ubuntu
images Windows images different
centerÃ­s Red Hat all those SLR cameras
and anyway you go to write that's the
images that I'm talking about next up we
have got Nova so Nova is the compute
shown so when you actually launch an
instance from glance it is the nova zone
with all the computing takes place so
when you open the console of your
since it is actually availed the Nova
compute zone so this is where all the
processing takes place in OpenStack so
Nova is built on a messaging
architecture and all of its components
can be run on several servers so in know
what every other micro service or let's
say every other component that is in
Nova actually communicates using message
queuing system so for that we mostly use
the rapid mq which is a message steering
system and we use it for Nova so this is
a brief architecture of the Nova so the
Nova has got api's now like every other
service in OpenStack I already told you
that it computes with the other services
using API so this is a Nova API over
here and this is the message broker
system so this can be a middleware like
rabbit MQ which actually enables a
message queuing system to communicate
with each other component in Nova so
this is the Nova scheduler so this is
where or the scheduling or the queueing
of different processes takes place and
when there is a queueing done and if you
want to actually like communicate with
the computer domain ok so this process
is going to come up in the compute or in
the processing zone so this is actually
communicated using this message broker
or the rabbit MQ so the scheduler
actually schedules job for to be
performed in the compute sole and this
is communicated via the message broker
and it is also connected with the
network so this network over here is
mostly a Neutron API I'll be telling you
about neutrons just after this one
they'll understand it better so this is
the neutron part that it is connected to
as for that also it uses the message
broker or the rabbit mq4 in order to
communicate with that service so any
questions on the Nova architecture I can
know questions
so now we have got Neutron
now Neutron is the networking component
of OpenStack and it is actually a
standalone service in OpenStack and it
lies alongside all other services like I
just told you nova glance keystone the
horizon which is the dashboard and like
all those services the deployment of
Neutron involves deploying several
processes on each host now when you're
using OpenStack you using like different
holes to install all the services you
are using a controller host which is
responsible for all the authentication
and for managing all kind of services
that are running on different hosts you
might have got different hosts for
computing and Neutron will be associated
with all of them now let me show you the
architecture of Neutron so this is how
the networking is connected so this is a
gateway device this is the access switch
which actually and these are your host
machines you can say they might be any
kind of VM so let's say that this one is
a controller these two are compute and
these are different services that are
connected with each other and Neutron
actually relies on keystone for
authentication and authorization of all
API requests so neutrons like I told you
that Keystone is responsible every time
you want to access any kind of service
you have to go to Keystone right for
getting authenticated and authorized to
use anything any service in OpenStack
and Neutron is responsible for actually
connecting you with Keystone so that is
why neutrons competing relies on
Keystone it cannot actually connect you
with any other service without going via
our key store without getting
authenticated first and then with Nova
the relationship is something like again
it interacts with API calls and when
you're using horizon which is the
dashboard I'll be showing you how to do
that so I'll just tell you the brief
relationship of neutron with Verizon so
with horizon it actually has got a basic
integration with the Neutron API and it
allows all the user
which are known as tenants to create
networks by themselves by creating
subnets and you can also use neutrons
and when you're using OpenStack as a
service you can actually event Neutron
as Naas which is known as network as
service so this is what is Neutron I'll
be showing you how to make subnets how
to create your own network with the
dashboard in a while till then any
questions okay no questions okay so next
up we have Swift now Swift is the object
storage system or object storage service
in OpenStack you can store all kinds of
files any kind of images or anything
into it so this is completely meant for
storage and it switched everything that
your store is converted into an object
and then it is stored inside the
database or inside the storage file
system and all the organizations are
using swift to store lots of data very
safely because it is very easy to
retrieve data from Swift and there are a
lot of companies using Swift storage
system to store all their files like
there is Comcast
there's Time Warner there's global
Wikipedia Rackspace and a lot more other
companies you can read it yourself
now let me show you the architecture
offices so in Swift architecture we've
got the stripped proxy which is
connected to each account container and
object so the account over here refers
to a user account whether it's a demo
user or you are an admin user or any
kind of tenant application user so this
is the account database now again in
order to validate it you can have to go
to Keystone for authentication and
authorization then you can actually
define containers to store your
different objects and the container
database will store all kinds of
metadata related to your files that you
are storing in Swift and like I told you
each of your files whatever you store in
your request a storage system
it will be converted into an object and
this is where you can store all your
objects you can also store different
objects in a container you can define
containers for storing as well so this
is the simple sister architecture any
questions on that
no questions you guys are pretty smart
you're understanding everything that I'm
saying good so next up we've got cinder
now I really love the names of all the
OpenStack services I think they're
really fancy love the name cinder I
don't know why now
sender is the openstax block storage
service now you might be asking me that
what is the difference between Swift and
cinder they are both meant for storage
focus right so actually a cinder is a
block storage system it is more of like
a pluggable storage system think of
cinder as an external hard disk that you
can plug into your computer for
accessing anything and your Swift is the
disk that is in your computers in your
local machine so that is list and this
is cinder and when you are actually
storing objects in Swift it gives you
with a link when you are actually
storing your objects in Swift what
happens is that you just get a link for
your object you don't know where in the
memory it is getting stored when you're
using Swift you don't have to actually
worry about how is your object getting
stored how is your memory getting
managed so you can all leave it up to
the open stacks of this they will take
care of the memory management about how
your object for storing but if by any
chance or accidentally you lose that
link you actually lose your entire
object you cannot actually find it again
in the memory and in cinder the memory
management is done by you so this is
very much similar to like the disk
storage system in your computer where
you have a pump defined for all your
objects or all your files which are
getting stored in cinder and let me tell
you that with this block storage service
you can actually attach a device to only
one instance so you cannot use it with
multiple instances ok now let me show
you the architecture of cinder so again
on the top we've got the api's because
it's again a service of OpenStack
and it will only communicate using APs
then we've got the cinder scheduler so
what does cinders scheduler does is that
it schedules and routes requests to the
appropriate volume service
so it might be and depending upon your
configurations it can be either a
round-robin scheduling or it can be any
other scheduling and depending upon your
configuration this maybe is something it
may be a very simple round-robin
scheduling to run the volume or it may
be any other kind of scheduling
depending upon your configuration now
the cinder volume over here it manages
the block storage devices and
specifically they are the backend
devices themselves and this in the
database over here we contain all the
metadata about the files that are in
your block storage system and then we
have the queuing system here again so
this is directly connected with the
schedulers every time the API gets a
call or any kind of request it is then
if this comes to the Q part and then the
sender's scheduler actually routes up to
the sender volume and then finally this
in the volume stores them all the
metadata it gives the database so this
is how cinder works any questions I
think I'm gonna hear a no again is that
right a middle yes of course
like I said no questions again and
finally there is horizon now horizon is
the dashboard this is the dashboard
which will actually help you to access
all kinds of services like nova swift
keystone and you can interact with all
the services together using horizon so
there's not much to tell about horizon
it is pretty much about just showing you
how to do that again so this is again
the architecture so the horizon is the
interface that is between all the
different services and OpenStack and the
users so we've got this dashboard over
here horizon which is directly connected
to the image service which is glance'
means I would horizon you can directly
go and launch instances and in the
instances if you want to like and when
he wants launch an instance if you want
to store
something you are doing some kind of
storage operations if you want to store
something it will directly route you to
open SEC storage which is Swift you can
also connect it with cinder as well and
if you want to do some kind of
processing in order to develop your
applications or to test it or deploy it
any kind of processing required you can
use the computer own of OpenStack which
is the OpenStack Nova and all the API is
are connected with the different
endpoints this is the Nova compute API
endpoint and this is the Swift storage
API endpoint so and actually before
logging on to horizon you have to get
authenticated first so I'll be showing
you how to do that so any questions on
horizon architecture okay no questions
okay now let me just show you the
dashboard and actually show you how you
can avail all the services of OpenStack
okay so this is Tristar orgy and this is
actually open fact sandbox that you can
use that they have installed all
different services and you can avail of
the services from this so I'm going to
log in with Facebook I'm going to use my
Facebook event shows
and so this is my horizon dashboard you
just saw that I just authenticated
myself with my Facebook credentials so
this is the Keystone authentication part
okay so this actually has been logged in
into my dashboard so I have made two
instances already so if you want to make
more instances so again here this is the
gland service so if you you've got
different images already let me just
show you these are all the images now
this is actually the disk format that is
supported by QEMU emulator and it can
expand dynamically and it supports
copy-on-write so these are all the
images that I have here so now let's say
that I want to launch an instance let's
say that our launch this zeros instead
so
I'm going to launch you just click here
so gal just name it
compute
and then you have to add a network to it
so you can check the available networks
from here and if there are no available
networks so let me just show you okay
let me just first launch this instance
and then show you that if there are no
networks is that it will happen you
actually create your own subnet to
launch instances so you can just click
on launch over you
and so you can see that this is in the
computer on where it is created this is
launched over here the statuses access
the availability zone is Nova parse it
is from running and you can actually
create snapshots if you're working on
any kind of influences over here you can
create snapshots and snapshots or
nothing but it is the state of your disk
at that particular movement so if you
want to preserve that so you can
actually create a snapshot of your
instances as well so I was telling you
about how you can actually add Network
right so so you can just click on Nexus
over here
and over here you can just go and create
Network so you can just provide with any
name I'm just going to provide that's it
I'm going to say it's ed Eureka and just
going to provide it with subnets and
different subnets details so I already
have to find one network so you can just
do that if you don't have any so I have
got one network which is active and up
and running and this is your object
store like I was telling you this is the
Swift part of the service you can
actually create containers over here
so there are no containers right now so
you can just create a container from
this over here and you can store it so
now let me just go back and let me just
tell you how to just access the instance
that you just created right so you can
just go over here which is the instances
and the volumes over here are is
actually your cinder part of service so
it is not attached to I have not
included any kind of volumes with any
kind of instance with yet so there is
nothing to display over here and let me
go to the instances part and this is the
instance that we just launched so
over here from the flavor over here is
m1 tiny so you can actually define
flavors which are nothing but the size
of your images which are nothing but the
size of your instances so if you want to
just access it you can just go to their
consoles
and it's over here so you can log in as
a syros user
and now this part is your authorization
part with it asked for your user and
password again so if you want to access
this VM or this instance over here you
need to get authorized first and this is
again done via Keystone okay so now I'm
going to just login
it is asking for password and there you
are
we were just logged in to your VM like
that and you can use it for any purpose
that you want if you want it to use for
development purpose or any other purpose
for application you can just use these
kind of instances like this so this is
how you can actually avail and instance
and then you can also maintain the
version by creating snapshots
you've got the cinder service over here
which is volumes the images is glance
access and security is Keystone then
we've got the neutron as Network you can
even check out the network topology so
there you have so you have maintained
your internal network you've got three
instances over here and none of them are
actually connected to the internet yet
so it's just for demo purposes I'm
showing you so this is your OpenStack
cloud away and I've got three instances
so you can get an overview of your
entire network topology - this is your
Swift service which is the object store
your identity service is Keystone so
this is entirely contained yeah so you
can also see the name of your instances
so this is my first instance that I've
created this one was second one and this
is the compute instance and I've
connected them with this network which
is named s network so this is it so this
is how you can actually use the
dashboard so let us go back to our
presentation now and move on with the
next topic so now let us take a look at
a case study now we'll take a look at a
case study of the time warner cable and
avi networks so if you're living in u.s.
you must have heard about time warner
cable's this is one of the top most
cable companies in United States and it
earns the revenue of tens of billions of
dollars every year and then we've got
the RV networks which is the time warner
cable's
OpenStack cloud provider so let us take
a look at the problems they were facing
and how OpenStack actually helped to
solve their problems so you know that a
Time Warner Cable is a cable company so
they are using different ad fees which
are nothing but analog to digital
converters and they were using very
traditional and conventional hardware
before and you know the problem with
hardware is that they are not very
flexible you cannot actually tweak them
into a completely different shape or a
completely different way because they
are hardware than they need to be
configure it in very different and
specific ways that they are not very
flexible so if they want a solution for
a particular app they would have to just
buy a new hardware of different
configurations itself so it was actually
thinking of a lot of money and then the
open source solutions that are available
in the market they lacked all the
advanced solutions and it's not capable
or they were not capable of actually
handling this kind of an enterprise
level business problem and it also
lacked the advanced features that Time
Warner Cable was actually looking for
and when they started to use a virtual
ADCs
the orchestration or to just lay out how
each of the virtual ADCs will interact
with each other made out of that plan or
orchestrating it was actually very very
complex so there was not a proper
management system to maintain that
orchestration so it became very hard to
find a solution for this problem so what
they wanted was that they wanted to
build an OpenStack solution with fully
automated provisioning and integration
with automation tools at Time Warner
Cable so they wanted to divide up all
the resources into three parts the first
one is compute this is where all the
processing will take place the
networking will take care of connecting
each service and everything to the outer
world as well as in the internal network
as well then storage for storing any
kind of metadata or all other related
files
so and this virtualization or these
layer would be placed on their own
standard a hardware so now this is again
an example of an on-premises OpenStack
infrastructure so this is how all the
networks actually help time on a cable
to apply or implement OpenStack so these
are the tenants and the tenants are
actually the application developers now
as I monarchy but they're using
different kind of applications for
different purposes so the problem was
that is that they would have to
provision each tenant for each
application everyone needed a different
environment a different dev environment
a different broad environment and so it
was very hard to provision them but with
OpenStack it actually became very easy
I'll tell you how and you already know
how because if let's say that when you
were using that horizon dashboard if you
wear any kind of an application
developer you can see how easy you can
actually create your own instance using
the CLI or the OpenStack dashboard which
is the OpenStack horizon and the rest
api is to communicate so the application
developers are using OpenStack dashboard
and it is actually controlled and
centrally managed by the RV controller
and the central clouds DevOps team
manages the OpenStack cloud so you don't
have to even worry about managing your
own cloud there is an IV theme and they
use the of the user interface and they
use REST API is to communicate with the
RV controller which then communicates
and handles the application developer
requests of launching instances and
managing their environments and then
everything is connected with multiple
data centers across different servers
and whether it's a private cloud which
is an open side privately hosted cloud
so you can see that everything is
managed so this is the most top tier you
can say this is where actually a user is
getting instance and
is managed centrally by the RV
controller they're maintaining a private
cloud and there is also an IT team to
manage everything to manage the RV
controller as well so the problem of
provisioning and problem of being your
hardware very inflexible is gone because
on the top of your hardware you have got
open fat that you can tweet in any way
you want you can actually modify it in
open-source you can even modify their
own source code to let open sex do
whatever you want it to do so it's made
a very flexible they can actually and
now use different applications they can
develop a multiple applications at once
and with OpenStack services like heat
which is an orchestration service you
can also get rid of the all the
orchestration problems that was due to
the virtual ADC and these are all
managed by the RP controller and RP
controller is there OpenStack providers
so this is how they were managing all
the different tasks and services in
OpenStack they were actually managing
all the tasks by setting up and
OpenStack infrastructure and this is a
very detailed flow of the next gen ADC
by and this was implemented by avi
networks and OpenStack clouds so these
are the nova instances of the
application developers and they're
building up applications on this
instances so every other user are making
different applications so again this is
the avi controller and it is availing
all the services like horizon no Bakke
stone Neutron and L path which is load
balancer as silvus so with horizon it
also provides with visibility and
analytics you can actually visualize
completely how your network is laid out
or how many instances do you have you
can get all the data for analysis as
well and this is the AV controller
cluster which contains all the different
Nova instances that is distributed among
the different application developers are
the different tenants
so any questions on this I hope you've
understood this this is fairly simple
okay no questions and so that was it
so we've learned the different cloud
concepts we've learned what is
infrastructure a service platform a
service software service we have learned
what is OpenStack and the different
cloud deployment models that can be used
to deploy OpenStack we have seen the
OpenStack architecture the different
OpenStack components and services and in
the end we have also seen a case study
of the RV networks and how RV networks
have time on a cable to solve the
problems using OpenStack cloud so thank
