Eureka today we will learn how to
install puppet on ascent OS machine here
are the steps to install puppet first we
need to install puppet master and puppet
agent after that we'll edit the host and
puppet configuration file in both puppet
master and puppet agent our third step
is to generate certificate signing
request from puppet agent and that
certificate should be signed by the
puppet master to establish secure
connection between both puppet master
and puppet agent in the end we look at a
classic puppet example in which I will
deploy Apache Tomcat version 9 using
puppet so let us proceed with the first
step that is to install puppet master
and puppet agent as you can see that I'm
using 2 virtual images one for puppet
master another for puppet agent I'll
first install puppet master so I'll go
to the puppet master virtual image this
is my puppet master virtual image before
we install puppet master I need to
delete all firewall rules for that I'll
type iptables - f now I need to save it
I'll type service IP tables save and
here we go
IP tables is a default firewall present
in most olynyk's distributions by
default let me clear my terminal now now
I need to enable official puppy lab
collection repository so to get that
repository I'll open my browser and I'll
go to this particular website that is
yum puppy labs calm and over here you
can see that there are repository is
available for sent to is 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 I'm
using sent to a 6 so I'll copy the link
location of this particular repository
copy it a go back to my terminal and
I'll use RPM - IV h command and just
paste the link over here and here we go
now I will
all puppetmaster for that I'll type yum
install puppet server and here we go
press Y it is now downloading packages
puppet master is now installed let me
clear my terminal now I need to install
puppet agent for that I'll go to puppet
agent virtual image this is my puppet
agent virtual image over here I need to
first delete all firewall rules for that
I'll type IP tables
- F now I need to save it service IP
tables save and here we go now I need to
enable the official puppet lab
collection repository as I have done it
in my master so I'll just paste the same
command I will just paste it here and
here we go now I need to install a
puppet agent for that I'll type yum
install puppet on here we go it is now
downloading packages
so puppet agent is now installed let me
clear my terminal so our first step is
complete that is to install puppet
master and puppet agent now we need to
edit the host and puppet configuration
files in both puppet master and puppet
agent I'll do that first in puppet
master so let us proceed towards the
puppet master virtual image first I need
to edit the hosts file but before that I
need the IP address of this particular
machine to get that I'll type if config
and it will display the IP address it's
copy it now I will edit the host file
for that I'll use VI editor let's see
host on here we go
here what I will do is I will first
paste the IP address that I've copied
and I'll give a name to it
puppet dot ed Eureka not Co so what I've
done here is I've assigned a domain name
puppet Eddie ray Kaku to the IP address
192.168.1.1 82 alright so let us just
save it and quit now I'll clear my
terminal now I need to edit the puppet
configuration file for that again I'll
use VI editor VI HC puppet copied cons
and here we go as you can see that there
are two sections one is main another is
agent and in the main section I need to
set up a DNS name to which the server
will respond DNS is a useful element in
order to allow nodes to communicate with
friendly names rather than using IP
addresses further I'll type DNS alt
names equal to puppet so a name is
puppet so obviously it is going to
respond to puppet doll Eddie Ricardo now
I need to add a certificate name as well
Fedora type suit named puppet save it
and quit let me clear my terminal now I
can start puppet master so let us type
command for it service puppet master
start on here we go
so puppet master has now started let me
clear my terminal now I'll edit the host
and puppet configuration file of puppet
agent so I'll go to puppet agent virtual
image now to edit the hosts file
I need the IP address of this machine
for that I'll use if config command to
display the IP address just copy it now
I'll use VI editor to edit the host file
VI HC host on here we go over here also
I'll paste the IP address that I have
copied
and I'll give a name to it I'll just
type up an agent whatever name you find
suitable just proceed with that so over
here this particular IP address that is
one ninety two dot one six eight dot one
dot one one nine I've assigned a domain
name topit agent over here also I need
to specify the IP address at the domain
name of my puppet master so now I'll
type the IP address of my puppet master
192 dot one six eight dot one dot one
eight two and the domain name I'll just
write puppet puppet dot ed u rekha dot
Co now save it and quit let me clear my
terminal now I need to edit the puppet
configuration file for that I'll use VI
editor again and I'll type HC puppet
puppet conf and here we go as you can
see here also there are two sections one
is main another is agent so in the agent
section I need to specify the server
name that I'll type server equal to the
domain name of a puppet master which is
puppet dot edu raker dot go in this case
you can write the IP address also of
your puppet master but I'll just proceed
with this domain name only and this is a
very important step because when I give
server name it will go to the hosts file
and will check the IP address over there
so just make sure you have typed the
correct domain name now just save it and
quit me clear my terminal now I need to
start puppet agent for that I'll type
service
puppet start on here we go
so does started successfully let me
clear my terminal so our second step is
complete and that is to edit the host
and puppet configuration files in both
puppet master and in puppet agent our
third step is to generate certificate
signing request from puppet agent and
this certificate has to be signed by
puppet master in order to establish
secure connection between puppet master
and puppet agent for that alphas go to
my puppet master virtual image over here
I need to first stop my puppet master
for data type
service puppet master stop on here we go
now I'll type a command sudo - you
puppet puppet master - - no - demon eyes
- - world bows this command will create
the CA certificate and the puppet master
certificate with the appropriate DNS
names included here we go
the moment you see the version of puppet
you need to stop it right there by
pressing ctrl C because we cannot start
the puppet master right now so we need
to stop it right now as puppet master
version is displayed let me clear my
terminal now I need to start this puppet
master for that I'll type puppet
resource service puppet master ensure
running on here we go puppet master is
now running just to confirm that our
type service puppet master status so it
is now running successfully let me clear
my terminal now I need to go back to my
puppet agent virtual image over here
first stop this puppet agent so I'll
type service puppet stop on here we go
now I will type a command puppet agent -
T this command will generate a
certificate signing request for puppet
master and here we go clear my terminal
now I go back to my puppet master
virtual image
now if you want to see the 30
that are available in puppet master I'll
type puppet sir list our it will display
the certificate for me so there's a
certificate signing request that has
been sent by puppet agent we need to
sign this certificate for the other side
puppet cert sign on the name of the
certificate that is puppet agent and
here we go so we have successfully
signed the certificate that was
requested by puppet agent let me clear
my terminal oh now I'll go back to my
puppet agent virtual image now over here
I need to start this puppet agent
further I'll type puppet resource
service puppet ensure running here we go
puppet agent is now running just to
confirm that I'll type service puppet
status and here we go
so puppet is now running successfully
now to check that the correct
certificate has been signed by the
puppet master I'll use finger print
c'mon let me show you how to do that
puppet agent - - fingerprint on here we
go so over here you need to match this
particular fingerprint with a
certificate that has been signed by the
puppet master in this case it is a
correct certificate that has been signed
so let me clear my terminal now I will
run a command puppet agent - t this
command will update the agent with the
changes made in the puppet master and as
master has recently signed a certificate
so it will update that I'll clear my
terminal law now a third step is
complete that is to generate a
certificate signing request from puppet
agent and that certificate has to be
signed by puppet master finally we will
now look at a classic puppet example in
which I'll deploy a passive tomcat
version 9 using puppet for that alphas
go to my master virtual image to install
Apache Tomcat version 9 I need to first
install Java 8 as Apache Tomcat version
9
is only compatible with Java 8 or
versions of Java that has been released
after Java 8 now to install Java I need
to first install Java module this Java
module will automatically install Java
JDK and simplifies the installation of
java using puppet so let us proceed
towards the installation of java module
further I'll type puppet module install
puppet labs
- Java and here we go so Java module is
now installed let me clear my terminal
now I need to edit site PP file present
in the puppet manifest for that I'll use
VI editor VI HC puppet manifest side dot
PP and here we go over here I'll first
define a class Java and now I'll define
package Java one point 8.0 open JDK - a
devale now close the braces now save it
and quit let me clear my terminal now
before installing Apache Tomcat version
9
I need the Tomcat module the Tomcat
module allows you to use puppet to
install Tomcat manage its configuration
file and deploy web apps to it the
Tomcat module requires puppet lab
standard library version 4.0 or newer so
if you follow these steps
puppet lab standard library version 4.1
- will automatically be installed so let
us now install Tomcat module for the
other type puppet module install puppet
labs
- Tomcat and here we go so Tomcat module
is now installed let me clear my
terminal now I need to edit site dot PP
file present the puppet manifest for
that again I'll use VI editor VI HC
puppet
Manifest site peepee and here we go over
here I'll type Tomcat install /opt slash
Tomcat now I need to give the source URL
for dollar type source underscore URL ml
I need the link of the tar file for
Apache Tomcat version 9 so to get that
I'll open my browser I'll go to this
particular website as I'm highlighting
with my cursor you scroll down and copy
the link location for this particular
tar file that I'm highlighting with my
cursor just copy the link location go
back to the terminal
and paste it here now close the braces
now I'll define Tomcat instance for the
I'll type Tomcat instance I'll get the
default instance so I'll type default
Catalina underscore home / opt / Tomcat
now close the braces and just save it
and quit here we go
now let me clear my terminal now I'll go
back to my puppet agent virtual image
over here I'll type puppet agent - t
this command will update the changes
made in puppet manifest so here we go so
it is done now let me clear my terminal
now I'll go to port 8 0 8 0 which is a
default port for Apache Tomcat
let me first open my browser on over
here I'll type local host
8:08 0 and here we go as you can see the
Tomcat is working on for a 0 a 0 that
means we have successfully installed
apache tomcat version 9 using puppet now
our fourth and final step is complete
that is
to deploy a party Tom card version nine
