welcome to this demo session on the
Android development program which is
powered by dareka well my name is Mohit
and I will be your instructor for this
session now to start off with this class
I had asked a simple question does
anybody know this man well this guy is
Andy Rubin he is the co-founder of
Android and he is the mastermind as now
in the sense he started everything now
as per the pool and statistics reports
over 850,000 Android devices are being
activated every day now no wonder why
Android is the fastest growing platform
in the complete industry right now let
us stop start talking about Android a
little right the Android ecosystem now
before learning any technology or any
platform it's very important to
understand what is the ecosystem what
are the different entities that are
actually surrounding the particular
platform or the technology when you talk
about Android the Android ecosystem
includes number one the consumers love
consumers or the folks that buy these
Android devices use applications right
people like us who buy the devices and
use the applications now we've also got
Google Google as we know is the owner of
Android right and distributes Android as
an open source which is free to all
everybody to use now we've also got the
OEMs now these are the original
equipment manufacturers om shanthi
companies like Samsung HTC LG Sony who
manufactured their own devices and use
Android as a software platform for their
devices now the biggest contributor to
this complete ecosystem are the
application development houses these are
the companies that are actually on a big
scale working on Android making many
applications publishing on the Play
Store and availing them to the consumers
to use right these are the companies
that are hiring on a big scale these are
the companies which give opportunities
to most of the developers and testers
and also to service level companies
right now
apart from this we've also got the
freelancers now when you talk about
Android freelancers also have immense
opportunities to you know work over and
to look forward for you can go to any
portal you can talk about oDesk you can
talk about guru and all in all the
portals you'll always find never less
than a thousand opportunities or
projects seeking Android application
developers or testers now the scope is
increasing day by day and getting
immense all the time right now this is
what the Android ecosystem is is
everybody clear with what is the Android
ecosystem now I want all of you to be
very interactive in the class right so
that I could figure out if you actually
understood what is being talked about
right so are we all clear with the
Android ecosystem okay that's correct
looking down at so many confirmations
coming it is a good feeling as well
anyways let us move ahead and let us
talk about the app monetization now most
of you would have heard that
applications earn revenues if you have a
look at this spring short overhead this
is a screenshot from a simple gaming
application on Android which is called
Angry Birds I think most of us have
played it already right now the
developers of this Angry Birds game have
earned millions of dollars as a revenue
to the game by posting these small
advertisements mobile advertisements on
the screens of their application right
this is a very small thing if you look
over there but then still the revenue
scope the revenue generation scope
rather is immense
and endless write a small wishes small
application which is available for free
is earning millions of dollars isn't
this amazing
the process of earning revenues out of
your Android applications irrespective
of the fact whether your applications
are free they are trial or they're
premium set of applications is called
app monetization now in your upcoming
plusses you've got a detailed session on
the Google Play Store and the app
monetization where you come to know a
lot about the place or the tie
of applications how do we publish them
how do we monetize our applications how
can we earn revenues out of them
all right is everybody clear with the
concept of monetization of applications
is everybody clear with this how what is
the scope of monetization everybody is
clear with this that's great now I want
all of you to have a very quick look at
some questions I will read them out for
you number one is what are the various
building blocks of an Android
application number two what is the life
cycle of an Android application number
three how does a mobile application
handle Hardware events number four how
does an application run background jobs
like network downloads music player etc
number five how do multiple applications
access shared resources such as a
passbook photo gallery etc now you need
not to wonder about the answers of these
questions already I know most of you
would not have the answers to these
questions how many of you have the
answers to these questions already can
you quickly post it on the chat window
how many of you have the answers for
these questions already do you know the
answers to these questions well I see a
lot of noise coming yet which which is
actually expected now not to worry just
let us not wonder about the answers at
the moment let us move ahead and what we
can promise out of this glass that after
this class you are definitely going to
have the answer to all of these
questions this is the least you can
expect out of this class all right so
let's move ahead and let us talk about
what is Android right now most of us use
Android devices right I should a KH is
saying let me get the download of this
session will Ashish you don't have to
request for it once the class is over
every class is recorded and sent to you
don't worry you will have this class in
your email inbox pose the classes over
okay anyways let us talk about Android
what is Android now can anybody from the
class tell me
what is android in our poll we came to
know 75% of the people are already using
android devices so i want to know what
is android can anybody tell me what is
android from the class okay sean is
saying android is a mobile operating
system nah man they're saying it is an
environment now with the answers that
I'm getting at the moment I can realize
that everybody has a different
perception towards Android most of the
people think that it is in mobile
operating system some have written it is
a free mobile operating system okay let
us try to figure out what is Android
exactly well when you talk about Android
Android is an open software platform
when I say it is an open software
platform
I must include that it is an open
software platform for mobile application
development right now for all of you to
understand it very well Android is not
just in the operating system or not just
the applications you use Android is a
complete stack you must have heard about
the staff right Android is a complete
staff which includes the operating
system the middlewares and the
application now the operating system of
Android is powered by Linux right and
the application development in Android
is done using the Java language so we
will be using the Java language the
concepts of Java to draw to code
applications in android right now Arana
pankaj is asking me what is a stack well
Ronna you must have heard about data
structures we've got a last in first out
structure layout right that is called a
stack write one thing layered over the
other right now this is what Android
exactly is is everybody now clear about
what is Android does everybody have an
answer about what is Android now right I
hope now most of you are not wondering
about what is Android right that is
great
now saranya is also you know also knows
now what Android exactly is confirms
that he or she knows but anyways let us
move ahead now when we have talked about
what is Android let's see what has been
the evolution of Android in the market
as of now right we talk a lot about
Android let's see what has been the
evolution the first-ever Android version
that was published officially released
officially was the cupcake version which
was Android 1.5 then came the donut 1.6
then the Eclair now the interesting part
is that you can all observe that there
is a certain nomenclature pattern c d e
f g h i j these are all alphabetically
ordered starting from c right this
honeycomb version over here was targeted
towards the tablet application
development now the most talked about
version ever has been the ICS Ice Cream
Sandwich version this was the most
talked about worsen because this was the
first ever Android version which was
actually optimized towards both tablet
and mobile application development now
the current version is the jelly bean
version 4.1 4.2 now what's next can
anybody tell me which is the upcoming
Android version anybody has a clue well
don't start googling it anyways so I'll
tell you one thing that we know that it
has to start with a K right seeing the
nomenclature pattern well the upcoming
Android version is called the key lime
pie I have posted it on the chat window
as well for all of you to refer the
upcoming Android version is the key lime
pie version right is everybody clear
about it now which is the upcoming
Android version now let's talk generally
about Android as well let us try to
polish our G key skills in Android a can
anybody tell me which was the first
Android power device that was lost at
the market was it the HTC Hero
the HTC g1 or the Motorola Droid just
select the desired answer on the screen
everybody what do you think was the
first Android power device that was
lost in the market can everybody vote in
quickly can I have the votes from
everybody quickly all right for the poor
results that I have up till now say 25%
of the people think it is an HTC Hero 25
or thinking it is the HTC g1 and 50%
people have voted for the Motorola Droid
well unfortunately the mass is wrong
over here the correct answer the
first-ever android-powered device that
was launched in the market was the HTC
g1 s TCG 1 was the first-ever
android-powered device and it operated
on the Android 1.5 cupcake were gen
right is everybody now clear about it
everybody is clear about this we are
going to remember the first Android
power device right and we are also going
to remember which is the upcoming
Android version isn't it
everybody is clear about this right
that's great let's move ahead and let us
talk about the main building blocks of
Android not this is the most important
part because now we are going to talk
about the components behind any and
every Android application right now I
hope for the people who have just joined
in I want to remind you that you can use
the chat window to ask whatever
questions whatever doubts that come
across your mind right I have an eye on
the chat window right whenever you post
in a question I will try to answer it
and I will try to answer all of them
anyways so let's talk about the main
building blocks of Android everyone now
the cluster says we've got the
activities the intense this services the
content providers and the broadcast
receivers right now is anybody having
any clue about these already in the
class anybody knows about them already
ok I can see a lot of noise already ok
not to worry let's move ahead let's talk
about these one by one and let us start
with
what is an activity right now I have
written it is typically a screen but
since I know nothing I would not even
know what is a screen this is my
facebook login screen isn't it a simple
login screen it has a colored background
it has two input boxes a Facebook logo
and a button right now I put in my
credentials over here I press the login
button what happens I am taken to a new
screen right which is menus feed screen
now if I click over here and go to some
other screen if I click over here I will
go to some other screen this means my
application is made up of different
screens different user interfaces or UI
is what you call it generally all these
screens individually are called
activities right every screen this is a
login activity this is a newsfeed
activity had I clicked over here could
have gone to a notification activity
right every screen is called an activity
and every activity in an application
also has a lifecycle of its own let us
try to discuss what is the lifecycle of
an activity right now these are the
stages that any activity life cycle
would consist of let's try to talk about
them one by one well a starting state is
one when the activity has just been
invoked it's not in the memory yet right
it is starting but it has not acquired
any memory yet that state of an activity
when it it doesn't exist in the memory
is called a starting State well from a
starting state an activity can only go
to the running state now what is a
running State a running state is one
when the activity is currently
interacting with the user simple way to
understand it is that if I am doing
something on my facebook wall page
wall activity that means I am currently
using it I am currently interacting with
it right it is on focus on the screen
that state of an activity when it is
currently on the screen and interacting
with the user is called the running
state of that activity now while I was
doing something on my facebook
whole page I could have received an
incoming call what's going to happen I
was doing something on my facebook I got
an incoming call what happens now what
happens is that you will realize the
Facebook goes to the background and the
call comes to the front right it comes
on focus this is because a call has a
higher priority in the device manager it
has to be handled first right so the
Facebook will go to the brow back
background and the call comes to the
front but you will observe the facebook
activity will be still visible behind
the call activity right that state of
inactivity when it is not on focus that
means it's in the background somehow but
it is still you know visible on the
screen is called the paused state of an
activity right now I take the same
example again I was doing something on
my Facebook wall screen and I suddenly
press the end key of my phone or maybe I
press the back key of my phone a couple
of times what happens you will observe
you will come out of that activity or
that application completely to your idle
screen or the home screen what you call
it right this means that your activity
is no more visible to you but if you go
to the task manager you will realize it
is still in the memory right so I can
eventually make out a statement that the
activity is now no more visible to the
user but it is still in the memory right
that state of an activity when it is no
more visible to the user but it is still
in the memory is called the stop state
of an activity
now when you minimize applications it is
the stop state you put them into right
now we are talking about mobile devices
right we are talking about small
processes we are talking about small
memories we have to optimize memory
utilization if you talk about both of
these the poor state and the soft state
in both of these states the user is
actually not interacting with the
activity or the application not using it
at all right this means they are just
eating up your memory and they're of no
use actually
right device manager of your Android
does not allow that for any activity
that stays for a long time in a poorer
state or in a stop state the device
manager destroys the process right kills
the complete process out of the memory
and frees the memory from them
well that state of an activity when it
is no longer in the memory is called the
destroyed state of an activity lifecycle
and once the activity is destroyed you
can only start from a shutting state
again right this is saying the lifecycle
eight against four now this is the
different activity stages of its life
cycle I hope it is clear to everyone
everybody is clear with all these states
what are these individually everybody is
clear with it Arana is clear no member
ash is also clear son to this Claire
right I hope everybody is clear with
this in case you have any questions
please post them on the chat window I
will be more than glad to answer them
now we've talked about activities and we
have talked about the activity lifecycle
let us move ahead to the next building
block which is called an intent right
now when we know we've got different
activities we know that we have got
different activities in our application
and from one activity we go to another
activity right what tells an activity
where to go next
you touch the screen you do something
that's okay but at the application level
what else an activity where to go next
what represents your action is called an
intent the description of what you want
to do or what you want to be done on any
activity is called an intent I'll give
you some examples you want to view a
photo you want to call a friend you want
to play a video view call and player
actually the verbs and are actually
describing what you want to do these are
called intends to understand it in a
very simple way let us see this example
right this is my photo gallery activity
in the Facebook application
right now you must be wondering why I am
talking so much about Facebook I'm
taking Facebook as a referral example
just to make sure everybody understands
it very quickly and easily because most
of us have used the Facebook and are
using the Facebook rigorously right so I
assume everybody knows about Facebook so
via it could be very easy to relate that
is why we are talking a lot about
Facebook
now this is my facebook photo gallery
activity and I have different pictures
over here right if I click on this
picture over here what happens as soon
as I click on this picture a new screen
will appear right I will be taken to a
new screen where and I will see this
picture in an enlarged form right that
means I fired a view photo intent I told
this activity to switch over to another
activity wherein I can see this image in
an enlarged form this was the
description of my action the view photo
intent for to call it right so if you
want to switch between activities if you
want to start one activity from another
you've got to use an intent on that
right this is the role of intent for any
Android application is it clear to
everybody the role of intent in Android
applications is it clear to everyone all
right that's great
that's quite a lot of yeses coming in is
a relief anyways let's move ahead and
let us talk about the next building
block right the next building block is
called a service what is a service well
most of you would have used a music
player right everybody uses a music
player and you must have observed that
the music player runs in the background
you actually don't need to keep it on
screen on focus to play songs you can do
whatever tasks you want to do in your
mobile but still the music player will
keep on running in the background right
sometimes you initiate a network
download right the download goes on in
the background you never see it
coming up right it never interferes with
your work what you are doing it just
goes on in the background we were
talking a lot about Facebook somebody
sends you a friend request or you're on
your mole you will observe the vol gets
refreshed by itself you don't do
anything still it gets refreshed of a
particular interval of times right it is
not magic that happens and that allows
all of this to happen
it's just that something which is not
visible to you is I mean doing all this
these are the background jobs these
background jobs are called services
the faceless components that run in the
background are called services now every
service also has a lifecycle of its own
when you talk about a service life cycle
it is only three stages number one the
starting state number two the running
state and number three the destroyed
state now there are no intermediate
states between the running state and the
destroyed state as there were in the
activity there is no pause state there
is no stop state now the question is can
anybody tell me why there is no pause to
a stop state in a service lifecycle can
anybody send in a guess since you have
understood the lifecycle of an activity
and you've also understood motor
Services can anybody tell me why there
is no paused or the stop state in a
service lifecycle the Chindia
is saying it is a background job well
yes ash ash is also saying it is a
background job all right let's try to
figure out write it let's
try to figure out why it is so talking
about the ball state right talking about
the ball state I told you inactivity
goes to the ball state when it goes to
the background but it is still visible
to the user right if you talk about a
service it is never visible to the user
there is no user interaction there is no
user interference number one this is why
there is no posted let's talk about this
top sheet a stop state one was one when
the activity was not visible to the user
but it was still in the memory the if
you closely observe this is exactly the
scenario what is the running State for a
service isn't it it's not visible to the
user but it is still running in the
memory right this is why there are no
pause state or a stop state in a service
lifecycle remember they never talked
about service remember service is never
initiated by the user no user
interaction no user interference they
have a limited life cycle they start
they do what they were designed to do
and they destroyed themselves right is
display to everyone by there is no pause
door stops rated the service life cycle
now I haven't heard from here in I
haven't heard from suna Mishra Vivek Sun
chip everyone is displayed to all of you
that's great that's great now I told you
some examples I told you the various
feeds by your friends that gets
refreshed the notification about the
friend requests that you get now these
are all examples of services in the
Facebook application as we were talking
a lot about Facebook let's move ahead
and let's talk about the next building
block right these are called the content
providers now before explaining what a
content provider is I won't explain a
scenario I want to discuss a scenario
with all of you right I have an Android
device I click a picture right I click a
picture on my Android device and now I
want to upload it using my Facebook
application
it's very simple isn't it I will go to
my Facebook application I will click on
upload photo I will select this picture
from my gallery and I will select upload
it will be uploaded as simple as that
right now I might also want to upload
the same picture using Twitter I might
also want to bloat the same picture
using Instagram I might also want to use
the same picture as a contact picture to
some of my contacts in the address book
isn't it now the statement comes out to
be multiple applications can use a
single resource from your database isn't
it multiple applications can use a
single resource from your database does
everybody agree to me on this
right everybody agrees to me okay now in
Android multi tasking of applications is
also allowed isn't it so I can refactor
my statement and I can say multiple
applications can use a specific resource
from my database simultaneously is it it
at the same time do you all agree with
me on this as well
wouldn't you agree right that's great
now let us try to figure out what is a
content provider since we have
understood this scenario let's see this
pictorial description over here these
are my applications right and this is my
database what is my database in and you
know when you talk about Android we're
using the sequel Lite database we're
using a very light version of database
which is there in the form of your
internal phone memory or your external
memory card right now these applications
which are multiple might simultaneously
hit my database with their queries with
the different query speed insert query
bead and update query whatever query it
could be I'm using a lite version of a
database right my database will give up
it will not be able to queue up it will
not be able to prioritize requests
because my data is always in the
inconsistent form multiple applications
are trying to access it at the same time
and it is a light database it will go
corrupt wouldn't it very easily it will
go corrupt this is a big big problem
right now this is where the content
provider comes to my rescue the content
provider sits between the application
and the databases right now whenever
this applications need any data from the
database they will request it from the
content provider the content provider
will in return face that database from
the its face the data from the database
I'm sorry and give it back to these
applications so what I have done I've
done two things
I have not allowed these applications to
directly interact with my database
number
one number two there is only one thing
which is the contentprovider that always
impacts with the database so my data is
always in the consistent stage it can
always provide uniform API is for
querying deleting updating inserting any
kind of requests right this is the role
of a content provider in any android
application is everybody clear with this
or do we have it out
you
you
is everybody clear with it that's great
so I have a confirmation from a lot of
people okay I mean a simp I want to ask
all of you a simple question just to
ensure that you are understanding what I
am teaching right Asuncion has asked me
why can't a plication directly contact
with database well I told you son
if you allow one application you will
have to allow all of them and all of
them at the same time will start hitting
your database to access it and your
database will go inconsistent this is
why you cannot allow to do this you
cannot afford to do it right your
database will never be consistent it
will never be able to provide uniform
api's all right
you
you
all right so great I have a simple
question for all of you now can you tell
me what our intents used for starting
one activity from another doing some
tasks in the background or providing
access to the system database just
select the desired answer on the screen
itself in the meanwhile John has asked
me a question
so content provider is the pal of the
app well it is John right so can
everybody vote in for the correct answer
quickly I am talking about intense right
the remember I am talking about intense
can we have the polls quickly can
everybody vote in quickly okay I am
waiting for the answer from everybody
can everybody quickly vote in I hope all
of you should be aware of it by now we
just discussed intense all right I've
got 97% of the people who have voted for
starting one activity from another 2%
have voted for doing some tasks in the
background and only one person votes
providing sis access to the system
database well the correct answer is
starting one activity from another I
told you it is the intent that carries
the description of your action you want
to start one activity from another
you've got to fire an intent on that
right is anybody still confused over it
or is it clear to everyone now I am sure
you understood it well just that you got
confused is everybody now clear with
this the role of intent this is why I
have kept this poll so help you remind
is everybody clear about the role of an
intent now right okay that's great I
have a lot of yeses coming in so that's
a relief let us talk about our next
building block now the next building
block is called a broadcast receiver is
now what's a broadcast receiver most of
you would have
in that low battery pop up in your phone
right the new battery pop up appears and
most of the applications stopped working
the low battery pop up appears you can't
make a call right you can't play music
you can't play a video you can't use the
camera isn't it right now the point is
low battery battery is a Hardware low
battery is in Hardware event isn't it it
is a hardware event the low battery now
your application is sitting right on the
top of the application layer right Vivek
I did not get your question why don't we
use calling as an app well I did not get
your question anyways so I was talking
about the low battery Vivek please come
up with your question again I was
talking about the loop broadcast
receiver I told you this low battery is
in Hardware event and it happens on the
kernel layer in the lowest layer of the
Android stack which is the hardware
layer when you talk about the
application it is sitting on the right
at the top of the application layer how
does an application come to know about
these system events that happen on the
different layers of the stack right how
does your application come to know about
it it is the job of a broadcast receiver
right broadcast receiver is a dormant
observer that means it's role is just to
sit and observe and observe what
whenever you talk about a dump yeah a
broadcast receiver the broadcast
receiver registers for these different
intents to occur on the Android system
and observes them right whenever any
Android system event occurs like the low
battery or the no network right it
generates it broadcasts a message now it
is the role of a broadcast receiver to
receive these system generated messages
right the broadcast receiver receives
these messages and eventually your
application comes to know about all of
these low battery and
the new you know facebook friend request
while the app is in the idle mode so all
of these system events are observed by
the broadcast receiver and this is what
you know let's the application know
about it is everybody clear about the
broadcast receiver the role of a
broadcast receiver in an Android app
everybody is clear with this john wants
me to repeat it repeat it and vivek say
is calling to someone we use application
free of cost well calling is done
through the call application vivek so it
is also an application no doubt cole is
also an application you music player is
an application your phone book is an
application right so these are all
applications that have been made right
so anyways i think a couple of people
want me to repeat a broadcast receiver
and mostly john
well john I'll give you a simple example
of a broadcast receiver right let's try
to understand the real-life
implementation a for example John I
asked you to sit down on a gate and let
me know whenever Vivek enters that gate
right so I'll come back isn't it I'll
come back you will sit on that gate and
is this scenario simply understood I
have asked you to simply sit on a gate
and let me know whenever we wake up
enters the gate is it simple yes now
assume that Vivek just entered and you
came back to me running and told me sir
you had asked me to observe the vague
and he has just entered and you go back
is this all so simple right well John
you are the broadcast receiver vivek is
the system event and I am the
application now tell me is it clear to
you the broadcast receiver that's great
I think it's
everybody now the broadcastreceiver is
clear to everybody now that's great okay
I have another simple question for all
of you let's make sure that we've
understood everything that we have
discussed today in this class and
Android snow this does not have the
following stages in their lifecycle
choose one amongst running paused or
destroyed now can everybody quickly boot
in let's see how much you remember out
of what you have been taught everyone
can we have the votes quickly and
remember I am talking about a service
and I'm talking about does not have you
got to read the question very quick here
you know very well so can we have the
votes from everyone quickly as of now
the polling results as of now I have 99
percent of the votes have gone to the
poll state and one person put have gone
to the destroyed state so I'm actually
wondering what is wrong with the one
percent audience and now one person has
also gone to the running state so 98
percent paused one person running and
one person destroyed well the correct
answer is the posted guys I told you a
service neighbor has a pause state right
because it is always in the background
it is never visible it has three stages
starting straight running state and a
destroyed state right now is this clear
with everybody in the class for the rest
of the two-person people who went down
for running and destroyed is it clear to
all of you I'm more worried about the
two-person people here in the class okay
that's great I am assuming you've
understood it right now let's try to
recapture what we've talked about up
till now we have talked about the main
building blocks and let's name them one
by one we have talked about the
activities which were the screens we
have talked about the intense which were
the action taken on activities we've
talked about the services that were the
background jobs we've also talked about
the content providers that would help us
fetch data for applications and we've
also talked about the broadcast
receivers which are determined observers
is everybody clear with all of these or
do you have any questions or any doubts
is everybody clear with these all of
these I want to confirmation from all of
you quickly everyone can everybody
very quickly confirmed me that you're
clever all of these all right that is
correct so let's go back ten by fifteen
twenty minutes and let's see these
questions again now tell me do you know
the answers to all these questions now
tell me do you know the answers to all
these questions well in the meanwhile
Sona has asked me I am confused about
content providers
well Sona I told you in a very simple
language in the meanwhile everybody
please concentrate on the questions and
let me know if you don't have the answer
for any one of these
well Sona as I was telling you content
provider is actually an intermediate
figure between applications and
databases
we cannot allow applications to you know
add directly interact with the database
because multiple applications will keep
your data inconsistent will keep it busy
at the moment and it will not be able to
provide uniform Avia is for querying and
all that stuff right so this is why the
content provider sits between the
application and the databases right so
it's like you and me while we are
talking to each other we have this
webinar as a medium we have this chat as
a medium right I cannot allow everybody
to speak in this class because if all of
you will speed how will I be able to
teach you and how will I be able to
focus on your questions so there is a
medium which is a chat isn't it so you
can post it on chat and one by one I can
read it similarly one by one your data
takes care of the queries that are send
by the application I hope so now I
display to you now okay most of the
people have the answers to all the
questions priya darshan he says I don't
have the answer to the fifth question
well how do multiple applications
accessory resources
well Priya - Annie how about content
provider right didn't we discuss that
multiple applications want to use shared
resources from the database right well a
 Kati is confused about the second
well haven't we discussed about starting
running paused stopped destroyed right
so does everybody have the answers to
all the questions
yes brother surely they can access there
is a difference between do they access
or can they access the answer - can they
access is yes they can access is
simultaneously but do the excess depends
right now that is great if everybody has
answered all these questions correctly
as of now now as we had discussed
I have only changed the smiley in this
slide rightly so I believed everybody
would be knowing the answers to all
these questions I want to know from all
of you what is your reason for learning
Android right what is your reason for
learning Android please answer the
question very quickly and select the
desired answer a Shikha will get back to
your question just give me a minute so
what is your reason of learning Android
I mean is it you want to complete your
beat agency a project you want to switch
over to Android development
are you seeking your career as a fresher
in Android you want to grab the
freelancing opportunities or is it just
that you love androids who you want to
learn it for fun can I have the answers
from everyone very quickly in the
meanwhile Asik has asked me is knowledge
in Java necessary to learn Android well
it is not necessary to learn Android
will definitely to make Android
applications you need to know Java so
don't worry about that I'll just come
back to it also so can everybody very
quickly answer this question
everyone now as far as the you know
distribution of votes I can see all
these words are distributed very evenly
almost people have voted for all the
things and all the options and these are
all equal distributions this is where
Android becomes special right for so
many people solving so many purposes
having to solve so many purposes within
itself is a big thing now we all are
here to discuss I mean we we were all
here through the demo class from the
Android development program which is
powered by idle a car aren't we right
let us see what this program is all
about let us see if this is actually the
program that solves our purpose let us
see should we join it or shouldn't we
let us see does this help or not right
let's talk about the Android development
program that is powered by ADA Breaka
well as you can see on the screen we
have divided the complete Android
subject into six sub modules right ashik
to answer your question we are also
covering Java in this program that means
the first division is Java essentials
then we go on to the basics of Android
the basic Android then we move on to the
advanced Android concepts like web
services animations right and moving on
to the sixth module we have covered the
databases and the other advanced topics
right so starting from whatever you need
to develop an Android application it's
here in this course
well yes Vivek I will come back to your
answer as well now how do we do it let's
see how do we do complete this course
and what are the course highlights right
now in this course first of all let me
tell all of you this course has been
specially designed to meet the needs of
professionals and student right ashik
I'll get back to your answer as well
just give me a
right now true for this course you will
be having two to three hours online
classes on weekends now these online
classes are live instructor-led classes
similarly to this class this is also a
live instructor late class but just that
this is a demo class and it is of a
small duration of one hour right and not
that focused towards your subject right
so you will be having two to three hours
online classes on weekends wherein all
these sub modules will be covered
individually right now you're given a
lifetime access to the learning
management system the learning
management system is a student portal
where in all your study material is kept
I will take you through a journey of
that as well you know in just a while
from now for now let us remember that we
have got the lifetime access to a
learning management system now I have a
simple question in my mind if I have
classes on weekends what do i do on
weekdays right I'll answer this with a
very simple scenario I studied Java on a
Sunday in a fine Monday morning I wanted
to revise it right now I have a doubt I
did not understand polymorphism and
inheritance or maybe anything else five
more things should I wait for the next
weekend to meet my instructor and you
know get support from in and clear my
doubts in they'll move ahead know you've
got 24/7 support over Skype email and
phone that means you've got a problem on
Monday morning get a support session on
Monday morning get a support session at
a time which is convenient to you now
this is the beauty of this program
throughout the week you decide the time
of your support class isn't it you're
free at 6:00 you're working professional
you have a 9:00 to 6:00 Duty take a
class at 7:00 take a class at 8:00 you
have a night shift take a class in the
afternoon you decide the time of the
class as per your own convenience this
is something you'll never get anywhere
else apart from this these sessions are
endless limitless that means you can
have as many
were of support classes as you want to
and it's available 24/7 now the biggest
problem that students at the moment
right yes-no mandir has asked me a
question can we set up a support session
even after this course is finished just
remember in case of a requirement you
can do that don't worry you're you
always entered Ericka you never exited
Erica don't worry about that the support
is a will to you post your course as
well anyways so the biggest problem with
the students is that yes I understood
everything in the class but I came home
and I forgot what was the example told
by my instructor right or maybe I am
busy this Sunday I could not attend a
class well you never miss a class and
you never miss a word of that class
because all your classes including this
class are being recorded right all your
classes are being recorded and the
recorded sessions are shared the same
day with all of you right that means you
have a class right there in your email
INBOX
attend it as many number of times as you
want to never forget foot was talked
about in the class never forget what was
the answer to your query and never ever
miss a class not just this you can also
request for a reclass to any of these
classes in case you missed or you have
attended it
that means the six weeks is the
recommended time of this program however
you have the freedom to extend the time
of the program you can attend these
classes as many number of times as you
want to right if you are not through
with java or through with animations in
one week these two topics talk about
them take a class again the next week as
well right so you never miss a class and
the second point there is no fixed
duration it's just a recommended
duration now the bigger picture you will
not just learn you will implement as
well you will not just learn you will
implement as well
as a project to this program you will
make your own live android application
under the guidance of your instructor
and with the help of the support team
there's a big team here to support you
you will make your own live Android
application and you get a chance to
publish your application on the Google
Play Store as well now once you submit
your project complete your project you
get 24/7 support for your project as
well once you submit your project after
a small online review of exam of your
project you are given a globally
accepted verified skills certificate of
being a skilled certified Android
application developer right now this
certificate is globally valued right now
I'll take you through some featured
applications of this month made by our
students right the PNR status inquiry
app made the pressure on Jen right these
are all the rewarded applications of
this month the blackjack app made by
si-xiong the Reebok shopping portal app
made by Andrew Bogota more than tens of
thousands of downloads already and
they've already started monetizing it
right this is how it goes when you make
something you know with such support and
such guidance now I was also talking
about your learning management system
let's have a look at it this is your
learning management system all your
learning material right from the
starting how to install Android in your
system it's right here right your
installation guides your learning video
tutorials your ebooks your quizzes
assignments everything the project
library everything right here at one
place you need not to get into any other
studying material because everything
which is exclusive for you is right here
not just this you are also given access
to a discussion forum now the best part
not and you can post in your questions
over here and seek answers from the
support team you can also see what
others are talking about what are they
learning what are their observations
that their queries what are the
solutions to their queries right amazing
interactive place is this discussion
forum that you are given access to right
so you can see what others are talking
about you can download their
applications you see people have posted
their links for the applications that
they've made they interact with the
other batchmates so everything is great
about this discussion forum now I want
all of you to ask me in case you have
any questions regarding this for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
