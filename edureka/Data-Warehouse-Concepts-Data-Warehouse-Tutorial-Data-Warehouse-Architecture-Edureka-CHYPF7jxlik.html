of ADA Rekha I welcome you all to this
webinar on data warehousing so I'll be
your instructor for trade and in today's
session I'm going to talk about the data
warehousing concepts okay the weariest
concept that are related to data
warehousing like OLAP schemas dimensions
and facts all these things are all the
important topics I'll be covering all
these things in today's session alright
guys so without wasting much time let me
just go to the agenda slide so guys this
is the agenda slide and this is the
topic that I will be covering in today's
session okay and this will be the order
in which I'll be covering them for those
of you who are new to data warehousing I
will give you a quick brief about data
warehousing and I will talk about what
data warehouses and talk about the data
warehousing architecture in detail and
then I will immediately go to the
different concepts involved so the
important concepts that are there are
what overlap is so OLAP stands for
online analytical processing and I'll
talk about will app and detail and then
I'll talk about the various will apps
cubes that we will usually work on right
for any company or anyone working on a
data warehouse the different OLAP cubes
that they work on so I will talk about
these things and after that I will talk
about dimensions facts and measures so
these three topics are interrelated so I
will talk about them in one segment and
the final segment of today's section is
going to be about schemas all right so
this will be the three or four different
topic that I'll be covering in today's
session so guys any doubts here are you
guys fine with the agenda and and I hope
everyone can hear my voice and see my
screen so guys if that's the case please
put your acknowledgments in the chat box
and if you have any doubts during the
session please put them also in the chat
box and I'll get back to you at the
earliest
all right so can I get up with yes one
everyone all right great so have a
couple of guesses from here all right
Anita is saying yes no Phil is saying
yes all right
great a nutbar is saying yes all right
guys so let's get started then first of
all what is data warehousing
okay let's understand what our data
warehouses what data warehousing does
and why it's seeded and what are the
added benefits right so what are the
data warehouse a data warehouse is like
a relational database designed for
analytical leads so you guys might all
be aware of water databases right so you
have your database where you Beast
large amounts of data right you'd be
soaring either in your database or even
in form of flat files okay but flat
files like Excel or something cannot be
used for storing large amounts of data
there is a limit on how much you can
store in an Excel right so that is the
case why you stored data and some kind
of database so example of databases are
those of Oracle my sequel Microsoft
sequel server all these things so you
have all these databases you will store
large amounts of data okay but the
problem is they cannot be used for
analytical purposes so that is why we
have to convert or you know get the data
into a database get that inside a data
warehouse and when it's inside the data
warehouse then we can perform analysis
so that's the advantage so the data that
once has come into the data warehouse
can be used for analysis for
visualization all these things because
you can look at the data and from a
different angle because the data that
comes into the data warehouse is more
information rather than just data right
so what you have your resist data which
you can probably view and you can write
data into these places and you can just
view preneur high levels okay you can
view from the level of every year
transaction that happens so every time a
sale happens then the entire table there
or the entire database will get updated
okay all that will happen button when
you want to perform analysis like what
happened on this day and how many
products were sold during this period of
time all these things cannot be gained
from a database right so that's why we
need to put them all into the data
warehouse and once it's here we can
perform these kind of analysis and you
know get insights from the data
warehouse and of course since the data
borrows your raw or your end-users your
business analysts your data analyst they
can all use it for analysis and
visualization right so that's the thing
about a data warehouse and that's the
use of a data warehouse and it functions
on the basis of full app right so I told
you will a person for an online
analytical processing so the whole
process of fluid analysis or running
queries on data where I was right it's
done on the basis of online analytical
processing right so that's one of the
activities that is done so if you are
running or any kind of queries on the
database then it will be called as LDP
online transaction processing but any
kind of activity or queering on all
these things when it happens on data
it's called OLAP so that's what an OLAP
is guys and yeah basically the central
location where a consolidated data from
multiple locations are stored so you get
data in here from multiple locations
from multiple sources you can get it
from you know one or two databases you
can get from one or two flat files you
can get all this data as long as you
know you are putting it inside the same
table or inside the same columns and
dimensions then you would be fine
because you can get any amounts of data
from any source and you can get them all
and store them all inside your data
warehouse so is that all about data
warehouse is data warehouse so simple
can we just simply get the data in from
database and get it into a data
warehouse and then perform analysis is
such a thing so simple is that going to
be the question on your minds
okay does anyone here has that kind of
fit out if you guys have that out please
raise your hands raise there's an option
on the right side of your raw panel
there's no option to raise your hand so
I mean you're supposed to get that kind
of a doubt and it's a very valid
question right because it looks so
simple from the outside but is it that
simple yes okay I see a couple of hands
raised from Akbar and I see a hand
raised by Anita all right so yeah that's
the thing okay it's not that simple now
let's see what the other activities that
are involved in this whole process of
converting data inside the database
converting it into an information and
storing that into data warehouse and
then performing analysis right so these
are the entire set of activities that
are involved okay now we can also
consider this to be the data warehousing
architecture now before I explain all
the activities and all the different
stages that are there in this data
warehousing architecture let me first of
all go to the definition okay so this
will ask the scholar data warehousing
all right and data warehousing is the
act of organizing and storing data in a
way so as to make its retrieval
efficient and insightful okay so this is
the key terms your to make it retrieval
efficient and insightful so you organize
the data and you so the data in a data
warehouse in a way you can access the
data at a later point of time and that
kind of an access should be easy
you should be in efficient ways to be
able to retrieve the data
there could be meaning out of that data
it should not be the same data that you
store inside your database
okay so inside the database is the data
that you collect so you collected on
your sword inside a database okay but
the data that you get from a data
warehouse should not be the same so it
should serve some purpose it should have
a meaning and it should be for your
benefit so that's the whole point for
data warehouse so that's the difference
between a data warehouse and a database
all right and the data warehousing is
also called as a process of transforming
data into information okay so relevant
data or more process the data that is
also called as information so that's
what is stored inside a data warehouse
and there's a lot of difference between
the data stored in a data warehouse and
the data that is sold inside a database
all right so that is the thing now while
speaking about the architecture and
means let me explain the diagram here
first of all so you have your data
inside your different data sources right
it can be a database or a flat file and
that data should first of all be
transferred into the data warehouse but
how was it done there is an intermediate
stage here that's called the staging
area okay the place where the data is
stored that is called the staging
database okay now this is a temporary
your storage
it's not going to be there for long it's
very temporary so it and the act of
getting the data from here to your
sitting area is done through the process
of ETL okay so ETL your stance for
extract transform and load ok and once
it comes into the temporary storage
again the cross of ETL is used to prance
the data inside the data warehouse
alright so so once the data is in take
your data warehouse it's not just your
raw data that's going to be your ok it's
going to be categorized and it's going
to be divided so you can think of for
these three things mainly so you will
have your raw data you will have your
radar data and you will have your
aggregate data ok so first of all your
raw data is the rows or columns or the
actual data that's being transferred ok
so this next of the junk of the data
okay but metadata is the most important
aspect which power the data warehouse
and which differentiates between
database and data warehouse
why because metadata is something that's
going to work give you data about your
raw data so whatever rules that are
there in your data warehouse or so
whatever information that is there
inside your data warehouse right so
information about that particular data
will be stored in secure metadata so
we'll have data about which are the
different tables that are there in your
data warehouse what each table does and
what kind of attributes are there inside
each table what kind of information what
will be the data type of the data
present on each of those attributes so
all these things would be controlled and
governed by metadata right so without
your metadata your data warehouse is
basically useless and metadata is the
you know so anyone who is working on our
data warehouse right they will tell you
that metadata is what differentiates
everything that's what makes their life
simpler and that's what is actually the
difference between a database and a data
warehouse right so this serves the whole
purpose and the whole difference between
the two so that and then you have
aggregate data right so all these three
things together they form the data
warehouse and then once the data is
inside your data warehouse your
end-users can use this data to perform
analysis so how do they do it they run
queries okay so you have user groups
here and they perform queries okay now
the act of performing queries on a data
warehouse is called online analytical
processing okay that's the OLAP okay so
such queries are called OLAP queries
because they will be analysis based
right so such queries will be analysis
based so that's why it's called on an
analytical processing and you have
something called as data marcher okay
now don't get confused because data
Mart's again not something entirely
different
it's again a part of data warehouse
zoning so the end-users your they can
run that ways either directly on later
where else or on separate data match now
you have something separately called a
data Mart over here because maybe you
want to give the extra security in your
data warehouse systems right so you can
see here there is user group 1 there is
user group 2 and there is user group 3
ok and each of these people they don't
get access to everything and the whole
point of even having the data Mart is
are simply to the restricted access to
your data warehouse so your
organization's or your company's entire
data right whatever is there that will
all be sold in sitio data warehouse ok
but what if you don't want people to get
access for everything and if you want to
just give them restricted access and
give them access only certain tables and
certain records so at that point of time
you can use the data Mart so a data Mart
again you know it is called
small version of data barrows where it
does have data about a particular domain
so supposing the user group won the by
talking about here is something with
sale scene right then you can have a
sales data Mart and the fields data Mart
will only have the sales data from the
data warehouse right and then supposing
this is the operations team right and
they want to access to the operations
data only so then you can form a
separate data Mart for the operations
team called the purchase Mart or
something and then based on that they'll
get access only to the data that is
present inside this Mart
okay so even even though do all these
things we present is at the data
warehouse so you get access only to this
particular table or this particular
domain or this particular field so
that's what the difference is so data
Mart is just basically dividing your own
data warehouse into smaller parts so
that different sets of users or groups
get access to only the relevant
information that they want ok so that's
what data warehousing is and these are
the various equities are involved in
data warehousing ok so this is the
diagram of the data warehouse
architecture and I hope nobody here has
any doubt this again is do have an outer
please or shoot them right away and I'll
ask them because next up is the various
data warehousing concepts ok now if you
want to understand data browsing
concepts in detail then you have to have
complete understanding of this I mean of
course it's simple so I don't expect you
people to have any doubts but yeah if
you do have any doubts please put them
in the chat box and I'll get back to you
all right so moving on the data
warehousing concepts now let us
understand the various concepts
revolving around data warehousing like
OLAP dimensions facts and schemas so
first of all let me give you a brief
about will up again let's go into
details here as it says will up is a
flexible way for you to make complicated
analysis of multi-dimensional data ok so
when we say multi-dimensional data then
whatever data is stored in a database it
has multiple views right so they'll all
be sued in such a way that you can
perform analysis then we store all the
different tables will be linked with
each other right so there'll be
different views every different
categories of data and all these things
you know to perform analysis then you
use the OLAP activities right so the
hola
you run on that data and whatever data
stored in a data warehouse that's called
multi-dimensional data and the very act
of you know storing it is in the form of
OLAP cubes right so you have OLTP on one
side and we all roll up on the other
side so as you can see this line it says
OLTP systems use data stored in form of
two-dimensional tables okay an example
of this would be any excel so you will
have your rows and you'll have your
columns here okay you'll have your rows
and columns and you'll have your data
stored over here so this is your LDPC
can run on them and you can not do all
these things okay but reference with the
OLAP is they'll be stored in form of
OLAP cubes right so they'll be multiple
dimensions there will be multiple views
that you can get of the same data with
respect to the year with respect to the
number of sales with respect to the
different products all the things you
can get a single view of all these
things so as you can see this diagram is
more for 3d view right so that's what
will a pure stands for so we call it
OLAP cubes and a word word reader that
is stored inside your data warehouse and
with Radar you access with the help of
lab activities then that data is called
as multi-dimensional data so that's what
the whole line here is all about right
so your data basically is converted into
a multi-dimensional form and that
particular data to access that data you
use OLAP queries and yeah it will be
stored in such OLAP cubes right so these
are the three different things and the
next point it says data warehousing is
modeled on the concept of OLAP yeah this
again this is what I told you right so
what our data is stored inside a data
warehouse is basically stored in a multi
dimensional form and it's a certain form
of cubes and to run your queries on your
rock you you run OLAP queries right so
that's why the entire process called
OLAP cubes and processing multi number
dimensional data on your OLAP cubes
right now that's where data warehouses
but with your data based database
however are remodeled on the concept of
OLTP right online transaction processing
so your data bases are modeled on the
concept of Ltd and your data warehouse
is modeled on the concept of OSAP or
so that's the key difference between the
two or the based on which these two are
remodeled and your LTP systems use data
as sorted form for two-dimensional
tables with rows and columns and your
OLAP will have multiple views right so
your OLAP cubes and cuboid so you will a
password in that infrastructure but
whereas your LD be there you just have
your x-axis or y-axis or your
two-dimensional data right so that's the
thing about OLTP and yeah that's the
difference between the two and well the
advantages of over LTP are first of all
that when you can see data from multiple
angles right from different angles from
different views from different
dimensions then you will get new ideas
right so you get new insights you can
think of different things and your whole
job of making analysis and getting
insights will become simpler it will
become easier with the hazard book or
lab activities right because it supports
so activities like filtering and sorting
of data so maybe filtering and sorting
of data may be possible even inside OLTP
okay but there is a limit on that so if
when you have data stored in multiple
tables then you cannot do filtering and
sorting of data right now that is the
advantage with a data warehouse so even
if you have data stored in multiple
tables you might have four different
tables or five different tables and will
have like thousands and millions of rows
and you know transaction that will be
stored in those tables okay in spite of
all these things you can perform
filtering and sorting operations or any
mathematical operations like calculating
all these things okay you can do all
these things and get the output inside
one single new table so that is the
difference between OLAP and OLTP right
such activities cannot be supported on
OLTP idea so it finally says that you
know data can be refined so when you can
perform such kind of analysis when you
know your data looks much simpler for
you to read right when you can gain some
information out of your raw data then we
called refine it so that's the other
advantage of OLAP you know that the
other advantage that Olaf has over OLTP
so that's the other thing about on an
analytical processing right so now I've
spoken about these things now let's go
to the next slide so first of all in
OLAP access there are three different
types of cubes okay so the first one is
molap roll up and roll up okay so you
know it we also call it m ola mo lab or
mo lab so this answered
multi-dimensional online analytical
processing rollup stands for relational
online analytical processing and whole
app stands for hybrid online analytical
processing alright so guys the whole
topic here is OLAP cubes right so your
OLAP cubes is where your data will be
stored okay now the analysis that you
will do the kind of queries that you'll
run they will all be OLAP queries and
they will all be on the
multi-dimensional data okay so the data
that's going to be stored inside your
cubes is going to be multi-dimensional
data okay but your multi-dimensional
data where are they going to get stored
okay so that is be your whole topic sure
so there are three different types of
places where you can sort your
multi-dimensional data okay
so there are three different types of
OLAP cubes so the first type is
multi-dimensional OLAP cube okay when we
say multi-dimensional OLAP cube then
this is your default type of OLAP cube
so your mole up is a form of olá that
process and source data directly into a
multi-dimensional database so you have a
multi dimensional cube and then your
readout be swollen site that particular
database now the advantage here is that
it will give you excellent performance
and it can perform complex calculations
okay but the problem is only limited
amount of data can be handled in your
Molag okay but then there's a difference
between molap and OLAP ok I'm not that's
where rollup scores over at molap so
roll ups and for relational online
analytical processing now roll up the
form of OLAP that performs dynamic
multi-dimensional analysis of data
stored in relational database rather
than in a multi-dimensional database now
what this means is that in your molap
you have your multi-dimensional data you
will be storing it inside a
multi-dimensional database right so this
will be your Ola cubes okay so what that
means is you have your data that we saw
inside a multi-dimensional database okay
thus making it a multi-dimensional data
and that is one type of lab that is a
multi-dimensional olá but relational
olap is getting that multi-dimensional
data converting it into a relational
data
unless you're going to get a relational
database right so that's what it says
here in the process of storing data in a
relational database so in your roll up
you will have your multi-dimensional
data stored inside your relational
database and then you will be running
multi-dimensional analysis and
multi-dimensional queries on a
relational database so that is the
difference right so your queries that
you'll be running your data is basically
going to be multi-dimensional all right
even your queries that you'll be running
will be the same it'll be OLAP queries
okay but the difference is the place
where it's stored the data in case of
for OLAP is stored in a relational
database okay but whereas in case for
multi-dimensional OLAP it is stored
inside a multi-dimensional database
itself now the other difference between
the two and the speaking of see
advantage and why rolap can be used
instead of molap is because a greater
amount of data can be processed in this
case all right but in case of small app
what is limited amount of data can be
handled at any point of time but however
the problem is it requires more
processing time and a lot of disk space
now it needs more processing time
because you are going to convert your
multi-dimensional data into a relational
data and once you've converted that you
are then stored into a relational
database
now this is certainly more time
consuming than your multi-dimensional
OLAP right so that is one set context
with your raw relational olap and also
your amount of disk space that will be
occupied because of all these process is
going to be greater now that's the
disadvantage but of course that comes
with the benefit right so you're getting
something out of using this so that's
the difference between multi-dimensional
OLAP and relational olap and then this
is the two basic differences and then
you have a third one that's called as a
hybrid OLAP right so your raw hybrid
will have this basically combination of
both your molap and your roll up so the
positives and your advantages of both is
used in your raw hybrid Allah so the
advantage with the roll-up is that kulap
can drill through from the cube into the
underlying relational data right so what
it means is you will have your cube here
and you'll have the underlying
relational data right so using hole up
you can drill 2 into the relational data
using
your review so that's the thing about
whole app which makes use of the best
features of both your multi-dimensional
OLAP and your relational olap right so
this is the three different types of
OLAP cubes so this is again one
important question that you'll be asked
in any job interviews right so if you
guys are you know operating for any job
interviews then you have to know the
difference between these three cubes
because you your work will primarily be
revolving around these three aspects so
so Kate in the audience do we have
anyone that is going to appear for an
interview very soon awkward naw fulanita
any any of you okay versus he is going
to attend one very soon all right so
you're still learning upward okay great
so he's still learning data warehousing
and probably when he's done he might go
for it an interview and the thing that
you need to remember Robert is the
difference between these three because
this is a short question in any of your
interviews right so any job interview
regarding data warehousing and all these
things you will be asked and you should
know all these things right so that's
the differences and the types of OLAP
cubes so moving on to the next slide so
the next topic that we have for today is
that up or lap operations all right so
we have five different operations and
they are roll up drill down slice dice
and pivot okay so these are the five
different OLAP operations that we can do
on our draw will have some
multi-dimensional data right so way to
our first operation that is the roll-up
now before I explain this let me tell
you why I am explaining operations first
of all so I am explaining the OLAP
operations so that you can understand
what are the kind of operations that you
can do on your data warehousing and the
things that you cannot do on your data
base right so with the help of OLAP and
since data stored in such a
multidimensional of fashion these kind
of operations can be performed right so
first of all let's get started with our
roll up operation so let's read the
definition first so roll up or something
that forms the aggregation or data cube
by either clamming up concept hierarchy
for a dimension or for dimension
reduction okay so when we say climbing
up the concept hierarchy for a dimension
it basically means you will have a
particular dimension here right so in
this case we have the dimension of
cities so we have four different cities
we have bus Chicago New York Toronto and
Vancouver okay now supposing you want to
go to the next hierarchy in this
dimension okay you want to add a couple
of attributes here and more to the next
dimension of countries then you can do
that so if you look at this example here
we have converted this dimension which
is in the form of cities to countries so
USA is a country which has Chicago and
New York as cities and Canada is a
country which has Toronto and Vancouver
as cities so we have converted this
dimension into the city dimension of
that special in this cube into country
dimension right so this is the kind of
operation that we've done so we've done
that using a rollup
operation right so that's the thing and
let me first spin this concept or this
example so first of all we have this
cube here and we have different axis
right we have x axis we have y axis and
the z axis so these are x axis where we
have the different items right so the
different types of products there are
they're for sale so we have mobiles
modems phone and security right so this
is the four different items that are
there for sale and then we have the time
time at which the phase were done like
different of quarters or for your
quarter 1 4 2 4 3 a quarter for right
and then we have the different cities
Chicago New York Toronto and Vancouver
so this is the ESL axis y axis and this
is the x axis now when we say we are
doing a roll up your roller corporation
we are basically converting this
dimension into a different dimension
with the different set of attributes
right we are changing this whole
dimension so in this dimension right now
we have these two cities part of from
USA and these two cities from Canada so
we are doing a developed such that we
are doing a rollup on location and
converting the cities into countries so
if you look in this year we are
aggregating these two attributes right
so these two different attributes
together and these two attributes
together so when you do the roll-up and
when you convert this dimension then
what you get is for USA you have the
total number of stages 2000 okay because
it is the aggregate of New York and
Chicago for 40 plus 1 5 6 0 but whereas
for Canada its 395 because only Toronto
adds to this and there is a knit from
Vancouver all right so that's what we
said when we are doing a rollup so we
are doing a rollup
the items based on any particular
dimension right so this dimension we
aggregated a part of this dimension and
we converted this dimension from
Mercedes to country so this is the kind
of operations that you can do on the set
of attributes that will be present
inside your dimensions so that's about
the roll-up okay
now the next operation that I want to
talk about is out of drill down now
drill down is something that is the
reverse of Road up so what we did in a
roll of course we aggregated set of
attributes right so let's break down the
entire attribute into smaller attributes
all right so we can do that by the
stepping down of concept hierarchy for a
dimension okay and by also introducing a
new dimension so if you look at this
example it's a similar cube where you
have a similar DDS where we have tails
for the quarter one we have the four
different total years and basically the
dimensions the same right so we have the
items or types for Russell we have the
different time and the different cities
okay but when you look at this diagram
what you've done is when you say drill
down we have there and drill down
operation on the time
so the time here right the time
dimension we have represented each of
them by quarters so quarter one or two
or three and quarter four but the thing
is each quarter can be further broken
down into different months so in what
one you will have January February and
March right so what we've done without
the for drill down operation is we've
broken down this quarter one into the
different months respectively so if you
look at this one here if you look at PE
or security that has been sold 404 to
one then if you look at that then that's
been divided into three different months
right so in January February and March
and how many products have been sold and
each of those are three different months
so this is the kind of for example right
so we've done a drill down on the time
so here it was in the form of a quarter
and we drill it down this whole
particular attribute into three
different attributes three further
attributes right in two months
and similarly we have three other
entries here and each of those would be
divided into different attributes so
through for four different attributes we
have twelve attributes where each of the
database habit and further divided into
three attributes summing it up to twelve
in total so that's the other thing so
that isn't between a rollup and a
drill-down
so let me go back to the previous life
remnant so in this case what will just
be aggregated these attributes and we
reduce the number of attributes in that
dimension right so we converted them
from four number of attributes in the
form of studies to two and boosting
countries so two attributes in this
dimension all right so in this
particular dimension we have four
different attributes and we've increased
that to twelve different attributes by
adding three attributes to each and
every single attribute here right so
that's the thing that we can do with
dimension so that's the the next
operation that we can do on dimensions
right so that is the difference between
roll up and roll down all right guys so
all through all right
great so let's move on then so next all
operation I'm going to talk about is out
of slice operation right so the slice
operation provides a new sub cube from
one particular dimension in a given cube
now what this means is in any cube of us
we'll have three different dimensions
right so we have our access here we have
our y-axis and we have our x-axis so
three different dimensions here and what
the slice operation means is with the
help of three in the three different
dimensions we can use one of the
dimensions and break it down into a two
dimensional cube right so if you look at
this example here here we have only our
y-axis and we have our x-axis right so
the z-axis is missing now what we've
done is we have taken the time and we've
done a slice of the time so we've done a
slice for only quarter one so here we
have different representations for
different quarters so quarter one or two
or three and quarter for now the data
that is displayed here is with respect
to only the quarter one and since we
have drill down into the quarter and
since we have taken a time as a
reference we've replaced the time
dimension here with the location
dimension right so this comes to the
y-axis and the whole representation here
is only with respect to q1
right so that's what you mean with
respect to our slides so you slice one
particular dimension and you get into
the videos of that particular mention
with respect to the other dimensions so
that's the slice operation and then
moving on to the next slide we have a
dice right so the dice operation
provides the new sub cube from two or
more dimensions in a given cube right so
in the earlier examples we saw you know
we saw slice right so slice what it does
is it you know gives us
a new sub cube from one by using one
particular dimension in a given Q okay
but the ties here it gives us a new sub
cube from two or more dimensions in a
given Q so if you look at this example
again we have the location dimension we
have the time dimension and we have our
items dimension here correct and what
we're doing here is we're using the dice
for a location okay so we have four
different cities so we are run dicing
only for this location of Toronto and
Vancouver right so because we are dicing
only for Toronto and Vancouver in our
final large cube we have only Toronto
and Vancouver here correct and then
we're also sizing the tile here so we
are doing a dice operation on the time
with respect to quarter 1 or quarter 2
so we are only dwelling into the details
of Q 1 and Q 2 here and again the item
is the third dimension which we are
dicing and we are realizing it's on
mobile or modem so here we have a mobile
modem phone and security right so these
two are ignored and we are dicing the
item only for mobile and modem so here
if you see the x-axis we have only
mobile and modem and after the dice the
y-axis has only q1 and q2 and the racks
will have net around on Vancouver so
that is the three different dimensions
that have been dies right so if you are
going to you know get a new sub cube by
your making use of two or more number of
dimensions in your cube then it's called
the dice operation but however if you
are wrong getting a new sub cube from
your existing cube by your slicing only
one particular dimension then it's
called slice operation so that is the
difference between slice and dice okay
so we have the difference between
roll-up and drill down then you know the
difference between the slice and dice
right so that's the difference between
these two and then finally we have one
operation called as pivot operation so
the pivot operation is also known as the
rotation operation okay it basically
transposes both the access whether it's
the X and Y axis it transpose it them in
order to provide an alternative
presentation of data now if you look at
this example here we have these location
dimension on the y axis and we have the
item dimension on the x axis right now
these two are row transpose now that's
what a pivot does so when you transpose
them your item comes your and your
location it comes over here your
location dimensions your and your item
dimension is here
right so even your data corresponding to
them are transposed so I hope you guys
got Teja will learn the concept of
operations right so the five different
operations which can be done with the
help of OLAP data warehouse so I hope
you guys got the entire concept here
right so the kind of operations that you
can do using your OLAP activities right
on your data warehouse so that's the
thank you right so these are the five
different operations and moving on to
the next slide
so the next topic that I am going to
talk about is that of dimensions all
right so the tables that describe the
dimensions involved are called dimension
tables so first of all to give you an
example of what a dimension is in data
base you have something called as tables
right so you have different tables which
will be a part of your database now
similar to tables we have something
called as dimensions in data warehouse
so we have dimension tables which will
have a set of attributes so our customer
dimension will have the customer details
like the customers ID the customer name
and the customer address okay and your
product dimension will have other set of
attributes like your product ID product
name and your product type and similarly
you will have a date dimension which lab
the order date the shipment date and
deliberate it right so each of these
dimensions they talk about a different
aspect of your entire data warehouse so
your data warehouse may be one for you
know in this example it is that of
e-commerce company right and as you can
see here it says the e-commerce company
here this is the subject and the
dimensions are these and these are the
attributes right so first of all why
would we need dimensions why should we
use dimensions right so we go to the
table for having different dimensions
instead of data warehouse similar to
having tables in our database we have
different dimensions in our data
warehouse why should we have all these
things you can have that kind of a
question now the answer to that is
dividing your entire data warehouse
project in two dimensions provide
structured information for analysis and
reporting right so when you break down
your render data warehouse into
different dimensions like for your
customer Delia's you will have a
separate dimension called as customer
dimension for your product details you
can have a separate dimension called a
product dimension and only for other
things you can have other different
and when you break it down in a
structured form like this your analysis
and reporting can be very easier why
because when you store data it will be
in this form right so you will have your
customer here you'll have your customer
ID the name address and the product that
particular person purchased the name of
the product the ID of that product the
type of the product and then the date as
to when it was ordered when was it
shipped and when was the delivery
completed so you have all these details
in a structured format so that's what
the benefit that dimensions and data
warehouse gives us right so end-users
can simply fire queries on this
dimension tables this content
descriptive information so you will be
here as an end user and you cannot just
fire or simple queries on your raw data
warehouse and you will get the answer
that you need so that's what is the use
of for having dimensions and that's the
benefit right so any doubts here guys
that's about the dimensions that's why
we should have different dimensions in
our data warehouse project all right
so moving on to the next slide so the
next topic that we have here is that of
fat and measures all right now in the
previous slide I spoke about dimensions
right so we spoke about there being
different dimensions in our data
warehouse and then we being able to sort
them filter them up are using different
queries right now how do you think you
can run your queries and result because
by the look of this table you might not
be able to get an idea of what kind of
dimensions here to filter orb it's kind
of four dimensions here to sort so you
have that kind of out right so that's
where the whole cost of facts comes into
picture facts and measures so factor
something that helps you measure your
row dimensions so water does let's look
at the definition first a fact is a
measure that can be summed averaged or
manipulated okay and every fact table it
contains two kinds of data a dimension
key and a measure all right now what
this means is or you will have all your
dimensions in your data warehouse but if
you want to perform any kind of query
like any sorting or analysis or some
kind of drill down or all these things
you can only do it if you have a fact
so for every dimension you will have an
Associated fact and using the back you
can measure your dimensions okay
so that's what it says here
if you want to measure the data that you
have in your data warehouse if you want
to measure any kind of data that is
there then you use the fact to measure
your dimensions and that is the reason
why your fact table will have two kinds
of data it will have a dimension key
which will basically be the link to your
dimension table and then it will have a
measure so your measure is something
that's going to calculate the data that
is there in your dimension right so the
dimension key is going to let you
connect to your dimension and the
whatever data that you get from there so
whether it's any kind of addition or
subtraction or any kind of average that
you want to take or the summing or
manipulation so whatever arithmetic
operation are you perform that should be
stored as an measure in your fact table
right so that is the relation so it will
have one particular dimension key which
will connect to the dimension and the
results from here what are the
aggregates or what are the operations
performed the result of that will be
stored as an measure so that's the thing
all right and it also said every
dimension table is linked to a fact
table yes now that's the thing now if
you want to perform any kind of query or
analysis on any dimension then you need
a fact table that's what we are talking
about in the Geo final line here it is
only if you have a fact table can you
perform you know any kind of queries or
analysis right so that's the thing and
it also ruled that for every dimension
table you have to have a fact table
so you cannot have any dimension table
in your data warehouse without a fact
table and that is what is the whole
process that leads us to having lot of
flexibility with respect to wearing and
analysis and all these things right so
take this example in your fact table you
will have one product dimension and then
that will have a dimension key and a
measure right so your dimension K would
be that of Product ID and your measure
would be that of the number of units
sold right so your product can be your
path table and your dimension key might
be that of Product ID so you'll have all
the different products that you have in
your repository and if you want to find
a number of units role then you can
perform any kind of arithmetic operation
there and measure of that will be stored
over here as the number of four units or
so that is the fact table so that's the
whole concept you're right of facts and
measures all right so moving on to the
next slide we have that of schemas okay
so if you remember what we spoke about
here right off for about dimensions
facts and measures so these are the
important topics that will help you
understand the whole concept of schemas
so getting back to schemas a schema is
basically that which gives the logical
description of your entire database okay
it gives details about the constraints
placed on the tables key values present
and how the key values are linked
between the different tables now what
this means is you have different
dimensions or if you take the example of
a database you have different tables
right so you have multiple tables you
will have an employee table you will
have a department table and how do you
link them by using the whole primary key
foreign key relationship right so that's
the example that's showed over here so
you have one table here that is of
employee your table and the other one is
that of the part mental and in your
table you have a department ID which
acts as the foreign key right and then
you have your department table where
Department ID is the primary key and you
use the department ID to do any lookups
correct so that's the whole concept of
first key Mazur in a database but
whereas in a data warehouse we follow a
similar model of primary key and foreign
key okay but we don't use the entity
relationship model here
however we use the star schema the
snowflake schema and the fact
constellation schema right so this is
three different schemas that you use to
establish relationships all right so
that's what a schema is I'm pretty sure
you all know what a schema is right so
you guys should all have a good idea of
word schemas and what it does but
anyways talking about the different
types of schemas that you have in your
data warehouse and a couple of slides
earlier I told you that every dimension
table will have a fact table right so
that's what this diagram also symbolizes
so if I can recall then over here I told
you that a fact table connects look at
the data are damaged key and a measure
all right and I told you that every
dimension over here is supposed to have
a fact table is supposed to be linked to
a fact table and it would be linked with
alb of schemas okay so that is the
relationship between dimensions and
facts ok measures are something that is
going to aggregate the data that is
present in your
dimensions and it will store it again in
the fact table okay
but the fact table and the dimension
table will be linked with the help of
your schemas and your schemas if you
talk about schemas in the concept of
database then it would be an entity
relationship schema right based on that
entity relationship model there will be
a link right so that will be the
relationship but in case of a data
warehouse they will be using a three
different types of schemas like cost our
schema our snowflake schema or fact
constellation schema so let's just talk
about these schemas and how the primary
key foreign key relationship works over
here okay in these three different
schemas so the first one is the star
schema and in our star schema each
dimension here in a star schema is
represented with a one dimensional table
which contains a set of attributes okay
so when we say a one dimension table it
basically means that there will be a
parameter key foreign key relationship
between the fat and the damaged table
only okay so we'll have your primary key
in your dimension tables and you will
have the Associated four and eat in your
fact table okay so to look at the
example of D log
okay this is a dimension table and the
dealer ID is a primary key okay and into
your fact table you have the dealer ID
which is the foreign key now similarly
for your date dimension table then the
data ID right this is the primary key
and this is the foreign key here and for
your product dimension table model ID is
the primary key and your model ID is the
foreign key okay and similarly for the
branch dimension table you have your
branch ID which is the primary key over
here and which is a foreign key over
here now when we say primary key foreign
key it basically means your dimension
table can now only one entry so each of
your primary key so whether in this case
if it's your dealer ID then each dealer
can have only one ID right and there can
be only one date there can be only one
entry for a particular date cannot have
multiple entries for the same weight and
similarly you cannot have multiple
products with the same ID right so you
cannot have multiple products with the
same model ID and if you look at this
example you cannot have different brands
or supposing there are three different
branches then they should have different
IDs right so they cannot have the same
ID so that's why we say that the primary
keys they cannot have duplicate
values right so the primary key over
here is branch ID which cannot have
duplicate values the primary key here is
modernity which cannot have duplicate
values and your at state ID and your
user ID right so these are the primary
keys in the four different dimension
tables which cannot have duplicate
values but however in a fact table you
can have duplicate values right because
you'll be making use of the foreign key
so using the foreign key you will be
referencing to the damage in table
you'll be looking up to the dimension
table and the because of that you can
have duplicate values there's no
restriction on not having duplicate
values right so we have a foreign key
relating to all the four of our tables
and those are the four different
dimension keys that we have and along
with that we have two different measures
right so units sold and revenue are the
two different measures so revenue we use
revenue to find the total number of
products that we have sold so we have a
product ID will have the name already in
variant ID right so each of those
products how many have we sold so all
those things will be part of our revenue
and the same thing with units sold so
each and every product that result the
number of for those products will be
present here and the money that we'll
made out of selling these products will
be present enough revenue right so that
is the whole concept of measures here
okay so let me just go back to this
slider as you can see a fact table
contains two kinds of data a dimension
key and a matter correct a dimension key
and a measure a dimension key is
basically the foreign key here which
we'll be referencing to the primary key
in your dimension table so that is your
dimension key and your measure is
basically the calculation or the
arithmetic value will be stored based on
the operation that is performed on your
dimensions so that's what has been
explained in this slide right so you
have your units sold and you have your
revenue
correct so these two will be your
measures and these four will be your
four different dimension keys for four
different tables so that's about your
star schema so if you understand your
star schema then it will be easier to
understand the other schema because they
are just a slight variation okay but
what you got to understand is the main
thing is that every dimension table will
be linked to the fact table correct so
that is the one thing which you have to
remember and talking about the next
appoint a fact table is at the center
correct so the packet is at the center
it
keys to every dimension table and
attributes all right so it has the keys
to every different dimension table and
it has attributes like units sold and it
has revenue as the other measure correct
so that's the thing about the start kima
that's how this works now we're the next
slide we have something called as a
snowflake schema okay now it just
slightly modified version of your star
schema when we say modified in technical
terms we call it normalized
okay and when using normalize it means
split into additional tables so if you
have one table which is having a lot of
attributes then we can break down this
table into further tables so that's what
is happening over here so if you look at
this table you have your stock table
okay over here in your star schema you
had only your dimension table and you
have your country ID you add your
location ID you had all these details
okay but inside your raw snowflake
schema you have split this delay table
into two further tables one is with
respect to location and the other is
with respect to country right so you
have your location ID foreign key and
your country ID foreign key over here
and they will be referenced to your
location ID primary key in your location
table okay and to your country ID your
primary key in your country table right
so that's how things work so since your
table is being normalized or split into
additional tables it's called the
snowflake schema correct the same thing
is done here right so you have something
bowlers variant ID which is again a
foreign key and that is reference to the
primary key which is inside the variant
table correct as you can see so these
four where the dimension tables that
were present in the star schema and if
you normalize these tables or this data
warehouse further then you get your raw
snowflake schema
right so it's further normalized into
additional tables so that's what the
difference between a star schema and a
snowflake schema is all right so I hope
there are no doubt guys if anything if
there are any doubts please put that in
chat box all right so the other thing
about snowflake schema and then now we
have one more type of pesky McCullough's
galaxy schema okay it's also called as
the fact constellation schema and the
concept here is that the galaxy schema
contains more than one fact table okay
now we saw a star and snow
like right so here it had a single fact
table but the number of damage in tables
went different right we had additional
dimension tables and there were
additional dimension tables which are
normalized in case of our snowflake
schema but in case of our galaxy schema
where you have two fact tables right so
you have two fat tables and you have
your dimension tables such that some
dimension tables can have more than one
fact table okay so if you take the
example of our branch dimension and your
date dimension so these two tables have
two fact tables they both have the fact
table of revenue and the fact table of
product okay but however the product
dimension table your okay and this one
has only one fact table that is product
and the dealer dimension table here has
only one fact table that is revenue
correct so to help you understand this
in a simpler fashion I've broken down
this product into another row dimension
table right so earlier we had the one
product table here and here we have
broken down this product table into
further a product with respect to
product ID correct so that's the whole
concept or if you have more than one
fact table then it's called a galaxy
schema so this would probably help you
understand correct so the revenue in
product or the two fact tables and the
dimensions which are shared are called
confirmed dimensions so that means these
two dimensions which are rochette by
more than one fact table these who are
called conformed dimensions correct so
that's the whole concept of galaxy
schema so guys any doubts
okay so guys that was about the gaseous
keema all right and those are the three
different schemas that you can have in
your data warehouse all right so if
you're going to work on radar warehouse
in a dam in your future then you can
formulate your whole organization's data
in generative arrows by using any of
these schemas okay they are either Rho
star snowflake or galaxy schemas so
that's it about the schemas and yeah
that's it so that's the end of the
session and let me just summarize
whatever I've covered in this session
all right so I first give you an
introduction to what is data warehousing
I spoke about a water heater warehouses
how it is a benefit and what are the
activities involved in creating a data
warehouse the whole concept of core data
warehousing and I spoke about the
architecture here and then I spoke about
online analytical processing I spoke
about the different types of labs right
what are the advantages of that Ola has
overall DB and the different operations
that are there that we can do on the
OLAP cubes so I spoke about all these
things and then I spoke about what are
dimensions fashion measures so
dimensions was one concept that I start
off from OLAP itself when I was talking
about collapse operations so it started
there and then we went on to talk about
what are dimensions facts measures and
then finally a finish off today's
session we're talking about schemas
right so we had the three different
schemas with respect to star schema and
snowflake schema and fact confliction
schema so this is three different
schemas that are used in a data
warehouse right so that's it that's the
end of the session and thank you guys
thank you for attending the session and
if you have any doubts please put that
in chat box or you can email it to me
and I'll get back to you immediately all
right so all the best I'll probably meet
all in the next session and until then
see you take care guys
