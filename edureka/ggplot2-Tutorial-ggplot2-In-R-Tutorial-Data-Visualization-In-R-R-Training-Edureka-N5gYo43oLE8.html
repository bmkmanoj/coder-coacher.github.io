I'm really excited to bake this session
on ggplot2 let's look at the agenda
we'll start off by making some plots for
the besa graphics following which we
will understand what is grammar of
graphics and then finally we'll be
making really beautiful graphs with the
help of the ggplot2 package so let's add
if your idea is to make quick and dirty
plots then you can definitely take the
help of base graphics from our and for
the sake of the practical we'll be using
the iris dataset and on the iris dataset
we'll be making the scatter plot
histogram and box plot so let's start
the practical this is our studio guys
let's quickly look at the iris dataset
this data set comprises of five columns
which are sepal length sepal width petal
length petal width and species are using
the table function let's look at the
different species of iris flower I can
use a dollar symbol to select one
particular column from a dataset so what
I'm doing this with the help of dollar
symbol I'm selecting the species column
of the iris dataset so what we see is
the species are equally distributed that
us there are 50 observations each of
setosa versicolor and virginica
so let's start for the plotting
we'll start off by making the
scatterplot the idea behind a
scatterplot is bivariate analysis not us
so I understand how does one variable
change with respect to another variable
and over here trying to understand how
to sepal and change with respect to
petal length we've given sepal length on
the left side of the tilde symbol and
hence it will be plotted on the y-axis
we have given petal length on the right
side of the tilde symbol and hence it
will be plotted on the x-axis Ballas
whatever value we give on the left side
of the tilde symbol it is plotted onto
the y-axis and whatever value we give on
the right side of the tilde symbol but
is plotted onto the x-axis let me zoom
this so we see that as the petal length
increases the sepal length also
increases notice there is a linear
relationship between these two variables
let's make this plot more descriptive by
adding labels have added three more
attributes over here which are why lab X
lab and main
now while app can be used to give a
label to the y-axis similarly X lab can
be used to give a label to the x-axis
main can be used to give a title so I've
given petal length as the label for
x-axis sepal length as the label for y
axis and the title sepal length versus
petal length because that is what we're
trying to determine let's also add color
to this plot i've added two more
attributes which are co l &amp;amp; p CH co l
can be used to add color PC heads
determines the shape of the start so you
look at the previous plot we see that
this is a hollow circle without a color
so here we see that this is a solid
circle with a blue color so when I give
the value 16 to PC H this will give me a
solid circle that was bivariate analysis
with the help of a scatter plot
let's do univariate analysis with the
help of a histogram the hist function
can be used to make a histogram and I'm
plotting the sepal width onto the x-axis
we can see that the minimum value of
sepal width is 2 centimeters and the
maximum value of sepal width somewhere
around 5 to 6 centimeters and most of
the observations their value of sepal
width is around 3 centimeters
let's again modify the labels and add
color to this the labels used are xlab
main and Co L so I'm giving the label
sepal width to the x-axis the title is
distribution of sepal width and the
color is aquamarine 3 you see this color
over here this color is aquamarine 3
we're done with scatterplot we'll onward
histogram now it's time to make a box
plot
we can use boxplot to determine how does
a continuous variable change with
respect to a categorical variable so
over here sepal length is a continuous
variable species is a categorical
variable and since I've plotted sepal
length on the left side of the tilde
symbol it will come on the y-axis and
since I've given species on the right
side of the tilde symbol it will come on
the x-axis so the sepal length was a
species and we see that if the species
of the iris flower is virginica then it
will have the maximum sepal length and
of the species of setosa then it will
have the lowest sepal length quite an
interesting observation isn't it
again Villard labels will also add color
so I've assigned the label species onto
the x-axis I have assigned the label
sepal and third of the y-axis I've also
given it a title which is sepal length
of different species so these were the
plots made with the help of base
graphics now there are two major issues
with this so the first issue is is a lot
of print quality that is if ever we
would want to publish these plots for an
international journal or an
international presentation then that
would not be possible again so another
major issue is these are just images and
if you want to add leaves over these
images again that is not possible with
the help of piece graphics so that is
where we need the help of ggplot2
package and prior to making graphs with
the ggplot2 package we need to
understand what is grammar of graphics
because the prefix Gigi in ggplot2 it
stands for grammar of graphics so let us
go to the presentation we started off by
making a scatterplot we added a color to
it then we made a histogram and a box
plot then we understood what was the
problem with base graphics so it's
finally time to learn grammar of
graphics so this is Sam he's a data
scientist and he'll teach us the grammar
behind visualization now he gives this
example so there are two sentences I am
John and I am John I so Sam tells us
that I am John is correct and that is
because it follows grammatical rules and
again I am John I doesn't make sense at
all because it does not follow the
grammatical rules now since every form
of communication needs to have grammar
since visualization is a form of
communication as well it needs to have a
foundation of grammar so let's look at
the components of grammar so we have
data aesthetics geometry and facet a
prior to plotting we need to select a
data set and this is the component data
which you are talking about we will
select a dataset after selection of data
set we need to plot the data columns on
to the east helix so simply speaking
aesthetics are the scales on to which we
plot our data so select in the data
we've mapped the data on to the
aesthetics now it's time to select a
geometry
so the examples of geometry would be box
plot scatterplot histogram and so on how
many times what happens us will be
working with huge data sets and when
we're working with huge data sets there
would be lot of categorical variables
and Lord of numerical variables and
plotting all of them onto a single graph
might lead to chaos that is why we need
to facet or data or in simple terms we
need to divide the data into groups and
when we do this this gives us better
visualization now these are not the only
components of grammar of graphics we
have other components as well such as
the themes Leo coordinates layer and
schemes layer but broadly speaking these
are the major components let's start
with the ggplot2 package the ggplot2
package is a simplified implementation
of grammar of graphics which you've just
understood and thus ggplot2 package has
been written by Hadley Wickham for R so
this is what we'll be doing in the
practical will select the data and we'll
mark the data columns on to the
aesthetics and these are the easter eggs
which we have x-axis y-axis fill color
shape in size so for the Easter decks
part will be taking the iris dataset and
we'll start off by mapping the petal
length and sepal length onto the x and y
aesthetic then we'll also take the
species column and map this onto the
color esthetic next instead of the color
aesthetic will be mapping the species
column on to the shape aesthetic so
let's go ahead and do that so ggplot2
guys the main power of the session
we'll load the package again prior to
loading any package we're supposed to
install it so I click on install I type
our ggplot2 over here and when I click
on install we'll be installed but then
again since I've already installed the
package I don't need to do it again so
let's follow grammar of graphics first
step would be selection of data and over
here of the data is iris now this gives
us a blank plot we have selected the
data now it's time to map the data
columns on to the east headaches so I've
mapped the sepal length onto the ye
static and I have mapped petal length
onto the X aesthetic you can see that
over here petal length is on the x-axis
sepal length is on the y axis so let's
select the geometry geometry is geom
point over here Jaume point will give us
a scatter plot so these are the three
components of grammar of graphics data
aesthetics and geometry now we already
had done this with the help of the base
graphics and we can easily see the
difference so this is a much better plot
then what we did with the base our
graphics let's go ahead and play with
the east headaches of ggplot2
so there seems to be a problem and this
we are supposed to give ggplot over here
now I've mobbed so already we had
assigned petal length on to the X
aesthetic and sepal length under the ye
static in this step
I've also mapped the species data column
on to the color aesthetic so what we see
over here is the color is determined by
the species column and if the color is
pink then the species is Seto so if the
color is green then the species of the
flower is vesicular and that the color
is blue
then the species of the flower is
virginica so what we can see is if it is
of virginica then it will have the
maximum petal length in sepal length
similarly if the species of the flower
is setosa I'll have the lowest petal
length and sepal length interesting
observation again now instead of mapping
the species column on to the color
aesthetic I'm mapping the species column
on to the shape aesthetic
so now the shape is determined by the
species of the flower so the shape is
circular then the species setosa at the
shape is triangular then the species
rosy color and the shape is a square
then the species is virginica
now let's see both of these plots we can
easily say that this plot it is easier
to draw inferences and the others why it
is always important to choose the right
aesthetic for the right data so finally
we'll go ahead and plot the species
column onto both of these aesthetics
which are shape and color
so shape and color both of them are
determined by the species column so we
see that both of them have been changed
so this was playing with these statics
now we'll also go ahead and look at
multiple geometries so we have histogram
bar plot frequency polygon box plot
you know the different geometries which
you have so we'll be looking at each one
of them
and to play with the geometry I'll be
using the houses dataset let's go ahead
and load this data set I'll be using the
read dot CSV function so with the reader
CSV function we can load a CSV file I'm
showing the result in the house object
let's look at the house object or the
house data set so this column tells us
the price of the house this is the lot
size this column tells us if the house
has waterfront or not this tells us the
age of the house the land value of the
house whether the house is newly
constructed on art this column tells us
if the house has centralized air
conditioning or not these are the fuel
type and heat type used then we have the
sewer system then we have the size of
living area following which we have the
number of fireplaces in the house number
of bathrooms in the house and number of
rooms in the house now we see that we
need to remove this column these are
just numberings for the roofs so let's
go ahead and remove the first column and
to do that I'll be using the deployer
package I can load the package with the
help of library function again prior to
loading any package I am supposed to
install it so I just type our deployer
over here when I click on install the
package will be installed so it's time
to delete the first column
this is the pipe operator from the mag
reto package and this helps us to
connect things so from the house dataset
we are selecting all other columns
except the first column you see the
minus one over here so that means we are
selecting all other columns except the
first column and storing the result
again into the house dataset let's have
a look at the house a desert we see that
the first column which had the numbering
of the rows has been deleted so it's
time to play with the geometries I'll
start with a histogram
the first step is to select the data we
selected the house's data the next is to
map a data call him on to the aesthetic
so we have mapped the price onto the x
aesthetic then we've selected the
histogram geometry
so we can understand that most of the
houses their price range is around two
likes to four lakhs and the maximum
price of the house is somewhere around 8
lakhs you see this values - e + 0 5 4 e
+ 0 5 6 e + 0 5 so they basically mean 2
into 10 power 5 4 into 10 power 5 + 6
into 10 power 5 and that would again
mean 2 lakhs 4 lakhs and 6 lakhs
let's add some color to the histogram
prior to that so you see this one go
here now this tells us that number of
bins is 13 or is the default value of
number of pins so what I've done is I've
increased the number of bins to see
greater variation this was the previous
plot this is the next flower to add
number of bends is equal to 50 so we see
that there is greater variation in the
distribution of price
we'll add color now so I'm using the
fill attribute to add color and the
color given is pale green for let's also
add color to the boundary I'm using the
co L attribute to give a color to the
boundary
the spot looks really pretty doesn't it
so above clouds have used fill as an
attribute so now let's use fill as an
aesthetic
so over here I'm mapping air
conditioning onto the Philly static so
what we see is the color is determined
by the air conditioning column so if the
house has centralized air conditioning
then the color of the pin would be blue
and the house does not have centralized
air conditioning then the color of the
bin will be pink so what we can conclude
from this is most of the houses do not
have air conditioning so if you see this
price range around two lakhs to three
point seven five likes and there is a
greater proportion of houses which do
not have centralized air conditioning so
as the price increases from let's say
three point seven five lakhs to eight
likes the probability of the house
having air-conditioning increases
now let's change the position
now this give us the count of the bins
this will give us the proportion so I'm
using position is equal to film so when
I say position is equal to fill this
will give me the proportion instead of
the count so what we can see is as the
price increases from here to here there
is a greater possibility of the house
having air conditioning so as the price
increases from let us say around fifty
thousand dollars to four lakh dollars so
over here we see that the houses which
are in the price range of four lakhs
there is a greater likelihood for them
to have air conditioning cause the price
of the house increases from four lakhs
to 8 lakhs the probability of the house
having air-conditioning increases even
more if you look at these two bins you
can see that if the price of the house
is closer to eight lakhs then the house
will definitely have centralized air
conditioning
so that was histogram now we'll go ahead
and make bar plots now people mostly get
confused where to use a bar plot and
where to use a histogram so simple rule
is this whenever you want to see the
distribution of a continuous variable
then you will go with a histogram and
variable you need to see the
distribution of categorical variable
then you'll use a bar plot let's make a
bar plot
so the first step select data map data
column on to the acidic so we have
mobbed waterfront which is a categorical
variable and we've mapped this onto the
X aesthetic we've selected geometry
which is a Ambar
that'll give us a bar plot so we see
that this gives us the distribution of
whether the house has waterfront or not
let's look at the data set now this
tells us that there are around 17 28
entries or in other words there are 17
28 houses and out of the 17 28 houses we
can see that around 1600 houses will not
have a waterfront so this is the bar
which tells us that the houses do not
have a waterfront and this is the bar
which tells us that the houses have a
waterfront so there are very few houses
which have a waterfront
you
let's go ahead and see
so we've mapped the air conditioning
column onto the fill aesthetic so the
color is determined by whether the house
has air conditioning or not and we've
given the position to be fill so this
gives us the proportion so these two so
this is the bar which tells us that the
house does not have waterfront and this
is the bar which tells us that the house
has waterfront and if you take this bar
we see that if the house does not have a
waterfront then around thirty percent of
the houses will have centralized air
conditioning and the house has a
waterfront then around 25 percent of the
houses will have centralized air
conditioning
now let's give another data column to
the Philly static now we are mapping the
sewer data column or the type of sewer
system onto the Philly static
so this bar tells us that the houses not
have waterfront and this bar tells us
that the house has a waterfront and if
you look at this so we see that if the
house does not have a waterfront there
is a tiny bit of possibility that the
house might not have a sewer system as
well and if the house has a waterfront
then the house will definitely have a
savior system whether it is private or
public another inference is if the house
has a waterfront then there is greater
possibility for it to have a private
sewer system so if the house does not
have a waterfront then there is a
greater probability that it will have a
public sewer system
that was a bar plot we've already made a
histogram so one alternative to a
histogram can be a frequency polygon a
frequency polygon is again used to see
the distribution of a continuous
variable so over here I've selected the
house dataset I've marked price onto the
X aesthetic and the geometry is germ
freak poly so the same inference can be
drawn we see that most of the houses
their price range is around 1.5 X to 4.5
x
let's go ahead and increase the number
of Bin's so this gives creative
variation
so this was the original plot increased
the bin size this gives us greater
variation let's go ahead and again
change the number of pens let's put it
to be hundred so again there is create a
variation let's reduce the number of
bins so I say bins is equal to ten now
there is the variation again decreases
and that decreases quite a bit
now in this command I've mapped the air
conditioning DITA column on to the color
aesthetic so if the color of the stove
is red and this indicates all the
observations of those houses which do
not have air conditioning and the color
of the curve is blue this indicates
all the sub survey shion's of those
houses which have centralized air
conditioning so again we can say that
there are a greater number of houses
which do not have centralized air
conditioning so that was a frequency
polygon now we'll make box plots
personally box floor is my favorite
so as we know that with the help of
boxplot we can understand how does a
continuous variable change with respect
to a categorical variable so since price
is a continuous variable I've mapped it
to the Y aesthetic and room so initially
rooms was actually or numerical variable
so this is actually a numerical variable
but with the help of the factor function
I am converting it to a categorical
variable and I've mapped it to the
x-axis so I'm trying to see how does
price change with respect to the number
of rooms so we see that as the number of
rooms increases rise of the house also
increases so let's look at this box plot
and this box plot so we're here the
number of rooms in the house is two and
thats price will be somewhere around one
lakh dollars and that the number of
rooms is twelve then its price or
average price would be somewhere around
three lakh dollars to four lakh dollars
these dots which you see are outliers so
when I say outliers that would mean they
are beyond the average values so these
are values where the price of the house
is closer to eight lakh dollars but that
is not the norm so the norm of a house
which has twelve rooms so it would be
somewhere around three lakhs to four
lakhs let's go ahead and add color to
this so I map the number of rooms on to
the fill aesthetic so that is why the
color is determined by the number of
rooms over you
now I'm mapping the air conditioning
column onto the fill aesthetic so
what we see is there are two box plots
so we can easily compare so let's take
this case so when the house has 12 rooms
we see that if the house is centrally
air-conditioned then its price will be
much higher than the house which does
not have central air conditioning so the
case is same for if the houses 11 rooms
10 rooms 9 rooms and so on so we can do
multivariate analysis over here so rooms
number of rooms is on the x-axis price
is on the y-axis so we have two
categories over here which is determined
by whether the house has air
conditioning or not so if we see at this
so we see that if the house has two
rooms there is no possibility of the
house having centralized air
conditioning
let's make the next box plot over here
we are assigning the sewer data column
on to the fill aesthetic again let's
look at this on this so we see that if
the house has two rooms then the house
will have a private sewer system again
if the house will have 12 rooms then it
has two possibilities
so either the house will have a private
Co system or a public sewer system and
the price of the house which has a
private sewer system will be higher now
if we take a look at the house which has
11 rooms then if the house has a public
sewer system then its price will be
higher than the house which as a private
Co system if we take a look at the house
which has nine rooms then if the house
does not have a sewer system then its
price will be lower now these two are
quite comparable so whether the house
has a private sewer system or a public
sewer system its price would be
somewhere similar the RO is box plot
let's go ahead and make a smooth line
a smooth line is used to see how does
one continuous variable change with
respect to another continuous variable
so over here I've marked price onto the
y-axis I have my size of living area
onto the x-axis and the geometry used as
John smooth so what we see is there is a
linear relationship that as has the
living area increases or the size of
living area increases the price of the
house also increases you see the scree
area around this line so that is the
error you can remove error by stating SC
is equal to false
now I'm mapping the air-conditioning
dita column on to the color East attic
and I've given a C is equal to F that is
we are making the error to be false
since the color is determined by whether
the house has air-conditioning or not so
this is the line which tells us about
all the observations which have
air-conditioning and this is the line
which determines all those observations
which do not have centralized air
conditioning and again we can see that
if the house has centralized air
conditioning its price will be higher if
we see the price for this had stops
somewhere around four point five acts
and this price goes above six lakhs
let's make the next floor
so now the color is determined by the
heat data column
so we have three heating types electric
hot air and hot water and so the Green
Line this is for hot air and the blue
lines this is for hot water so you can
see that if the heating type used in the
house is of hot air then the price of
the house would be higher and again if
the heating type used as hot water then
the price of the house would be quite
low
now this is quite an interesting plot
have used two geometries over here John
point and John smooth I have mapped ties
on to the by aesthetic I've mapped
living area on to the X aesthetic now we
here what you see is I have given the
attribute method is equal to L M so that
as it gives me a linear model
so this jump point gives me a
scatterplot between price and living
area jerome smooth gives me a linear
model between the price and living area
so again as the size of living area
increases the price of the house also
increases and that is verified by this
linear model over you in this linear
model tells us that there is a linear
relationship between the living area and
the price of house
let's make a similar plot
so over here I'm using another aesthetic
which is color I'm mapping the
air-conditioning data column on to the
color aesthetic again I'm using two
geometries Jerome point and John smooth
so the scatterplot is given to us by
John Point and these linear models have
been given to us by John smooth so the
color is determined by whether the house
has centralized air conditioning or not
so where these dots are of red color
that would be houses which do not have
centralized air conditioning and these
dots which are of blue color they
determine the houses which have
centralized air conditioning again we
can make a similar inference that if the
house has centralized air conditioning
the price will be high
so it was John Smith so you look at
different geometries now it's time to
facet our data now we see that this
floor does quite chaotic so to reduce
this chaos we can facet the data into
two groups so let's go ahead and do that
you can see the difference between this
plot and this plot so now till here the
command is the same that is we've marked
rise onto the y-axis we have mapped
living here onto the x-axis we've mapped
air conditioning onto the color ascetic
and we've used two geometries geom point
and John smooth now here comes the facet
layer so over here what we see is we are
faceting it on the basis of the air
conditioning column so we have two
facets which determine so the first
facet tells us that all of these
observations do not have centralized air
conditioning and the second facet tells
us that all of these observations have
centralized air conditioning now making
inference from this plot is much easier
than the previous plot so we can easily
say that if the house has centralized
air conditioning then its price will be
higher
let's go ahead with the next plot so
over here PI's onto the y-axis living
area on to the X aesthetic for the color
I've used a different data column so the
color is determined by the number of
fireplaces in the house again the
geometries are geom point in java smooth
and I divided the data on the basis of
the fireplaces column
so there is one facet for the houses
with zero fireplaces another facet for
houses with one fireplace and similarly
for two fireplaces three fireplaces and
four fireplaces so now if we look at
these three facets we see that as the
living area increases the price of the
house also increases so further as a
house with zero fireplaces one
fireplaces in two fireplaces as the
living area increases the price also
increases if you look at the density of
these two dots you see that there are
greater number of observations or
greater number of houses which have one
fireplace again similarly following that
we have greater number of houses which
have zero fireplaces and this is quite
scarce which would mean that there are
very few houses which have two
fireplaces if you take a look at these
two facets they tell us that there are
just two houses which have three
fireplaces again there are just two
houses which have four fireplaces
now in this plot I'm changing the XE
static Dallas on the x-axis I'm mapping
the each column rest of the geometries
and rest of the Easter eggs are same so
I'm trying to understand how does price
vary with respect to the age of the
house and I see that if the age of the
house increases the price decreases so
the address of the house is old then its
price would be likely lowered and if the
house is new and surprise should be
likely high so again if we look at these
three columns again they tell us that
there are greater number of houses which
have one and two fireplaces again these
two so there are very few houses which
have three and four fireplaces
so I've learned how to do faceting now
we learn how to make this plots really
presentable with the help of the theme
layer so let's go ahead with a first
plot
she had already made this plot to
understand how it is price vary with
respect to the number of rooms let's
make this more presentable with the help
of theme layer what we need to
understand this
all of these are objects so they can be
grouped together and stored in one
object so I am storing the result and
the object and naming it as obj1 and I
can build further layers onto this
object so on to the obj one I am adding
another layer and this layer is of
labels so in the labs function I'm
giving the title of the plot I am giving
a label to the x-axis and I'm giving a
label to the legend over here so the
title given a price with respect to
rooms and the label given to the x-axis
is rooms and the label given for the
legend over here which is filled as
again rooms now lets me store this into
another object obj2 or on the top of obj
- I'm adding the theme layer
so themed layer helps us to give a theme
to applaud so you see this panel dot
background attribute over here with the
help of this attribute we can add a
background to the panel so this is the
panel and these are the different
functions which we can use so we have
functions such as element blank element
gr OB element line and element rectum if
you want to change any rectangular space
then we'll be using the element rect
function if you want to change the text
of something we'll be using the element
text similarly if you want to change
some grid lines or the outer boundaries
then we'll be using the element line
function so over here since I wanted to
modify the background which is of the
rectangular shape so I am using the
element rect function and inside the
element red function and giving the
background to BP a green one again let
me store this into a new object let me
name it obj 3
so you brough understood by now that
clicking add as many layers as possible
under these objects so this is the
benefit of ggplot2 I'm adding another
themed layer over the object 3 and this
themed layer consists of the plot title
so this was the initial plot which we
had and to that plot I wanted to change
the title so and since I wanted to
change the title I'm using the element
text function and in that element text
function I am using the head just
attribute 2 center-aligned the title
initially the title was left aligned now
I'm changing the title to be
center-aligned again initially the title
was not pooled I'm using the face a
tribute to make the title bold
similarly the color of the title was
black I'm giving it the color cut it
blue using the color attribute let me
store this in another object I'll be
naming it as obj for now it's quite
difficult to understand so these values
so what do the exactly mean to e + 0 5
for e + 0 5 now we do know that this
indicate the price of the house in
dollars that would be easier to
understand so let's go ahead and modify
the by labels so I'm using the scale Y
continuous function so you can
understand by the sense price as a
continuous variable and I have nabbed it
on to the y axis so that is why I'm
using the scale Y continuous and I
wanted to change the labels so I'm using
the labels attribute and I'm giving the
value to be dollar so initially these
were the values which have been changed
to values of dollars so now we see that
the prices are in - like dollar is full
like dollar 6 like dollars and so on
we see that this plot is really
presentable we made all the changes we
have given proper labels for the x-axis
y-axis and also to the legend we made
the title to be more colorful they've
also given a very pretty background
color so now this is of print quality
which can be published in any
International Journal let's take another
plot and let's add theme to it
this was a plot which we had already
built we had visited the data and we
were trying to understand how this price
vary with respect to the living area so
let me store this in the Jeevan object
and on top of the Jeevan object
I'm adding the team leader and I'm
assigning the background to the panel
using the panel dot background attribute
and again since it is a rectangular I am
using element rect function and the
color given by me is lemon chiffon for
this color which you see this is lemon
chiffon
initially the background of the color is
gray I've changed it to lemon chiffon
again let me store this result in
another object I will name the object to
be g2
let's add another team leader with us
I given a background to the legend using
the legend dot background attribute so
in the previous plot we saw that the
legend did not have a background over
here they've given a background to the
legend let's again store this result in
a new object I'll name it to be g3 and
on top of g3 let's add another theme leo
now we can assign a background to the
panel as well as the plot so this is the
panel and behind this is the entire plot
so this pays overuse which you see so
this is the entire plot so now I'm
assigning a color to the entire plot so
I can use the plot dot background
attribute and for this I'm using the
element underscore rect function and the
color given by me is light coral so this
color is light coral
this is on
we'll take one final plot and we'll add
themed layer to that final chord as well
this was the frequency polygon which we
had built you see the size attribute
with this we can change the size of
these curves so if I give it to be
around five I will be getting really
rough curves again if I change the size
to be around 0.5 I'll be getting quite
thin curves so for the purpose of this
plot I'll be giving the size to be one
because it seems to be perfect for the
plot now let me store the result in P
one object onto the P one object we'll
be adding the theme leo
so in the theme lair I'm adding the
background to the panel using the
element rect function and the color
given to the background is peach puff so
this color is peach puff let's store
this into a new object P 2 and on P 2
let's build another leo
so this layer is of the labels so I've
given the title which is frequency
polygon for price let's again stores
into a new object which is p3
so this is the final theme later so on
to the p3 object we made two changes
using the theme layer so over here I'm
changing the title of the plot and again
I'm giving a background to the entire
plot so the title given is frequency
polygon for price so over here I'm
adjusting I am Center aligning the title
so initially it was on the left side now
using the head just is equal to 0.5 I am
Center aligning the title afterwards I
am giving a color to the background
using the element rect function and the
color given is aquamarine 4 so this
color which you see in for the entire
plot that is aquamarine 4 so we've taken
three plots and we've made it more
presentable using the themes layer let's
recap what we did in the entire
practical we started off by making a
scatter plot histogram and box plot with
the help of base graphics then we
understood that these are not up to the
mark so then we took the help of ggplot2
and we played around a bit with the east
ethics of ggplot2 finally we took the
houses data set and in the houses data
set we tried to explore the data with
different geometries we started with a
histogram then we understood there is a
histogram used and where is a bar plot
used following which we've also used the
frequency polygon geometry now we
understood that frequency polygon as an
alternative for a histogram and then
we've made some really beautiful plots
with a help of a box plot following
which we've made some plots with help of
a smooth line and then we decided to
facet our data now after we were done
with all of this now we use the themes
layer to make our plots more presentable
we took two plots we took three plots
actually and we've added themes layer on
to all of those three plots and made
them more presentable so this was it for
