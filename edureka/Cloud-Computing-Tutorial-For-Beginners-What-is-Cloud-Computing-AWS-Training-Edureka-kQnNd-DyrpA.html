welcome to this session on cloud
computing tutorial for beginners guys
this is a live session and it's meant
for people who are new to the cloud
computing industry right so I'm going to
start with the basics today I'm going to
discuss cloud computing from scratch and
I hope you enjoy this session today
alright so let's go ahead and start with
the agenda to see what all we'll be
covering in today's session so guys this
is our agenda we'll start with why do we
actually need cloud computing and then
move on to see what is cloud computing
exactly after that we're going to see
what are the different cloud models
which are there in cloud computing and
moving on we'll look at cloud providers
or cloud providers or the companies
which provide you with the cloud
services all right once we're done with
that we'll move on to the hands-on part
where you will launch your first so in
the cloud we will try to deploy it in
AWS and in Azure as well alright so guys
this is our agenda for today I hope it's
clear to you some things that I'd like
to mention guy is any doubt do you have
you have during this session please
comment it in your comment box my team
is here to help you out in that all
right so with that let's start today's
session with the first topic which is
why cloud computing all right so let's
understand this using an example say you
want to host a website right and say
there is no cloud computing right now
right and you want to host your website
how would you do that so first you would
have to buy a stack of servers right you
need servers to host your website on
after that you have to keep the peak
traffic in mind now what is peak traffic
peak traffic is basically the traffic
which comes for a shorter duration for
example you can expect the most traffic
between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. the kiss that
is the time when people are the most
free right so there's a peak traffic and
after 10 p.m. the treif a traffic and
decline so when your traffic booms you
have to have the servers to manage them
right and after 10 p.m. if the traffic
declines these servers that you have
deployed Touma handle your
traffic become idle right so you have to
get maximum servers so that you don't
get any problems when the traffic goes
up in a peak right after that since you
have these many servers you have so so
so many servers you have to continuously
monitor and maintain them because you
don't want your website to experience a
downtime right so you have to
continuously monitor them and maintain
them so that your website is up and
running right so these the set up that
is built without cloud computing had
some disadvantages let's see what were
the disadvantages right so first of all
the setup was very expensive because
you're buying service on your own right
and so us guys are not cheap they were
very expensive all right so the setup
was very expensive
also since you're troubleshooting
problems on your own that is you're
maintaining your servers you're
monitoring them at the same time right
so these problems could be tedious and
they can conflict with your business
goals what I mean by that is if you have
someone to handle your servers then you
can actually focus on how you can expand
your application but if half of the time
you're worried whether your website ex
is experiencing any downtime or are you
protected with all the latest security
patches and everything and then you
cannot focus on a security goals all
right the third thing was since the
traffic is varying your servers will be
idle most of the time right so like I
said you have to have the maximum
servers so that your any any kind of
traffic can be accommodated within your
servers right so what what also like a
give you a window that between 6 p.m. to
10 p.m. you will experience the most
traffic but what will happen 10 p.m.
happen after 10 p.m. after 10 p.m. a
traffic will drop and most of your
servers will will become idle so that
was a problem all right so these
problems were to be faced or these were
to be solved and we solved it using
cloud computing now came cloud computing
and now we were able to solve these
problems with like this so first of all
our problem was that a set up was very
expensive
right so with cloud computing it was
solved how because now we don't buy
servers anymore right we just rent them
from the cloud providers and we can rent
them not on a monthly basis not on a
yearly basis but on an hourly basis
right on our new basis and now you can
rent them actually on minutes basis as
well so as long as you want the servers
you pay for them and when you are done
with your servers you can terminate them
and that's it you don't have to pay any
more so this is a very cool thing about
cloud computing also the scalability
factor so you had to scale your
resources according to your traffic
right so you don't have to maintain the
maximum number of servers now what you
can do is you can various number of
servers according to traffic so if the
traffic is more you can auto scale the
servers to to a number which is which is
okay with the number of people who are
trying to access your website and as the
number of people who are trying to
access your website goes down as the
traffic goes down you can scale down
from the number of servers you were
having all right so scalability is again
a feature in cloud computing also with
when you rent servers in cloud you don't
have to manage them or maintain them
anymore so that is the responsibility of
the cloud provider who is providing you
with those cloud cloud servers so that
so now you can focus on your business
goals you can focus on how to expand
your application and other things it so
it becomes very tension free when you
using cloud computing and at the same
time it's cheap as well so it's a
win-win situation so we were understood
why do we need cloud computing let's go
on and understood understand what is
cloud computing exactly all right so
cloud computing is it is the use of
remote servers on the internet to store
to manage and to process data rather
than doing it on a local server you do
it on remote servers so this is what
cloud computing is you can store your
data you can manage your data using
databases or you can process your data
using you happen by by renting a server
which has larger processing power so you
can get it faster your work you can get
your work done faster rather than have
had to do it on a local computer which
would happen slow on the other hand you
if you wanted to do a large batch
processing work
you could have bought the server which
had a lot of processing power but that
would have make sense because after your
work is done you don't need that
computer anymore
right so all of that problems could be
solved with cloud computing okay now
cloud computing also is further divided
into models right so there are two types
of models in cloud so the two types of
all the service models and deployment
models so service models basically mean
the kind of service that cloud offers
this service can be divided into further
modules and then you have the deployment
models how can it deploy your
application to them when I say deploy
your application how you can upload your
application in what ways you can upload
your application on the cloud all right
so these are the two different models
that you have in cloud computing so
let's discuss them one by one so first
let's discuss the service models what
are service models right so you
basically have three kind of service
models in cloud computing you have
infrastructure as a service you have
platform as a service and then you have
software as a service right so let's
discuss each of these so first you have
the infrastructure as a service so when
I say infrastructure as a service
imagine it like this you get a server
one cloud right so you you choose an
operating system and you get that server
on the cloud for example you want a
Linux system on the cloud right so you
say you request your cloud provider for
the Linux system and they give you a
fresh system to work on so they'll give
you the IP address they'll give you the
password you can Remote Desktop into
that server and now that server is fresh
you can install anything on that server
and you can make that so anything for
example you can make that's about to be
a web server you can make that server to
be a database so it's all yours you can
do anything with it so that is
infrastructure as a service because you
have the access to the operating system
of the of your so right so it provides
virtualized computing resources over the
Internet no worries about the underlying
physical machine because you don't have
to manage the physical machine that all
of that is managed by the cloud provider
and it abstracts the user from the
physical machine all right so these are
the points about infrastructure eizember
then comes platform-as-a-service so in
comparison to infrastructure a service
where you were getting the access to the
operating system and you can do anything
but the system when you are using
platform as a service you don't get the
access to the operating system all you
get to an access to is user interface
for example you want to host a website
right so you take a service from AWS or
Azure and you say I want a platform I
don't want the whole infrastructure so
what they do is they launch a server and
they don't give you the IP address and
password to it so you don't get the
access to the operating system what they
do give you is a button right so you can
click on that button which is upload and
upload your website onto it right and
that is it you don't have to install any
software you don't have to manage the
files over there you don't have to do
anything you just have to upload your
files and those files will be
automatically deployed on whatever link
that they will give you all right and
you go to that link and the website will
be deployed as it is you don't have to
manage the operating system at all this
is what platform has a services and then
comes software as a service so software
is a service basically means you don't
get the server and you don't get a user
interface you basically just get a
software right for example Salesforce
clouds that is the most common example
you might that you guys might know and
for those of you who don't know sales
was imagine it like this so if you
launch a server on the cloud you are
getting Windows operating system as well
right now as you guys know Windows
operating system is licensed right but
if you are renting the server on the
cloud you are basing basically using
Windows as a software as a service as
well
right because you have rented the
windows operate a software as well right
so that that is the most easy way you
can understand it and that you take
software as a service rather than taking
the whole solar as a the whole
infrastructure as a service or taking as
a platform as a service right so this is
what a software as a service is moving
on guys now if you would like to
conclude what you just learned you can
see if you have
your own computer you'll have to manage
the networking the storage the servers
the virtualization operating system and
everything right if you take
infrastructure as a service from a cloud
provider you have to manage only the
operating system middleware runtime data
and applications right so this is what
in French oxidiser services if you take
platform as a service where and you just
can upload your application you get the
applications and data which you can
manage the rest everything is managed by
the cloud provider and if you take
software as a service you don't get the
X you don't get to manage anything you
just can use the software as you want
and when you're done with it and just
delete it from your subscription right
so you don't have to manage the
underlying computer you don't have to
manage the underlying operating system
not anything just the software that you
get pay for the software that you use
and you are done with it right so these
were the service models then comes the
deployment models so what are deployment
models so deployment models are
basically of three kinds you have the
public cloud you have the hybrid cloud
and then you have the private cloud
right so what is the difference between
these three public cloud is basically
when you are sharing your server with a
host of different people right for
example you launch your server on AWS
right so if you're launching your server
on AWS you are basically getting a
server on the AWS infrastructure now you
don't know whether the server on which
your operating system is hosted is also
giving operating system to someone else
or not because on one server you might
have hundreds of operating systems which
are virtualized all right so if you are
say using a Linux system on AWS and you
haven't specified that you need a
standalone so or you haven't specified
that you need a private server your
server can be shared with a lot of
customers right so if you would like to
opt for a standalone system that
standalone system could be a private
cloud because they give you the server
privately that this is your server and
we have deployed only your operating
system own to it and you can use it you
can be stressed short you can be safe
with your data
but I said it's not like if you are
using a public cloud server your data is
not safe but some companies have this
policy that the data is confidential and
it cannot be hosted on public cloud so
in that case you use a private cloud the
other side of private cloud is that you
host your own servers right you buy it
servers and you set up your own flower
right and you deploy applications on it
that also is termed as a private cloud
now hybrid cloud is actually a mixture
of both public cloud and private cloud
so if you have an application wherein
you're using public cloud and private
cloud both you term it as hybrid cloud
for example if you are in a data science
company right and you want to host a
website so hosting a website can be done
on the public cloud but you have at the
same time you have some confidential
data as well that you don't want to
expose to the Internet right so you can
do that on public cloud as well but
because of company's policies you can
host it on your own servers right so
this kind of architecture then comes out
to be a hybrid cloud architecture
wherein you use making use of public
cloud and private cloud booth right so
these were the deployment models guys
moving along now you've learnt the basic
concepts about cloud you know why do we
need cloud you know what is flower
exactly you know the different models of
the cloud and you understand that okay
so this is what the cloud world is all
about but how do you get started how to
get your own server in the cloud so for
using cloud computing you first have to
contact a cloud provider and if you want
to choose bitch Club cloud provider to
choose there are actually hundreds of
cloud providers out there right so which
one to choose so let me list out a few
of the cloud providers you have
Rackspace you have digitalocean your
vibe iam cloud Microsoft Azure Google
cloud platform joint thermic VMware and
of course AWS right so AWS and Microsoft
Azure if you talk about they are the top
two cloud providers in the industry
right and today in this session I'll be
telling you guys about AWS and Microsoft
Azure both right so let's go ahead and
launch a first server in
ws and Microsoft reservoir right so
let's move on to the demo section let me
quickly switch to my browser where you
can learn servers so hold on a sec all
right guys so this is how my this is my
browser so first I'll be going on to the
AWS console so let me go to the AWS
console alright so the first thing that
you need to actually be on AWS is
creating an account so I'm assuming you
guys have an account on AWS but if you
don't once you have that just go to your
console and this is how it will look
like right so these are all the services
that AWS has to offer us so we are image
to launch our first server in the cloud
right so the infrastructure as a service
part that I was telling you that service
in AWS is called ec2 right so you'll be
clicking on ec2 and you will see this
console right so we are interested in in
launching an instance right so I click
on launch instance and then I get to
choose the operating system that I want
right so for now let's launch an app
onto the server so I'll select the
Ubuntu server I'll choose the processing
that I want processing path that I want
now remember guys for those of you who
are practicing in AWS once you create an
AWS account there is something called a
free tier right so a freeter under the
feed here you can launch AWS services
free for one year up to a certain limit
all right so remember the only free
Theory eligible processor and this in
these selections is 2 T 2 dot micro so
ensure that you're selecting theta dot
micro every time you're launching or so
right for practice next you will click
on next and you don't have to worry
about all these settings since this is a
basic session we are just interested in
launching of browser in a server you can
straightaway go ahead and click on
review and
everything is by default set so you can
review all the settings which you have
done and now click on launch once you
click on launch you will be prompted
with this screen where you have to
create a key pair what is the key pair a
key pair is a basically a way to
authenticate yourself to the servers of
AWS right so you basically have a public
key and a private key so whenever you
are trying to connect to your server you
have to match your private key with the
public key which is there on AWS so to
get they give you the private key and
every time you try to connect you have
to feed in the private key to connect to
the server all right so let's create a
new key pair right now let's click on
create a new key pair and let's give it
the name as payment underscore 2 all
right
and now let's click on download' key
pair all right so my keeper has been
downloaded let's copy this key pair to
our desktop right let me paste it here
all right so my key pair has been pasted
here and now let's click on launch
instances all right so my servers are
now being launched I can check the
status of my servers by going on to the
AWS management console and clicking on
ec2 so I can go to this particular link
and as you can see there will be a
server which will be deployed so it says
it's in the pending state that basically
means it is being deployed right now ok
so while this is being deployed let me
quickly show you how you can deploy a
server in the azure cloud service as
well right so for going to the Azure
service let me type in the URL that is
portal dot-com and again you have to
have an account to actually work in
Azure so once you create an account you
will be prompted with this screen which
is basically the console wherein you can
work with Microsoft Azure so what we
want to do is we want
launched server in Azure so let's do the
same thing let's launch an Ubuntu server
in as well so like in AWS the
infrastructure-as-a-service was known as
ec2 service in AWS right so if you talk
about this that same exact service in
Azure that service is known as virtual
machine so we'll go to virtual machines
I'll click on virtual machines and we'll
be prompted with the screen so we have
to add a new server click on add and
then we'll get this screen wherein we
have to choose our choice of operating
system so let's let's launch and a12
server and then with what type of
Windows overdue I won't let choose the
16.04 one and let's click on create
right with that you will get this screen
wherein you have to fill all the
information so let's name our server as
Eddie Rica demo - 1 then the user name
so user name is basically the login name
that you want your server to have so
let's give it the name as Eddie Rekha
the authentication type so it it it
supports both it you can either have our
syndication type of the public key that
I got in AWS or I can just choose to
have a password right so that is pretty
simple let's choose a password here and
let's confirm the password all right and
then you are prompted to choose create a
resource group so basically a resource
group is something where is a group of
resources right so it is basically is
there to make your life easier you can
manage all your resources under one
group right so we are creating a new
instance let's create a new resource
group for it let's call it ad rake a
demo and we'll click on OK alright so
next screen they will ask me the
configuration that I want for my server
so let's choose the least configuration
and click on select all right so leave
all these settings at blank
don't need to touch them just click on
okay and then you will get this page pay
then you will have to we will have to
review everything and click on purchase
so this page usually takes time to come
on
okay its game so we just have to agree
to the permissions and click on purchase
and you'll set your server will start
getting deployed on Azure right so while
this is being deployed let's check if
our ec2 server is ready so yes it is in
the green state which means it's now
ready let's try to connect to the server
will click on that server and once you
click on that server you will get the
public IP of that server over here right
so this is the IP you want to connect to
at the same time I caught up M file
remembers this Pam file to connect to my
own two server after I usually connect
it through my put piece off so there's a
software called putty using which you
can connect to your remote servers on
AWS or any cloud provider now these this
produce offer can only accept PP gif
format of key pairs or your private keys
right so first we have to convert a PEM
file into PPK and the way to do that is
using putty generator right so we will
launch the petition software and we will
click on load and then we will go to the
place where you have stored your PEM
file which is here right so let's
convert this file to PP k so for that
you will click on safe private key and
you will name it say human underscore 2
and hit save alright so you have the PPK
ready with you now now all you have to
do is open the putty software now over
here you have to punch in the IP address
so this is the IP address of a server
let's punch in the IP address over here
and to attach your PPK file you have to
cordon to SSH and click on authentic
and then click on browse and then you'll
be prompted with the screen just go to
your PPA file
and you should be fine this is my PPG
file I'll click on open again click on
open and then I'll get this terminal
just click on yes and it will ask you
the login name so by default any server
that you create on AWS if it's an Ubuntu
server the login name for that server
would be open to let us enter that and
hit enter all right so if everything
goes well if it's it authenticates your
key file you'll be able to get into your
server right so you have successfully
connected to your open to server now you
can install any kind of software's on it
you can install the lamp stack or the
Apache web server to host a website and
once you install the software's you just
simply have to go to this IP address and
it will start serving website for you
right so this is the way you connect to
your AWS instance and this is
congratulations on your first server on
AWS alright so let me close the session
let's go to our as your now so as your
instance is also ready let's try to
connect to it alright so this is the IP
address of that instance let's copy the
IP address and paste it in our putty
alright so now in this case guys you
don't have any PEM file or PPA file
because we opted for the password option
all right so let's click on open
straightaway and this should give us the
screen where and we have to give the
login name so it we created a username
at the time of configuration right so
that user name was Eddie Rekha will
enter that and then it will ask us the
password so let's fit in the password
that we chose at the time of configuring
and hit enter and if everything goes
well you can connect to your server so
you are now connected to your own two
server on the azure platform so
congratulations on that as well now this
the these servers were
infrastructure-as-a-service guys right
now remember I told you guys something
about
platform-as-a-service let me show you
how they are different right so on
yes if you talk about
platform-as-a-service the service in AWS
is known as elastic beanstalk right so
it's just an advanced version of ec2 so
basically it's a it's easy to but you
don't have the access to the operating
system all right so let me show you how
you can launch an application in elastic
Beanstalk so basically you will click on
create new application alright and you
will give the application some name so
let's give the name as editor guy - -
and click on next
so then they'll ask you what type of
server do you want you do want to work
on environment or do you want a web
server so let's click on create web
server what kind of platform do you want
so as you can see I'm just clicking
everything I'm not installing I'm not
typing any commands so say I want a PHP
server I'll just select PHP and I'll hit
next now it is asking me for what kind
of application do I want to deploy and
it let it be the sample application and
don't change any of the settings just
click Next and this is the URL that you
will get where your website will be
deployed all right everything is
happening automatically let's click Next
and it makes again and hit next again
don't put anything here because we have
not discussed what these are next and
then the final page will come where you
have to review everything so after
reviewing after you are sure all your
settings are right you can hit launch
and this will launch your elastic
Beanstalk application with PHP installed
on it right so it takes some time to
actually launch it'll take around 2-3
minutes to launch so for the very reason
I have already launched an application
so that I can show you how the elastic
Beanstalk console actually looks like
right so this is my application all
right so I've already deployed I've
already I've done the same settings that
I did in a dirac - - it's a PHP server
alright and once that rolling cause of a
you will get this
green symbol which means your server is
ready all right so this is the console
you don't as you can see I cannot
connect to this instance in any way all
right it shows me that it has PHP
installed on it and it has this OS which
is Amazon Linux and there's an Inc PHP
7.1 this is fine but as you can see
there is no there is no button over here
which will let me connect to the system
all I have is this button missus upload
and deploy if I click on it I'll be
prompted with this screen where I can
choose a file to upload so this is
basically where I will upload my website
and once I choose my website I'll hit
deploy and that my website will
automatically get deployed on elastic
Beanstalk so once it gets deployed once
I get this green symbol I will straight
away go to this link and this will take
me to my website so as you can see this
is the default page as of now and it
says congratulations your AWS elastic
means your PHP application is now
running right so you are not installing
any software you not installing the
Apache
you're not installing PHP everything is
happening automatically so this is what
platform as a services right and if you
were to have the similar kind of service
in Azure
this service is known as app service
image also if you were to search app
service you can get it over here
alright so app services so app services
is similar to your elastic Beanstalk so
in app services in the source called web
app which is used to deploy your website
on AWS but the difference between these
two services from these two cloud riders
is that over here in AWS you can quickly
click on upload and deploy and just
upload your application but in your it
is the other way around you actually
have to do it through kit right so you
should know kit you should have a code
uploaded on kit and from over there it
pulls your website and deploys it on
itself I mean the logic is same you
still are not getting the access to your
operating system but the method of
uploading your apps
different all right so this is the
difference between the two
