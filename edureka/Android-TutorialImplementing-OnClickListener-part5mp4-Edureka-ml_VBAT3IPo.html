clarify your point please okay okay i
guess some problem is there on the other
students side fine we'll go ahead so
this is the example which I was just
explaining the same way so I have I have
to create the same thing for button also
i am creating the ID here simply like r
dot ID dot button now just have to use
the keyword like implements because what
i am doing i want to i want to use the
click listener here so they're gonna
click on the button it should be able to
work can you hear the voice properly can
you acknowledge the same who all can
hear the voice can you please
acknowledge the same okay yep okay good
so this is what i did i am implementing
here onclicklistener because i want to
put a click listener on the button now
when i put a click listener here then
simply I've all I need to do is I am
implementing it so one click listener
when I put the interface use the concept
of interface I have to follow one rule
that is I have to implement all the
unemployment in math so I have to use
like ad and implemented methods now once
you have done that then you have to
register the listener with your button
set on
glessner and you have to this is the
lion how you will register the listener
to your button so that when you click on
the button the particular code will
invoke now on the click of the button
what you want the click of the wedding
you want is first you have to create a
string variable let's create a simple
string variable str in this string
variable we will store the data which we
are getting ok i just got a
clarification from nikita nikita wants
to say that in video examples they
didn't use this implements part meter
nikita there are two ways to do this
either you use a interface directly to
do that or you can rooster anonymous
class to achieve the same for an example
the same for which I have registered
like button thought set on click no sir
I could have done it like this button
dot set onclicklistener and within this
i can use onclicklistener that is
anonymous in a type class I can use the
moment I will use it will come and just
this is the way of doing it you might be
you might have seen this part to
implement it ok so i am using the other
way around both are the ways whichever
is suitable you can do it for yourself
so i will take i will be doing it with
the help of the first part that is using
the implements and then in this string
variable what i am going to do is I will
just simply get the value from the idea
text so when I want to get the value
from the edittext I need to use the ID
text object so I'll use this object I'll
use it this object and then i'll use it
i will try to get the value out of it so
let's say get get text dot to string it
will return me the value whatever is
there inside the edit text when i click
the button ok now what I want is as the
bundle is one of the concept which in
which we will put the gate
in bundle we will put the data then
finally the bundle itself we will put
inside the intent okay so first part is
to put the data inside the bundle now
before doing that we have ready with our
string which has the value from the edit
text now create a bundle objects simply
so let us create a bundle object okay
naked I've got a question what is the
question we have not defined any type
where what type you are talking about
Nikita know is that okay you said that
for edit text first screen you have not
defined a type this is this is a edit
text type instance the object of edit
text which you are using okay yeah cool
so far any questions from anyone
everyone has understood so far
cool let's move ahead and I have this
string variable now i will create a
bundle so Wendell let's say bundle I
have just simply say bundle is equal to
new bundle I prayed the object of the
bundle now what I want is in this bundle
i will put the data which data the
string so i will say bundle object dot
put a string there is a method put a
string which says which takes two
parameters string key and a string value
now i use this method i will put the key
as edit value' edit underscore value is
the key and the data which i am putting
with this key is the str variable which
has the value of the edit text now my to
process is completed first that i have
extracted out the data from the ID text
and second that I have put this data
inside the bundle now what I want is
below to this simply i will put the data
inside my intent so i will create object
for intent now before going to this part
i have to complete other part i have to
be ready with my other activity which I
want to invoke with the help of this
intent so whether my activity is ready
let's see the xml file 0 for that
activity is ready but i have to create
the activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
