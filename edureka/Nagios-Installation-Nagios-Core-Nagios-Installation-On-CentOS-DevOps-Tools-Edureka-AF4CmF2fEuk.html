Rekha today we will learn how to install
nog use which is a continence monitoring
tool on st. OS here are the steps to
install nog use first we need to install
required packages on monitoring server
after that we will install an arduous
code plugins and NR PE n RP is an
arduous remote plugin executors I'll
explain you in detail later on after
that we'll set Nagios password to exit
the web interface and finally we will
install NR p on client so let us proceed
with the first step that is to install
required packages on monitoring server
this is my monitoring server over here I
need to install the packages so for that
I'll open my browser I'll go to this
particular website that I'm highlighting
with my cursor over here there are two
options if you have a 64-bit machine and
then you need to click over here if you
have a 32-bit machine and just click
over i386 as our 32-bit machine so I'll
click over here now over here you need
to scroll down and you need to copy the
link location for this particular
repository that I'm highlighting with my
cursor as I'm using sent to s6 so it is
compatible with Gen 2 is 6 I'm copy the
link location go back to my terminal and
over here I'll use rpm - UV it's command
and I'll just paste the link location
and here we go
now to get the second repository I'll
again go back to my browser and I'll
open this particular website just scroll
down and copy the link location for sent
to s6 just copy it go back to the
terminal again I'll use RPM - uvh c'mon
I'm just paste it it is done now I'll
clear my terminal our first step is
complete that is to install required
packages now we need to install an argue
score plugins and NRP
so let us go ahead with that
over here I'll type yum - why install
Nagios I won't install Lagos so I'll
type Nagios on I want plugins as well so
for Allah type Nagios - plugins - all I
need plug-ins for NRP as well so I'll
type Nagios - plugins - NR PE to install
an RP I'll write n RP and now we need to
install Apache as well as PHP the reason
for doing that is a passive observer is
required to monitor the current web
server status and PHP is used for
processing dynamic content of the site
data so to do that I'll type HTTP D for
Apache and PHP for to install PHP and
here we go
it is done now I'll clear my terminal
and now I need to enable a part a add an
argue service for that I'll type check
config httpd on and check config Nagios
on and here we go
now our next step is to start Apache and
argues for that I'll type service httpd
start service Mario's start and here we
go so we have started an argue assess
well as Apache is over let me clear my
terminal now our next step is to enable
swap memory of at least 2 GB swap is
basically used to free some not as
frequently access information from RAM
and move it to a specific partition on
our hard drive so for that I'll type
here we go and now I will type make swap
/ swap and here we go now we need to
edit FS top file for that I'll use echo
let me show you how to do that I'll type
echo swap swap default let's see FS tab
down here we go now I let it say CTL
confine for that I'll type echo we m dot
equal to 0
let's see CT l dot conf
sis cereal - pee and here we go it is
done now I'll clear my terminal now we
are done with the second step that is to
install an arduous code plugins NN RPE
our next step is to set an argue Espace
word to access web interface so let us
proceed with that to provide password
I'll type HT password - C let's see
Nagios password and I'm going to give a
username that is not used n min and here
we go enter the new password confirm it
it is done now I'll clear my terminal
now what I'll do I'll open my browser
I'm going to type localhost Nagios over
here you can type the host name of your
particular machine
the host name of my machine is localhost
so I've typed that or else you can type
the IP addresses will enter it is asking
for username Nagios admin is my username
and I'm going to type a password and
here we go as you can see the Nagios is
working successfully over here I'll
click on host and it is displaying what
all hosts it is currently monitoring so
as you can see it is monitoring only one
host that is local host if I want nog
use to monitor more machines I need to
install NRP on those remote machines so
I'll show you how to do it we are done
with the third step and our final step
is to install NRP
on client so for that I'll go to my
client virtual image this is my client
virtual image over here I will install
NRP NRP is nog use remote plugin
executors that
allows you to remotely execute Nagios
plugins on other Linux or UNIX machines
this allows you to monitor remote
machine matrix like this cue sage CPU
load etc but before that I need to first
install the required packages like I've
done that in my monitoring server so
I'll just repeat the same steps so I'll
just paste the same command that I've
executed in my monitoring server and
here we go I will clear my terminal and
for the second package also I'll repeat
the same step that I've done in my
monitoring server so I'll just paste the
same command and here we go so we have
installed the required packages now I
need to install Nagios Nagios plugins
and NRP so for that i'll type yum
install Nagios Nagios plugins and NR PE
here we go
it is done now now I will enable NRP
service for that I'll type check config
and our PE on our next step is to edit
NR p dot CFG file for that I use VI
editor VI let's see Nagios and our PE
dot CFG and here we go over here when
you scroll down you need to add the IP
address of your monitoring server in
this section that is allowed host so I
will just do that
save it and quit our next step is to set
up firewall rules to allow connections
between monitoring server and clients so
for that I'll type IP tables - 10 and
our PE and now I'll type IP tables
- I input here we go
now I'll type the third come on that is
IP tables - I and our PE - s and over
here you need to give the IP address of
your monitoring server I'll type one
ninety two dot one six eight dot 56.1
zero one
- J accept and now I'll type IP tables -
a nrt e - s - j
and now finally I need to save these
configurations for that I'll type HC I
net dot d iptables
save and here we go it is done now now
we will start NR PE for that I'll type
service in our PE start so n RP has
started successfully now I will go back
to my monitoring server this is my
monitoring server over here I need to
edit Nagios dot CFG fight for that I've
used VI editor VI HC nagios nog use dot
c FG and here we go over here where we
scroll down we need to uncomment this
vertical line that is CFG underscore dir
equals to HC nog your server just
uncommented and we are good to go now
i'll create a directory called servers
for that i'll type make directory HC
nagios servers and here we go
now let's change my directory to server
for that outside type change directory
let's see Nagios servers and here we go
now I'll edit some configuration in
servers for that I'll type VI editor VI
HC Nagios servers and whatever file name
you want to give I'll just type client
dot CFG so whatever fine name you want
to give you can just proceed with that
and press Enter
as you can see that currently it is
empty so what I need to do is I'll first
open my notepad and I'll copy this go
back to the terminal and I'm going to
paste it here over here I'm just adding
what all services that I want to monitor
so wherever there's client name written
just type the host name of the machine
that you want nog use to monitor in this
case the name is client so just change
it to your host name and you need to
type the IP address as well so this is
the correct IP address that is
192.168.20.10 norse name client
just do it one more time now just save
it and quit similarly you can add more
services that you want to monitor and
same configurations can be used to add n
number of clients now we should set
folder permissions correctly and restart
Nagios so let us go ahead with that
first I'll type - R Nagios dot slash HC
Nagios and now i'm going to restart
Nagios for the RL type service Nagios
restart it is done now
now what I'll do I'll open my browser
and I'll refresh this link once now over
here will click on host and it will
display all the hosts that it is
currently monitoring as you can see that
earlier it was monitoring only localhost
but now it is monitoring one more host
and the name of that horse is client
similarly you can add n number hook n
number of hosts that you want to monitor
and when we
click on services it will display the
status of all the services if you want
in-depth knowledge about the whole
DevOps lifecycle that includes
continuous monitoring as well you can
enroll at WWE you Rica Co slash DevOps
