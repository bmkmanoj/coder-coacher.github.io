we use database yes to make a storage of
data and whenever required we can just
retrieve the data from the database and
use it in our application now moving on
database is a collection of data in an
organized way so that we can update
modify data present in the dot database
easly okay you can update it you can
modify it you can insert rows you can
delete rows in everything can be done in
your database and you can manage your
data very easily data storage in
database is permanent ok that means you
once the dad I stored it will be
remaining there unless and until you
delete it now for example Oracle
database my sequel ms access db2 Sybase
these are all different kinds of
database that are available
moving on how to store data in database
data will store in tables in database in
the form of records ok that is rows one
by one you keep on adding the rows into
the database that are called records
each row is one record in the database
table is a collection of relational data
in 2d form that is in the form of rows
and columns
ok database stored in tables in database
in the form of records tab table is a
collection of relational data in 2d that
is in the form of rows and columns ok so
it is stored in row dimensional rows and
columns each row is actually a record in
the table ok moving on so that means
first you create a database and within
that you create multiple tables so that
you can store your different kinds of
data ok moving on we come to what is
sequel okay that is SQL sequel it is
pronounced as sequel so sequel is
structured query language it is a
language used to access and modify the
data stored in database ok so how do you
insert a value into the database from
your program or how to query the
database that means how to get the
desired result from the database that is
how to retrieve data from the database
how to update a data how to delete a row
all of these things are done using the
SQL queries that is structured query
language it is you it is used statements
to access the database sequel statements
can be divided into two types DD l and d
ml
first of all DDL that is tarah
definition language these statements are
used for creation and deletion of
database like the commands present in
DDL are create alter and drop ok create
is to create a new table or a new
database or alter is used to alter the
contents of a text table ok what is you
the use of drop whenever you want to
drop the entire table whenever you want
to delete the entire table you will be
using this drop come on ok so this is
the DDL data definition language
commands now first the uses of create
the command is used to create table or
database ok so you write create you
write the database keyword then you
write the name of the database like you
want to create a database we need then
you'll be writing create database we
need when you have to create a table
then you'll write create table you will
give the table name and within that you
will give the parameters one will be now
when you are writing column one and
column two so this column one will be
the name of the column first and this
will be the datatype that will be stored
it could be number it could be care or
anything like that okay the data types
that are supported by database now
second column if you want to add third
column just put a comma after this and
then add column three and then the data
type that is what kind of values will
that column store are you clear till
here that is create in create table so
first of all I will show you not the
database that will be used so we'll be
using MS access today so I will just
right click new Microsoft Office access
2007 database so let's name it
tada ok this is the name of our file ok
we'll rename it then DB data okay this
is our database we'll just open it so
now when you open it you will get a
security warning okay just go to options
and select enable this content because
if you want to query the database if you
want to make changes into the database
using query you
to enable this content so never forget
to do it click on OK after that now we
go to create you go to query design ok
don't forget go to create go to query
design just close this one right here
first
now after closing you'll find sequel
click on that you'll get this command
wrong where you'll be entering your
queries ok so I have my queries let's
see likely copy and use them okay so
like create table ok I'm creating a
table into it create table I'll give
table name tab underscore name ok
after that I open up the parentheses
within that first I'll mention the name
of the column one that is call one ok I
give the data type like number for
integer values that means I will put a
comma after that I'll mention called 2
and then I'll mention that in that you
need vodcast ok that means it will take
character values within that I will give
the size that means the size will be 10
it will take characters up to 10 and
finally I put a semicolon okay then
let's execute how to execute click on
run and it will created a table name
that is named table underscore name and
when you click this you'll find column 1
and column 2 okay so what I did are you
clear I just created a file in my D
Drive so the e Drive right-click MS
access project that is new Microsoft
Office access 2007 database okay so I
clicked on that as soon as I click this
is the file that I created I opened it
up when you open there will be a
security warning just enable that
security warning or I'll just close this
database first
okay I've closed this database when I
open it again I receive a security
warning right here can you all see it
click on options I need to enable this
content okay when I click on options
click on enable this content and after
that click on OK when you click on OK
you go back now you can insert update
anything using the queries now when you
have to create a table first go to
create option the tab on the top p8
after going there go to the right and
you'll find query design okay so click
on query design when you click on create
query design you'll find this show table
so click on close first when you close
it after that here on the left hand side
LLL find SQL ok click on SQL you'll come
here you'll see the window where you can
write your query so query for creating
the table is create table ok tab
underscore name - the name of the table
after that or one after that open the
parentheses and close it as well within
that give the names of the columns of
your database ok so I'll name it tab one
which is of number tie tab 2 is off
bracket I okay give the size also
anything like that and 10 and I close it
finally at the end of the query I'll put
semicolon okay so Indiana place the
semicolon now if you want to run the
code just go here on the left side okay
and you'll find a run command click on
that as soon as you click on run here
you okay on the left side you can see
tab underscore name one this one this is
your table that was created so I just
opened this table I'll find tap one and
tap to as the column names I come to
alter command okay this command is used
to rename a table or column name of an
existing table okay whenever you have to
rename a table name you'll be using this
order come on now it can also be used to
modify add or drop a column field
present in a next
string table okay so you can modify the
table using order come on you can add a
table drop or anything now you have seen
how to actually query a database using
your exes okay so this is the query that
is alter table you give the name of the
table after that you click on rename and
then you give the new table name to
rename the table okay similarly all the
table table name rename column whenever
you have to rename the column of a table
you will be using rename column keyword
and then to the new column name now when
you have to add a column name user add
keyword after that when you need to
modify now we come to draw this command
is used to remove an object okay that is
a value we cannot get the table we
cannot get the table of values in it
once the table is dropped okay that
means that evil has been deleted that is
quite easy drop table and then you pearl
mentioned the drop table range now we
were on data manipulation language these
statements are used for managing the
data in database okay the commands
present in Delia oh sorry DML ah that's
a mistake that is insert update delete
and select these are the cool commands
using which you'll be actually managing
the data into your database that is
insert update insert for inserting new
rows update is for updating the values
the latest for deleting a row and select
is for selecting a row or the entire
table okay so let's go see each one of
them one by one so I move forward I come
to insert first of all okay the insert
command is used to enter the records
into the table records are the rows that
are getting added to the table
now insert into table underscore name
you write values values underscore the
name of the column in codes and the
value in codes if it is a string type or
a character you will be mentioning it
within the single quotes if you are
putting a number into the table in that
case you do not have to mention the
codes okay now update this is a command
used to update the values of a record or
column of a table we use condition to
know where the operation is to be done
okay so whenever you have to update it
you'll have to mention where the update
has to be done so you can use the update
c'mon
mentioned the place where the update has
to happen it will go there and update
the values now update table said when
you mention the column name in which the
update has to be done and you pass the
values will write where clause this is
the bearclaw's okay to mention where
exactly the update has to turn so where
some column underscore name is equal to
value of some column okay so you have to
pass the value that is if the value is
equals to this in this column then in
that case you'll have to change the
values okay we are done with update
similarly we will be using a delayed
come on this command is used to delete
three cause one or many from a table by
specifying some condition where to
delete the record so you write delete
from table name we our column name
equals to value that means you mentioned
the column name and that column name
wherever the value matches it will
delete that value okay so in this query
it's ll write delete table name that is
tab underscore name one where column
name is have one have one equals two
one I put a semicolon now let's go to
resign I click on run machine says sir
I'm back was disconnected you didn't it
with problem don't worry machine you'll
receive the recording oh yeah
delete from exactly delete from table
name of your thigh vehicles to one
thanks of it I click on run okay when I
click on done you are about to delete
three rows from this specified table I
click on yes when I come back to my
table I'll find all the three rows
deleted okay so when i refresh it it
goes off but none we delete now what is
select so select command is used to
retrieve the records from the table
select column one column two that means
you can mention the column names from
table okay so only values of those
columns will be
now if you want to retrieve all the D
cards each and every column each and
every data from the table table name so
you have to mention select start from
table name itself and it will fetch the
entire data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
