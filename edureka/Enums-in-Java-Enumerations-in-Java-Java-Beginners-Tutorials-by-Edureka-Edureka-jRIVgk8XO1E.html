everyone present today
my name is vineeth and I'll be the
instructor once again so each and every
one of you I'd like to tell that in
today's class will be going through
enough and I come to announce in Java
enums
is actually an abbreviation for
enumeration okay like there are
constants constants like Sunday til
Monday
in a vague you have got seven days and
everyone knows it so they will always
remain the same like Monday till Sunday
so whenever you have to use these kind
of things in your program what you can
do once first thing is you can insert it
like manually Sunday Monday Tuesday you
can use them like that but there is a
lot of chances in that like you get an
error and it is also not optimized for
that what you can do you can use in um
in Java
other examples could be the names of the
planets okay let's say the roll numbers
are in a class you have the roll numbers
only from one to ten so you can have
four that let's see the example right
here enumeration enumerations helps to
relate the variable with related
constants so that it will be flexible to
work like Sunday Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday to
represent we use nm keyword whenever
you'll be using it whenever you will
defining an enumeration you'll be using
this nm keyword it can be used in a
drop-down boxes now there is a drop-down
there you have to select these names one
one thing what you can do you can use it
by a Sunday Monday Wednesday anything
like that mention it in the drop-down
list or what you can do you can define
enemies and you can pass enemies into
that okay now why we need to use anonym
this is one important question and I'm
is type safe that is any constants
cannot be assigned to that powerful
outside the nm definition if for Monday
yes machine that's the correct
implementation if for Monday you are
assigning that it should be run so like
that you can declare the
you can provide the constant values to
it for to state could be to Wednesday
3:00 Thursday for so outside that what
you can do you cannot assign any more
values to it so it is type safe adding
new constants will be easy with without
sorry it's not with it's without
disturbing already present code whenever
you have to add at once you see the
implementation of her enemy you'll find
that you can easily add any number of
constants to that particular and I'm
without actually disturbing the entire
code so this is one more advantage that
anims provide finally I come to you can
assign different constants to variables
other than default values right let's
see how to declare an enum declaring an
anomaly is quite similar to a class
the way you declare a class similarly
you declare an Ana should be declared
outside the class in which it has to be
used or in an interface okay if it
appeared in an interface or outside a
class in which it has to be used or you
can make entire enum different class
okay now you write enemies you mention
mention the name of Janna like colors
this time you have to make an enum these
are the five default colors that you
have so you wanted to make an enum you
use the keyword enim after that you
mentioned the name of the enemy that is
colors variables which we will be
assigned constant values like red within
the curly braces what you do you
mentioned red green blue white yellow
now all these variables will be assigned
a default value from 0 till 4 these are
default constant values you can also
assign your user-defined values right
here there was the third statement
others you can also sign different
constants to variables other than the
default values ok you'll get to know in
the next slide right now as soon as you
mention the variables within the enemy
they can't the default values like 0 1 2
3 4 like this so all of you are you
clear till here please
right down on the chat window if you are
machine says yes you are already clear
machine or see the says yes the gauge
man says yes okay good now simple
program for an enum enum you mentioned
the Menem name in the brackets what do
you do red green blue white yellow as it
was given you can define it outside your
class you come to the class main within
that way you have got your main methods
now you want to use these this and
answer what you did you mentioned you
made an object right colors underscore
random color array you mentioned an
array because all those values will come
directly to this array right colors
array colors and the score random dot
value so all those values that are
present within the colors nm will get
saved in this array of colors which is
of type colors underscore ennum finally
you run a for each loop lattice for
colors NMC you pass this colors array
and using that you are printing all
those values that are present in annum
so you get red green blue white yellow
okay so all the values are right printed
over here so all of you are you clear
with this please write down on the chat
window if yes I'll implement the same to
a common Eclipse itself file new Java
project
okay receive all the essays that's good
which you have a underscore enum finish
this is our project right click new
allow dhyanam to it and i'm name is
colors so I've got one annum allowed one
more class new class I'll add the main
method to it let's say mean itself and
finish instead of making a different
that for I can also use it right here
now in that I'll define the colors red
yellow green
I guess this much is enough now after
there were a Lou I come here
all right colors equals to I could have
used the even this and even this okay
you can define it anywhere so colors OB
sorry
OB colors dot values now I'll run the
for each loop colors colors anything
colors to it could be anything and you
come with OB right I'll simply print
system dot out dot println in that I'll
pass
colors too
now all of you please tell me if I run
this code what will be the result I
would receive everyone please write down
on the chart for now it's been long that
I have asked you a question like this
for run this code what will be the
result that I would receive my eggs is
green Vasile says red yellow green with
a says red yellow green never says red
yellow green how they say is red yellow
green around this control ctrl f11 I
receive the same result that is red
yellow and green okay so this way we can
use it like or you have to use it
directly like this so what you can do
Oh B dot like system dot out dot println
Oh B dot
okay artist colors dot sorry you can use
the Ricky like this that is colors dot
green colors dot red colors start yellow
and say it will print the values right
so this is one other way if you have to
use it individually and you have to use
it collectively what you can do you can
simply make an array and you can run it
or else if without making an array if
you want to what you can do you can just
cut this part instead of making a
different array pass this okay and
remove this line it will also do the
same thing control f11 and I receive the
same result once again that has red
yellow green so all of you are you clear
with this example the simple example for
anonym</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
