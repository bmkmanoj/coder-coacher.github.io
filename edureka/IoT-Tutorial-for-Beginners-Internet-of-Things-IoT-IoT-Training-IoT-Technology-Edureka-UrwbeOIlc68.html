and welcome to this IOT tutorial session
now IOT our Internet of Things as it's
most popularly known is one of the
greatest phenomena of this century it's
gained a lot of popularity and in
today's session we'll be getting a brief
idea of what IOT is and we'll also be
working on a demo using raspberry pi now
going on to the agenda for this session
we'll start off by first understanding
what is Internet of Things and then
we'll try to address the question why do
we need Internet of Things going on from
there we'll talk about the various
benefits of IOT as well as the various
features of IOT as well and finally
we'll be moving on to the demo of this
session which is basically creating a
weather station using raspberry pi will
mainly be measuring three things we'll
be checking the temperature of the
environment the pressure as well as the
humidity present okay so these are the
three things that we'll be measuring
using raspberry pi and other comprehend
known as censored okay so moving forward
let's talk about the first topic of the
session which is what is Internet of
Things now to help you understand what
isn't enough things let's look at an
example of a mobile phones first okay
our mobile phones has GPS tracking it
also has mobile gyroscope you have
adaptive brightness which gets adjusted
based on the light falling on it you
have voice recognition and you also have
face detection which identifies who is
the user now again iPhone X is coming
with face detection so again these are a
lot of features that are coming
pre-built on the mobile as such and most
of these have a common interaction
between them because let's say one
application can use all of these
features I can also have these features
in itself being interacting with each
other let's say based on a GPS location
my brightness could be adjusted or based
on the direction my phone is being held
the brightness in itself can also be
addressed in as well so there are a lot
of features but when they interact with
each other these features come together
to bring in a better system than
anything that they can provide
individually as such that's what
Internet of Things is it basically is a
platform where we can connect everyday
things which are embedded with either
electronics software or sensors to the
Internet and this in turn enables us to
collect as
well as exchange between these things
now then I say things it can be anything
and everything let's say I have an
internet platform wherein I can connect
these things if I take the example of my
house I can connect my lock I can
connect my AC I can connect my light and
all this can be managed on the same
platform now since I have a platform so
if I can also connect my car to this I
can keep a track of my fuel meter I can
keep a track of my speed limit I can
also keep track of the location of the
car as well now if there is a collector
platform where all of these are
connected wouldn't it be great because I
would love to have the AC on and set a
cool temperature at my home by the time
I reach back from office if I have a
platform that knows my preference and
that keeps track of where I am and where
I am going to then it can also identify
that I'm going from work back to home
and my preference suggest that it would
be best if there was an easy temperature
of about 22 or 23 degrees centigrade and
this is something that is definitely
possible through Internet of Things then
this is just one of the examples now
let's say tomorrow you come back home it
would be great if I wouldn't even need a
key to unlock my door my home system
should be aware that I have come home
and should unlock all the doors that are
needed and now this can be done if my
mobile and my home devices are connected
onto the same platform based on the
location of my mobile it can identify
that I am at my home so will
automatically unlock the door and let me
come in as well these are some of the
real-world implications of Internet of
Things these are something that are
already happening but going forward what
we need to understand is that when I
have a specific component with me which
can do a lot individually wouldn't it be
great if I can collaborate this
component with my system of different
components and build a better system
this is what Internet of Things is
helping us to okay you provide a
platform through which all these things
are connected through the internet so
Internet becomes the medium through
which you are connecting all these
components work things to a platform
okay moving forward let's try to
understand why do we need Internet of
Things now to help you understand why
let's look at an example this
patient at home okay he's on constant
life-support where and his status is
being checked to a health monitoring
system present on the clock let's say at
a point there is certain issue with
respect to his health let's say there's
some irregularity with his heartbeat or
his blood pressure is low there is some
fluid being there lap or sofa now what
happens is since the system on the cloud
is connected to a hospital as well this
information would get passed on to the
hospital as well there and what would
happen is that they would get the
complete details with respect to the
patient and the important information
with respect to the current situation of
the patient as well we made aware with
respect to what tissue exactly is the
patient facing as well as enable them to
dispatch an ambulance immediately to
bring the patient back to the hospital
as well now meanwhile once the patient
has been picked up and brought back to
the hospital
that could be prescriptions there could
be medicine there could also be an
operating theater made ready in case of
an emergency situation as well there'd
be doctors on standby who have the
complete history of the patient who have
the complete details of the present
condition of the patient as well so this
in turn brings in a lot of transparency
and reduces a lot of effort and time
involved with respect to this same thing
gets taken today scenario there has to
be someone monitoring this patient's
health and if there's a fluctuation they
need to call the hospital they need to
call request for an ambulance and
meanwhile once the ambulance is here
they take the patient and they're back
into the hospital then again there needs
to be a lot of checkups that need to be
done because the doctors are not fully
aware again there is a lot of tests that
need to be run and this in turn leads a
lot of delay as well in certain
emergency cases as such now if a system
can do this then this is exactly where
our future lies it and what we have to
definitely move forward to now Internet
of Things basically is expanding the
interdependence of humans to interact
contribute and collaborate with things
around us now what do I mean by
interdependence of humans how we depend
on each other like how I'm explaining
this concept to you if you're not clear
you would reach back to me you would
request me for help okay
this becomes an interdependence between
us when I'm giving you knowledge when
you
now clearly coming back to me and you're
helping similarly tomorrow if there's
something that you can do for me I will
reach out to you so we all are
interdependent on each other for
something or the other if we can expand
this interdependence to interact
collaborate and contribute with respect
to the different things around us then
we would be building a proper Internet
of Things environment this would be a
much more safer secure effortless and
time-saving environment into existence
moving forward let's talk about the
various benefits of Internet of Things
now the first thing that would be as a
benefit of having an Internet of Things
platform would that you could
efficiently utilize the resources that
are available if I have a smart system
which can interact with empty if it has
enough computational power if it has
enough understanding of how things work
between each other I'm quite sure the
usage of the resources away will be more
efficient as per this resource could be
in terms of monetary it could be in
terms of natural resource it could also
be an input taken up by the thing as an
input and so far okay so all this can be
more efficient if I have a platform
which is more smarter and interconnected
as well apart from this it minimizes the
human effort involved if my system is
smart enough to interact it to filter
smart enough to do things that I don't
need to get involved with then my
interaction is always going to be made
this is same with everyone and that's
one of the major reasons why Internet of
Things has become popular today and the
concept of smart home is always growing
as well in the same perspective because
if the system in itself is able to do
most of my work at home then I don't
need to put in much effort I can relax
at home without having to worry about
anything okay the next benefit would be
it saves time if it reduces my human
effort definitely it is going to save my
time
okay apart from that if the resources
are utilized more efficiently then again
it is going to save a lot more time as
well all in all any benefit of Internet
of Things will in turn help you save a
lot of time as well ok so time is one of
the major factor that can be saved on an
Internet of Things platform now
I have an artificial intelligence
platform through which all of this is
managed and maintained then the
personalization and the human touch also
comes into the picture
now today most of us have had a level of
interaction with an artificial
intelligence or a virtual intelligence
as well this could be a personal
assistant like Siri or it could be an
assistance application like Google
assistant now if I have a system where
all these components and things are
interconnected then in turn all the
security present on each of these things
is going to get multiplied and it's
going to build a much more secure system
apart from that the level of security
that you would be integrating to the
platform in itself is going to be quite
cute
so the overall security with respect to
everything is going to increase multiple
times as well now let's look at some of
the major features of Internet of Things
now any technology that is available
today has not reached its
hundred-percent capabilities and it
always has that gap to go Internet of
Things is one of the major technologies
in the world today that can help any
other technology reach its true and
complete potential as well now there are
mainly three aspects to Internet of
Things as to how it works first is the
connect aspect here basically what you
need to work on is you need to ensure
that there's a connectivity between all
the things around you all the necessary
things to the Internet of Things
platform ok then comes analyzed now I
have my things around me they each are
going to generate some amount of data
now this data needs to be collected and
it needs to be analyzed to build a
business intelligence solution if I have
a good insight from the data that is
gathered from all of this then
definitely I can call my system as a
smart system finally what happens is in
order to improvise and improve your
system you need to integrate it with
various models to improve the users
experience as well let's say this a
personalization module that is there or
let's say there's going to be an aspect
where I can directly connect to my
providers now this provider could be
Amazon it could be flip card it could
also be my retail store that is next to
me let's say I'm out of milk 3
we'll get a notification and he would
send milk right away and the same thing
can be done let's say my coffee machine
requires special beans and this business
is almost complete
then what my system could do is it could
go online to Amazon and purchase these
beans for me as well so there are a lot
of things that I can do when I integrate
this with respect to various models and
improve the overall experience to a
single user or a group of users or the
world itself as such okay now let's talk
about each one of them one by one let's
start with connect now the first stage
of Connect is device virtualization
because what you need to first do is
that you need to standardize the
integration of the device to the
enterprise platform which is present on
the clock okay now it could be present
on a cloud it could be present on a
server but again it's all going to be
connected through the internet so what I
need to do is that I need to ensure that
certain level of standard is present on
the device so that it can go on and
connect to my Internet of Things
platform now to help you understand this
better there could be a standard power
plug and there could be a power plug
which has an inbuilt Wi-Fi support so
that it can connect to my lab now to
build a smart home system
I need the second power point because
there only I would have the acces to
control it over the Internet and my
system could integrate with respect to
the same okay now if I take the first
standard power point then what would
happen is that I need to manually switch
it on and switch it off how in the
second case I could send a signal to it
and this in turn will switch it on and
switched off so there is supposed to be
a level of standardization through which
I can integrate all of these devices to
my platform
next comes high-speed messaging so now
what I have done is that I have
connected all these devices to my
platform but these devices in turn
generate a lot of data and this data is
what is going to help us understand
better on how we can improve the overall
system and help and provide the user
with better experience so for that we
need to have high-speed messaging okay
this basically means that there needs to
be a reliable secure and a
bi-directional communication channel
between the devices and the platform
well the purpose of it being
bi-directional is because you need
control each one of them as well let's
say I want to switch on the AC then the
signal would be going on from the cloud
platform to the device so this is how it
works on okay so every communication
needs to be reliable it needs to be
secure and it needs to be by a
directional as well moving on to the
third point of Carnac
you need to have endpoint management if
I don't have an endpoint much I have
established a way through which all my
devices can connect to my platform
I've also ensured that the data is going
to be sent from the device to the cloud
and the cloud can send back to the
device as well through a secure Channel
but if I do not actually identify from
which device which data is coming and
how this data has to be processed then
it becomes a failure of the system this
is where endpoint management comes into
picture endpoint management basically
helps you in managing the devices
endpoint identity the metadata and the
overall lifecycle involved with respect
to these things are such okay so to
Paulo quite simply it basically helps
you identify from which device which
data is coming and what needs to be done
with this data as well now coming on to
the next feature is analyze and the
first thing that you need to do for
analysis is the stream processing now if
the data coming from the device is not
on a real-time basis then my system is
off no use there is no use if I tell my
system to switch on the AC at my home
and by the time I reach there if the AC
is not even turned on then it's a
failure on my sister okay so real-time
analysis of the incoming and outgoing
data and must be done and with respect
to different aggregations it filtering
correlations processing and so forth
okay
now apart from this what you need to do
is that this is raw data that is being
streamed from all the things you need to
identify which is contextually important
information which is going to be taken
forward so once I have the relevant
information then I can even generate
composite streams of information which
can be taken ahead for future analysis
and understanding as well now this is
what your data enrichment process does
then you have events tour now in events
- basically any information that you
want can be queried and visualized from
the vassal amount
dita which is present on my cloud
platform okay now this in turn can also
help me get a better insight analysis if
I have all the enriched data present on
my cloud platform I have a tool which
helps me identify what is needed helps
me analyze this data healthsome utilize
it then definitely it becomes more
useful aspect and when I have data
coming from different things as such
this in turn can also lead to being a
collection of big data now when I talk
about big data it's not just few GB of
data it's going to be terabytes of data
because because the data generated from
the things around us is that was and if
you're doing it over a period of time
then definitely it is going to grow into
a big data domain as well now coming to
the third feature of Internet of Things
comes enterprise connectivity so this is
what I was basically telling you about
let's say I have a requirement from my
retailer or even an enterprise
organization which is present it could
be Amazon it could be flip card anything
as as any enterprise organization which
provides me a service if I can connect
to them through this platform then
definitely my overall process also
becomes easier as well let's say there's
a service provider okay let's say
there's a leakage in my plumbing or
let's say there's some issue with
respect to my electricity then it can
contact to the corresponding service
provider it can send them a detail and
corresponding they would be dispatched
this would in turn reduce my effort of
having to check the problem having to
call someone wait for them to come back
all that gets reduced to minimal
required effort as well now how does
this communication operate so for that
we have REST API okay once I integrated
my REST API with respect to the cloud
application and my Internet of Things
then communication between the
enterprise communication between the
platform and the communication between
the things around us can be made more
efficient and can be more easy as well
the third aspect is command and control
if I don't have command and control on
my platform
then it's off noise yes I build a very
great environment I build something
that's quite extraordinary but if we
cannot command it if I cannot control it
as per my requirement then the system in
itself is not useful
I cannot tell my door in my smart home
to unlock when I want it then it becomes
failure on my part if I cannot control
the AC or my host motto then again it's
a failure so always the major aspects
when you integrate with respect to these
things the major thing is that you need
to ensure this a huge control on the
system and you're able to command it as
for your record and this command could
either be through a voice based
recognition you could also me a message
that you can send through your mobile
application and so forth as well okay so
now let's start with the Raspberry Pi OS
installation I'll help you to understand
how you can actually install Raspberry
Pi operating system once you've bought
the Raspberry Pi ok so we will divide it
into different parts first let me help
you understand the different operating
systems that are available at present ok
Raspberry Pi in itself supports multiple
operating systems as such but will
mainly be working on raspbian ok so
these are some of the most for a pillow
operating systems supported on Raspberry
Pi so you have RISC OS you have FreeBSD
operating system you have net BSD
operating system plan 9 is again from
Bell Labs as well as Windows has its own
Windows 10 IOT version okay so for this
session we're not going to go into the
Windows 10 we stick to the core
raspberry pi operating system now for
downloading the operating system you can
go on to the original site that is
Raspberry Pi dot o-r-g
and there in the downloads tab you can
download the operating system let me
just show it
okay so this is the Raspberry Pi
homepage and here if you go on to the
download section you can download the
operating system now if you are starting
off with raspberry Pi an Internet of
Things trust me this is the best place
that you can find a lot of informations
with respect to it okay most people
actually publish their details with
respect to the projects that they are
working many popular projects are also
available you can find a lot of help as
well as good information here okay so
this is definitely the place to go to if
you go onto the download section here
okay this will either show you two
options you have noobs or you have
raspbian I would recommend that you go
with noobs because this is a complete
package with respect to the different
operating systems as such so here again
you have noobs and loops like so my
recommendation would be you download
nodes and make sure you using a 32 GB
memory card
this would be really helpful because it
gives a lot of memory for your operating
system so in case if you're going for a
16 GB or below I would recommend you go
with the nope slide but make sure you
keep the bare minimum of 16 GB in case
if you are working with Raspberry Pi but
do not mistake me when I say use a 16 GB
memory card you can install it on an 8
GB Esper but again the operating system
has less memory to work with so at least
go for 16 or higher 32 is what I would
recommend so once you download this zip
file or you can even download it by a
torrent ok but I would recommend
download it as a zip file let me show
you the file so this is the noobs file
let me extract this okay it may take
some time it's about a 1.5 GB file ok
the Lites version is slightly lower in
comparison but this is something that I
would recommend in case if you're
working with the Raspberry Pi
so I have my noobs folder here so what
you need to do is that you need to copy
everything inside the noob folders and
then paste it inside the SD card okay
make sure you are not directly copy
pasting the folder that you have extract
so what happens is if you do that it
does not actually recognize the
operating system as part of the
Raspberry Pi so copy everything that
you've extracted and then directly paste
it inside the SD card now again this is
why I recommend that you use a
high-speed memory card because in case
if you are not using it then what
happens is that it takes a lot of time
with respect to fetching the data okay
now as I had mentioned if you're going
for a memory card for your Raspberry Pi
you can use something like a 16gb at
least and make sure it has a high
transfer speed so this in turn will give
you a lot of memory area to work around
with as well as I would recommend you
take something like a class 10 memory
card that is available in the market
today so these have a very good read and
write speed issue so definitely this is
something that you should consider while
you're getting a memory card for your
operating system okay now once you're
done copying with this let's go on to
install this memory card on to our
Raspberry Pi and let's begin the
installation process okay so now we've
successfully copied all that is needed
for our operating system so safely
remove this make sure you're ejecting it
safely because sometimes what happens is
if we do not safely eject it the files
get corrupted before you load it into
your Raspberry Pi this is a certain
issue with respect to the memory card so
just eject this okay so this is my
Raspberry Pi and if you actually flip it
over
this is the slot where you have to
insert the memory card and we've copied
the noobs folder into this memory card
again let me just insert this into this
and let's begin with respect to the
installation process
let's begin installing this memory card
on to my Raspberry Pi and start with the
setup
so let me just turn though on my
Raspberry Pi
okay so this is a screen I'm getting by
default again now what happens is the
installation steps will be initializes
so the raspberry pi is getting loaded
okay now there are two operating systems
that are present here by default and we
want raspbian so let me just select
raspbian and click on install option
present here now if you see here it
basically is telling me that it requires
4.5 GB so this is why I was recommending
you to get at least 16 GB or more
because if I have an 8 GB memory card if
4.5 GB goes off with the operating
system itself then there's not much
memory left for me to work around with
ok now let me just click on install
okay just before I do
case if you are using a different
language or if you want to use a
different keyboard as well you make sure
you're specifying that okay so there are
written languages present here so choose
the corresponding language as per your
requirement okay once you selected that
this click on install and this is just
basically going to ask you whether you
want to format your data and install the
operating system on top of this so click
on yes and the installation process has
begun now it may take some time so I
request you to be a bit patient because
this is an operating system installation
process so please be a bit patient and
hope you have fun meanwhile
okay so now as you can see the operating
system installation has completed
successfully
once you hit on okay it's going to ask
me whether I want to reboot
automatically reboot asthma okay so yeah
it's automatically rebooting at this
point
you
okay now as you can see the Raspberry Pi
operating system has successfully been
installed okay so this is what your
Raspberry Pi operating system would be
looking like okay so this is raspbian as
such so there are different operating
systems that are available today for you
to install that we have discussed
already so let me go back to my slide
and let me just summarize the
installation process again now if you
see here we started by downloading the
noobs folder and then we move Anton to
extract the folder and copy it into the
sdcard
okay make sure the SD card is empty as
well once you're done with this insert
it into the SD card slot and then we
have completed with respect to the
installation process okay now that we've
installed raspbian on Raspberry Pi it's
time we begin with the demo for this
session now what we're trying to do is
that we're trying to build a weather
detection system to get the real-time
weather analysis now when we talk with
real-time analysis it basically is the
pressure temperature and humidity and
what we want to do is that we want to
get a live mobile notification for this
so for that will be first using sensor
board which will help us measure the
various metrics like temperature
humidity and pressure onto our Raspberry
Pi then we use raspberry pi to transfer
this data and display it on the sensor
as well so we will just be displaying
the temperature as of now on the set
side and finally we'll be using insta
push API and python program through
which we can send this notification
across the internet to our mobile
application so let's begin the stem
apart first let me show you what sense
artists and how you can assemble sense
that on Raspberry Pi okay so this is my
raspberry pi unit and this was what I
was referring to this is some sample
okay
now if you see this is a simple
additional board that you can add on top
of your Raspberry Pi okay now it's quite
simple but how it's different is that in
comparison to your Raspberry Pi there is
an 8 cross 8 digital LED display present
here so you can use this for various
different purposes as per your
requirement ok now it simply sits on top
of the Raspberry Pi ok just make sure
the alignment is correct and once you've
done with that just push it on top and
the pins would merge accordingly
once you do that you can just place the
4 screws across the different ends and
tighten it up
you're done with this you can integrate
and use the sin site for various
different purposes
we'll use sensor to measure the
temperature the pressure as well as the
humidity across in this room that is
present okay so this has different
sensors present on it and we'll be using
them for today's demo okay so let me
just put this up and once it's all set
up let's go back to our demo and let's
begin with understanding the programs
before we begin the execution okay so
moving on now that you've understood our
board class very pious and sat and we we
also install raspbian on our Raspberry
Pi let's move forward and start with
respect to today's demo part so again
going back just to remind you we're
trying to create a better control system
where are we trying to measure the
temperature the pressure and the
humidity around the sensor as such okay
so the first thing we're going to do is
that let me just connect to my Raspberry
Pi
okay so this is my Raspberry Pi
interface now let me just show you the
program as well so I've divided the
actual program into three parts so that
it's easier for you to understand how
this program works as such
now the first program that we are going
to execute is the sensing environment so
this is a simple program that's going to
sense the environment variables that is
the temperature pressure and humidity
and then it's going to correspondingly
display these values on the send side
LED display panel now let me explain
this program to you one by one now
firstly we need to import the variables
the values on the sensor so for that
we're going to use this line from sense
underscore hot import sensor so this
will give me the corresponding values
from the sensor to my raspberry pi
interface then I am also importing type
now the main objective of time is to
help me keep a log of all the values
that I'm measuring
okay so that will be seeing little ahead
after that I am going to assign the
sensor values to a variable known as
sense okay so through this variable I'm
going to correspondingly relate to all
the values coming from the sensor okay
moving forward we have written a while
loop and this is an infinite while loop
who is going to continuously measure the
temperature pressure and humidity and
it's going to correspondingly be
displayed on the sensor as well okay so
let me help you understand how the
temperature humidity and pressure are
measured okay so what you need to do to
measure the temperature is used the
function sense dot get underscore
temperature so this function that is get
underscore temperature will give me the
temperature value measured by the sensor
in degree centigrade and here what I am
basically doing is that I am just
converting it into Fahrenheit okay so
the value in degree centigrade into 1.8
plus 32 is just a Fahrenheit
representation of the current
temperature I am using a round function
to round off the corresponding value I
don't need any decimal point values here
I want a whole number so what I am doing
is that I am using a round function and
once I have the temperature then I am
going to be storing it inside a temp
variable okay similarly we are going to
use sense not get humidity and sense dot
get pressure to get both the humidity as
well as pressure and store it in
humidity and pressure variables as such
so basically I have all my three
variables that are needed now what I'll
do is I'll create a string called
message okay into which I'm going to
store the temperature you
and pressure with a specific notation so
T is going to be equal to the
temperature H is going to be equal to
the humidity and P is going to be equal
to the pressure now comes the part where
I have to display this value on to my
Sansad display screen okay so here I'm
going to use the function sense dot show
underscore message so this is basically
a call through which I can send any
message to my sense and display screen
okay now here I am just passing the
message with respect to the temperature
humidity and pressure variable and then
I'm also defining a scroll speed now
this is something that you can play
around with if you want to have a faster
scroll you can modify it I have chosen a
0.08 scroll speed then the other two
factors are the font color and the
background color
okay now the text color I have set as
200 240 and 260 um so this is something
that I have said as per my requirements
you can player on as well as background
color is something that I have set to
zero zero and zero okay so you have the
complete freedom to modify this as per
your interest I would definitely
recommend that you try playing around
with this to get a better feel of how it
works okay now what I am doing is that I
am putting my system to sleep for four
seconds this is basically to introduce a
delay between the measurement carried
out from the sensor now if I don't do
this since it's a continuously running
infinite loop it's going to keep
measuring it one after the other so I
want a simple delay between the
measurement so I'm putting the system to
sleep for four seconds after that what
I'm doing is that I'm opening a file
called weather dot txt now Here I am
going to create the log into this file
I'll take the present time and then pass
the message as well so these both with
respect to the present time as well as
the message are going to be stored in
form of a law okay so in case in future
if I want to refer to the measurement
this is something that will be really
helpful
finally I'm also going to print message
on my console now this is something just
for our understanding asthma we'll be
saying it on different places we'll see
it on the console we'll see it on the
sensor as well as we will be seeing it
inside the log file as well finally I am
closing the log and then I am putting my
system to sleep for five seconds
so these sleep delays are just to ensure
that the consistent values are being
measured in real
well and there is no hindrance with
respect to that okay I hope you guys are
clear about this because I'm going to go
on to execute this program so let me
open my console
okay here let me write the command for
executing a Python program and it's very
simple it's this Python followed by the
filename okay now in our case it's
sensing environment okay so let me
execute this and now if you see the
values are being computed and on the
same side the values are being shown as
well so you can see here the change with
respect to that okay firstly it showed
me all the temperature humidity and
pressure and now it's already come on
the console as well similarly it's going
to have a simple delay and then you can
see already it's showing me the next
values on my sensor and it's going to be
stored in a log file and then it's going
to come on to my console so very
interesting right so definitely you can
play around with respect to the font you
can play around with respect to the
background color as well as if you are
interested you can try bringing
different temperature items near the
sense that to see the variation with
respect to that as well let's say if you
have a glass of hot water and you bring
it near the sensor the temperature value
will correspondingly change as well okay
so this is something that you can really
experiment on and have a good
understanding of how things work on so
let me just close this program and let's
see the log file okay so this is my
weather dot txt file so I have taken
different temperature and measure
variables it's been logged from a long
time that we've been trying this out on
so definitely there are a lot of values
here okay so let me just show you the
latest value so this is a range of
values that I had just tried out some
time back so all the log all the
temperature and pressure log are being
stored here continuously okay and if we
come down this is the latest log that we
have just created with respect to the
three values this is the current status
as such okay so again this is something
that you can experiment on I am just
stored it because of my future reference
as well okay so I hope you guys have got
a simple understanding of how you can
connect to your sense at measure the
temperature pressure and humidity and
also display it on the console as well
as on your sex act
now coming on to the second part second
part is a slightly advanced version of
the same program here we're trying to do
something little more apart from just
seeing it on the screen okay now I want
to send an email with respect to all the
logs that I have or let us say at a
regular interval I want to have an email
which notifies me with respect to the
present temperature and the current
pressure and humidity now this is
something that you can definitely use
while you're working on a social
experiment as such usually in
laboratories it's important that you
always keep a check on the temperature
pressure and humidity so this is
something that you can try out so let me
show you the code alright so here I've
been just including something new as
well apart from our previous code okay
now if you see our previous code is
still present here I'm taking the
temperature I am taking the pressure
humidity storing into a message and then
I'm also printing that message but apart
from that I'm using a few libraries
which are very essential for mailing me
this detail okay so for that I'm going
to use first SMTP library okay because
your mailing protocols are SMTP based
protocols so these are something that I
will be using in case I need to send a
mail with respect to all the details
ourselves so these are standard
protocols through which I will be
communicated okay now coming down with
respect to what a Miami is a Miami
basically is an extension a
multi-purpose internet mail extension
through which I can send emails with
support text characters non text
characters audio video images and so
forth so sending a mail this is an
essential important library as such okay
moving on forward let me explain you the
code now here we're repeating the same
thing we are also importing the time
function and then we are establishing a
communication between the sensor and the
program okay so here first you need to
specify the from address that is from
Coos mail ID you're sending this so I
have created to test mail IDs one is a
Eureka test 11 at gmail.com so from this
address the mail is going to be sent and
the address which is going to be
receiving this is a Eureka raspberry pi
okay so from this email ID I'm going to
send a log with respect to the data that
is measured from my sense that Raspberry
Pi ok 9 I'm going to use my a Miami
multi-part function from here I'm going
to distribute my mail
to multiple parts so this is what your M
IME multi-part function will help you to
that so in my message part the from is
going to be the from address that is
from whom it is going the to is going to
be the to address and the subject I am
defining it as temperature Raspberry Pi
so temper ASP then I am measuring all
the temperature as well as the pressure
and humidity and storing it in inside a
message variable so here what I am doing
is that I am basically going to attach
the message in a plain format to my
message variable which is going to be
the details of the temperature and
pressure okay now let me come down and
help you understand this part of the
cook now I'm going to establish a
connection to my server so I'm going to
use your server variable wherein I'm
establishing an SMTP protocol to Google
okay that is your smtp.gmail.com so this
is a standard mail protocol SMTP for
Gmail it is smtp.gmail.com burr so again
with respect to SMTP this is a standard
port that you would be using for
communication that is 25 okay
then I'm going to start my server so
that is server dot start TLS okay once I
start this then I'm going to specify the
login credentials this is basically for
authentication factor so server dot
login you have to provide the username
and password
so my from address is my username and my
ID eureka api is the password for this
email ID okay once i've specified this
then what I'm doing is that I'm
converting the message as a string okay
sometimes what happens is while you are
trying to send this it may not get sent
as such because it has values also
associated with it so I'm directly
converting it completely to a string
okay and then storing it inside a
variable known as text then I'm calling
the function send built through which I
am specifying from which address it is
going to which address it should go and
the text which is part of it finally I'm
quitting the connection between the
server I hope you understood till here
with respect to the program now it's
time we execute this program
okay so let me call Python email dot py
so now what it has done now it's
connecting to my server that's the delay
here okay it's measured the temperature
it's measured the humidity as well as
measured the pressure and then it's
going to sender me so let me show you
this mail ID as well so as you can see
here I've already received a mail from
a Eureka test lab it's called temp rasp
that we had set and it's given me the
corresponding value of temperature
humidity and pressure so this is what I
was referring for so you can do this
across now let me show you my sent box
as BA okay now if you see near sent box
I can actually see that this meal has
been set so there are two ways for me to
verify this as well so this is something
that is really helpful for me now coming
back to my Raspberry Pi let us now see
the final program in which we're gonna
incorporate this and do a little more so
let me explain you the code a little
more better here there are few things
new here so first you have pi Cole and
Jason being imported now PI call
basically is going to help you establish
a connection between your API so we're
going to use an API through which I'm
going to pass my data so for that I'm
including PI Korea apart from that you
have a string IO which is a standard
string input output management package
and you have your RP i dot GPIO so that
is a raspberry PI's general input/output
I'm just referring to it as GPIO okay so
moving forward whenever you see GPIO it
is the general input output from the
Raspberry Pi and then you have the
similar function you have sense i
underscore heart from sensor and time
function and i am establishing a
connection here as we have done earlier
between my sensor and my application and
i'm clearing the screen on sensor now
what happens is sometimes if you've
executed a program before and you've
stopped the execution of the program
then what happens is the display will
still have the remaining data present on
it it stays stuck on the sensor so
before we move on to with respect to a
program will clear the data out I guess
that's what sense dot cleared us now
here there are two things that are
present here hot and cold okay now why
they are being used I'll come back to
that a little ahead okay apart from that
there's also a new variable known as
push message so we'll be talking about
this also when we come down later and
you'll understand what the push message
is used for now let's try to understand
the code which will help me display
numbers
on my sensor now you might be wondering
if I have already displayed number and
data on my sensor why do I need a
separate part of this core because here
we are trying to do something different
from what we have already done so here
firstly what we are doing is that we are
setting an offset from the left and the
top let me go back to my presentation
here okay now here this is the standard
program that we were talking about but
let's see this is what we need okay so
this is what we're going to explore
ahead now this is my actual sense at
okay this is an eight cross eight LED
display function okay so here what I'm
going to do that I'm going to eliminate
the first column and the first two rows
from the top okay so this distinctively
will give me a six cross 7 matrix area
remaining with me okay this is where I'm
going to do all my operations from now
onwards so this is something interesting
and I'll help you understand why I am
taking this 3G now before we move on
let's take a simple look with respect to
the core present here okay now before I
do that let me try to help you
understand why I have taken a six cross
7 matrix area now this was the remaining
area I have divided this remaining area
into two parts okay I'm just going to
give a gap of one column between these
two and the left-hand side is going to
represent the temperature or that value
in tens place and the right hand side
segment is going to give me the value in
ones place so this basically is a 3
cross through 5 matrix wherein I have 15
positions to play around with remember
this number again this is 15 areas that
I can play around with in a 3 cross 5
matrix now let's go back to our code now
let me help you understand how it works
now I have basically 10 numbers with me
ok so each one is going to have a
specific way of representing in a 3
cross 5 matrix so that's what I have
written here in this number matrix as
such okay so each of the line is a
representation of a corresponding number
in a 3 cross 5 matrix and this 1 and 0
basically is the configuration for the
led to be either turned on or turned off
so normally when we write 0 the first
line will always be full the first three
numbers are 1 okay then you have 1 0
ok again 1 0 1 1 0 1 and my last three
numbers will be again 1 so as in when
you represent 0 in a normal form this is
how you do that so it may not be so
clear to you right now ok
so what I would recommend is before you
try to understand how each of the
numbers are displayed set an offset on
your sensor there try playing around
with respect to different values to
understand how you can represent each of
the numbers once you've made two or
three mistakes then you'll get a
clear-cut understanding of how each of
the numbers can be displayed now if this
is for a 3 cross 5 matrix tomorrow you
want to try it across the 8 cross 8 you
can do that as well
so definitely make sure to try out make
mistakes only then will you learn ok so
each of the line is a representation for
a digit in a 3 cross 5 matrix now let's
try to understand how we can display a
single digit for that I'm going to
define a function called show digit okay
so this is the function it takes a value
as an input okay it takes a value for XD
okay XD is the x-coordinate for where
the digit has to be present yd is again
the y-coordinate as to where that did it
has to be represent and the last is a
simple RGB value present here now first
thing what I'm going to understand is
that I want to compute the offset
position okay why do I need to compute
an offset because each of the numbers
are present in different rows of the
column so I need to understand which is
the present number and which value do I
need so for that what I'll do is the
incoming value into 15 will always put
me at the start of that row
let's say the value is 3 okay so 3 into
15 tells me that I need to move 45
positions so as I said each row has 15
so 15 okay then I have 30 in the next
row okay and once I'm done with the 45th
transfer then I'm here this is the
standard representation for 3 so I have
this complete row at my disposal
presently I am pointing to the start of
3 value ok so this is something
important to remember so this is why we
are computing an offset by multiplying
the value into 50 so I have the complete
access to this row ok now we will try to
execute a 4
through which I place these values into
the different parts of the LED display
okay now see I have three cross 15 area
so I need to identify in which area
should which value come that is which
led should be turned on I have three
rows and five columns so I need to
identify this let's go back now the
first thing that I'm going to do is that
I am going to compute X T okay X T
basically is going to be the value of P
modulo 3 okay
this basically is going to give me value
of zero one or two okay so if you go
back to our presentation it's either
going to start from this 0th position or
it is going to be in the first position
or in the second position okay similarly
in the left-hand side also it could be
this 0th position first position or
second position so basically we are
dividing this that's what you need to
understand okay coming back let me just
remove this okay similarly I'm going to
compute my Y of T Y of T basically is to
help me understand which value should I
take from this complete row so this will
basically start from zero and go all the
way till 14 as such okay so it will
basically represent which column value
should I take okay so I hope you
understand from this which column value
should I keep taking for my next value
once I have this then what I will do is
I am going to call the sense dot set
pixel remember how he had called sense
dot show message so there and we had
sent a complete message now what we're
doing is that which is sent take each of
the pixels individually as such okay so
we're going to use the x coordinate okay
which is going to be my XT plus XD okay
remember this okay
we'll define XD little ad but just keep
this in mind XT plus XT is going to give
me the x coordinate y T plus y D is
going to give me the y coordinate and
then basically my RGB number comes so
here I have just done a multiplication
of P into R so whichever I want I will
just convert it according okay now comes
the choice of when you have to display
two digit number so instead of going
back to the same function I have defined
a new function which is called a show
number now show number is actually the
original function
that will be caught because the
temperature measured is most often a
two-digit number so this is where the
actual code was going to start from okay
true number takes four values it takes a
variable called Val which is the present
temperature I have my RGB value as well
as I am going to begin the function here
firstly I'll begin by taking the
absolute value of the given input okay
when I say absolute value I am basically
trying to identify the number present in
the tens place okay so this is what
absolute value will be whatever the
digit is present in the tens place I'm
going to store it in my ABS underscore
value so that I'm just providing it here
to the tens place then let me also
identify Waterson units place and this
is simple mathematical operation where I
divide the number by ten I'm going to
get a remainder and that's what I want
so I'm going to use a model illusion so
my absolute value divided by ten is
going to give me the unit's place as
well now what I'll do is I'll run an if
condition so here what I'm going to do
if the value is greater than nine then
I'm going to call the show digit
function which I had defined earlier and
I'm going to pass the tense value okay
the value present in the tens place so
and then I will also pass the XD and why
D in this case XD + yd is going to be
the offset left and offset pop-y let me
help you understand here my offset top
is going to be with respect with this
position it's going to start from here
okay so it will point to the third row
okay my offset left will point to the
second column here so I know that this
is where my tens place has to come so
that's why I am passing it here okay I
also I'm going to pass the standard RGB
value that I have got input here then
for a second time I'm going to call the
show digit function wherein I'll pass
the unit place but with an offset of
additional four spaces okay so this
coming back to our segmentation this is
going to be four positions from our left
so offset left is going to give me the
first place but offset left plus four is
going to be the start place where I have
defined for my unit's place when I say
from top it's both going to be the same
because I'm not separating with respect
to different levels so I'm just going to
change with respect to my offset left
okay so that's the only difference
present
now coming down we are computing the
basic temperature the humidity and
pressure and then storing it into a
message string now comes the place where
I need to do my actual implementation
now if you remember our problem
statement we have to send the pressure
temperature and humidity as a
notification on our mobile device okay
so for that I'm going to use insta push
which is an application through which I
can send notifications across my mobile
so my Python application that is the
final application will communicate to
insta push and that will in turn
communicate to my mobile application
that on which I have configured it okay
so the notification will be received on
my mobile application now coming down
let me remind you again why we are using
this in a real-world scenario this is
something that is being used by NASA ok
there they're using it to identify if
the exterior temperature is falling
between a specific range or even let's
say if there's a change in the pressure
inside the cabin or if the humidity is
too high so all this can be measured and
you can get notified with respect to any
change that you want okay now come back
to our program this is why I have
defined a range of cold and hot if it
falls below 37 degrees I want a
notification if it goes beyond 40 I want
a notification so this is my range by
value it should either be only 38 or 39
okay
so this is why I'm using cold and hot
variables now let me help you understand
how the insta push application is
working for that let me open my browser
and show you how you can configure in
stop push for your raspberry pi
application okay so this my insta push
homepage okay now first thing what you
need to do is that you need to begin by
creating a user ID credential here and
it is very important when you logging
into your application you use the same
credentials so make sure you do not
reuse this because it's very important
only if you use the same credential will
you get this notification so remember
that so you have an option to sign up
for free as well
okay all you need to do is provide your
username provide your email address and
then specify a password now
we just log it okay so I'm just logged
in okay now here you can see there's
already a time line because I've already
configured this application let me help
you understand how you can do this now
in my application I already have a temp
notifying application okay which we'll
be using as part of our understanding
okay firstly let me click on add
application now once I do this I need to
specify a name so let me just call it
sample once I click on sample once I
press our application sample gets
created now it is asking me to add event
here so click on add event so let me
call this temp rasp
okay and then tracker would be message
make sure you put a tab here after you
specify whatever it is that you are
specifying and here push message will be
message so make sure it's present inside
curly braces whatever you're specifying
once this is done just click on add
event and this event is going to get
added
okay so the event has been added now
it's time I help you understand why I
had specified message there so Roma let
me go back to my code remember we had
defined something known as push message
so this is why I have defined message
here so this is what is going to be sent
between my final program application and
my insta push application so this is why
we had defined this way ad bill earlier
as well okay now coming down with
respect to this let me go back to my
insta push and let me help you
understand what all do you need before
you move ahead okay just go to the basic
info tab and here there are two things
that you need okay first you need your
application ID and then you need the
application secret so this is very
similar to how you have a user ID and
password so this is what you're going to
use in case you're working with an
application okay so make sure you note
this application ID and the
corresponding application password now
if you come back to my program you can
already see I have mentioned the
application ID as well as the
application secret and here the push
event is to my temp notify so this was
the previous event that was already set
so I'll be referring to that as well now
what you need to do is that you need to
use curl to post whatever data that you
have to the insta push API so for that
you're going to use Pikul dot curl
function okay and this in turn will help
you communicate between your application
and insta push okay so all the
communication is going to be through a
variable called C now C dot setup okay
here what I am going to specify is that
I'm going to specify the URL first okay
the URL is going to be HTTP colon slash
slash API dot insta push dot I am slash
version 1 slash post okay this also
another alternative URL which is HTTP
colon slash slash API dot insta push dot
I am slash post itself now in case the
other is not working you can use this or
vice versa
okay moving forward I need to set up the
customer headers basically for my
authentication and content type
specification okay so for that you're
going to use the command C dot set top
followed by C dot HTTP header
I'm going to specify X - install push -
API ID + my app ID which I have
specified earlier so this will help me
identify to which up this has to be
pushed okay the next is going to be X -
install push - app see so basically the
app secret your your password in this
case okay
then comes the content type that is what
type of content I equal to pass so this
is going to be application dot J's so
I'm basically going to pass adjacent
file to my API okay so I hope you guys
are clear till here okay now what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to define
the function through which the message
is going to be passed okay so here what
I'm going to do first is that I'm going
to use a dictionary structure for
passing the data as Jason in my post
function so Jason - field is going to
create a dictionary and in through that
I'm going to send this data okay now
what I have to do is that I have to
specify the field values so first comes
to the event okay which is basically
what event I need to relate to then
comes my tracker
now I have not specified any tracker as
such then comes my message wearin I'm
going to pass the push message push
message basically is the temperature the
pressure and the humidity as such now if
you want you can print this but I'm not
going to print it here finally I'm going
to use Jason dot dump to make adjacent
file I'm going to assign it to post
fields variable okay so post field is
the variable which I am going to pass to
my API okay next to send your Jason file
with post use the following command
C dot set top okay inside which you're
going to specify C dot post field and
you're going to pass this post field
which is the Jason file as such then if
you wish to capture the response then
you can capture it inside a buffer so
for that I am also going to use a buffer
not write operation and this can be done
with the following command C dot set top
inside which I'm going to write C dot
write function and buffer right that is
the right back has to be into my buffer
okay now if you want to be updated
whether the post has been sent then you
can use the following command that is C
dot set top followed by C of C
so this will make sure that I am getting
posted on my terminal with respect to
the communication finally comes our
operation of checking the temperature
this is very similar to what we have
done earlier where we are running an
infinite loop I'm measuring my
temperature in degree centigrade I'm
measuring my humidity measuring my
pressure storing this value inside of
message variable and then putting it to
sleep simultaneously I am also writing
into a log file and this is going to be
stored with respect to the present time
okay so till here I hope you guys are
clear now comes the part where I have
identified my temperature I am just
making sure it's an integer and then I'm
going to call my show number function
remember we had defined a function based
on which it is going to be displayed on
my raspberry pi so this is a call to
that function okay once I have done
through this I am going to store it into
temp 1 then I'll make sure that I am
writing it into my file and then comes
the interesting part if my present
temperature is either greater than or
equal to the hot message or if it is
lesser than or equal to a cold
temperature that we have defined
remember the two variables we had
defined earlier this is where they are
being used okay the push message will
start with either if it's hot or if it's
code following that would be the present
values okay the pressure the temperature
and the humidity okay then what I'm
doing is that I'm going to pass this
push message to my P function that I
have just defined so basically you will
first convert the push message into
adjacent data and then it will pass it
through the communication so this is
what is happening here okay same thing
will happen in case it is the
temperature falls below the cold range
as well okay then I'm going to create a
JSON file and then call C dot perform so
this basically will initiate the curl
operation to start finally to capture
the response from the server you can
actually use the buffer rage okay so
with this we've come to a conclusion let
me just show you the final part of this
okay so make sure that you're closing
the communication through curl so you
see dot close okay this will ensure that
the communication done through curl is
closed as well as you ensure that the
general purpose input output is cleaned
up so that new values are being
so now let's execute the final program
that's Python
find a program dot people
now as you see on the Raspberry Pi it's
showing me that it's presently 35
degrees centigrade okay
started getting notifications on my
phone let me just share this phone
screen with you okay and you can see
there's a variation with respect to the
temperature shown on the Raspberry Pi as
well okay let me show you first my phone
screen now if you see here it's actually
showing me multiple notifications being
generated okay it's showing me that it's
cooled presently and here's the complete
list of the temperature notifications so
I'm getting a constant notification with
respect to the change in temperature so
you can see it's continuously being
generated here as well so this is
something that is really helpful when
you're working on R with respect to a
real-time scenario so like I said NASA
extensively uses this for their own
purposes of measuring the temperature
pressure both in their scientific
research area as well as the shuttles
and space stations that they use okay so
with this we come to a conclusion of our
demo session okay let me go back to my
presentation and let's just have a
summary of what we've discussed as far
as a session okay so let's just
summarize what we've discussed as part
of the session we started off by first
understanding what is IOT then we moved
on to understand why we need IOT as well
as the various benefits and features of
IOT and then we started with the demo
where we installed raspbian on raspberry
pi and finally we created a weather
detection system in using raspbian and
sensor so with this let's end this
session meanwhile if you do have any
questions as well as if you have any
feedbacks feel free to pull it up in the
chat box so with this thank you and
