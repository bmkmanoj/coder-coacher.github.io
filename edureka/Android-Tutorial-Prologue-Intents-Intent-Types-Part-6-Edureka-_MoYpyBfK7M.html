the course now I have another important
component or the building block of
Android which I called intents so an
intent what one can think of intense as
verb and objects suppose I have an
activity a and I want to call activity B
but there is no kind of communication
between activity a and activity B how
will I do it I know it with the help of
intents in tanks actually help you in
establish establishing and communication
between two activities it need not
necessarily be two activities only
suppose if I want to open a web page I
might be calling a web browser here so
this is how I use intents
so if I talk about an intent and intent
it exactly what it describes it is an
intention to do an action it could the
action could be view photo call someone
a play some music so this is how intense
work an intense intent is say a message
to say that you want something to happen
depending on the intent the application
or the OS might be is listening to it
and interact they they'll react
accordingly so if I say I have to start
activity B from activity a I will be
firing an intent from activity B which
tells it that it should start the
activity V from a it should say that it
has to start at the VB so this is how
intense work here I have an example of
an intent wherein I'm having a tea and
you can edit a page on the Facebook and
I am seeing various photographs here as
you can see when I click on any
particular photograph here I want this
photograph to open up in an expanded
view as you can see here so what I'm
doing is upon click I'm actually hitting
a view photo intent which will open up
this photograph for me in an expanded
mode as you can see here there are two
different activities what is the photo
gallery activity and one is the photo
you activity
so this is how intense work any person
has in having any doubts with respect to
intense they can write on the chat
window then I'll move forward with the
other the other topic
so is this clear to everyone please be
quick with your responses because then
only I will be starting with the new
topic
all right so indents are cleared to
everyone I have a poll question coming
up for all of you you can see this
question on your screen now
and tents are used for the options are
starting one activity from another doing
some tasks in the background or
providing access to the system database
alright I think majority of the people
have ordered it correctly it is for
starting one activity from another I'll
close this poll now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
