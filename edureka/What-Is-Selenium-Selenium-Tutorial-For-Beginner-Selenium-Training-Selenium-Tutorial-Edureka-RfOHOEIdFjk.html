name is Vardhan and I'm super excited to
be here on a Drakkar life with you guys
so today's session is going to be about
selenium
right I'm going to give you an
introduction to what selenium is all
about how relevant it is in today's were
in today's market as an automation
testing tool what are its benefits why
it's actually the best automation
testing tool and I'll also clear a few
of the doubts that a lot of people come
and ask me a lot of people ask me should
selenium why should they choose
automation testing as a courier why can
they do it if they are not from a
programming background so these are the
questions that are asked and these are
the questions which I'll also answer in
today's session okay
so before I get started I want to show
you the agenda for today and that is
this first I'll start off by talking
about what is the need for selenium
automation testing tool right I'll talk
about what was the basic reason what are
the problems with manual testing and
then I'll talk about what my selenium is
I'll go into more details about the
different suit of tools are there in
selenium I'll give you more details I
will talk about what is the job
opportunity with a cilium currently and
then like I told you I will talk about
the actual people who can go for
selenium can everyone go for it what
background they need for selenium and
those related questions and offer me I
will end up and today's session with a
small demo right it'll be a basic demo
of how selenium webdriver works so let
me get started and the whole concept of
why selenium is needed and what is a
need for automation testing I'm going to
talk about that part with this slide ok
the problem statement I'm gonna present
this problem statement let's consider
that there is a web-based application
for booking cabs okay and if you have
developed this Web this is this
application then you need to make sure
that all the applications in that
application work perfectly right so
let's say that you know we have a rubber
or an Ola which is very popular and what
would it have it would have
your Maps integration right a Google
Maps integration it would of course have
a payment gateway which is bug free then
it can have probably your profile
profile settings tab so where you can go
and set your name you can set your you
know link your bank details your set
your default address a lot more details
like this can be you know set over there
you can do that and besides that there
are a few more options which you can do
and this is just a this just web
application where you can book cabs okay
but but then look at any of the other
dynamic web application that we have
today
so take for example facebook.com which
is an e-commerce site sorry Facebook
which is a social media platform and
then we have Amazon which is or you know
which is an e-commerce site now in these
places you have all these products which
need to be you know which keep moving on
a day to day basis right they come under
the FMCG category and they keep changing
and when we say changing it means that
they get updated very often and during
this process of being updated it might
happen sometimes that the links are
broken or some functionalities stopped
working so at that time we cannot offer
to our customers to have a bad
experience so you have to make sure that
they are tested end to end right so that
is the reason for testing first of all
but testing in general is not that easy
okay
and when I say testing I'm talking about
manual testing over here where let's say
there's a quatre here called Alice okay
and she's a tester she is testing the
application and she's finding it to be
very hard and very tedious why because
there are multiple components there
might be a tab bitches or displaying
some some image then you might have some
part of the web page where there's a
video which can be played and then you
might have links over there you might
have some text you have all these things
and what happens is these applications
which are not dynamic they also get
updated very often especially with the
onset of this DevOps lifecycle where you
know these applications they have
multiple releases so the features are
always incremented right so at that
point of time you might have
and the need to test your application
probably every week or run scripts even
every day so at that time you cannot
have manual testers doing that job for
you because the biggest problem is its
its stuff okay it's going to be tedious
and most of all the company has to bed a
lot of cost for manpower and to
eliminate this problem is what
automation testing does right what
automation testing does is you can
simply execute these scripts of whatever
you want to test and you can either
execute those scripts in one machine or
you can scale it up and execute those
tests and multiple machines perrolli you
can do that and even the very fact of
generating the the result of those tests
can be automated so the moment a test
case fails you can automate that to come
to you and you'll be notified that
failed and you will get an of which part
of your code field and you will get to
know which you know which part of the
code to fix and you also get these
reports or to automate it and send your
email or in any other way as per your
preference so automation testing is the
future and well let's not say future
because it's already being implemented
in most of the places this is something
you people might know right but the
question here is why am I talking about
a selenium why is today's session about
selenium and not about the other testing
tools well to start off selenium is an
open-source tool which can be used for
automating these web browser tests right
and being open source it has one
advantage which most of the other tools
in the market today they don't have and
let's say 90% of the tools today are not
open source at least the most popular
ones
take for example testcomplete or qtp or
rft and ranorex all these all these
tools are paid so you need to have a
license to use these tools that's the
biggest problem that companies are
facing well at least medium to small
size companies the MNC is they can
probably afford licensed versions of
software and these are
- okay but not startups and not these
medium-sized companies where you know
where the business is pretty new and
they cannot afford to spend on a lot of
things so for them selenium is the
number one option but is that the only
reason definitely not there are other
factors also especially the future said
that you can see here the programming
language is that selenium supports
compared to other tools the web browsers
that the cilium scripts can be run on
and of course the operating systems on
which the tests can be performed let's
let me start with let me start by
talking about the programming languages
first of all cilium scripts can be
written in any of the languages of Java
or Python or Perl PHP Ruby or c-sharp
and well the well the thing is because
it supports so many web so many
languages a lot of developers or a lot
of programmers from all these domains
can contribute and they can start off
and make a career in selenium this
cannot be said for some of the other
tools
take for example QT p QT b for working
on q DP you need to have VB script
skills right so how common is that look
at the herbs if you want to implement C
as a company if you want to first well
implement QT p you got to pay for the
license and then you have to hire people
who are skilled in VB script so you are
very short of options right and even
other tools like rft they cannot dip I
think our FD needs c-sharp skills and
probably one more one more language but
yeah that's a problem right the company
needs to pay for the license and then
get people who are skilled in that but a
selenium just beats all of them because
it has a wide pool of people who can
contribute to testing and besides that
it's open source so companies don't need
to pay for implementing selenium in
their company another advantage with
selenium is that it you know it's a
butch cross-browser testing whatever
tests that you want to run you can run
them either on Chrome or on Firefox or
on Safari or Internet Explorer and they
can also be you know run on either
Windows or Linux or Mac so I think these
three are the operating systems which
I'm aware of at least
so there's no reason why you cannot or
you might not want to implement selenium
compared to other tools and rightly so
it's actually the most popular tool in
the market and even the come even the
people who are draw you know interested
in learning selenium they that number is
also skyrocketing and to prove that fact
you can see this slide right this trend
that you see or it's I've picked this up
from a very popular job portal called IT
jobs watch and you can the link is right
here you can look this up and find out
is this true you don't need to take my
word for it I just pick this up today
and this is what I got to see if you see
over the years especially from 2008
that's when selenium start picking up
and this is where it's reached that's
almost three times more right it's it's
risen by three threefold in the last
couple of years same thing with the
salad trend over here right so these are
things which you know which would know
at least I can hope that you can take my
word over here if you don't then you can
probably just Google up this place and
find out how relevant selenium jobs are
and how friending the selenium job
postings are right but yeah anyways
enough talk about selenium let's talk
about so here let me let me talk about
the different suit of tools that we have
in selenium okay because selenium is not
just one there are three different
flavors your there is webdriver
there is RC and there is IDE as you can
see over here on the screen but there's
one tool called selenium grid which I am
NOT discussing because that is not that
sort of complete testing tool that is
something that is going to be used along
with webdriver for deploying tests on
other hosts so let's talk about only
these three tools over here and let's
compare them according to the feature
set so right now webdriver is the most
popular and most used and that's because
it has a programming interface where you
can you can script your own logic
whatever rod whatever website you want
to go to whatever elements are you want
to locate over there and perform tests
on that can be done with ease so that
was the same case with even selenium RC
okay
not with IDE so first thing is that
selenium RC is an outdated version so
right now in today's were today's market
we don't have RC anymore
it's depreciated and it's taken out by
webdriver that's the more recent one and
that there's a big history why RC was
deprecated and that was because it was
following something called as the same
origin policy which it had to satisfy
and according to the same origin policy
UV cannot perform tests on on webpages
which are all websites which are not
from your own domain
so for tester had to perform tests on
any page then the JavaScript he has to
inject in that page it has to be in the
same domain right so that is one major
drawback and because of that selenium RC
was implementing a selenium RC server to
do this and because of this reason it
was very slow it was very hard and very
tough on the system's performance wise
so the eventual version of selenium was
webdriver which which implemented a
different way here we don't have a
separate server which is doing the
deployment for us it's injecting the
code with the help of a virtual server
right so that's the benefit with
webdriver and speaking of selenium IDE
it's not a programming tool it's
basically a record and playback tool
okay so it's like it's a Firefox plug-in
which can be installed and with the
click of a button
whatever perform whatever tests that you
perform on the browser that would be
recorded and that can be played back at
any point of time and when we say
playback that playback is with respect
to the testing you can test it and when
you play it back whatever actions you
performed those who those be mimicked
and those actions would be performed on
the web on the browser again and because
of this you know a lot of programming
effort would reduce but then it's not
the solution to testing because a lot of
complicated logic cannot be done like
scrolling up scrolling down that's a
little tough and for dynamic web
applications especially the ones like
Facebook or Amazon or other sites it's
it's not possible to use ID
because it cannot locate the element in
the right amount of time and if it
cannot locate the element then it would
simply throw an error so that's why IDE
also has a very small market it was well
designed for a different purpose
altogether though but what you need to
worry about is webdriver webdriver is
what that's the main tool that's being
used today and let's concentrate on that
so test case creation I again let's poke
about you decide the programming logic
with ideally of course you play back the
test and the browsers that is supported
by webdriver is for web browsers that is
of Chrome Firefox Safari and Internet
Explorer opera is also supported by
webdriver and when it comes to Aussie
right now we does not support these
browsers because right now it's
deprecated so I've not put any of those
logos here but back in the time it could
support across all the testing right and
then in terms of in case of IDE
it supports only Firefox so you cannot
have a chrome plugin for IDE and perform
tests you can you can export that test
and execute that info in probably some
other browser
you can record the whole test in Firefox
and then export that test and then load
it into either Eclipse or any other ID
programming ID if you want and execute
it on some other browser like Chrome or
Internet Explorer but you cannot design
it in other browsers other than Firefox
that's the problem with IDE and
performance wise the driver is fast RC
is slow for the reason I told you
earlier because of the same origin
policy and the IDE is also fast right
away you can record your test and you
can execute them right away so that's
the comparison of the different tools in
selenium right they are called the
cilium suite of tools so these are the
three that you see here and a grid these
are for together form the selenium suite
of tools and then now coming to this
part of selenium bed a lot of people ask
the question can they learn selenium
well no matter what the background of
the art from well the answer is you need
to have basic programming knowledge okay
you have to have some knowledge because
at the end of the day you're gonna be
scripting and you're gonna be doing a
lot of programming right so you're going
to be using either Java or Python mostly
and for that without programming
knowledge you cannot be a tester but
there again having said that it's not
too difficult to get into this domain
because learning jar you need a limited
knowledge of Java to learn or selenium
and implement the codes and it's gonna
be a little bit of effort to learn and
once you're done with that you can
become good you can become a tester
right
and once that question is answered they
ask how can I change my profession will
be right if I jump to automation testing
because right now I'm a manual tester or
rather mainframe professional or am
support engineer or all these kind of
questions come up well the answer again
is yes you all can as long as you are
ready to learn of learn a little bit of
programming concepts there's something
that's needed but when you are done with
that it's well and good right even fresh
shows for that matter of fact
can get into the IT world through the
testing or domain so fresher looking
straight out of college they can you
know that's B that's basically the entry
point into the IT world for a lot of
people right who are from a
non-technical background so these are
the most important questions and these
are the things that I want to tell you
about selenium so now that I've told you
this let's straightaway execute let me
show you a demonstration of one simple
selenium code okay and for that I need
to switch over to my Eclipse so please
acknowledge if you can see my Eclipse
IDE over here okay so I suppose the
screen is visible so this is my Eclipse
IDE where I have scripted Maya when I've
scripted my code this is a selenium code
and on a high level let me tell you what
this code is going to do first I am
going to navigate to Amazon daughter and
then I'm going to wait for a couple of
minutes and then I'm gonna use the
search box to type in Nike shoes
okay I'm gonna search for some of the
results and then I'm going to fetch the
page title of that particular webpage
all right and then I'm navigating to
facebook.com and I'm gonna try to login
to Facebook or come through selenium and
I'm feeding my email id and then I'm
feeding my password okay and then I'm
gonna click on the login button and now
finally when I'm done with that I'll
just end my browser this is what is
gonna happen on a high level now let me
explain each and every part of this code
before we even start by you're
navigating to Amazon daughter we have to
first set our browser driver because
with selenium webdriver for each and
every browser that you want to perform
your tests on you have a different
browser driver okay so for selenium 4
for Chrome we have something called as
the chrome driver for Firefox we have
something called as the gecko driver and
I see anything for Internet Explorer and
for the other tools for Lex first of all
for Safari ok so I want to perform my
tests on Chrome's who have used chrome
driver of instance created an object of
chrome driver
and I've said that chromedriver the dot
exe file is present over here so this is
the file that is going to be used for
carrying out my my selenium test and
have user system but a set property
function to say where that's present
okay it's been in this folder and then
I'm just printing a simple command which
says hi welcome to Enriquez youtube live
session okay and then moving on the next
part of the code is all about navigating
to Amazon Turin
so I can have any website or any webpage
over here and the function after used to
now to reach that webpage is driver dot
gate okay so driver is what I'm
instantiating over here
and I'm saying get this particular URL
okay and I've just I've just used an
implicit wait function over here Rob
basically to ask to tell my web driver
to wait for some time before the page
completely loads because sometimes
because of internet you know internet
being slow your test case would fail so
it's important that you also give some
kind of timeout before some action is
performed so that's what I've done here
our views the driver dot manage dot
timeouts commands for that purpose that
I've said implicitly wait for five
seconds and this would be executed only
in case my webpage is taking time to be
loaded if it's loaded then this would
this command would not be executed and
my execution would continue with the
next command okay and in the next part
what I'm doing is I'm first for locating
the search bar in Amazon and the search
bar I'm use locating it with the help of
this function by dot ID so in selenium
webdriver we have eight different
element located techniques okay
now since search bar is an element the
ID that it has is this one a later on
I'll show you how to how to fetch the ID
of any element okay but just keep in
mind that you use the element located
technique to locate the element and then
you send whatever keys you want if you
want to type in something there you can
send it you can just type it over here
and that would be sent okay now since
our
once I have a scent Nike shoes after do
the click operation right that's what
i'm doing here i'm doing a driver what
find element function i'm implementing
this and I'm using the XPath I'm using
the expert located technique to find
that element so XPath is another popular
there's another popular element locator
technique and it's probably the most
stable one so in the industry this is
the most preferred one because this is
something that's not going to change
okay
it has the absolute path of where the
element is present in the red page so
that's why XPath is the preferred one if
you want to learn more than I can of
course we have a cilium code so over
there I will go to details about this
but over here is going to talk about
this in brief and what I'm doing to that
particular element which is located is
the click operation so have used the
click function for that and I get when
that button is clicked I'm using a
driver dot manage dot tie modes function
to again tell my browser driver to wait
for 10 seconds before it continuous
execution if you don't want to use this
you can also use an alternative that is
thread dots lead so thread not sleep is
not a very effective way to avoid
movement of weight in your raw selenium
you know selenium webdriver but the
thing is it does the job for you it's
gonna basically ask my execution of the
code to pause for 5,000 milliseconds
okay so that's why there's 5,000 or
4,000 milliseconds is basically 5
seconds so I'll wait for 5 seconds and
it will continue with the execution and
the next command that I've executed is
that of driver dot navigate dot back so
what this would do is it would go back
to the previous page because at this
point of time I have timed Nike shoes
and have clicked and gone to a new web
page ok so from there I am going back to
Amazon Gordon with the help of the
driver dot navigate function and then
I'm just fetching the page title and I'm
storing that inside my variable title
and then I'm basically printing whatever
title I saw retrieved am using the
system dot out dot println function to
display that title ok
and then comes the driver dot navigate
to facebook.com so this is the same
function that I implemented over here
I'm saying this go to facebook.com and
Here I am first of all locating three
elements okay those three elements are
those of email ID password field and the
login button okay and those three
elements locating with the help of name
field so name is another locator
technique it's one of the eight
techniques so the name and case of the
email field is email itself and in case
of the password field it's again pass
okay and for the login button I am using
the dot ID function and this is the this
is the ID of the log in bottom okay and
in case of my email id and password
fields I'm sending this am sending ABC
either a gmail.com and then I'm sailing
and then I'm sending the password as
abc123 now this of course this is going
to fail okay but that's my whole point
I don't want login to Facebook um I'm
just going to show you how that process
happens and then of course the login
button once it's located I'm using a
click function to click on the login
button and again I'm have implemented a
weed a function and then I'm saying
Dravid quit so the driver would quit
would end my browser instance so this is
how selenium testing happens in general
and this is a very basic code but there
are a lot of other things that you can
do if you have a if you basically if you
have a web application right then you
would have thousands of test cases this
is just one test case because an
extensive web application would have a
lot of functionalities and there are a
lot of frameworks also which is used to
optimize testing on those web pages and
those frameworks are those of data
driven testing keyword-driven testing
there is a hybrid driven testing and
then there is one popular design pattern
called the page object model so these
are other topics which you can learn
there you can go back to the selenium
playlist to see to go through these
videos so these were videos which I
recorded a couple of a couple of months
back
so you can go through them if you want
to learn
something more detail about selenium and
this session of course I'm not going to
cover that so I can just quickly run
this program and show you how the demo
works okay so this is the run option
over here in Eclipse IDE so when you
click on that a new instance of Chrome
will open so that happens here have
navigated to arms around or I'll have a
look at the search bar right so what
types like he shows so these are all
things which I'm not doing manually
right so selenium is doing that for me
I've written the script okay so it's the
weight operation which is delaying the
execution so that's what we wanted
then after navigate to facebook.com and
then there goes my email area and then
password and then grab acquits so that's
how simply a silicon script works and
let me just pull this up and show you
that my test case has passed so demo
test is the name of my test the you can
see it you can see my name here with the
name of my method okay it says it was
the only test that was run and that's
past zero failures zero skips and along
with that it also printed two lines for
me I initially said welcome to a two
recalls YouTube live session that I had
got printed and then it also fetched the
page title so the page title at that
point of you know Amazon's web page was
online shopping and a shop online for
mobiles ebooks watches shoes and more
right so this was the page title so
these are things which I have retrieved
with help of the briber and I've
displayed over here so this is our basic
Concilium script runs and this pretty
much brings an end to my session right
so let me just open up my slide and
conclude today's session so guys these
were the topics that we discussed we
spoke about the need for automated
testing I spoke about what a selenium I
said who can learn selenium and then I
gave you a demonstration of how Vegas
a basic sinem script so guys if there
are any doubts you can ask me there's a
team that was there that was answering
all the questions for me and now I can
also take up a few of those questions
all right
okay so joy is asking which is more
common core Java or JavaScript joy its
Java which is used okay it's cool Java
JavaScript is what is basically injected
into the browser for performing the
functions or the operations okay okay a
Virendra has another question he's
asking will selenium support web service
testing I do not know what exactly you
mean by web service testing very intra I
am aware of web browser testing and
that's what I showed you earlier if you
can give me more details about web
service then I can probably help you
and joy also had another question
earlier he said which is the best which
to launch lynnium whether it's Java or C
sharp well joy the thing is Java is the
most it's the most used language okay
c-sharp not really I would say if you
wanna if you're gonna learn a
programming language then you can either
learn Java or Python so python is also a
very popular language as you may know
and it also supports you know it also
has a good market for selenium testing
so one of these two is what I would
suggest okay so I think that's pretty
much all the questions right okay so I
have one more question here Prima's
asking can you explain on selenium
framework which should be used
preme so first the get start with
selenium okay so start learning selenium
and then eventually when you learn it
you will also be thought a few of those
frameworks popular frameworks which you
have to know are those of data driven
testing in short it's called DDD and
then there is something well as the page
object model so these are two techniques
which will optimize selenium testing and
these would only help you if you have a
huge testing you know testing space with
you okay but if you have a massive web
application and if you have thousands of
test cases then at that time these
frameworks would help you in running the
test quiz click quickly and for you it
would help in maintaining the code it
would help readability and all those
aspects
okay so I think that's pretty much all
the relevant questions that I can answer
and I think I've done justice to this
session I think I'll end my session over
here guys
on that note but before I end do let me
tell you that we have something called
as sorry so let me just open it up for
you yeah so we have something called as
this survey form right so I would
request you to fill up this survey form
so that you can avail a free you know I
would say free you will get a discount
on any of the aid Rika course that you
know that you plan to buy any aid Rika
