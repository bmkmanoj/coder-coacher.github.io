today in this session we'll be talking
about cloud security without making any
further ado let's move on to today's
agenda to understand what all will be
covered in today's session so we'll
start off this session by discussing the
why and what of cloud security after
that we'll be seeing how we can choose
between a public a private and a hybrid
cloud after that we'll see whether cloud
security is really a concern among
companies who are planning to make a
move on the cloud so once you have
established a cloud security is really
important we'll see how secure should
you make your application after that
we'll be looking into the process of
troubleshooting a threat in the cloud
after that we'll be implementing that
process in AWS so guys this is our
agenda for today
are we clear with it okay I am getting
confirmations so Dinesh Shivani Jason
the bake has given me a confirmation
ok guys since most of you were clear
let's move on to the first topic of
today's session that why cloud security
is important so let's take an example
Erin talked of three very popular
companies LinkedIn Sony and iCloud so
LinkedIn in 2012 experienced a cyber
attack where in 6.5 million usernames
and passwords were made public by the
hackers after that Sony experienced the
most aggressive cyber attack in history
wherein they're highly confidential
files like their financials their
upcoming movie projects were made public
by the hackers right and this made a
huge impact on the business front of
Sony iCloud which is a service from
Apple also experienced a cyber attack
wherein personal or private photos of
users were made public by the hackers
right so guys now in all these three
companies you can see there's a breach
in security which needs to be addressed
right so cloud security has to be
addressed it needs to be there in the
cloud computing world so since now we've
established that cloud security is
really important let's move on to
understand what cloud security actually
is so what is cloud security so it is a
use of latest technologies and
techniques and programming to secure
your application which is
on the cloud or the data which is hosted
on the cloud and the infrastructure
which is associated with the cloud
computing right and the other part of
this is that whatever security
techniques or whatever techniques or
technology that you're using to secure
your application should be updated as
frequently as possible because every day
new threats are coming up right every
day there are new workaround to problems
right and you should be able to tackle
these problems or these workarounds and
hence you should upgrade your security
as frequently as possible right moving
ahead let's understand how we can choose
between a public a private and a hybrid
cloud so we have understood that what
cloud security actually is now let's
talk in terms of security and understand
how we can choose between a public a
private and a hybrid cloud so if you
were to choose between these three
infrastructures what should be our basis
of judging which cloud we should choose
right so you would hope for a private
cloud when you have highly confidential
files there you want to store on the
cloud platform right now there are two
stories or there are two ways of
thinking a private infrastructure you
can either offer private servers or
private infrastructure on your own
premises or you can look up for servers
dedicated servers by your crown provider
right so that all comes under the
private infrastructure then we have the
public cloud infrastructure in public
cloud infrastructure you would basically
use website set up public facing so say
if you have a products page where you
have application which can be downloaded
by the public so that can be hosted on
the public cloud because there is
nothing that has to be secret over there
right so things like websites things
like data that is not confidential and
you don't mind public seeing it can be
hosted on your public cloud the third
infrastructure is the most important
infrastructure which is the hybrid
infrastructure and this is the setup
that most companies go for right so what
if there's a use case wherein you have
private files of highly confidential
files and a website as well right so if
you have this kind of use case you my
go for hybrid infrastructure which is
kind of best of both worlds
you get the security or the comfort of
the private infrastructure and the
cost-effectiveness of the public cloud
is well right so you your hybrid cloud
is basically if you want your highly
confidential be stored on your own
premises and your website being posted
on your public cloud this infrastructure
would be hybrid cloud infrastructure so
basically you will choose the private
cloud if you have a highly confidential
files if you choose a public cloud if
you have files that are not that
important or files that you don't mind
people seeing and you would choose a
hybrid cloud infrastructure if you want
best of both worlds right so this
addresses how we can choose between a
public private and hybrid cloud moving
on let's understand whether cloud
security is really a concern so we will
discussed that why cloud security is
important we have discussed what is
cloud security right now let's talk
about whether this really makes sense
right so if we say that cloud security
is really important and there is no one
who is actually thinking about it there
is no point right so let's see if
companies were making a move to the
cloud actually think about cloud
security so here is a Gardner research
on companies who are making a plan to
move the cloud or who has not moved to
the cloud yet right so what are their
concerns why are not their doing so so
the topmost reason listed by these
companies was security and privacy
concerns right so as you can see these
companies who want to make a move to the
cloud are also worried about this
security on the cloud infrastructure and
this makes it clear that cloud security
is actually very important right now
we've understood that cloud security is
very important we have understood that
companies are looking for cloud security
are actually following the practices for
cloud security but now how secure should
you make your application right what are
the extent to which you should make an
application secure so let us start with
this line so it is said that cloud
security is a mixture
of art and science right why let's see
that so it's a science because obviously
you have to come up with new
technologies and new techniques to
protect your data to protect your
application right so it's a science
because you have to be prepared with the
technical part but it is art as well
why because you should create your
techniques or you should create your
technologies in such a way that your
user experience is not hindered let me
give you a guys an example suppose you
make an application right and for making
it secure you think okay after every
three or four minutes I'll ask the user
for a password right from a security
point of view it seems okay but from the
users point of view it is actually
hindering his user experience right so
you should have that artist in you that
you should understand when to stop or
till where should we extend your
security techniques and also you should
be creative as to what security
techniques can be implemented so that
the user experience is not in there for
example there is a two-step
authentication you get that when you're
logging into your gmail account right so
if you know your password that is not
enough you should have an OTP as well to
log into your Gmail account right so
this might be hindering with user
experience to some extent but it is
making your application secure as well
right so you should have a balance
between your signs and the art path that
you are applying on cloud security
moving on let's now discuss the process
of troubleshooting a threat in the cloud
so let's take an example here so like
you're using Facebook right and you get
a random message from some person saying
there is some kind of story
like you usually get that really while
you're using Facebook right that such
and such thing happened and click here
to know more right you get that similar
kind of message here and by mistake you
actually click on that link you didn't
know that it's a spam and you click on
that link now what happens is all the
users that are there or all your friends
on the Facebook chart gets that message
right and they get furious as to why
this kind
of spam messages there in their inbox
right and you get scared now you get
angry as well and you have to bring your
frustration out on Facebook so you
contact Facebook and you get to know
that they already know the problem and
they're already working on it and
they're near to their solution now how
did they come to know that there is this
kind of problem and needs to be sewn
right
so basically cloud security is done in
three stages so the identification
process or the thread identification
process is done in three stages the
first stage is monitoring data so you
have a I'll go rhythms which know what a
normal system behavior is and any
deviation from this normal system
behavior creates an alarm and this alarm
is then monitored by the cloud experts
or the cloud security experts sitting
over there and there's a thread they see
there's a thread they go to the next
step which is gaining visibility right
so you should understand what caused
that problem right and or who caused
that problem precisely so your cloud
security experts look for tools which
give them the ability to look into the
data and find or pinpoint that statement
or pinpoint that event which causes
problem right so that is done using
gaining visibility stage and once we
have established ok so this is the
problem then comes stage 3 which is
managing access so what this basically
will do is it will give you a list of
users in case we are tracking the who it
will give you a list of users who have
access and we will pinpoint the user who
did that right and that user can be
wiped out of the fit system using the
managing access stage right so these are
the stages which are involved in cloud
security now if you want to implement
these stages in AWS how would we do that
let's see that so the first stage was
monitoring data right so if you have an
application in AWS and you are
experiencing this same kind of thing
what will you do for monitoring data so
you have a service in AWS called AWS
cloud watch now what is AWS
watch so basically it's a cloud
monitoring tool so you can monitor your
ec2 and your other
AWS resources on cloud watch how you can
monitor them you can monitor the network
in network out of your resource and you
can also monitor the traffic which is
coming on to your instance right now you
can also create alarms on your cloud
watch so if there's deviation from
normal system behavior like I said so it
will create an alarm for you it will
escalate the event and alert you about
that thing so that you can go on around
and see what that problem actually is
right so this is cloud the monitoring
tool right so this was about AWS cloud
watch let me give you a quick demo of
how the AWS cloud watch - or actually
looks like ok so this is your AWS
dashboard so now for accessing cloud
watch you can go under the management
tools here is cloud watch you will click
on cloud watch
now over here you can monitor anything
right it will go to metrics and you can
see there are three metrics over there
you can monitor your EBS you can monitor
your ec2 you can monitor your s3 right
now suppose I want to monitor my ec2 so
as you can see so I have two instances
running in my ec2 one is called for
batch instance and the other is called a
blue PS instance right now these are all
the metrics which are there so I can
check matrix for my WPS instance for
network in I can check the disk read ops
so let me select the network out metric
and there will be a graph over here so I
can see this graph and as you can see
between 6:00 o'clock and 6:30
I experienced a surge in my traffic
right so basically this is how you
monitor your instance in cloud watch and
you have all these default metrics to
check how your instance is doing and
yard it applies all right
so this is what cloud watches you can
also set alarms here right so if you go
to alarms click on create alarm
I will go to ec2 and you can select your
metric from over here now selectively
discreet by it's aware now once I do
that it will ask me if there is a time
range to which I want to monitor that
instance right okay let's not set any
time range let's click on next so when
you click next you will be prompted with
this page so you can set your alarm name
you can set your alarm description here
and then you can specify that for what
readwrite number you should get this
alarm fall right so you will be setting
that over here after that it will go to
actions so once an alarm is triggered
where should that alarm go who should
that alarm go to right so you can set it
over here now whenever the state is
alarm right what should we do
so when the state is alarm you can send
your notification to your SNS topic now
what is this ination SNS so basically
it's a notification service we'll be
discussing what SNS is in the next
session don't worry if you don't
understand
basically for now what you can
understand is that SNS is a protocol
where a new set if you get a
notification what could do with that
notification on whom to send to that
notification right so if there is a
proper called notify me in SNS so in
notify me I have configured an email
address that is my email address that
whenever a notification comes to the SNS
service or the notify me topic to be
precise
it sends an email to me right with that
message so I'll get a message with this
alarm that such-and-such thing that has
happened in club watch now you do
whatever is required the other thing
that you can do over here is in the same
SNS topic you can also configure a
lambda function to be executed right now
what that lambda function will do so say
suppose I configure the metric to be of
CPU usage right and I say whenever 40
person metric is crossed create an alarm
or like go to an alarm state and it
notifies the SNS notify me topic about
this in the notify me topic I can
configure a lambda function to clear all
the background processes in that easy
remains right so if I do that the CPU
usage will automatically come down right
so this becomes a use case that you want
to launch a lambda function wherever
your CPU is it goes beyond 40 person
right and hence this is the way you will
do it so this is about cloud boss there
is nothing much to it you create alarms
and you monitor metrics right moving
ahead let's move on to the second
process which is gaining visibility so
for gaining visibility basically you
have to track your whatever activity is
happening in your AWS account so this is
service in AWS called cloud trail right
so the cloud roll service is basically a
logging service where in each and every
log - each and every API call is made
now how is it useful let us talk about
the security perspective right so your
hacker got access to your system so you
should know how he got access to your
system so if you have a time frame say
he got access to your system or you
started to face
problem say around four o'clock right so
you can set the time between two o'clock
and whatever the time is right now and
monitor what all has been going around
and hence you can identify the place
where that hacker got access to your
system right now this is the part where
you get to know who that person actually
is or you can isolate the problem or
which caused that so if you take cue
from our Facebook example over here you
can actually pinpoint who is responsible
for those spam messages because you
allow have those logs right you see the
origin of those messages now once you've
done that the next step is managing this
guy out of the system or wiping this guy
out of the system but before that let me
show you guys how cloud trail actually
looks like so let's go back to our EWS
dashboard and go to our cloud trail
service so again another management
tools you have the cloud trail service
you click on the cloud racers and you
will reach this dashboard all right so
here you have the logs so as you can see
you can set the time range here but I'm
not doing that I'm just showing you the
logs so even for logging into my console
it is showing me that I've logged into
my console at this time on this date
right so every event is logged guys
every event that is happening on your
AWS console is being blocked so let's
talk about the s3 bucket so somebody
deleted a bucket and that has again been
locked right so it happened at 7:30 8:00
p.m. on 28th of March 2017 right so any
activity any kind of activity which
happens in AWS would be logged where
okay guys so this was about cloud trails
let's go back to our slide and move
ahead and create session so like I said
so now you've identified who is
responsible for your problem right so
now the next step is managing access
right so now you should be able to throw
that person or remove that person from
the system so most of the times what
happens is like if you take our Facebook
use case
so basically there was a user who
triggered that problem right so the two
things that you have to do is first of
all you have to remove that spam from a
system so you have got to know where it
originated so now you start wiping it
after that you have to debug that user
from doing it again
right so from the source you get to know
who that user is now using managing
access you will actually get access to
do all that alright so if you talk about
AWS this service is called AWS I am so
what AWS I am does is it basically
authenticates that particular service
now you are root user right so you can
do anything but what if you have
employees and obviously all employees
will not have all the rights right now
what if you want to give granular
permissions to your employees now for
like in our example what if one specific
employee is capable to track down this
problem right or track down what has to
be done so you can give that particular
person that writes how using I am right
so I am is used to provide granular
permissions it actually secures your
access to these zero instances by giving
you a private file and also it is free
to use right so let's see how I am is
used so let me go back to my AWS console
ok I said this is my AWS dashboard I'll
go to the security identity and
compliance domain and then click on I am
right now over here I'll click on roles
now I can see all the roles which are
there in my I am right so since I would
have identified which role is creating a
problem so I'll go to that role so for
example I have a problem in say AWS
elastic Beanstalk easy to roll right I
click on this
now once I click I will be getting this
screen so now I can see the permissions
across relationships that exist advisers
and the revoke sessions right
so I go to revoke sessions and I click
on revoke active sessions and hence I'll
be able to wipe out that user from
accessing my AWS resources right so this
is how you use I am guys and now one
more thing that you can do over here is
you go back to your dashboard go to
roles now I get told you guys you can
actually create a role for a person
who'd be able to access restricted
things on your AWS account right so let
me quickly show you how you can do that
so you will click on create new role and
you'll give you a role some name so
let's give it hello over here right
click a next step go to role for
identity provider access right and now
you can select how that user of yours
will be accessing your AWS account right
so allow users from Amazon kognito
Amazon Facebook Google ID alright so
let's select this now let us select
Facebook and let's give it some random
application ID right so anyway is not
going to create this role I'm just
telling you guys how to do it right so
basically you get your application ID by
facebook over there you'll be since you
are using Facebook to authenticate that
guy to your AWS account you'll get an
application ID by going on to graph at
facebook.com/ you can do all of that
over there okay so that is not the
concern you will enter the application
ID and click on next step right so you
get the policy document so whatever you
configured in your text boxes has
actually been created in a JSON file
right so you don't have to edit anything
over here click on next step now you
have to attach a policy now what is the
policy so policy is basically what all
permissions you want to grant that user
right so if you want to grant them the
execution role for lambda you can do
that you can grant them the s3 execution
role right so whatever policy that you
create you can actually create a policy
in here I am right I'm not going much in
details of this because all of this is
covered in your I am
but I'm showing you guys because as I
just told you guys how this can be done
so let me to show you how it can be done
right
so you'll select whatever policy you
want and click on next step and review
it and create that rule this is it guys
right so you can actually select a
policy whatever policy you want that
role to have and hence so policy is
basically a permission that you want
that role to have so if you get the
permission to just review your instances
he'll be only able to review your
instances okay one more thing I want to
make clear is that you don't have to
give your security credentials to that
guy anymore because now you will be
specifying that user K will be able to
connect to Facebook okay so also you
have a part here wherein you can specify
what specific user can access it right
so I can type in my name here
and if I'm being logged in through
Facebook if my username is him and
Sharma only then I'll be able to connect
to my AWS account right now this is ID
right I can also set the locale
parameter right so ID I think is fine
wherein you will be adding the ID of the
guy who whom you want this AWS account
bxs PI right so you all have Facebook
IDs right so you all have to just punch
in your Facebook IDs over here click on
next step and then you will be able to
access this AWS account if I create this
role right now with the policies that I
will be attaching to your role right so
this is how you use I am guys let us go
back to our session ok so these are the
three services guys so you have I am you
have cloud trail and you have cloud
watch using which you can control or you
can actually see what is going on in
your AWS account alright so guys this
brings us to the end of our session
anything that you're not clear off you
can ask me right now ok so after T is
clear so is Jason Shivani is clear spell
the big Matthew okay guys so since most
of you are giving me a go let me wrap up
today's session so thank you for
attending this session guys I hope you
learn something new today I have
attached the assignments in your LMS and
I expect you guys to complete your
assignments in by the next session also
the practicals that we have done today I
want you to try them on your own
I didn't execute them to the fullest
that was because of the shortage of time
but you do that right if you have any
problems you can contact the support
team right there always at your disposal
24/7 alright guys so see you in the next
session thank you for attending today's
session good bye I hope you enjoyed
