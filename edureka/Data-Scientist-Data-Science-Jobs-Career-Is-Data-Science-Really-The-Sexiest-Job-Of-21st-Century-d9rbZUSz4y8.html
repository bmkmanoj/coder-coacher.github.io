classes in Nigeria including data
science and mahute and other things and
I've been working in IBM Research in
California IBM research labs and I'm in
the area of big data and data science
for more than 10 years I have done my
PhD in data mining which is kind of a
close cousin of data science and machine
learning and yep my daily job is
basically to research on new ways of
doing analytics and creating system
support for doing large-scale data
analytics that includes data science
obviously and yeah that's briefly about
me and in today's session we are going
to basically get kind of introduce
ourself to the world of data science
okay and hopefully by end of this hour
I'll try to convince you guys to kind of
venture into this new field of data
science which is probably closely
related to some of the things that you
have been doing in your daily life or it
may be completely new as well okay but
nevertheless I promise you it's going to
be a promising journey for you if and
when you choose to join this new field
okay so without further ado let's begin
the actual session and as I was telling
you will first talk about what exactly
is data science I mean why there's a new
fuss about all this buzzword and then
we'll understand what exactly is it and
what kind of opportunities are there in
the market and we'll also see how
different companies are trying to
leverage this day
science in order to kind of increase
their revenue reach out to their
customers and whatnot right and then
then show some little demo of one
particular application within data
science which is primarily used in many
many organizations currently okay so
with that I hope I'll give a good
introduction to data science but feel
free to ask me any question you know
where to type in your question since its
it's a general webinar I will not be
able to take questions on on-air so you
cannot speak directly to me but you can
type in your question in the questions
window and whenever it is appropriate
I'll answer it okay and you can ask me
anything relevant to data science need
not be exactly what I'm need not be
exactly related to what I'm talking okay
okay so we've been hearing I'm sure
you'd also heard saying that data
scientist is this new magical role and
everybody is doubting that as six years
job in the 21st century okay and let's
see why exactly people have said that
and what's the kind of the truth behind
it and oh by the way at the end of the
session
I will open up for general questions as
well so if you have a completely general
question please hold off until the end
of session and we'll have as much time
as possible for the Q&amp;amp;A okay okay so I
mean yes it's a sexiest job in the 21st
century but also it's becoming a dream
job for many many people
starting from experience professor
from fresh graduates out of universities
right and in fact again some of you have
already know that many universities in
us are already having curriculum
developed our own data science right
just like you you've been hearing about
degrees in computer science mechanical
engineering bioinformatics and so on now
you can get a degree like a full-fledged
economic degree in data science now
think about our lifetimes right how
often did we see a new science or a new
degree being created in our entire our
last 3040 years right probably at least
in my lifetime I remember only biotech
being the new field that was introduced
to the regular curriculum of computer
science and mechanical and blah blah
blah in at least in the space of
engineering and now I'm saying a new
thing which is data science right so
that won't come very often at least that
should kind of corroborate the fact that
it's going to be there for quite a few
years down the road right and many
people I mean if you read any article on
data science you will see that lots of
numbers again you can take them with a
grain of salt as well saying analytics
and data science has multibillion-dollar
industry in the coming years right and
one nice thing about data science is
it's kind of closely related to what
people have been doing in various
different in districts right starting
from data analysts which are a standard
job description in the context of
databases and analyzing data that is
stored in databases right
and it's kind of you can think of that
as an extension and it's also related to
like the core systems engineers systems
programmers who are who have been
developing software in order to
facilitate data analysis that may be
based on databases or not based on
databases right but code system
engineers so it's not only relevant to
the data analyst it's also real own to
the programmers and moreover it's also
relevant to the functional experts right
like in the context of sa b and oracle
ebusiness suit or whatnot there are lots
of functional Deitz
who are very very familiar with the
actual businesses they need not be like
coding Java programs day and night but
they know the business very well so they
can take business decisions they can try
to create a solution for a given
business problem and so on and data
science is relevant to those guys as
well so so that's kind of a nice thing
because whichever domain you are working
in currently chances are it has
connections to the data science and
therefore you have a chance of venturing
into this new field ok and we tell you a
little more about that later on how
these different domains kind of come
together in the space of data science
right and not surprisingly because of
various reasons these companies have
been inundated with lots and lots of
data I don't need to lecture on big data
at all because I'm sure you would have
already been convinced that data is
there right data is the new resource
like water like sunlight data is
considered being a new resource for
businesses right now it's all up to
organisations how exactly to make
something out of that data and that's
where exactly
data science come into play and
you'll see lots of charts like this
saying that basically data scientists
rule as a new job description is growing
in popularity right and this particular
slide tells you that it's kind of the
best one of the best new jobs at least
in America and I'm sure it's across the
world as well okay and another nice
thing obviously ultimately we work even
though we're passionate about work we
need money right of course for surviving
and good news is that data scientists
role has basically bumped up the average
salary in many different these related
domains that I was talking about right
like for example if you take California
a recent study showed that average
salary is about one hundred and five
thousand dollars per year right and the
range is pretty large
like you will see entry level data
scientist positions about 80 K and 85 K
as well ranging up to close to 200 K as
well right so depending on lots of
different things right depending on the
candidates expand experience and the
company that criticality of the troll
based on lots of different things the
range matters but the average salaries
are significantly higher than average
salaries of other related positions like
for example if you are familiar with
data analyst area you can compare
average salary of a data analyst with
data scientists and you can see you will
be able to see the differences then and
this is not just across like a
technology friendly Silicon Valley in
Sonia but it's across the board right at
least in newest which is where the study
was done now even like South Dakota and
North Dakota also there are lots of
positions and the reason being data
science right it's all about science on
the data and data has no domain right
you take retail you take healthcare you
take petrochemicals or oil industry any
domain that you take you can call it
data and in fact they have been
collecting data and therefore analyzing
the data kind of cuts across all the
domains and that's why even states like
North Dakota and South Dakota where oil
for example is the main business right
in North Dakota oil is the main business
and even there you can find positions
because they have data in fact they have
treasures of data right because the data
tells you where to where to drill so
that you can get oil most of the oil
right so since data cuts across all the
industries you will see detai data
scientist positions in various different
industries and therefore across entire
country right so it's kind of pervasive
in that sense now again we can talk more
and more about salaries and types of
growing set of roles and so on but
ultimately what exactly is reticence
right yes I mean we have been hearing so
much about jobs and being the sexiest
job and whatnot but who cares ultimately
what exactly is data science right and I
would like to some some of the entire
data science as this one line data
science is all about extracting
meaningful and action
knowledge from the data okay and similar
definition you will law you will also
see in the context of data mining but
kind of they're all ultimately talking
about the same thing which is extracting
something interesting something
innovative from the data that you have
and this knowledge that you are
extracting should be meaningful
obviously otherwise nobody cares right
and it's actionable actionable meaning
after getting that knowledge you should
be able to act upon it you should be
able to do something from that knowledge
like for example if you take a data
scientist in working in government then
the knowledge that you extract from
these public data sets about energy or
some some other thing maybe government
will be able to take some policies right
maybe depending on the energy usage and
stuff like that maybe they want to
create a new renewable energy plan going
forward in the next five years or ten
years right so so the knowledge that you
extract is kind of affecting the way the
policy is being written right so that's
the actionable item that you get out of
the knowledge that you gain from the
data and similarly let's say a retail
company once you extract knowledge maybe
they can create a new recommendation
strategy from the knowledge that you
kind of glean from the data or a bank
for example maybe should be able to
create a new financial product targeting
a particular class of customers for
example or telco company may be able to
create a new kind of a calling plan
targeting some set of users in their
cellular network right so whatever that
it's
whatever that action is it depends on
the domain it depends on the application
and so on but ultimately it should be
actionable you should be able to take
some action because of that knowledge
otherwise yes it's interesting fact but
ultimately it doesn't help me grow in my
business it doesn't help in government
to create a new policy then doesn't help
right it's just a interesting fad and
people will move on unless it's
actionable so data science is about
extracting meaningful and actionable
knowledge from the data okay and so
that's kind of very very ten thousand
feet high definition of data science now
you may be thinking I mean this is not
new people have been using data for a
long long time right banks even if I
take banks I mean they have data for a
very long time and they have been doing
analytics for a very long time as well
right and that's why we have we have
positions like data analyst for many
years until now so what's new right
inside there's nothing new and that's
why I call it this other line I have it
here data science is new but data
science isn't so what I mean by this
oxymoron is that yes analytics of data
and extracting knowledge from the data
has been there for a very long time
right but it has been there only for
selected companies handful of companies
right like high-end banks or insurance
companies are down some specific
government labs and so on right only
these handful companies were able to
work first of all they had the
capability of collecting the data and
not only collect but they can
they had the capability capability in
the sense of manpower as well as systems
architecture to store and manage the
data as well as they have enough kind of
people with very skilled labor that can
work on their data and extract something
meaningful right for example take google
right it's a classic example so Google
what have they done those two guys
Larry Page and Sergey Brin of course I
created a new search engine but Google
was not the first search engine before
that there were some attempts to create
a search engine as well like Alta Vista
right which is a search engine which was
just based on the content you type in a
word and it simply searches for the word
in a bunch of web pages that they have
crawled and then they show them as a
result okay I mean I'm simplifying it
but it's pretty much like that but then
these two guys have seen who web pages
is not just about the content there's
actually hidden trove of information in
the connectivity that they have within
the web pages the hyperlinks between the
web pages and they said these two guys
they said that oh if all the web pages
are referencing to the to one page let's
say cnn.com if everybody is refering to
CNN tÃ¼rk Ã¼m then
cnn.com should be containing some useful
information compared to other other web
pages that's why everybody is
referencing it so by looking at this
link information along with the content
you can actually create a better search
ranking and that's why that's how they
came up with this PageRank right so
that was the underlying intuition now
from there they created a mathematical
technique or they used existing
mathematical techniques to formulate
that problem and they created this new
ranking scheme called PageRank and that
helped in creating better search results
and from there onwards Google was born
and and we know where it is right now
right again I'm simplifying a lot of
things but the point is they were able
to extract something actionable in terms
of search engine ranking for example
from the data that they have and the
data being the webpages so what Google
has done is exactly data science it's
just that it was not called data science
back then and that's why I said data
science is new but it is inched it's new
because the pervasive nature of data
science in the current day world
previously this kind of massive amounts
of data are the interesting types of
data was being collected only by these
handful companies but now you know that
every little organization every society
in the world is being able to has the
capability of collecting and storing the
data and obviously they want to make use
of it and to grow their business to grow
their organization or whatever is the
need right so because of that
democratization of the data the problem
of analytics and extracting something
new has become much much wider and much
much bigger than what we have seen in a
couple of decades ago right so that's
why the data science is new but the
actual concept of data science is not ok
does that make sense everyone
okay very good so with that so remember
previously I was kind of alluding to the
relationship between multiple different
domains and the slide tries to capture
that interdependence see across multiple
fields of study that data science is
bringing together right like for example
you need the data science is essentially
is a mix of all these five different
things okay like for example it requires
statistics or mathematics you can call
it whatever you want but the idea is the
core fundamental mathematical Technol
techniques that are required to analyze
your data right like for example in in
the Google example that I just told you
there's a fundamental mathematics behind
this page rank which is simply algebra
with matrices right it's called linear
algebra which we all studied in high
school it's just some matrix computation
you have rows you have columns you have
vectors you multiply them you transpose
them blah blah blah and then magically
you get ranking right so the entire page
rank actually you can just describe it
in math in like five or six lines it
lists the main idea of page rank right
so that's the statistics or mathematics
or machine learning all that falls into
that category that bucket this bucket
which is the core fundamental techniques
to analyze the data right but that alone
didn't bring Google to the stage where
it is right now it has accompanied that
core mathematics or core technique is
accompanied by lots of other things like
for example data engineering which is to
say that data engineering is responsible
again the labels can be different
I mean people people call it data
transformations or data pre-processing
and whatnot but the idea behind the data
engineering bullet is that converting
your raw data into a form in which you
can start applying your mathematical
techniques right so this PageRank
algorithm is there let's say I read it
from my textbook it's nice little six
line of equations okay but how can I
apply where should I on what data should
I apply it I cannot apply it directly on
the webpage that I just downloaded from
internet right because that webpage is
very very dirty it has some HTML it has
some XML it has some images it has some
tags and whatnot right it has some
advertisements it has all sorts of
things in it and I cannot apply my my
mathematical equations on that
particular webpage I have to clean it up
I have to transform it I have to massage
it in the form that that I can start
applying my mathematical techniques that
I created right so that's the data
engineering part and people who have
been working in databases and stuff
that's like ETL extract transform and
load if you were familiar with that
right which is essentially converting
raw data into the form in which you can
start applying your techniques so that's
the data engineering without that
however cool your mathematical technique
doesn't help right you don't know where
to apply so data engineering or the ETL
kind of people are related to data
science as well because it's an integral
part of data science but story doesn't
end there you need like again taking
Google as an example initially when they
started in 96 or 98 the internet was
very very small with only May
with thousands of web pages but it has
grown significantly over the time we now
have millions of web pages and there are
billions of edges between the pages
right and previously they were able to
crawl and analyze the entire internet
using couple of machines in their DOM
but those couple of machines cannot
handle millions of web pages that are
available today so along with the data
you need to scale up the underlying
infrastructure as well you need to make
it bigger right so that you you meet the
demands of the growing internet size
right I mean Google does a lot of
different things but just keeping search
or PageRank alone in in the picture you
can already see the need for scalability
the need for being able to handle these
terabytes or petabytes whatever is the
number so much data right so just having
mathematical equations cool mathematical
equations and having very nice
ETL pipeline doesn't help you need to be
able to make them grow bigger on big
data as well as on larger set of
machines and that's where your advanced
computing comes into play again you can
call it distributed computing scalable
computing whatever you call it but the
underlying idea is that you need to be
able to scale right and along with these
three you also need something on the
visualization right especially I mean
there are a lot of times you can analyze
a trend just by looking at a chart right
I mean as people call it a picture worth
a thousand words
so if you just draw
chart it can tell you the trend and lots
of different things than just looking at
a table of numbers right so from the
presentation perspective as well as
analyzing perspective visualization is
kind of the underlying current in data
science now along with that you also
need domain expertise this is where I
was relating to the functional experts
or the people who understand the
business right that's also important
because without that you cannot really
make sense out of the data or you cannot
go through the data or navigate through
the data in a more efficient manner like
for example as a data scientist or you
can join for example your healthcare
company ok let's say I joined anthem or
Kaiser which is a health care provider
and they hire me to analyze their
medical data sets ok maybe I have to
create a new predictive model to assess
people's risk of having diabetes ok a
patient comes in they have their health
records with it maybe their blood prefer
I mean the blood test result glucose
test results and BP and blah blah blah
cholesterol and whatever doctor
recommended them to go through the
testing I got all the results now using
all those results I have to make sense
and predict whether that particular
patient has a risk of diabetes or not ok
very simple problem settings but will I
be able to do that no unless so I know
very good mathematics ok I have I can
create very cool techniques and I have
super experience with creating pipelines
of data transformations and also I
recently learned Hadoop and I can scale
things to allow
data sets as well but still I cannot
deal with that problem because I don't
know what this data is I don't know what
sugar is I don't know what's glucose
level relate to diabetes whether glucose
is related to diabetes or cholesterol is
related to diabetes I don't know only
the domain expert knows only the doctor
knows that Oh in order to analyze
diabetes research from years old in the
medical domain have shown that something
like body mass index glucose
concentration or your work ethic are
your pedigree that means the hereditary
information all that will play a role in
determining whether somebody has a risk
of diabetes or not so the domain expert
will tell the data scientists that oh
these are the factors that are involved
oh by the way the last year recent study
showed that I don't know the stuff that
you eat is linked to the diabetes so try
to incorporate that data as well in your
analytics that's what the domain expert
will tell the data scientist and only
then I will be able to as a data
scientist I will be able to combine all
these different factors that the domain
expert is telling and then make sense
out of it and create a model and then
predict that predict that the patient
has risk of diabetes or not right so so
the point of the slide is basically
saying data science is confluence of all
these three different things only when
you combine all of these you can extract
meaningful and actionable knowledge from
the data now obviously we cannot be
expert in everything
right and historically from my work
experience maybe I'm a ETL guy but then
I know it's related to data science and
I know what other things are involved in
data science so maybe I'll learn little
bit of machine learning algorithms and I
learn a little bit about scaling up into
larger data sets learn how to learn
spark whatever right so that way I can
venture into a little bit of other
things and then I can become a better
bait scientist and similarly if you're a
score statistician or a mathematician or
a data side at a-- analyst by experience
then you know what other areas to
explore in order to make yourself become
a better data scientist and if you are a
core software engineer who can create
nice infrastructure again you know where
what other things to look out for in
order to become a data scientist and
this is what I meant by saying data
scientist is kind of a role for many
people many types of people depending on
what type you are you you have to
venture into other areas and learn
little bit about those things okay I
hope that gave a kind of a comprehensive
view on what exactly it takes to become
a data scientist okay
similarly I mean this is the same thing
in a different way
statistician programmers domain experts
and all those guys and again straight
corollary of that slide is the type of
skills that you require in order to
become successful in the area of data
science starting from business acumen
programming skills data warehousing
skills which are like data engineering
stuff and then business intelligence
starting from analytics and so on and
hopefully over the years as the domain
gets more and more mature and as the
technologies become more and more mature
for data science depending on the major
focus you may have a different role
right a person may be a data scientist
available knowing all of them but maybe
his expertise is in data engineering
maybe some other guy again knows all of
those little details but may be expert
in visualization right depending on the
core expertise maybe there will be a
different type of role in the future but
currently data scientist is about all of
them and that is because the domain is
very very new everybody is figuring out
what exactly the roles should be and
since nobody has a clue data scientist
is supposed to know everything and which
is good and bad it's bad because you
need to make extra effort to learn
little bit of other things as well but
it's good because it's new since its new
the bar is very very very very low so
it's easy to get into the field
obviously right when it's new it's very
easy to get into the domain and
therefore you can grow in the field
itself as opposed to you grow and then
join the field which is what happens
once the field becomes mature
then you have to learn a lot of things
in your training itself and you need to
have lots of project experience only
then you will be able to start applying
for jobs but Paris now since the bar is
low it's very easy for you to jump into
this new career okay and that's why if
you have vague interest in data and if
you are excited about the type of
applications or data science enables
then it's it's the right time to make
that jump now depending on the type of
analytics that you do there are
different stages of analytics like
starting from descriptive analytics
which is descriptive diagnostic
predictive and prescriptive
okay these are all the different type of
analytics data scientists will be
dealing with descriptive analytics is
basically about what happened so far how
do you describe the trend that has been
there for some time so it has already
happened you're just describing it in
terms of statistics in terms of trends
okay and then the diagnostic analyst
takes is to deal with why exactly this
thing happened
why exactly the oil prices are
plummeting right now right why exactly
the asset prices in US has been
increasing now predictive analytics is
obviously as a name suggests it's able
to predict what will be the oil prices
in the next one year next two years next
five years do we reach energy crisis
like 1970 or are we going to go back to
normal
normalcy
right so that's the predictive analytics
and even one step above is prescriptive
analytics how can we make something
happen how can we steal the oil industry
or I mean we cannot Steve the entire oil
industry but how can we make some
changes and then get the result that we
want right and there are already
applications being created in all these
types of analytics right for example I
mean prescriptive analytics I mean these
applications are very very new and may
sound way across the real life but they
are there and in the future they'll
become common commonplace like for
example in last year every year there's
this Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas
right where all the companies will try
to showcase their new gadgets that they
have created all the electronic
companies and startups and so on CES
that's a very very popular that's where
all the new sexy TVs and new mobiles and
new gadgets like Fitbit and stuff like
that they will get introduced for the
first time into the market like there
was last year there was a product which
some company I don't remember the
company name but basically they have
sensors in the spoon with which you eat
food ok and the sensor is gathering the
data of how much food you're eating how
many scoops you are eating and I mean
how many spoons and how fill your spoon
spoons are are they half filled are they
full scoop spoons that you are eating
and the pace at which you are eating
right
so it's collecting all the data about
how you're eating essentially it's
tracking your eating habits ok
now it can just do the collection and
then let you on your computer or tablet
it can show now some nice trends but
that's about descriptive analytics what
has happened how did you eat so far
that's it but they also did something
prescriptive that means if you are
eating very fast then it will light some
indicators or kind of show you some
signals that you should slow down maybe
eating fast will affect your digestion
and maybe affect your health right I
mean I mean that might sound very very I
mean who will use that spoon to eat
every day and monitor your eating habits
at least I won't do it looks as of today
but you can see the type of applications
that will grow right especially with
this new Internet of Things
everything is sensors starting from my
refrigerator TVs and all the gadgets
that I have in the house
everything has sensors and they can all
work together and with that you have
loads and loads of data and they can
change a lot of things based on the
patterns that we observe right that's
kind of the prescription prescriptive
analytics how can we make things happen
according to some goal ok and data
scientists will be dealing with all
these different stages of analytics
depending on the project that they run
ok
and finally applications so we saw what
exactly was data science and what type
of analytics are there and what type
what it takes to become a data scientist
and now finally actually this should
have been in the beginning but since a
lot of people already know about data
science
I kept it at the end which is simply the
type of applications that you see in the
real world and as I was telling it's
cutting across all the domains starting
from retail starting banking insurance
healthcare they any domain that you take
right
like for example insurance if I apply
for a house loan right mortgage how much
should I get as alone and how risky I am
as a borrower to the company to the
lender and depending on that the amount
may vary the interest rates may vary the
loan agreements loan terms may vary lots
of different things vary depending on my
profile right and that's again again
well known application but has lots of
new trends new twists through it right
there more data you can analyze to make
the decision previously they were
analyzing only we let's say my credit
card history and my credit score and so
on but now they have lot more data about
me about my financial profile how I use
my credit cards and where do I use my
credit cards and how many accounts I
have how many investments account higher
all of that information they can put
together and then analyze am i paying my
library dues in in time right all that
information is kind of telling me
telling the bank about my behavior and
that will be useful and how am i
interacting with social media even
that's people are looking at right so
even though it's a classical problem
there are new tips and new twists in
terms of new types of data and new types
of analytics and new types of insights
right so II there are new applications
like the ones I was talking about in
terms of tracking your food habits and
there are old applications with a new
twist right and in terms of well all the
companies that you can think of they
will have problems relating to date
signs and yeah in terms of the roles I
get you got an idea from that slide from
this thing right different types of
roles depending on where the focus or
where your expertise lisen okay but
nevertheless I strongly urge you to
learn from other areas in this picture I
mean of course you cannot get domain
expertise until you work on it but at
least you can look at visualization
statistics or mathematics data
engineering and advanced computing
depending on which bucket you are in try
to explore the other buckets okay now
with that I will so some more
applications like for example here
BMW is using predictive analytics to
find a parking spot in a huge parking
lots it can find you very exact ly is it
and you can directly go and pocket it
right and similarly ecommerce
recommendations any retail company like
Amazon and Walmart and stuff like that
thrive on recommendations in fact that's
the example that I'm going to show you
next
okay and so on many applications in
terms of creating profiles of your
customers to understand their purchasing
behavior or if you are a
telecommunication company you want to
analyze this churn prediction it's a
very very classical application in telco
telecom industry churn prediction is
churn refers to the people who are
leaving your service right and we know
that changing a cellphone carrier is
very very very very easy switching from
Airtel to doe coma or something else
it's very quick just change the SIM card
and you're done and so the chance of
leaving your service is the ease of
leaving your service is very easy and
therefore that these companies try to
predict that churn who is likely to
leave the service and then maybe try to
take care of that business right so the
chant reduction also kind of falls into
interesting application of data science
ok so we can talk lots and lots of
applications in healthcare and other
things as well but let's let me show you
a quick demo of recommendations ok we
know recommendations right how important
they're like if you take companies like
Amazon Flipkart and those kind of
companies their main business is in
recommendations once you buy your
product they will recommend saying that
oh if you like this product you may also
like something else are people who like
know who bought this product also bought
this one so maybe you want to check it
out or some targeted advertising right
if I am buying lots of baby products
maybe they will send me Eric send me a
coupon for trying out a new set of
diapers maybe right
give me a coupon for and a body wash so
that's recommendations in general it it
can encompass us a lot of different
types of recommendations not just retail
even in online streaming video business
I don't know how many of you are
familiar with Netflix company anyone
know I mean in newest probably people
know about it already in India you may
not be familiar
so Netflix is a video streaming company
right I subscribe to their service and I
can watch movies and videos and TV shows
documentaries and stuff like that online
in streaming manner now
recommendations is their bread and
butter if I am watching lots of action
movies then they try to recommend more
action movies to me or if I rate some
movies very very high based on the genre
and the type of movies that they have
that I have rated very high they will
recommend some other movies to me in the
similar context and they will they will
also try to find similar users like me
based on the things that have been doing
on Netflix they can figure out that Oh
me as a user is very similar to some
random guy in China let's say we both
have similar tastes we don't know each
other but Netflix knows that we do have
similar tastes so if if that Chinese guy
let's say he rated a movie very very
high which I haven't seen yet then
Netflix can basically recognize the fact
that we both are similar so since he
liked that movie I may also like it so I
it will recommend that movie to me okay
so there
subtypes of recommendation and let me
show you a few types of recommendations
that we can do and if you are familiar
with Netflix interface on the website
you will be able to relate to exactly
the type of things that I am going to
show you not okay so for this I will
look at the D from this public data set
called movie lengths which is exactly
like Netflix data which is about users
and movies okay so there are a bunch of
users let's take very small data set
just for the demo purposes but there are
larger collections available as well
okay
in this small data set we have about
hundred thousand ratings okay users will
rate movies right right four out of five
or five out of five three out of five
whatever is star rating so there are a
hundred thousand ratings given by
approximately thousand users and on
seventeen hundred movies okay that's my
data and it looks like that actually
let's let me show you the data on the
downloaded version so I am going to use
for this particular demo I'm going to
use Mouse which we will learn in the
data science class you know for a couple
of classes couple of sessions okay
mahute is this machine learning
component in this Hadoop framework okay
Hadoop is this Big Data software or a
framework and it has many components in
it and one particular component is
called as mult and this is geared for
doing machine learning on lost data okay
so let's see the data first
let's see where it is
okay this ml 100 k ml 100 k is the data
set that I just showed you
movie lens small data set hundred K
that's what I if I if you download this
one that's what you get
ml 100 k now it has bunch of files but
we will focus on only couple of files
which is U dot data so your data looks
like this four columns user ID movie ID
and the rating and the timestamp okay so
this means user 196 has rated movie 242
with the rating of three it so and so
times down okay similarly I have so many
ratings total of 100,000 ratings across
multiple users across multiple movies
now this is a data
I've been collecting on my let's say
website like Netflix okay people are
watching movies rating them and then
I've been collecting that data now with
this data how can I build a
recommendation engine now obviously I
have more information about the users
and movies as well like for example you
dot user will give me some information
about the users the user ID the age of
the user 24 years male and his
occupation is technician and he lives in
this particular zip code 85711 postal
code okay some other obviously Netflix
will have much more information about
users but let's say this is my user
information and similarly I have item
information as well you dot item item
means movies here
the products okay
it looks like that oops sorry I have the
movie ID and the movie name the release
date and some IMDB URL and a bunch of
flags indicating the type of movie the
genre right if you look at the readme
file you will see you dot item
information about items or movies okay
what does it have movie ID
movie title released it video release
date URL and the genre whether it is an
action movie or an adventure movie or an
animation movie documentary crime and so
on right so this is some movie
information so we have the movie
information user information and the
ratings now using this data we can now
start by creating recommendation engines
ok so let me show you
I mean without showing you the actual
mechanics of it let me show you what
kind of output you can get by simple few
lines of code ok and this we can do that
from command line as well but I'm going
to show you from java application ok so
this is a code I have written which is
recommend I mean it uses mahute
functionality to create a recommendation
engine ok in as simple as these three
lines of code that's it those three
lines of code creates a recommendation
engine called recommender that's my
engine using the data that I just showed
you ok
now using this recommender you can make
lots of different types of
recommendations which are exactly like
what you will see on
sites like Netflix things okay let me
show you some examples so this program
takes bunch of parameters essentially it
takes these I will give you I will give
it the type of recommendation that I
want and the relevant arguments okay
so first let's let's see one simplest
type of recommendation which is given a
movie ID and a user ID estimate the
rating okay so for example I I mean I
just logged into Netflix and now Netflix
has to figure out whether for example if
it has to recommend the movie Titanic to
me or not okay so for that what we'll do
it will basically estimate the rating
what would be the estimate I would give
to movie Titanic based on my history
okay so there I have the user ID which
is my user ID and I have the movie ID
which is the Titanic and between these
given these two I need to estimate the
rating predict the rating and that's
what we are going to estimate the user
ID 20 and movie ID 1 okay one happened
to be the Titanic movie I think
sorry Toy Story ok so I want to see what
is the estimated rating for the user 20
the movie Toy Story ok so I can just run
it and it is estimated to be 3 rating 3
out of 5 now depending on how you
interpret that the service may like to
recommend it or even even when I click
on Titanic it will show like again if
you have
with Netflix interface you will be able
to relate to this whenever the user
clicks on the movie Titanic it will show
you the estimated rating in terms of
stars and their I will show three okay
so that's one type of recommendation
given a movie given a user estimate the
preference
you
oh sorry it went into mute sorry so let
me repeat what I was just saying so the
first type that I showed you
given a movie and the rating sorry given
a movie and the user you predict the
rating right that's one type of
recommendation now there are other types
of recommendations as well like for
example whenever the user logs in to
your service you want to show some
generic recommendations some top five
movies that you want to recommend to
that particular user
now this is a different type of
recommendation and this is exactly what
you will see on the Netflix website as
well as soon as you log in you will see
top picks for your user right so my name
is Suraj
so it will say top picks for sure Raj as
soon as I log in it will show some
movies now how does that happen the same
recommender object that we created here
the same recommender object can be used
to create a different type of
recommendation as well like here I'm
showing this top five okay given a user
ID 20 give me top five recommendations
okay so when I run it I'll get something
like that top four I recommended movies
for the user 20 or so and so these are
the top five and these are the estimated
ratings right so like 1 6 6 2 is
actually a movie rough magic and
similarly 1 1 9 1 is another movie
letters from death row or something I
don't even know what was that movie is
but it shows you some movies that you
can directly show as soon as the user
locks in
that's a different type of
recommendation okay
and Netflix or any other service gives
you a different another yet another type
of recommendation which is let's say I
go and click on a movie and add it to my
list okay now as soon as I add the movie
to a list it will recommend 10 different
movies related to this movie that I just
added to my list and similarly on Amazon
or Flipkart you can think of the same
thing as soon as I purchase a move a
purchase a product it can recommend some
five different products that are kind of
related to the product that I have just
bought so here so in the first setting
we have both the user and the item in
the context in the second setting we
just have the user in the context given
a user give me a recommendations
now in the third context you just have
the item in the context given this item
tell me all the similar items that are
there so that I can start showing to the
user right so that's a yet another type
of recommendation similar items okay
give me some sim five and that means I
mean this just a code I created Symphony
Skanda gives me five items similar to
this movie number one which is toy story
okay so I'm asking give me the best five
similar movies to Toy Story so that I
can recommend to the guy who just
watched Toy Story okay so I will get
some movie your IDs so let's see what
they are item 50
they are star wars and 121 independence
day and so on so these are the movies
that from the data it saw that they are
related or they are similar to Toy Story
and therefore it made a recommendation
now this should right away kind of raise
a question in your head why Star Wars
and Independence Day is closely related
to Toy Story Toy Story is a children
feel-good movie animated movie where a
Star Wars and Star Wars is a sci-fi
movie Independence Day is full-on action
movie why these movies are related to
Thai story if I'm doing just from my
brain I wouldn't pick those two as the
most similar movies but by analyzing the
data you can figure out that who ever
liked Toy Story they rate it similarly
to Star Wars and Independence Day as
well if somebody hated Toy Story the
same person hated Independence Day as
well and if somebody really loved Thai
story the same guy rated very high for
the Independence Day as well and
therefore it sees the correlation
between the type of ratings that these
two movies have got and therefore it
finds that the rating pattern is same
even though the genre of the movie is
different the rating pattern is same
which you cannot find by just looking at
the data you can only do that by
actually analyzing and figuring out some
model under the hood
and these are only very very simplistic
model I created and there are lots of
sophisticated recommendation engines
that are possible and that's what
companies like Netflix Amazon those kind
of companies use and the similar
techniques you can use them for
advertising as well right recommendation
is also kind of advertising if I have
like 10 different types of coupons to
distribute whom should I give that's
also kind of work can be post as a
recommendation problem okay and in the
class you will be learning about these
building recommendation engines what is
the math what is the code technique
behind it once you know the technique
it's it's a matter of implementing it
like mahute already gives you a way of
implementing it very very easily but
even if some new software comes in
tomorrow once you know the core
technique you can implement right away
right so that's what you will learn in
the class we will look at different
different applications and the
underlying technology or technique that
powers that that kind of analytics and
we will see a great length on predictive
analytics like the diabetes example that
I showed you is actually one of the data
set that we deal in the class it's a
it's a toy dataset but nevertheless you
will be able to create a model which can
predict whether a particular patient has
a risk of diabetes or not given the
health history of that particular
patient and you will be able to you will
learn ways to evaluate whether do you
are doing the right thing or not even
the recommendation engines
I recommended something like these five
movies but is it really a good model
right unless I a certain that this model
is the right thing is the good model I
cannot build my business on something
that I don't even know that works right
so whenever you build a machine learning
model or a data science model you need
to make sure that it performs very well
as well and that's the quality
assessment and we will see that angle as
well so in the class we will basically
see many types of models starting from
clustering classification
recommendations and a couple of others
and again as to each of them will learn
multiple techniques under the hood and
will play with example data sets to see
how we are doing it or how we can apply
these techniques in real world and we
will also learn how to assess these
models how to assess the quality of
these models okay so all these things
you can learn in the class now with that
I will kind of close the session
basically this recap we have looked at
what exactly is data science what type
of components that are involved in data
science
what type of technologies right and what
kind of analytics are there and then
finally we looked at one small
application of recommendations okay now
with that that's all I had to say and I
hope that gave good and quick
introduction on data science and gave
you a sense of what that is and I hope
you got excited by those couple of
little examples now I will open
the floor for questions if you have
anything please let me know and we can
take like 5-10 minutes for question and
answers even though it's already kind of
way over the time limit what can we
expect the course that you have
mentioned oh where can we expect oh
that's the data science class that is
offered by Ed Eureka and I will teach
that class okay and the interface what I
have shown is mahute yes that's the Java
interface of mouth yes
subject that's why I said mahute has
multiple interfaces but I shown you Java
there is also command-line interface as
well so even though you are not a Java
person don't worry
data science does not mandate you to
know Java it's a plus and over the time
you can learn it but it's not a
prerequisite what's what should be the
step one to do enter into the data
science field well you already took step
one attending the webinar step two will
be taking the class and after that you
will be able to see whether you can
really fit in or not and I'm sure
everybody can fit in because of this
confluence of different fields what are
the required languages to know data
scientists profile what are the rhythm
so that's a tricky question because it
as you saw it's a confluence of many
things right and therefore there are
lots of different technologies and
languages involved in it like our Python
Hadoop spark Pig hi blah blah blah right
so there are multiple varieties and
nothing is like a strong prerequisite
right it's good to know
multiple of them but some organizations
might be using Python some other company
might be using R right so there's no one
answer to that question what are the
courses come in data science SAS and our
excel not sure I understood your
question in Satish data science is a
class that Eddie Rekha offers okay if
you want to expand on that question
please do so I think you kind of made a
UDF in Java is Java a needed component I
guess I answered that question now we
can hive guide oh very good you fit in
right there what are the basic language
is to be learnt about Big Data again I
hope that answers the question there are
multiple of them so there is no one
fixed thingy but in the I mean actually
since that's kind of the common question
that I'm seeing in the class we will
learn R and we'll learn Hadoop at least
the machine learning side of Hadoop
which is mahute and other things okay
and we'll also learn how our and Hadoop
can be interacted with each other as
well and we focus on our because it is
gaining a lot of popularity in the
market right now and in the class we'll
see what kind of market trends are there
and stuff like that but with that
capabilities you can go into the market
and apply for positions or take some
data scientist certification
and stuff like that how many hours a day
and how many days course is a good
question we have 10 sessions each
session is of 3 hours so total of 30
hours and it spanned over 5 weekends ok
I learned her do but didn't get a chance
to work in real time can I go ahead with
the data science absolutely without a
question I want to know doing course is
enough to get a job or we get we have to
go to some post graduation in data
science so I know a couple of people who
landed in data scientists jobs right
after the course but I mean don't think
of the end goal right away right I mean
since this is new to all of us
just take the class to understand what
this thing is and at the end of it you
will be able to really assess obviously
you can judge only when you know it
properly right so at the end of the
class you will be able to assess
yourself and your interests and so on
right but again depending on the job
description you may be able to get the
job right away and sometimes you need a
further work as well because I mean in
the class we'll discuss that there are
tons of different techniques and
obviously within 30 hours of lecture we
cannot cover all of that we will cover
only the most popular one in different
different categories and the goal of the
course is to give you the breadth of
techniques so that you get an exposure
of what kind of things are there but
there are lots of other things that to
be learned as well and that you can pick
up after the class
okay could you please explain what type
of roles and responsibilities of data
scientists in project again like as I
said it involves massaging the data
creating mathematical techniques which
are well known so you just need to
understand them and how to apply them
and then visualizing and stuff like that
I don't know if that answers your
question karna Kerr and math knowledge a
math of statistic knowledge is required
to learn data science yes because that's
an integral portion of it and and you
just need to understand some basics of
those techniques okay at least to become
an entry level data scientist you just
need to understand the basics of these
techniques and how to apply those
techniques that's sufficient and only
when you reach a very sophisticated
level that's when you can create your
own methods as well but that requires
lot of expertise and lots of time and
that comes only with time you cannot
right away become a person who can
create a new model on your own right so
at the beginning level you just need to
understand what is there and how to
apply that technique I am from banking
domain with eight years of experience
working in Oracle is this recommend
easiest data science recommended for me
absolutely you have the financial
background or the domain knowledge as
well as data working with data that's a
clear combination already if you are not
from a drug run how will we go with it
again as I mentioned in the beginning
you just need to understand the
technique and how to apply it
you need super high level of mathematics
only when you want to create
your own thing which will come way later
in the time is this online or classroom
well it's it's an online the session
will be like this one the webinar what
is a course fee you can get the indira
you can get the information on Eddie
raker website and they have lots of
deals as well buy one course and get one
course free and stuff like that yes and
Eddie Rica is an Indian company and
therefore you will be paying in Indian
rupees as well not in dollars again
since another common thread of question
is easiest the right thing for me
right so for that I will just leave you
with this slide you figure out which
bucket you are in if you're a data
scientist maybe you are run here if you
are a ETL person you are in here if you
are a core software engineer you may be
here right depending on where you are
it's if you fit in any of these buckets
it's for you
right one person said they have domain
knowledge then you fit in here if you
fit in any of these boxes then data
science is right for you all you need to
do is open up your box and look at the
other boxes come out of through your box
and look at into others at least speak
into others did I answer all the
questions did I miss anything or any
other questions you have
okay very good so this entire webinar
will be made available online as well so
you can watch it later on if you need to
and yeah that's all I have to say about
data science I hope you got a better
perspective than when you started the
class our start of the webinar and I
strongly encourage you to give the
course a try it's only five weeks five
weekends three hours every session it's
not much time and if 30 hours can change
your career path why not why not give it
a try right so just give it a try see if
it if you really find it interesting or
not and I'm sure if you keep your mind
open I'm sure it will be of interest and
not just interest but it will be useful
field in the future in the very very
near future as well
so you can really kind of reap the
benefits out of data science in in near
term
when will it yes the PPT will also be
available so fish and the classes there
are multiple batches again you can get
all those information online when it
starts what are the timings what is the
duration what's the plan of the class
and stuff like that do you teach any
data visualization also actually no in
the class I don't focus on visualization
because that's something you can easily
pick up whereas other things like
mathematical techniques and other things
need some explanation you need to be
able to see the intuition behind the
technique and learn how to apply it and
stuff like
I mean that's not taking anything away
from visualization and the complexity of
it but it's something at least you can
pick up and there are other courses also
for doing that and therefore I it does
not I do not touch upon visualization at
all okay very good
thanks guys thanks everyone for joining
the webinar and I hope many of you will
consider taking the class as well and
hope to see you in the regular sessions
bye everyone now and good luck in your
careers and I hope you give data science
a chance to make your careers more
exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
