that we always have questions and that
is how we come to a decision when we
talk about taking a particular one my
name is Aisha and I'm from in Eureka so
in today's video I will be discussing a
very hot topic that has been bothering
quite a few techniques in genial
statisticians and businesspeople that is
how does one take a proper approach when
it comes to pick up aid a scientist or
in simple terms how to become a de
scientist let me just throw some light
on this topic so as I've said that human
beings have lot of questions so the most
relevant ones as far as data science is
concerned
are these the first one is why should
you go for either science or why should
one become paid a scientist then what is
the exact road map or the journey to
become a de scientist next were the
different tools and techniques required
given the fact we have so many in the
market which ones are the best and how
did they fall in the place and find it
to us then we'll be discussing the
different roles and responsibilities
that one might pursue when he or she has
taken up the part to become a de
scientist so let's start with the very
first question that is why should you go
for either science or why become a de
scientist now data scientist is regarded
as a six is job title of the 21st
century now why well there number of
points first of all I would like to tell
you that according to Harvard Business
Review it is considered as the high
ranking professional with the training
and curiosity to make discoveries in the
world of big data therefore it comes as
no surprise that data scientists are the
professionals in the big data analytics
and the IT industry apart from it this
job is for people who like doing things
that is different every day this job
will never let you get bored now why I
am saying that because there is a
challenge and always new to learn out of
it even the data you studied yesterday
it might change over the next day so
that gives more challenges secondly data
science analytics is not just subjective
to one particular background or a field
professionals from different verticals
are moving to analytics by learning data
science let us talk about all these one
by one
so first is health care now however
imagine from Vedas health care have so
much data coming from so the data
basically comes from the various sources
like EMR with an electronic medical
records then we have labs we have
medical correspondents we have databases
and we have many other things
therefore big data
they designs play a major role in the
healthcare sector then we have traveled
nursery
so here again data science is highly
adopted for more business opportunities
then you have customer satisfaction
let's say if your customer is most
likely to leave a negative feedback so
what you can do you can sweep in and
become the helping hand to make instant
yet less painful changes to their travel
plans therefore with the amount of data
present there is a huge opportunity to
shape the future of travel and help the
travel experience better which will also
result in a good revenue for the
organization as well next is finance the
banks insurance companies investment
companies and other financial bodies
harness large volumes of data from
various sources such as your transaction
retail or you can say the real time
marketing feeds then you have social
media ports an existing database of
customers as well so there's a large
amount of data that is been generated
every day so where we have just touched
a handful of industries and
professionals who can learn Lehrer
science but today any business that
comes to your mind is big database so
the reach is endless moving ahead the
third reason is increasing train and the
salary so it's not just the job openings
and the opportunities but how much it
pays just let us talk about money now so
can you think of a figure of how much a
data scientist you well the average
salary of data scientists in u.s. is
approximately 120 thousand dollars well
you can bet on it by comparing it with
the salaries with any other IT jobs next
let us have a look at the road map so a
first you need to start with the
statistics or you can say the basic
mathematics then you must know any one
programming language after that you
should also be having knowledge of
databases then comes the major role of a
der scientist where one can implement
machine learning and some concepts of
deep learning as well next in this era
of big data you should definitely know
some of the big data tools and
technologies and once the data is here
you must know how you can ingest the
data process the data or you can say
clean the data which also called as data
ingestion and managing so after that it
is very important to present your data
or you can say visualize the data let's
say in the form of bar graph or line
chart so that a layman get easily
understand it and finally one should be
capable enough to make data-driven
decisions to solve any problem so once
you acquire all these skills
congratulations you will be a data side
next let us go into the details of all
these skills one by one so the first is
statistics so status it's basically
deals with the biomedical area it
includes your exploited data analysis
they are data scientists analyze
different characteristics of data for
example mean median range standard
deviation and we have many other things
after you come to know what actual data
reveals you can think of various
possible outcomes in experiment so to
name some of the probability
distributions we have Poisson
distribution we have binomial
distribution and we have many more like
that next you can apply various theorems
and equations to manipulate the data
according to your needs such as nave
based Yoram or you can say linear
transformations then what you can do
with that data you can basically measure
how far a number is spread out from the
average values that is nothing but your
variance calculate by the curve analysis
so these are all the basic which you
need to know or just in general
mathematics that you must be aware of so
a good data scientist must be able to
understand what the data is telling you
and to do that you must have a basic
linear algebra and understanding of
algorithm and statistics skills now once
you understand artistics for data
analysis you're half a reader scientist
now why I am saying that because you can
discover from radar and for that
fortunate to understand the data and
pressure things that you will be doing
on the data so this actually forms a
very core part of decision-making now
from here you can take you to the
advanced level which can be done using
machine learning and deep learning but
again that is an advanced of your
discussion so we'll be doing that in a
further slides
but for now what you need to do you
first need to analyze the data so that
you can take meaningful decisions out of
it so now let us consider the other
problems that we face why we are in the
flow so moving ahead with data we can't
write everything on pen and paper and
draw the graphs right so we need some
sort of programming so next we have
programming so to become marina
scientist you must be well versed with
the programming skills now the most
commonly used programming languages are
Python r and SAS so let us discuss all
of them one by one
now Python is an open so general-purpose
programming language which is extremely
simple and is very easy to learn so it
is a very powerful language which
closely resembles our English language
as well it is also portable or you can
say it is paid for many platforms be it
Linux platform be
McIntosh or anything next Python has
many libraries starting for my numerical
errors to machine learning to your
visualization so some of the libraries
are numpy scipy matplotlib Seabourn and
all of these so you can perform almost
any statistical operation or build any
model using these libraries next let us
talk about are now on another language
which is mostly preferred by data
scientists so our is again an open
source and is a programming as well as
statistical language well one reason
that it is said that R is very easy is
that it is very well documented it is
also cost effective and has strong
statistical capabilities then we have
sass sews a spacing theory stands for
statistical analysis system it is the
most used tool in the commercial alex
market and contains various statistical
functions along with a very good GUI now
SAS is also considered as a full
generation programming language so
basically a fourth in duration
programming language is designed with a
specific purpose in mind
such as the development of commercial
business software therefore SAS is
designed to reduce the programming
effort and minimize the time and cost it
takes to develop a software also python
and r are not the four generation
languages now for each of these
programming languages there are various
inbuilt libraries for visualizations and
they are fairly nice but when you talk
about business in perspective you need
to have proper visualization tools and
will be having the discussion over that
in the for the slides so again if you
have to choose any programming language
I would anyway go with Python but if
you're coming from data analytics back
load R would be a better choice for you
so it all depends on your need
so basically you just need to be
expertise in any of the programming
language P a Python be it R or SAS next
you must have some database knowledge
now with the large amount of data that
is being generated every day you need to
store it somewhere so you must have the
basic database knowledge to store and
analyze the data well nowadays every
companies are using various database
management systems such as my sequel or
Cassandra which is a no sequel database
to store the data so working with EDA
bases will surely secure a dream job to
become a to scientist next and very
important is machine learning and deep
your
so a data scientist is incomplete
without these so machine learning
basically uses artificial annoyance to
turn the data into value and learn
without being explicitly program then we
have deep learning deep learning models
are capable of learning to focus on the
right features by themselves requiring a
little guidance from the programmer
so basically deep learning mimics the
way that our brain works that is it
learns from the experience next deep
learning is also a subfield of machine
learning which is concerned with the
algorithms that is inspired by the
structure and the function of the wave
which is called as artificial neural
networks then we have variously gardens
in machine learning and deep learning so
talking about machine learning we have
algorithms such as supervised learning
unsupervised learning and reinforcement
learning so you need to have good
knowledge on various algorithms such as
linear regression then we have logistic
regression k-means clustering decision
tree and we have many more like that and
in deep learning we have libraries such
as tensor flow and chaos to implement it
you can also take it forward and
understand how convolutional neural
network recurrent neural networks are
being work together next in a list is
Big Data
so there is a huge amount of data that
has been floating around and what we do
with it is all that matters right now
Big Data and data science is not only
seen in the IT field but it has spread
across all the reading - trees today
therefore it makes it evident that for a
certified data center fessional sky is
the limit and big data analytics has
become a major role as health in
improving business decision makings and
providing the biggest edge over the
computers so with big data you can
perform distribute processing and you
can even write MapReduce codes so one
should definitely know Big Data
technologies and the most popular ones
are Hadoop HDFS and Apache spark then we
have data ingestion and managing so the
process of importing transferring
loading and processing the data for
later use or you can say storage in a
database is called as data ingestion
so this involves loading data from a
variety of sources so some of the data
ingestion tools are Apache fume and
Apache scoop so if you have ever
performed data analysis you might have
come across feature selection before you
apply to your analytical model to the
data so in general all the activity that
you do on the raw data to make it clean
enough to input to an alkene algorithm
is called as data
so we can use any programming language
for that you can use our or you can use
Python packages for that as well so as a
data scientist you must be able to
understand what all features are
important in the data set and what all
features can be removed and obviously
you have to remove some inconsistencies
in the data set and all these things
comes under the part of data munging or
you can say data wrangling then we have
visualization so data visualization is a
very important part of a data lifecycle
now a good hands-on knowledge is
required
unreal visualization tools even you can
use a programming language for that
purpose but you need to understand the
basics of good visualization and
reporting so you don't have to pick up a
graphic designer
but you need to be well-versed in how to
create reports that a complete layman
can understand it such as you enjoy your
repost your manager or may be dieted of
see you so you will definitely not be
showing the course to him right so it is
very important to present your data in
the right way so now some of the major
popular visualization tools are tableau
we have picked you then we have Google
charts and we have many more tools in
the market but these are the most
popular ones used in the market today so
till now we have discussed the various
tools and technologies next is your
problem solving or how a data scientist
can solve everything
now basically data-driven problem
solving approach is something that you
need to develop and that will only come
with experience so a data scientist
needs to know how to productively
approach a problem so the first thing he
needs to understand the data or you can
say explore the data he must know what
data tells from it what are the salient
features of it and all those things then
he needs to analyze the data properly or
you can say what patterns can be drawn
from the data or how can you frame a
cushion that will help you yield the
right answer so all this comes in the
part of analysis then deciding what
approximations make sense take the
appropriate action or train the model to
get the desired results
afterwards you can just communicate with
the co-workers perform visualizations
and get the desired output but for that
all you need is practice and practice if
you actually want to get into this field
you need to have more and more hands-on
experience and for that what you can do
you can go ahead and build your own
projects and then you can explore
various data sets you can also enter
various competitions which has been
organized
by Kaggle and many the websites out
there so a data scientist will have all
the relative industry requirements and
is capable enough to do the job
next let us understand the various roles
and responsibilities of our hit a
scientist so after him discussed a data
scientist is not only responsible for
business analytics they're also involved
in building data products and software
platforms along with developing
visualizations and machine learning
algorithms some of the premier data
scientist job titles are data Ingenio
then we have data architect we have data
analyst rater
then we had in the analyst business
analyst data analytics manager and this
intelligence manager so we can choose
any field so organizations who
previously played mining dealt with well
behaved data but today the amount of
unstructured data is far more than the
structured ones and definitely needs
highly exposed Atta scientists to handle
them so this condition is not only seen
in a particular sector but it is face
across all the industries learning and
getting equipped with data science
skills and technologies will not only
fill the need of data scientist but it
will also going to make you the IT
superheroes so to be among them Aradia
science course is a must so anyone with
a passion to become ADA scientist can
become one through professional data
science training so get trained in data
science and become the coolest
profession in the IT field now to get
in-depth knowledge on data science you
can enroll for the live redesign
certification training by Ed Eureka with
24/7 support and the lifetime access she
provides courses on our programming as
well as the Python programming now in
our programming it will help you to gain
expertise in machine learning algorithms
like k-means clustering decision tree
random qualif and many more using the
our language it will also help you
understand the concepts such as
statistics time series text mining and
an introduction to deep learning as well
so throughout this data science course
we'll be implementing various real-life
use cases on media healthcare social
media and HR next it is the same who's
available in Python language as well so
here again it will help you to gain
expertise in various machine learning
algorithms then it will expose you to
the concepts of statistics time series
and different casts of machine learning
such as your supervised learning then
unsupervised learning and reinforcement
learning so throughout this data science
certification training you will be
having 24/7 support and the lifetime
accessibility to the courses will
so you can go ahead and choose any one
of it now let me summarize today's
session so first of all we had a look to
various facts after why I should go for
it a scientist then they have talked
about the road map or the journey to
become a successful data scientist after
that we have understood all the tools
and techniques required to become one
and discuss the ways roles and
responsibilities operator scientist and
finally towards the end I have talked
about the trainings which are provided
by Ed Eureka that is both in Python
programming language as well as our
programming language so don't just learn
in guys master it with Ed Eureka I hope
