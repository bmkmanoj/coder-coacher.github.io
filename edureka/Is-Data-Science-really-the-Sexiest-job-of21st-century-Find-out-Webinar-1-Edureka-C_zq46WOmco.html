the session you will be able to know why
did a science is the most soft after job
in 20 and 5 carry opportunities with
data science advantages of data science
and understand how come things are using
data science now before we go ahead the
idea is not to buzz you to make you
pursue this data science field rather to
make you make you more informative about
about what exactly is there in the ball
of data science why are what are the
reasons that it's actually pushing this
entire ecosystem of data science and
what exactly do we need to do once you
become a need a scientist so while it
assigns is the most sort of a job in
2015 let's find out well the fortune
hundred companies board the redesigns
light and I and the analysts carousel
rabanne fit so what does it mean I mean
the first one is pre-clear right the
legacy firms a fortunate firms all of
them are building up their designs team
so they are building up they don't have
established team yet so that means you
get them first mover's advantage in case
you are in the first the initial member
of the team analysts get a salary band
left complete looking to recruit data
scientists need to make sure the bands
of competitive and the basically think
of ways to Leo telling so basically it's
now you know as I myself visiting
scientists and whenever I get a call
from a company they don't they don't
really ask me you know how much of the
salaries is one of expecting they they
are open to they're open to any kind of
you know salary hikes whatever you know
I am asking them so it's majorly uh you
know a candidate different market it's
not a market where you have a fixed
thirty percent nikond40 person I
whatever you're working in India where
you have to ensure that will ensure that
everything is everything else is taken
care of in terms of the remuneration as
well as the the the other benefits for
example if you are data scientist the
first thing that will get is a good
salary the median salary is higher than
any of the IT jobs right now in fact
after
glamour investment banking hedge fund
and investment bank and an advantage
trading data science is on is one of the
most you know is when the most richest
of the jobs richard job in the ones
where you get more of the job may or
more of the money no job so that's
that's a clear indicator why people are
looking for for this data science stream
and why it's a dream job nowadays top 6
printed jobs in the decade in us so
let's see a video game designer data
scientist is number two sustainability
consulting solar sales consultant social
media and wind turbine so artham mode
are towards the environment side video
game designer how opium designer by the
way are required by the organization's
though this this says it's 30 2.4% the
fact is the number of job vacancies for
a video game designers is way less than
the number of vacancies for a data
scientists and that's primarily because
the the data science spectrum is so wide
that it's actually required in virtually
every other domain right even if its
healthcare or if it's finance or if it
is retail or real estate nowadays or you
know ecommerce it's like it's super
Yujin and when the impact of a data
scientist a good day design is huge in
any organization that's why it's
actually at the number at the second
number so this is this is something
really exciting because if we can have a
projected growth of 18.7 percent a year
that's phenomenal actually well it
assigns scientist salary of course the
salaries are very higher in the west
coast in the Silicon Valley one lakh
four thousand I one and four thousand
I'm sorry for those who are not from
India another of h-1b filings is to is
rate and so so I'm talking of someone
who's traveling from India to us of
course when I was in u.s. Miceli was in
fact much better than and then then what
is mentioned here I dinner scientists
need not to be someone who comes in who
has to be a u.s. resident or someone
who's working you
even India the salaries are way high
really high and primary again for the
same reason that that data scientist in
in any part of the world they all are
making huge money because of the kind of
impact they bring into the
organization's okay which is which is
you actually ID salary let's look at the
ID salary in terms of I mean if you look
at us and then look at India so so
basically it's around ninety four
thousand dollars if you're in US which
I'm not too sure if it's great I mean
it's definitely much more than that
maybe it's a little more adding some
stale data I guess and the good thing is
it's not just the it's not just the
total salary in fact this number of jobs
for example sales job for let's say five
people in hedge fund and all them are
making two hundred thousand dollars a
year or three thousand dollars a year
that's great but that's only for five
guys whereas data science data
scientists requirements is actually with
let's say 100 companies right now at mr.
point of time all of them having at
least one or two openings every month
that means there are 200 jobs each one
each offering more than one hundred
thousand dollars which is a huge come
down to India the salary is around 1
million rupees which is not that bad of
course and it goes up to 19 1.9 million
rupees I can you can get my in a more
than that for sure okay let's not that
difficult so let's decode what is data
science well it seems like it's a study
of extraction of knowledge from data old
saying I guess it includes reading
elements and is built on techniques and
theories from many fields like machine
learning computer programming
mathematical skills visualization
pattern recognition and data engineering
but honestly some of them are
overlapping terms machine learning and
pattern recognition honestly they both
fall in the same bracket call artificial
intelligence data engineering in
computer programming can be clubbed into
one and machine learning pattern and
mathematic
in fact could become a bucket into one
and visualization data engineering and
computer programming could be bucket
into one so they had to set of skills
unlike any the technology that you know
you must have seen machine learning and
computer programming and mathematical
skills would go back to your basics of
your mathematics of course not that not
not basic math that you've studied in
your you know and you know a secondary
school but something like your
elementary years of your college that
involves partial differentiation
differential equations integral calculus
differential calculus matrix algebra
linear modeling optimization that's all
what is constituting this term called
machine learning and the other part is
data engineering computer programming
which after the advent of big data has
become equally important nowadays
because you could program a system to
run a multiple clusters and do some very
creative stuff which was not possible
before distributed computing so so as a
matter of fact it's both of them have
have got equal proportion in terms of
their total input to this concept called
a science visualization tool is very
important aspect though it does not seem
like that technical but visualization
makes your entire entire work you know
logical it brings it into a logical
space from a more technical space or a
more meaningful space from a more
technical space so basically you are
doing a summary of let's say behavior of
students and all you present as data it
does not make sense but if you can bring
in some certain graphs second chance
side set in chats that are dynamic that
makes a lot of sense to someone who is
looking at it who understands the
business but does not understand the
technical behavior then assigns
practitioners are data scientists of
course well it's a combination of
artists programmer statisticians domain
SMEs communicator client-facing honestly
the biggest at a difficult most part in
this entire set of this entire pie it's
not a pie charts Venn diagram kind of
thing these circles the biggest thing I
would say is the red one
which is stat statistician and that's
because statisticians the statistic part
is the most is the most difficult job in
this entire entire set of things that
you see and that's because it brings in
a lot of time at it brings in a lot of
lot of stuff which is not trivial
programming we I mean if you I expect
you are from IT background so
programming is not going to be difficult
client facing you anyways have been
client-facing artistic ideas maybe
that's because of visualizations
communication well of course it's very
important but you know communication by
the way is any important any other field
so it's um it's like it's like mandatory
one so it's not important it's mandatory
but statistics here becomes the key
factor and that is why you see so many
people getting rejected for it assigns
interview and we'll discuss at why so a
career path ah skills required a
startling modeling technically up TP or
business acumen programming data
warehousing business intelligence all of
this constitutes you know your spectrum
of data science though data science
actually is little you know away from
these two concepts data warehousing and
business intelligence that's pretty much
a set of skills that it's there in the
IT industry as a plow I think the most
important part again is statically
modeling in technical aptitude and and
if you are technical aptitude is is is
that on the learning side then it's good
in case you are opting for a data
science field but if it's not then it's
going to be a very difficult case
because data science is everyday
learning kind of a thing every single
day you'll come across something new
someone posting something on on linkedin
or somewhere else article with something
else by said if you don't read that
that's fine but in in a year or so
you'll figure out that you are lacking
lot of skills which other people have
and that's why you have to keep yourself
up on your toes every time
that's in fact true for every ID role
but Dinah science is really more
exhaustive in terms of learning every
day then compared to any other role in
the ID field as of now job roles
business analyst data analyst data
scientists you know data scientists and
decision that scientists honestly there
is no such no such rule as decision
scientists a data scientist supposed to
be a guy who could take decision so a
data scientist is nothing decision
scientists nothing but a subset of data
scientists generally designed this is
nothing but a amatory designs and data
analyst a business analyst are the rules
that are already existing and these
roles have these words have been really
industrialized over a period of time and
they are specific with specific
organizations advantages so basically
you're able to find sites from data
which is not meaningful so first of all
we could define what happened then we
could figure out a diagnostic analysis
on the same and then then pricked of
analytics so protective analytics is
like your the heart of data science
protective analytics is the is the study
of printing a particular behavior of a
system and prescriptive analytics is now
our new version of predictive analytics
where you figure out how can you make it
happen for example I might focus about
an organization that it will do great in
Linux coming here let's say to grow by
forty percent but what how can I make it
grow by fifty percent and that's the
series of insights that you can bring in
through prescriptive analytics now let's
look at one of the cases billions of
dollars are lost every year because of
the frauds in various domains okay
Aberdeen analyze different types of
prevailing frauds and company's
readiness to deal with that okay now i
can give an example of fraud management
for a big credit card company in us so i
was part of the p when we were asked to
figure out how many credit card
frauds are going to occur in the next
one month specifically related to
payment of bills utility bills okay so
so what they were trying to figure out
was that if someone is going to pay a
credit card bill how what what would I
chance is that someone will actually be
someone's salmon system would actually
breached during that process and doing
that was a definitely played definitely
a non trivial exercise but we saved the
organizations are going to be saved
around you know one-tenth of the
organization's total expenditure on
fraud management just with a single
exercise and that was amounting billions
okay I'm sorry millions okay and that
was that was definitely a big big in a
boost for the organization because they
fell it's a big big invest it's a great
investment because otherwise is
humongous one you're improving a
business second you make money you're
stopping Billy or you're kind of not
letting mary berner for some absolutely
with you know a weird reason right in
the same way if you look at the other
things like the theft of his gray SS
mortgage ADM fising the credit card
debit card default default management
and and adam there was the case with
there was a case the bank which I which
we have part of again and once you
figure out whether a particular person
will be a NP an odd or particular
account applying for a loan will that be
an NP a lot and if we could do that with
seventy percent of accuracy that was
used for any organization for suddenly
very huge and exercise took around five
months now so so of course whatever
money they had spent for the research
actually paid in really good fruits
because these saved a lot of money 11
you know NPA dissolves around 100
accounts so what do we learn from hunter
accounts is taken up by one in PA
when the CM branch so if he could avoid
that that's a big big plus now let's
look at the data science career path
looking at the job opportunity well when
I start my career data science term was
not even coined I start McCurry about
the emphasis and then I switched on to
IBM Research when I was part of a IBM
Research somewhere in 2008-9 McKenzie
along with the DJ party who is the chief
data scientist for US government now
coined this term data science and then
eventually did a scientist so it's
majorly from you know somewhere down
july a absurd to 2001 to end that this
term data scientists started picking up
and by you know by by by end of two
slogan for it it reached a state from
where it only see a big big growth and
the reason is the number of people
realizing the potential of data
scientist second the possibility of
introducing a use case that would
require it in a scientist both of them
have actually starting checking shaping
up big time in every other company now
major companies that are using data
signs one is amazon.com Amazon uses data
science for recommendation engine
majorly and that's because so coming
like Amazon or any other e-commerce like
Flipkart in India thereand evidence to
show you the right product in the first
25 seconds if you cannot show the right
product in the first 25 seconds then
there is there isn't any chance that the
customer is going to buy a product from
the website so they want to ensure that
whatever is off the liking of the
customer we should show it first and
that's where is the recommendation
engine which is based on the history of
that customer plus the history of the
customer who had similar shopping habits
IBM i was part of IBM researcher second
maybe talking share some part ib am so i
mean as a brick move is in fact on the
biggest vendors for data science and
they've got a tool called IBM big data
insights which is majorly contained
analytics which is basically basically
into takes analytics using IBM Watson
and apache weima so Ivan Watson is not
another new face of content analytics
very costly tool but they're using it to
to help organizations slave or make
sense out of any data that they have
okay so so Ameican search about what's
in a bit more facebook and all the
social media I don't think I need to
make an effort here to explain what why
they're using data science of course
they using criticized for figuring out
what people like nowadays then walmart
honda bank of america finance or walmart
would figure out the best inventory
optimization techniques as well as
recommendation engine what could be the
best way to sell stuff to people let's
look at a real life application so
application of day design so BMW is
using pretty valid x to find a place to
park okay now of course is one
big is it definitely a one big even
nowadays that can frustrate your
customers so so basically BMW also be
able is a taxi in u.s. okay so they want
to ensure that whatever whatever
whenever I mean whenever they are
running the taxis they should pay
minimum bills for parking okay and the
cost of parking in certain countries
goes up proportionately to the number of
waking slots okay so you want to ensure
how they can figure out the parking
slots how they can how they can find
parking slot at the cheapest cost and if
they don't optimize this particular
exercise then they lose around more than
you know five to six million dollars
each year which is not small which is
used right so if they can optimize it in
a way in which they can see and they can
use they can pay the most rushing rates
for parking they'll save a lot of money
and that's what we're trying to do they
figure out of predict which parking
slots are going to have an empty slot
okay and that is how they are capturing
the entire parking queue system
ecommerce using it for accommodation is
that as i told you that the e-commerce
companies they show
you that if you buy this you can buy
this because people have been buying
this also but that's one imagine you are
looking at youtube and you're looking
around at a video for Tom Cruise of mi5
okay now those who looked at come close
mi5 also looked at some you know let's
say some of the videos of Tom Cruise
let's say now that is first of all on
the basis of the history of other people
having having near about same history
pattern as compared to you as well as
your own history bathroom ok so so in
that way in that way you could you could
pretty well serve your customers with
the rightmost thing with the most
pertinent thing that they would mean
Netflix is one of the biggest ex you
know adopter of recommendation engine in
fact they ran a competition on cattle
that ran for about a couple of years and
and after after that they give it they
gave me the price of three million
dollars it was a combination of France
170 Gotham's and finally they adopted it
for the website those if they eventually
did not use it but they actually had
that e-commerce recommendation engine so
it is not the e-commerce but the
recommendation engine you know going
through with their strategy repeat
business so basically one big aspect of
data science is the customer 360-degree
view every come you want to ensure that
whatever customer like they have a
customer they want to ensure that the
customer is a repetitive customer that
means you can they should be suffering
the same customer again began so that
they have our ongoing business at now
first of all you can figure out from
Ali's itself who are going to be a
convertible customer you can predict
that and based on that you can serve
them better that you've got 10,000 ye
leads and the chances of chance of
solving your chance of serving your
chance of the fact that only two of them
would convert into a customer is not a
great idea and you won't certainly want
to ensure that who are more possible
customers
okay and then you want to solve them
more appropriately then the entire lead
crowd you got customer churn prevention
now al and any other any other telecom
company have a they have some they have
a concept called customer churn which is
the frequency of a customer going
available or bleeding away from their
from their technology set up from their
services to some other bed in your shoe
okay and this is one of the biggest
problem they've got so so they are using
data science big time is it has a big
eater innovation lab they're using all
them or that to figure out who are going
to leave the company and at what time
okay we'll have our hands on so the
hands-on basically is the a part of our
course in edit Rica you can look at the
course content and see if that makes
sense to you so is data really the
successor of 21st century the answer is
a big yes it is the success you have off
the 20th 21st century because of the
most adorable market they are among the
most wage jobs that difficult and
expensive to hire that's fine so that
means if you are a good data scientist
you've got your say while you are being
interviewed and the fact that they are M
simply aren't a lot of people the idea
is very simple see even if lot of people
start you know learning about it assigns
not many of them are going to convert
into data scientist for a very simple
reason it's not trivial it's not yet on
the technology that you master enjoyed
instead everything it is laughs math and
it's not simple math there's a lot of
the sort of logic is not of algorithm
that you have to master and that's not
simple that's not a simple set of skills
so effectively there are only ten
percent of the actual data scientists
from the community that is that that
that constitute the entire data science
ecosystem that means if there are
hundred people on LinkedIn saying that
they are data scientist only 10 of them
are actual data scientists okay so
someone says so I was just going to talk
about just salaries in companies well we
did cover some of the parts yes but
salaries and companies was the most was
the motivation factor here and for the
rest of the stuff you can look at the
data science career
and see that excites you manisha so how
do I become a data scientist well we've
covered that pretty much i can give you
a link of my video which talks about the
fact that how do you become a data
scientist you can search me on youtube
under color how to become a data
scientist you can find a video on that
alongside that indian assigns you have
to study statistics programming and and
and some visualizations with the domain
knowledge what are the things we have to
study in statistics well it's not the
trivial statistics that you probably
have seen in your class 12th or your
high school it's more of statistical
learning there are some really good
books of the market one is elements of
statistical learning by Travis let me
write down the name shravan sorry
travelocity Trevor st and rob tisha
Annie the name of the book is elements
offset not introduction there's a book
called elements of statistical learning
it's freely downloadable and and you can
download it from the Stanford NFC
website ok so I am sending it to all you
can read it there I am doing mba right
now I'm not inside there's one question
for that how is someone from accountants
in converting to become design this I'm
doing mb right now non engineer
alexandria science so for both of you I
expect the question would more relate to
the fact that the technology that you
don't know ok well the technology is not
important ok now it's not that you're
developing something in java application
java rather what you're doing is you are
you are using your technology to write a
book oh sorry to write some code reading
question to write to write equation that
you don't want to solve a hand for
example imagine solving an integral
calculus problem ok
integration problem in a class 12th
higher school they were quite there are
cases which was not that easy to solve
and imagine if that gets complex and
complex okay so what do you do you
cannot you cannot kind of you cannot
solve by hand so you have to use
technology to solve that problem and
that exactly the use of technology in
this case so for you of course it's not
only that easy you have to learn some
basics of Python and our but the most
important statistics which I think
should be equal difficult for you as for
any energy engineer okay so that should
not be a problem i have 10 years of in
java of them can i moved into this field
yes of course you can move into this
field just see that you are good in math
and statistics ok let's for pawan and
for shriram and clement lee who is an
accountant I've just answered the
question there was no question on
accountancy an MBA then this question by
treaty Mishra she says I'm currently
working as taking black little company
what path should I take so can smoothly
make a transition towards becoming it
assigns test ok so to become a data
scientist see if you think you can do a
course of three weeks or four weeks or
five weeks or six weeks you can become a
data scientist know the answer is a big
big no he cannot and for a very simple
reason it's not it's not a technology
it's not a programming language but I
tell you ok do this this lap and do this
lap and no the question the the the the
the thing is we have to have certain
knowledge of statistics and the
application of that strategy which is
called as applied statistics then seeing
what bales better in what kind of
scenario so I think it's a good two
years effort that you have to put in one
to two laser forgetting to put in to
become a good quality data scientist
okay the cones with Eddie Rica is a good
one to start with okay that's because it
is get you started again it will not
make you did a scientist honestly it
will only get you started as a data
scientist please write books in here
I've already done that
I'm working a two year I working to him
for two years in a dwv i niver the
course on data and data science is it is
a great job in minus two expenses on c
getting a job is not going to be easy
for sure okay first of all if you do a
course in redesigns you will need not
get a job directly you'll be because I
have taken at least winded interview so
far and the only reason why companies
called me is to figure out whether the
person is only a course guy or does it
really know you know something in India
science okay so so you have to put in
efforts do a course and then put in
efforts of at least 12 to 18 months to
become a good data scientist and then
apply for group job what all
technologies the question is the metal
Shrivastav I'm sorry the question that
Amazon's answer was for the arijit other
is Python in Python you need to know
scikit-learn not the entire Python
scikit-learn and then pandas and I'm
writing down the name so don't worry I
just spin it to all of you and sigh
numpy how can a person from physics can
fit as a redesign well that's a
wonderful question abaca gamma
physicists I've been physics guy I've
been a physics teacher in the past the
guy with physics background can very
easy to any into a data scientist
because physics is all about logic and
data sciences not different either it's
all logic just some different set of law
subjects so someone from physics can
very well turn into a data scientist if
the person has really given a lot you
know is given some thinking to physics
what about visualization yeah of course
for visualization you can use d 3 dot
J's file otherwise we use a lot of our
and Matt plot live in Python so the
physics question was for Gopi Krishna
and for visualization I just amazed I'm
sorry what was the name is what are the
things we covered under this I don't
understand what this is rakesh can you
please rewrite a question only after
complete statuses should i move to
redesign sorry I think that's a good
idea if you not completely knowing
statistics if you there okay let me just
like
the set of things which are important
for statics one is linear regression
there is logistic there is splines Marsh
random forest boosting edibles and
gradient then bugging the neural
networks support vector machines okay
then ROC curves auc f-score sensitivity
specificity then there what cross
validation yeah certain tests like
t-tests NHS t wall stairs i am a ok
write some basic stopping some
statistics to get started I have done
that what was your background how did
you become read a scientist ok that's a
very good question ah well I was I have
a bachelors in computer science and I
have a master's in theory of computation
and advanced 36 from Indian stamps
considered kolkata that is how i started
into SATA sticks and then i joined IBM
research must watch which was purely a
machine learning job and from there i
joined mckenzie in consulting and from
then I joined zs associates and then
finally I join a start-up and then I've
shifted back to India so all my work was
actually around statistics and machine
learning so my Master's helped me to
some extent but i think was purely my
project work and and my constant
learning behavior i would say if i could
appreciate myself in that case that led
me you know let me become a let me
become a data scientist i have that
answer the question Krishna Krishna oh
I'm sorry please write some basic
tropical statics I've done that below
I'm a Devon currently working as a
market research in an EA with no
programming background looking forward
to be getting new designs one of the
player is required to get any designs
and what other programming language are
a must and how it assigns different from
big data i think the word the most
important part of question is how is it
assigns different from big data
big data is a term nowadays use pretty
much for everything which is no biggie
de menthe putida memes like a lot of lot
of you are able to process a lot of data
okay now why does revolutionize the data
science field is previously you look at
in statistician they used to take
samples of data because their
programming capability you was not be on
a particular second day does it okay but
I am so putting the size of data set now
with this advent of the advent of these
data this Big Data technologies I can
now run my analytics on top of terabytes
of data which can give me further much
better results then what way I was
getting with the samples of course in
the sample you might not be able to
capture them entire representation of
the population and should not get a
great answer so big data is a mechanism
to process store and manage data sets
which are really huge data science is
the ability to make sense of the data it
could be a big data it could be small
data you can use big data technologies
in fact so in fact our can be used with
Hadoop Python can be used with a group
and there is this new apache spark which
is integrated with machined apache em
lib which can be used for large key
machine learning and for the
prerequisites have already mentioned
that you have to i mean one language is
a must so you should start learning are
are as in our programming language i am
working on hpcc big day technology i am
also learning are what else do i need to
become read a scientist status x simple
you need to know the algorithms i'm
currently at working its data engineer
rapid housing do I have to Nolan having
observed no not not me i don't have java
knowledge i work on a two black day in
and day out I don't have java knowledge
whenever I need to run a MapReduce I can
run it with Python and with hive I can
pretty much squaring all my big data
sets how do we owe come no data
scientist experience during interview I
think that's a pretty good question
Clement again simply for I
for a very simple reason most people who
are interviewed in a great for example
whenever I interior end of your guy they
say they've got ten years of experience
in data science okay one is redesigns
and big data well as big data is data
came into it went after 2004 that's when
Google wrote at very first research
paper and was first used outside google
in 2007 and in yahoo and i was adopted
by a patch in 2008 even if you were the
most you know let's say let's see active
member in a pasture community you
couldn't have used it before 2009 okay
so first of all they are liar second set
of people are those those who have no
experience but then when they they show
that they've got some experience those
are the guys those of donna course and
they come up and and you know the study
some basic set of problems and then they
come up and say oh I know their signs
and I've been doing this and they're
caught on the very first in body first
question I think the best that's what
I've been saying it's not a six give it
a one year time learn lua course take a
dataset try to research on it try to
come up with an optimal answer in six
months then do another project and try
to improve whatever you've learned from
your first project and after one year
when you appear for an interview and if
you've done those two things properly I
can assure you that you'll certainly
find a job and it assigns very easily
because you would know certain stuff and
get a background in others there's other
things if you're an engineer if your
accountant whatever cookie when suddenly
hero back up your entire domain
understanding what you seeing a good can
it for data analytics statistics and and
learning capability I don't really ask
questions on on technology of course do
i do ass on certain architectural
problems for big data but i don't really
ask how do you do that in python what is
our means r is a programming language
the capital R stands for is it stands
for programming language named our car
is it how to get that opportunity after
the code is Erica will it will give that
one in excess and business kitchen well
business case and everything it's I mean
if you join a trigger course you will
get a project but that project is for a
week so shouldn't be a shouldn't be it
won't be something that helped you there
are thousand of cases available online
as if you're really interested I can I
can help you get certain projects i have
my own startup i can help you do that by
the way i am the instructor for a design
scores also so once you are done with
the course you can certainly I can
certainly help you with some of the
projects I have some of the industry
projects also what are to be covered
under visualization is some kind of
mathematics involved in visualization no
visualization majorly is some library
knowledge with some artistic
understanding of things what are the
parameters parameters subject area wise
which the Intimidator signed is taken
how to make yourself ready to cry out
the interview you should start the six
basics I'll got thumbs basics where is
the basics that means you should know it
from the basics okay and you should know
you should have worked on at least
couple of big problems otherwise there
is no way you can crack the interview I
had studied statistics during my
undergraduate that happened it assigns
it all depends on how much have you done
that for example if you not done
regression-based aggression I'm sorry
whatever you've studied in statistics is
not going to help how can I learn our
language in a comprehensive day are well
I'd like a course the goodwill Charlotte
but that but then but then our has a is
also I mean it's an open source so you
can find lot of tutorials on our online
I do like I will give you a good fast
moving you have no course that can help
you get your feet wet in are also can we
connect on Lincoln yes of course we can
all connect on LinkedIn my email I mind
my you can search on linkedin by
unalloyed kala a and i are you thk al a
collar and nothing on the only data
scientist by the name one of the courses
you will suggest in Attica for learning
data science with his only one quirks
for it assigns so it should do that how
to enroll for the data science course
which we mentioned above I think you'll
get an email from Eddie Rica which can
which will have a link to a delicate
data science course see otherwise you go
into idiotic of website and find the
link to the day
ence course from where can I get a small
projects on data science only dialysis
well you can go to top coder com
topcoder popc oh dear let me top coder
was my past was my last organizations
basically they are into data science
challenges so they take up problems from
the industry the actual problems that
with which a particular organization is
struggling they put up put it up as a
challenge and who sir will solve their
problems get some money okay so we can
start participating in those challenges
in that way you will land up solving a
problem for a company and the question
was Suraj is Suraj sherek how to annul
for the design schools which you
mentioned system with us was with
re-adding I've already answered the
question is SQL of prerequisite his SQL
is not a prerequisite but you should
know is critical is the easiest of the
entire entire entire lot you know that
I've mentioned in terms of the self
things that you need to learn the annex
question is again by Mitali does the
data science course by Derek involves in
real time projects yes it is so all the
algorithms that we do is based on a
woody beers on a case study in practical
data scientists job how do you relate
our language to work will it be the same
or not I'm not getting the question if
practically design job how do you relate
our language tube well I day I use our
everyday I use our Python Hadoop mall
would be be every single day ok so r is
definitely very useful but it comes to
text a python is more useful before then
the course what are the blue box we need
to do well a basic statistics mean mode
median all these things basics of
statistics you should know if you know
start if you know if you know some
programming language that will help
because that will help you understand
sin texts written faster okay so I come
to that was last question biology is
there a classroom training available or
all our online well honestly classroom
trainings are virtually not possible
nowadays because if the class is in one
sin city you might not be in the recipe
if gas is
in let's say in one producing you might
not be you might be in that city but you
cannot travel if if the class is if the
class is I mean there could be several
means why a physical class it is not
really held so online class i mean i've
i've had i've taken 15 matches in every
kind of taught with other organizations
to i'm also corporate trainer and I and
I can tell you online courses have
become much more reliable and much more
convenient because you get training
recordings available so you can you know
you can go through recordings again and
again and you can ask questions the same
way equal you could ask the instructor
in a physical class I think the only
difference is you cannot touch or you
cannot you know shake hands with the
ready with the instructor otherwise
thing is exactly same is that in
classroom traveling oh sorry did you did
not get you in lingdon imma just search
by my name it's under root collar link
didn't even if you search it on google
minus the first link ID you'll see ok my
name is under color to search by this
name how many programming languages in a
typically designed his job i would say r
and python are the must once can you
please show a small practical demo on
how did a science work so r is open at
my hand ok so basically we're trying to
figure out the cost of a house but
trying to get it the cost of a average
house every thousand sense average
average sized house in boston and we
were using different variables like like
they're the the age of the middle name
of every person in that kinda city the
crime rate the the pollution the
taxation in that area all of that to
predict the the median cost of a house
and and and to do that use algorithm
called i think we are using random
forests here and using that we predicted
the summary the predicted the we did all
these analysis like
what could be the reason for example
black black as a number of people who
are black I mean it's some racist
ideology but can can can race of upper
to the person determine the house cause
the price of house in a particular city
or the crime it can that end if I so we
did all that to figure out can we
actually see some some you know some
some pattern in the house prices for
example the crime rate gave a very clear
indication on as the crime rate
decreases the house did increase is
quite drastically so there is a small
small name of that we're doing for
random forests which operating system
should i use to them Bridget and it
arises if you can afford a mac go for a
Mac I mean honestly should go for linux
by no means windows which ID do you use
for i used to i use our studio mad Mac
might not be good for open source of
knowledge it's good enough because all
these open source ones that we need they
have a mac version also for example RS
mac version thanks a lot how is SAS
sizes is good SAS is good but it has an
inherent cost plus it has some some
issues with some of the complexity of
items like neural networks you cannot
use new networks in SAS also d is a
freeware or I need to install Newton
only you need a open license so it's
freeware actually yeah I've seen the
invitation so many of them here how near
let me work can help here the new
network is algorithm and like any girl
caught them it has its own application
will see that when once if you join the
course i'll definitely expand that or
expand your horizons of new network for
you but it's it's rather bottom it can
help in exactly the same way neither
Gotham could help you of course honestly
no kohls can give you or can make it a
scientist I'm not the course is not
claim that you'll become data scientist
once you finish the course important is
that you let you do a course but you
also work on it for next 62 i would say
at least 10 to 12 months then only
you'll be in a position to say then only
you'll be able to i know they strongly
position yourself in a data science
industry any good books in python well
there is a Coors in Python also good
books on Python I think Python for
domains is a good one but the best one
is the psychic documentation on on the
web scikit-learn documentation any
online course for status in Python yes
you can go to Coursera you can go to ADF
they've got courses on one statistics
and Python I cannot cannot I cannot say
that they are not great they're good but
they are more from academic purpose they
don't give you a practical knowledge
that's where Andy Ricker differs from
those courses but suddenly they're good
ones they're not bad at all online
courses for our yes there are some
online courses one is data camp dat a
CMP it's a free free one you can go
there again more from from from a
perspecto academic perspective what are
certifications for it assigns idyllic
either a certification but I don't think
any certification helps if you know
stuff you can say that in the interview
I know staff even if you know stuff if
you don't if you don't know stuff and
you have a certificate it cannot help
you ok Python 40 times in femoral is a
good one year certainly you can go to
call sorry DX they've got Python courses
you can you search the Python courses
there is a course free course on Udacity
also you can go there and see ok find
them so now we reach the end of this
webinar thank you so much for joining in
there's a question okay for statics need
and data science is there any good book
I've mentioned the book named elements
of statistical learning again i'm
metalia i'm writing it here elements
yearly Emmy NTS elements of status
ticker learning by Rob dish irani and
Trevor nasty okay great then thank you
so much for joining him I hope you had
an informative session and all the best
and thanks to everyone for thanks
everyone for for their linkedin invite
so there's a question 110 question thank
you so much am i and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
