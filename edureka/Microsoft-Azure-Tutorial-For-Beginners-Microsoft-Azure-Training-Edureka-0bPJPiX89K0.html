is homage I have total overall
experience of around 15 years and my
training experience is close to around
10 years so as far as today's agenda is
concerned so we would talk about
Microsoft Azure so we'll try to
understand more exactly as 0 is and more
exactly it has and what are the benefits
what are the drawbacks in case we use as
you're over the other trout services
what we have now a few ground rules
before we start in case anybody has any
questions so after the session you'll
have a round of questioning answers and
probably you can ask your questions then
because it becomes difficult for me to
address the questions within the session
so first of all the thing is that we
will go with the session once we are
done with the session then probably we
will have a Q&amp;amp;A now then we'll talk
about your questions we'll try to
address why should you go for a zero and
so on right so we'll try to understand
and talk about all those things I mean
if something is left basically so we'll
talk about all those things during the
session itself right so as far as the
agenda is concerned we would talk about
what is flow so we'll try to understand
what is cloud and why should we use
cloud what are the benefits of using
cloud and so on then we'll give you
brief of what Microsoft is your s
because if you are aware there are other
cloud platforms which we have in the
market these days so some people might
be already working on the cloud
platforms like AWS s1 Google cloud is
not a one
so not a cloud platform somewhere out
there so we'll talk about what exactly
Microsoft Azure is so cloud from is your
perspective then we would talk about the
job trends so we will try to understand
why should you learn so I mean just to
give you an overview Microsoft Azure has
acquired a lot of market from AWS
because few reasons behind it
number one being cost so a zero is
pretty cheap when you compare it with
AWS so we'll talk about all those things
as we go further then we'll talk about
Azure services which include lot of
different combination permutation
combination of services which you can
use as far as the server is concerned
then we'll talk about pricing then
there's a small demo which actually I
forgot so after a session we'll have a
demo
then we'll talk about the QN and then we
have certifications as far as
certifications are concerned probably
I'll just give you a brief of
certifications in the beginning itself
so when you go ahead and attend the
course for s 0 so there are three
certifications which are available till
date one is the Microsoft developer
certification for SEO so that talks
about 7:05 30 T so this is the code then
we have 533 so 533 talks about the
infrastructure services certification
from Microsoft and then you have the
architecture services which is basically
in 534 so these are three certifications
which are available as far as - your s
concerned
so from the developers perspective if
you would like to understand how do you
develop solutions on Azure and probably
the best course for you to attend would
be 532 if you want to go ahead and talk
about infrastructure side of SEO then
the certification what we would talk
well if you are familiar with the things
you are already working on is your past
one one half year or maybe two years and
you have some experience working on is
there so then we would talk about the
third certification which is fine or you
call architect in the solution
certification one second I guess
somebody is asking me a question
okay I would request everybody to please
keep this for later but if you have any
questions in between just make a note of
those questions so we can address those
questions on a later point in time so
let's just start with is your and the
first thing we will try to understand is
what is cloud why do we have flower and
why exactly the companies came forward
and then adapted this technology so
we'll talk about a lot of things as we
go further so now when you talk about
cloves in doing first of all I will just
go ahead and compare what we were doing
initially and what we are doing now so
previously when you talk about if
somebody's from the infrastructure back
end would be able to understand in a bit
of it initially when we started working
I mean if you talk about 10-15 years
back when I started working and I
started my career so we were talking
about I of course started my career with
I teach the company which I used to work
with used to support a particular client
and for that client they used to do the
IP they used to take care of the
infrastructure they used to take care of
the help desk and
right so initially during the course of
time what happened was wine became much
more educated that these people are
charging me for each and everything
wherein I am owning everything so I own
the infrastructure I own the bandwidth I
own the storage I own everything but
still these guys are charting images to
support that right
so the trend became intelligent and they
started hiring people they started
moving the things start there and right
so these companies like big giants I
would talk about
Accenture as Wipro in India is their
emphasis they have Capgemini calculus
and all these companies are losing
entrepreneurs so they wanted to talk
about something which they can show the
Train that yes this is what we are
implementing and this will save a lot of
money few of these all companies came up
with a new terminology which was cloud
come to me so when you talk about cloud
as a home solution no I don't think so
cloud is a known solution because the
first product which was a cloud product
was my Microsoft hotmail they say
Microsoft but hot man was the first
product wherein we will use in some
else's infrastructure and still hosting
our domain and everything coming scale
hosting our mail and everything right so
now during the course of time what
happened was that the company started
itching the planes with the new
terminology which was cloud computing so
they used to tell them that we own
everything we want the infrastructure
below and the services we support these
services you just have to pay us for
what you use right so when you talk
about the benefits of cloud computing if
I go and pitch the solution to my client
so I would talk about cost I would talk
about my scalability elasticity I would
talk about my performance I talk about
my speed I talk about enhance
productivity and I talk about
reliability so just to give you a brief
in terms of cost so when I compare the
cost with the other solution the managed
services solution so over there I was
paying for the complete thing I was
paying for the infrastructure I was
praying for the licenses I was paying
for the bandwidth I was paying for the
air-conditioning I was paying for the
motor and everything what we used to use
in data centers and to run the servers
right so when you talk about
cost-effective solution so when you talk
about cloud computing the people just
pay me for what I use
so this is one of the benefits of cloud
computing what we talked about today
when you talk about global scale I will
give you an example in but let's just
take an example of Amazon so right now
from 11th to 14th I believe if I'm
correct meaning Amazon is running a sale
right
during the same time you see lot of
people going on buying stuff if you
compare in a normal scenario or a normal
day they are not so many people getting
on to the site and buying stuff so what
happens is if I have maybe 50 thousand
more people logging on to that site I
need extra servers to support those many
people right now if I talk about a
normal scenario I would have to go ahead
install servers after configure servers
and once the sale is finished I still
would have to keep the server's over
there initially people used to do that
but now if we have something called
cloud so that is something which is not
a good idea right so when you talk about
cloud we have an option where and we can
just go ahead and scale in and steal out
whenever required so when I have the
same Amazon or cart or whatever site say
is running so I can go ahead and scale
up once everything is done I mean once
my sale is finished I can go ahead and
steam down now similarly I can give
another example during the course of
time you know that in the morning you
have more number of people knocking onto
the side in the night you have less
number of people so I can schedule it
right so I can schedule in the morning
Teli evening you have more number of
servers provision and during the course
of time you have less number of service
now talking about the performance so
when you talk about performance we
talked about it's more like corporate
data center what we use as far as much
loud environment is concerned and we
have different locations where these
data centers are placed right so when
you talk about these different locations
where these servers are placed so I can
just go ahead and put a server to my
nearest possible location whereas I'll
give you an example if you talk about
managed services say for example my
client is a US and I'm hosting the
servers maybe in India right so there
would be a lot of bandwidth requirement
lot of performance issues and so on so
in the cloud environment we don't have
these kind of issues with the
performance and with the speed now at
the same time we talk about productivity
so this removes the need of racking or
stacking because I do not have anything
at my end so I don't
infrastructure will be setting up at my
end and I don't need extra bandwidth I
don't need extra people to do that so I
can use that time I can utilize that
time doing something more productive the
disaster recovery and business
continuity is much more easier when you
compare in a cloud solution rather than
a managed solution because when you talk
about a cloud solution a cloud solution
is something which is spread across the
globe
we have so many sites we have so many
backup sites we have so many data
centers we have so many regions which
support the cloud with back so the
redundancy is always in place when you
talk about a normal infrastructure I
talked about managed services or I
talked about something which we used to
work with initially we have to put a lot
of effort you have to put a lot of cost
we have to put a lot of money in setting
up a disaster recovery site where in the
cloud it's much more easier so when we
talk about the flower in the bargain we
talk about reliability so let's just
jump onto the next slide
okay one important thing again if
anybody has any questions please make a
note of it at the end of the session we
will address all those questions right
now talking about what is cloud
computing it is use of remote servers on
the internet to store manage and process
data rather than local server or a local
personal computer what we have right now
computing is the delivery of on-demand
computing resources over the internet on
a pay per use basis now I have two
definitions on this slide if you open
the internet you will see millions and
millions of definitions for cloud
computing on each and every site so we
have different signs we have different
definitions we're in--okay the cloud
computing talks about model where and I
can pay for what I use right so this is
what is the simplest possible definition
what we have for cloud computing and
make sure that you make a note of it or
you just remember it so cloud there's no
rocket science it's something which we
just pay for what we use right so we
don't need to own the infrastructure we
don't need to own the licenses we don't
need to own the bandwidth everything we
use we just pay for what we use
so going further let's just talk about
the deployment method so what we see on
the slide is three different things one
is my public cloud one is my private
cloud and one is my private cloud which
is hosted by a service provider
okay
there is one mode which is my hybrid
cloud so I'll give you an example of
each now let's just take an example of
public Rome so Amazon is there as zeroes
there Google Cloud is there all these
companies host a public cloud that means
if you are an individual you are as an
end-user you can just log into any of
these pay for what you want to use a
different ways of things of course you
can reserve an instance we can just go
ahead and pay for any contracts and so
on so I would not go into that because
this is just a refresher section I'm in
the first session introduction session
to close I want to be pin to technology
for the time being so when you talk
about public cloud these three companies
post public loads so in other words the
idea behind this is that they will host
the infrastructure everything you want
to use you just go ahead and use and
just pay for that so this is something
which we talked about publicly node now
the other type of cloud is my private
cloud now if somebody is aware of VMware
or somebody is aware of Microsoft SCBA
Men which is my system center virtual
machine manager so these are the two
things using which I can go ahead and
host a private flow so the idea behind
this is when you talk about private
cloud
everything is owned by the company so
this is one way of hosting a private
node so everything is owned by the
company so when I say everything is
owned by the company I own the
infrastructure I own the license I am
responsible for the air conditioner
responsible for the data center I am
responsible for each and everything
right so this is one type of private
cloud what I have the other type of
private flowers let me just give you an
example so the idea behind this is that
I have a private cloud I mean I want a
private cloud I go to Amazon that I go
Microsoft I have a guest and I just
allocate few resources for me right so I
mean you can say reserve few resources
for me and so they go ahead and allocate
a set of resources so when they do that
they are basically
allocating those resources from the
public cloud what they host ok so the
idea behind this is these companies host
upon the cloud and then they are
allocating the resources for before
which I pay off front right so nobody
else can access those resources so that
is a private
which is not on brain but is hosted by a
third party right now a company like
Amazon or a company like Microsoft
having a cloud can host a public cloud
can host a pilot clone so that makes it
a hybrid flock so this is the definition
of my hybrid cloud so my Microsoft is an
example of hybrid cloud Amazon is an
example of hybrid cloud Google maybe is
an example IBM SoftLayer is an example
of private flower now the other example
of private cloud which we host a CBMM
System Center Virtual Machine Manager
which is a Microsoft product you can
just go ahead and read about that then
of course from the cloud is pretty
simple Amazon again is an example
Microsoft again is an example Google
again is an example so a lot of examples
so it's a combination of all these
things okay now the question is why
exert now if you talk about my personal
opinion I prefer Azure because it's much
more user friendly and not sure how many
people have joined from the Linux
background or how many people are from
the Windows background but when you talk
about Microsoft Microsoft is known to
make things which are user friendly I
would not talk about the other Microsoft
applications or software's but over the
period of years they have done lot of
enhancements lot of things let's just
take an example for example we would
take an example of Windows right for an
end user if a known user is supposed to
be working on Linux operating system how
difficult his life would try to just
imagine how difficult is life would be
right whereas when you talk about
Windows we just use your mouse keyboard
and all those these are friendly things
Microsoft is more user-friendly when you
compare to the other solutions which are
available in the market these days the
capacities and capabilities of Microsoft
okay
Azure has mean significant advantages
during year so I'm not sure how many
people are aware but is your was ready
he's the first version of SEO which was
for the internal use Microsoft internal
use was released in 2006
it is very recent I would not say in
2012 even by 2012 2013 when people
started using assume Microsoft released
a new portal is your portal I believe if
I'm correct July 2015
and since then they had made significant
improvements in the way they were
delivering the services right now they
have a lot of different services the
portal is more user friendly they a lot
of things what I put out there in
building the portal and you can do so
I'll show you few of the examples as we
go for them now it now offers a set of
features and capabilities far surprising
its competitors right so there is a
comparison online which is available
what Microsoft can deliver and what
Amazon and Google Cloud can deliver I
always take an example of only Amazon
and Google Cloud and compare it with
Azure because these are the big players
right there are thousands of small pairs
which are available to market these days
but I just take example of big one so
these are few examples now just to give
you a brief everything on the internet
I'm talking about websites are is based
right and is this is a Microsoft product
so enough day when you talk about past
services example I can give you in here
is app services which is basically
people having the same capability of an
is-7 so I mean of course it's better so
when you compare somebody using a
Microsoft product and you would like to
go ahead and move for cloud solution
would like to definitely go with a
Microsoft product itself so pass
capabilities are net compatibility
because it is based on is so yes dotnet
compatibility is great because dotnet is
Microsoft thing then you talk about my
security offerings some people although
do consider
Amazon better than this but then yes
there are a lot of improvements which
have been done during the course of time
I guess somebody has a question give me
one quick let me just check I would
request everybody it's very difficult to
answer everyone please make an order for
the questions and we will address all
the questions with the Q&amp;amp;A room ok I
hope everybody's with me okay then you
have hybrid solutions for seamless cloud
connectivity which are great when you
compare it with other things because
being Microsoft again
then you have integrated environment
junk learning curve now I hope everybody
has gone through some of the other
Microsoft failings
during the course of their career right
and you know that Microsoft gives you
the best courses which are available in
the market right I mean
try to understand let's just compare AWS
because I train on AWS also so finding a
resource over the internet for AWS is
much more difficult finding a resource
online which is Microsoft of course
right so there are many things which we
can talk about but let's just keep it
simple and then we talk about the
enterprise agreement advantage so
somebody has a volume licensing contract
with Microsoft that means they are
eligible for internal use licenses and
only use licenses talks about Windows 7
licenses Windows 10 licenses server
operating system licenses so that should
clear case what happens is Microsoft
gives you free licenses for i0 also I
would not say free but then during the
initial time it's it's kind of free
right so once we move to the cloud
services and you comfortable with each
and everything moving to the cloud and
all those things so I mean it's it's
always like they'll make you use this
service and once you comfortable with
using that service then you can go ahead
and decide whether you would like fYI
Microsoft gives you 30 days free trial
so in case you would like to go ahead
and check how exactly is your works so
you can sign up for a free is your trial
in which you would get thirty thousand
three hundred rupees in an rupees or
approximately two hundred dollars for
spending and learning easier so you can
just go ahead and do that now when you
talk about current or trends now during
the course of time I did read somewhere
the information maybe not also resided
treated somewhere in the blog that
Microsoft has acquired close to one
hundred nine percent of the market it's
not that they acquired the market from
other cloud players and the main one
being Amazon but then the idea is that
lot of things going on lot of people
have adapted cloud so Microsoft is
selling their solutions also and then of
course few people would like to go ahead
and move to Microsoft because Microsoft
is much more cheaper the best example I
can give this Flipkart I'm sure a lot of
people on this particular session would
be aware of flip card so flip card
around three months back move to Azure
so you can just imagine the amount of
photo means they would have in SEO right
ok now talking about what is easier
okay so Microsoft SEO is a growing
collection of integrated cloud services
three services we talk about one is SAS
one is fast one is is is is
infrastructure-as-a-service
PS is a platform or product as a service
and Sasa's software as a service so
we'll talk about during the course of
time what these services are and what
are the benefits or the drawbacks should
you move to these services if we're
having in our current infrastructure and
Marvin training or not okay so we will
talk about all these things as we go now
Microsoft Azure is a growing collection
of integral cloud services which
developers and IT professionals used to
build deploy and manage applications
through our global network of data
centers so when you talk about this a
lot of different locations of Microsoft
Azure gain acceptance which we have in
India itself we have three locations one
is in Pune one is in Mumbai and one is
actually their new locations coming up
every now and then I believe they have
new locations recently started in Korea
also not north of course the South one
okay so let's just see more options I
mean as far as my SEO is concerned so
now when you talk about different
domains in Azure so we talked about
compute we talked about storage they
talked about my networking and content
delivery sealians and we talked about
migration helping people to move through
the cloud then we talked about security
and identity compliance so in here we
talked about Active Directory as a
service how do you use Active Directory
our service and integrate that with
office 365 so these are the examples we
talked about in messaging which is my
notification so let's just try to
understand what Computers Computers my
virtual machines which I can create in
my SEO require that you have databases
so I can talk about my sequel because
when you talk about there are this here
being a Microsoft product we would only
talk about sequel you will not talk
about maybe my sequel or Oracle so
majorly Microsoft supports and sequel
runs best when you talk about it so then
we have CBN's management tool so a lot
of different domains are available as
far as my SEO is concerned so we will
talk about that now when we talk about
the compute domain building level
products which
dictates and determines the execution of
an application in the ACO black sock so
when you talk about my computer it talks
about my CP it talks about my memory so
how much memory you want to assign how
much you wanna say go virtual machine so
that it can execute or maybe you can say
processing ok simpler terms now talking
about cloud services so a lot of
different services what we have you see
my virtual machine you see my VM scale
sets then you have my as your containers
container registry
now you guys would have a question what
is your container
what is container its history so this
particular session is not for me to
explain in this because we just have one
more and a half hours we don't have
complete time otherwise it would have
been a pleasure to explain you what is
your container rich history is what VM
scale set is what is a cloud service and
so on
ok now talking about the compute
services you see virtual machine you see
my virtual machine scale sites you see
my container so just to give you a brief
virtual machine it's just a VM what I
create now when you talk about is there
a lot of different concepts which we'll
come across during the course of time so
what your machine is just like my
physical machine it's running on a
hypervisor now for hypervisor you would
like to go ahead understand what is the
hypervisor I'm sure a lot of people on
the session understand what hypervisor
well in case you need more details so
there's a course which we run for
Microsoft trainings I'm sorry in
Microsoft so you can just go ahead and
go through that particular course which
talks about what is the hypervisor and
so on then you have my skill sets so
this talks about auto-scaling I was
giving an example of scaling and scaling
out so this talks for auto scaling then
you talk about my container service so
this is basically for hosting these
solutions which are optimized for Israel
which do not require to interact with
the operating system so we can talk
about that as I said when we do the
complete course then you have the
container registry which talks about the
images across all different types of
azure deployment so I mean if an
application is to be deployed in the
container which uses registry so we
talked about container is this thing
wherein you can just go ahead and save
the information then you have functions
which talks about writing codes
regardless of infrastructure and
creation of my servers translate with
that then
my batch hundreds of virtual machines
and how do you go ahead and scale those
then you talk about stage data and
execute compute pipelines on those
virtual machines again then I have my
service fabric so this is something
which simplifies my Microsoft with based
application deployment a lifecycle
management and this helps me to deliver
low latency performance and efficiency
are at a massive level right then you
have a cloud service so when you talk
about cloud services this focuses on
apps not on hardware so I'll give you an
example so the idea behind this is I
need sequel I need is to run a service
right so I can just go ahead and bundle
few VMs which will act as a cloud
service right and I will have my is
running which will deliver my front end
and I have my sequel running which will
deliver my back end so this is what my
cloud services are now talking about the
networking lets us try to understand
what exactly networking means first of
all now giving you a very basic example
if you talk about your home
infrastructure right so your home
network so everybody I'm sure everybody
has internet because without the
internet first of all there is no life
the second thing is you will not be able
to log into this particular webinar so I
believe everybody has internet and when
you talk about intimacy you might be
using a laptop or a desktop so in that
particular scenario what happens is when
you talk about connecting using a phone
or maybe connect a laptop or a desktop
so you need to connect it to the router
so the internet service provider gives
you a router where in the internet line
is terminated and all your internal
machines internal machines I would say
is the laptop and the best of tools in
which you are connecting would get an IP
address right so I mean in simpler terms
one trying to say is that all the
machines which require to be connected
to the Internet are combined or joined
together using this router now initially
we had switch before that we used to
talk about hubs right so when you talk
about the networking power as far as my
zero is concerned we talked about few
things where do how do I go ahead and
join these virtual machines together and
how would I go ahead and join these fast
services with iea services and so on so
there are things which
can talk about as far as my easier is
concerned so when we talk about that we
talk about something called Bennett's
okay then we talk about something called
my load balancer because of course you
need to run the service on two parallel
machines if the service is not running
on two parallel machines it's very
difficult for you to go ahead and make
sure that you have 100% availability for
that particular application all the time
so we talked about my load balancers now
I also can talk about my traffic
managers where different people are
logging on from different locations
right so if the user is logging on from
us you should be redirected to a server
in us and that should be load balanced
right so we can talk about traffic
manager now if you want a direct
connection with the SEO clowns in other
words I am a company a I go to Microsoft
I tell them please host my private cloud
they host my private cloud and they go
ahead and set up direct connection to my
network so that I can go ahead and
access that cloud as my local machine so
they set up I Express route okay now if
I want to go ahead and manage my cloud
using the VPN if I talk about managing
my cloud so how do I go ahead and
connect to the cloud to manage the
different services running the clouds
right maybe okay
so when you talk about the networking
domain it's a very huge thing and it's
very important for everybody to
understand how networking works as far
as my SEO is concerned right now one
very good thing with Microsoft is that
they give you all the details how these
things work right now if you go for an
Amazon training in the Amazon training
what happens is they'll just tell you
that this is supposed to work okay but
how many come to Microsoft the best part
is they'll tell you this is how it is
supposed to work and why this is
supposed to work this way okay then you
have my networking domain so I named
different things
I have Express route virtual network
load balancer application gateway which
I did not talk about but then again when
we have a training full five-day session
or maybe of the weekend session so we'll
talk about this traffic manager sealians
content delivery network the best
example I can give you for contain
delivery network is my youtube ok so we
have pups in each and every location
we have one serve on which the content
is loaded so on the box what happens is
if somebody is requesting for the
content they contain from the main
server is downloaded to the pop from
that particular location it is delivered
to my headline so I mean again maybe you
don't understand what cbn is right now
but during the course of time when we
have the full session so probably we'll
get more information of what's alienness
and in case you want to go ahead and
search yourself or a CDN is the best
example is YouTube and I hope everybody
watches YouTube okay so these are the
different definitions so this is virtual
network performs my network isolation
and segmentation node balancing so this
is for load balancing different
applications which we have running in
the environment then you have the
application gateway so this is my
virtual appliance providing the
application delivery controller as a
service then you have my SEO DNS so
first of all DNS is my domain name
service so every website has an IP
address attached to it so the idea is
every website is running on a computer
which has an IP address so how we go
ahead and reach to that particular IP
addresses my domain name so we can talk
about much more not just giving you a
small example but then we have time
constraints so again I would love to
speak on this when we have full session
then you talk about the content delivery
network I gave an example of lutein then
you have my VPN gateway so this is in
case you want to go ahead and finish
through my cloud services on the
Microsoft Network or on my cloud so I
would go ahead and use my VPN gateway to
connect to the cloud service traffic
manager is for geographical or in
distributing traffic using the different
geographical locations then you have
Express route so this is my direct
connection to my Microsoft datacenter
from my on track then you have my
storage domain so when you talk about my
storage domain so we talked about four
types of storage in SEO one is my blob
storage where I mean you can save your
phd's the VMS which are running in your
cloud then you have your file storage
where you can save your files then you
have my table storage and then you have
my queue storage so these are the four
types of storages which is supported by
Acer so it's at Rao's own storage
solution
for modern applications that relies on
durability availability and scalability
to meet customers then you talk about
massively scalable so you can store the
information it's a huge amount of data
which can go on that particular story
then you talk about elastic elastic
means so whatever you need you can just
go ahead and request for more when
you're done you can delete the files and
we'll go ahead and just start charging
you for what you are using and has Auto
partitioning systems so you can just go
ahead and automatically load bad data
based upon the traffic so you see this
is what I was talking about blog queue
file table so table is more like my data
base blob is my raw storage queue is my
messaging storage and then you have my
file storage so this is for my files and
here is a small brief definition of each
everything so you have belong as your
blob storage your service that stores
unstructured data in the cloud as object
so this is your raw storage then you
have my cue storage the stores my queues
for messaging systems orbit cloud then
you have file storage so the stores my
file and this is SMB based I knew as
your portal uses sm e 3.0 it supports
3.0 and the final second stone on that
and then you have my table storage so
this is my storage in which you can same
unstructured data because these
structured data has a schema so this one
does not okay then you have web and
mobile services so basically this what
you see on the screen is a part of pass
paas and we talked about something
called app services wherein we can go in
very different applications we can go
ahead and put different mobile apps so
basically these are web apps these are
not mobile apps but they're something
which is configured and is compatible
with my mobile devices then you have my
API apps you have my logic apps then you
have my event hub which is used for
events then you have my notification hub
and then you have my search so these are
the services which are there for my
mobile and web and this as I said is a
part of my pass so let's jump on to the
next slide so and I mean basically try
to understand what web apps
now get giving an example generally if
you want to host a website you host a
website on either is server or an Apache
server so when you talk about a cloud
solution we talk about something called
paas pass all right so when you talk
about pass Microsoft gives you two types
rather three types of services one is my
app services which is for my websites
then you have sequel databases which is
used for hosting when sequel services
and then the other one is my active
directory in the cloud right so that is
for a hosting an active data clean bath
right so when you talk about my web apps
using Web Apps you can host a website in
the cloud mobile app and web app is same
but this is optimized for mobile devices
then you have my API app so this app is
my service which supports different API
to the cloud and then you have my logic
apps so this logic apps basically
provided me to simplify and integrate my
scalable integration and workflows in
the cloud then you have my notification
app so notification happens used for
sending different notifications just
like you have notifications in your
mobile apps so in here also we have my
notification app using which you can go
ahead and send notifications on your
websites immediately mobile services
site which you run on the isÃ¨re
environment then you have event hubs
which is nothing but a collection of
different events which can be stored
over there let me have my it's your
search so this is the cloud-based search
as a service solution that delegates
server and infrastructure management to
Microsoft so you give everything to
Microsoft that you're responsible for
doing this and then I have my Azure
sequel database of course you have two
options like everybody knows you can
host database you can just go ahead and
deploy IBM once you deploy a beam you
can install sequence ourselves on that
once you install sequel services you can
use that as a database but if you don't
only use that as a database you can use
my SEO Unida based services which is a
part of pass so let's just talk about
that in this we have my sequel databases
I hope everybody understands for a
sequel databases so it's a relational
database service which is based on
Microsoft sequel database server so the
sequel server which Microsoft Azure use
2012 right so in case you would like to
make a note of it so they use 2012 then
you have something called document DB so
this is a fully managed no sequel
database servers will for fast and
predictable performance high
availability so this is something which
again not many people work with but then
yes it's there now the other one is
Redis cache so this is more like a cache
which is basically used for sorting the
information which is available on the
right so the first thing what we talked
about when we talked about compute well
we talked about my virtual machine sets
so that was a part of I guess this is
the power of P AAS now if I am hosting a
complete solution and the end user is
getting the software so then I talked
about SAS then you talk about the
enterprise integration services so in
this we talked about two things one is
my service bus and the other one is my
sequel server stretch database so
service bus talks about the s your
service bus which is a reliable
information delivery service which is
kind of a broker between the third party
communication which happens with the
Azure and the other one is my sequel
server stretch debase so stretch
database migrates your cool data
transparently and secures it to the
Microsoft Azure data center now it
depends whether you want to use it again
these are my enterprise integration
services and they are additional to IAS
NPS further you have security and
identity services when we talk about my
Azure Active Directory I give an example
of Azure Active Directory previously
then you talked about my multi-factor
authentication so multi-factor
authentication I can give you an example
generally what happens is when you log
on to a website so few websites you get
an OTP right and then you are able to
log into the website once you put on the
OTP right so multi-factor authentication
is for that so we talked about security
and identity services so we talked about
all these things for you see on the
screen
q1 sales all the information related to
your storage in a vault right so they
have your primary and secondary keys who
access the information from the storage
and you have my is your Active Directory
so thus talks about
and cloud-based directly so not somehow
many people understand Active Directory
but it's it's kind of if you're working
in an organization it's one of the most
important part of the organization so
it's it's more like a security boundary
where in all the resources of your
organization of your enterprise lies and
you can just go ahead and access the
resources based upon the access level
which is assigned to that now you can
move this from your own pen to the cloud
and use it as a service so let me talk
about is your Active Directory so as
your Active Directory is also what you
call part of passes pas right then you
have my is your it will be to see this
is again a part of pass and then you
have ad domain services this is again a
part of pass multi-factor authentication
rather is also part of us I'm sorry
as your ad domain services is not a part
of pass but it's a part of I a s so in
this particular case what happens is you
have one domain controller on them you
have a domain controller running in the
cloud and you need to have a connection
between the cloud and the on-prem so you
need to have either I Express now or a
VPN connection between these two sites
and you have a full-blown domain
controller running over there in the
cloud which is basically available for
you local also so this is what we have
as far as my IT services is your ad
services are concerned so as your Active
Directory and as your ad b2c is a part
of services whether it's already serves
as a part of ILs
okay then you have monitoring and
management services when we talk about
my Traffic Manager we talked about
automation we talked about a RN and then
you talk about the is your book okay
so traffic manager we did talk about as
far as my is your portal is constrained
so we talked about how do I go ahead and
manage my resources how do I go ahead
and monitor my resources so this is
something which I will show you in a 10
then you have my resource manager so erm
is something which is new previously we
were not using air and as I said that is
your face iron and developed a new
portion which was lying at night from
July of 2015 so this photo was based on
erm so the resource manager will be call
it as your resource furniture and there
are lot of differences between the older
somebody has seen the older portal or is
watching on the older portal so you will
see the difference there's a huge
difference so there are things old
portal new portal but again our time
does not permit permits us to discuss on
the portal and unimportant
so let's just skip this for the time
being now as far as my automation is
concerned there's something called ms as
far as this is concerned this talks
about how do I go ahead and create run
books and automate the process now let's
just square then you try to understand
this fourth an example now previously
what used to happen was when a developer
needs in machine so you used to request
a machine and the request will go to his
manager the manager will approve the
request once the request is approved
then it will go to a system admin once
the machine is configured then the
information goes to somebody who will
patch the machine install the antivirus
software and love different things so
this whole process used to take ten days
okay now with Azure and with automation
in place we can do this maybe in three
hours
valances try to design and understand of
slow charge developer would request a
machine the information is sent via
email to his manager the manager
approves as soon as the manager approves
the information is passed across to be a
CEO pocket where the provisioning is
done provisioning of the VMs down right
at the same time it the manager rejects
it so the information is sent back to
the user that your manager has rejected
and I cannot just go ahead and give you
a machine so this whole process can be
automated using something called
flowcharts which we can design I mean we
call them run books of course as you see
written on the screen so we'll talk
about that as we go we'll just have to
check now talking about the pricing so
as your pricing talks about pay as you
go model so there's a reseller pricing
which comes in picture then there is
something called a world in licensing
pricing which comes in picture so when
you talk about is your is your would you
just like if you remember I am not sure
how many people have more than
fifteen years of experience so the
reason I'm saying that is because if you
have 15 years of experience you're quite
old enough to understand what I'm saying
because when I was small I used to go to
an internet cafe and I used to play them
tengu piece for using the internet for
an hour or so right so there works on
the same phone so if you're using that
for an hour you just go ahead and pay
Microsoft for a not then you have my
result instances so in case I equal
Microsoft tell them that I need these
many machines for an ear so Microsoft
will say yes that we will go ahead and
reserve these many instances for any air
you pay us off front cost and of course
there's a lot of saving involved in that
I mean we pay 75% less amount when we
just go ahead and pay off front for an
ear okay
now talking about dinner let's just jump
on to a demo or just go ahead and log
onto the portal first of all
I'll show you both the portraits let's
talk about both the collectors because I
have been talking about all the bottle
on your portal and you might be thinking
about what the older portal is and what
is my portal and so let's just talk
about
so right now I'm just going ahead and
opening onto the new portal and this is
my ID so I'm a Microsoft certified
trainer and so I get a lot of money from
Microsoft every month just friend on
this end to test this of course not a
lot of money but yes I get someone of
money from Microsoft to check this ok so
this is how your photo looks like what
you see in here is my dashboard then you
have my Bien's you have my virtual
network you have my storage so you see I
have two subscriptions both are for my
trainer account and then I have one
pay-as-you-go so you might be thinking
where is the subscription so this is
kind of for the time being you can just
say it's the level of access what we get
to get your machines and so on so a lot
of things out there they have my virtual
networks I have my storage accounts I
have my sequel server resource group app
services connexes go ahead and build a
website using app services so I don't
have anything right now so I'll just go
ahead and create a new app service so if
you remember in the slide there were two
things one is website and then there was
a mobile site so this is my mobile app
of course you cannot build a mobile app
in here so somebody thinking that yes I
can now do wonders with this now you can
just build ecosystem wherein you can put
everything of that so let's just talk
about this app services so I'll create
an app service environment so this is
basically my website
look so this is any random meaning of
course it should be unique so basically
it's trying to figure out if this name
has been given to anybody or not if this
name is not given to anybody it's been
going show me a green mark over there
what you see the application in sight is
for application monitoring I'm not sure
how many people are aware of something
called app dynamics which was recently
purchased by Cisco if I'm correct okay
so I go with this I will leave
everything to default so right now then
I click on create website so it is just
going ahead and trying to build a
website for me so this is my web app so
this is a part of pass so this is
currently in progress so we'll wait for
one or two minutes
you
okay
so let's just jump onto this so I have
this now this is my website now anybody
and everybody on this call can open this
website so I have some templates in here
so I'm trying to build my website now
try to understand what used to happen
initially so initially I had to build a
Windows server then I had to install a
is on top of it once I installed is I
had to configure it so that can be
accessed from an external source right
and after everything is done I had to go
ahead and then install the website over
there okay let's just check where do we
have this or where can i download it
from let me just go to a different site
because I believe all this is junk I
guess this should work so I have a 5lb
template that's currently downloading
that so should take some time and once
this is done I can use a FTP program to
upload it so while this is running while
this is downloading let's just go ahead
and do something else let's just go
ahead and build our first we already
have fuel running in here okay it's done
I guess yeah okay so my web site is done
it's downloaded so let's just open my
FTP
try to rock a little bad okay so let me
just go to my portal some people might
be thinking more exactly I'm doing I'm
basically building a website so you can
imagine how much time it takes to build
a website now so I don't have to go
ahead and install a machine I don't have
to go ahead and install is I can just
simply come in here and build my website
so this is my FTP link and this is my
username and I don't remember the
password so I will just quickly reset
the password
it says the name isn't loose
so let's just check this one I guess
I am sure this one would not be loose so
it's resetting my FTP credentials and
once it's done let's just go in here
copy that again and check
you
okay let's just check so it's going
ahead and trying to connect so I am
already connected I guess yeah okay so I
go to my site and then I go to my route
so if you're not understanding what this
is I'm sure after attending one course
you will be able to get what I'm doing
but if somebody is a web developer so
you will be able to understand what I'm
doing so right now I'm using my FTP file
and uploading the files which you see
here and once my files are uploaded I
will go ahead and open the site and show
you what we see over there so it may
take maybe I guess three or four minutes
so while this is running let's just jump
on to creating a VM and we use more than
one how do I go out and create so for
that I could watching machine I go to
add and what you see is my marketplace
so you have oh is it complete yeah okay
all right so have my Windows server
which is what I need I will create one
Linux machine also intuitive so I'm my
2008
I have 2012 2016 if you want Windows 10
machine Windows 7 machine that is also
possible in the cloud if you plan on to
deliver those machines using VDI but for
the time being I'll just choose Windows
2008 in then I click on home this is my
test clean em - one so you want to use
SSD or HDD so I guess I will go with HPD
this is my username
so I prefer using my u-turn on all this
that makes sense and if somebody
understands what is the resource group
good if you don't that's also ok because
you I believe few people might be having
knowledge on what is your s few people
might be very new ok let's just see
right so these are my plans and this is
what I will be charged in case I use it
for a month still loading the pricing so
go with basic because this is the
cheapest possible plan this is somewhere
around 885 Indian rupees 885 this is per
month so this includes my 1 cor this
includes 0.75 of memory one disk 300 I
ops and Windows 2000 edge license so you
see it's pretty cheap so I say no so you
can I I'll just choose yes so if you're
familiar with this good if you're not
probably then you have to attend the
company session so it will come okay and
I have my windows 2008 finish to session
okay so it's the point of view which you
see in here and in the meanwhile the
good thing is that my website has been
uploaded so let's just browse it and see
you
okay so let's just check so if you
remember this is what we downloaded and
anybody wants to see this can open this
PW local as your website its life now
there are of questions which might be
coming up if I have to update this how
do we do it
what do we do so everything is planned I
mean everything has way of doing those
things so again we don't have enough
time to discuss all that but still yes
there is a way of updating the website
in case you want okay so once this is
done my website is done and we can
access it as you did see from anywhere
now let's just go ahead and get another
machine which will be a Linux machine so
I guess I will go ahead and get a bun to
machine and this is my LTS long term
support so I would be getting machine
for my Linux but 60-knot Oh for
you
so I type in the password
when I choose an existing resourceful so
again it will asked me where do I need
to save the files and so on and of
course the pricing so you choose the
same one cheapest possible one because
again this is just for testing so have
this 885 ina and I will go by default so
no fancy stuff just go by default to
come up k and we are done so you see how
easy it is to deploy the things to
manage the things and so on so this will
take maybe 10 minutes or so I think
let's just
so it's stopped so this is the one which
I created previously then you have one
running so this is fine test machine
then I created one test VM one which is
creating and go wait for another 1
minute or so and we'll have the fourth
one
you
okay so while this is running let's just
open the slide and check what all things
are left okay
certifications I have already talked
about certifications but just to give
you a brief we have M CSA which includes
two certifications so if you're doing
this you can do this as a developer so
that is seven zero five thirty two then
if you want to do it for an
infrastructure engineer you have seven
zero five double three and if you want
to go ahead and work on this for maybe
two years and then you would like to go
ahead and do an architecting
certification that's seven zero five
three four so these are the three
certifications which are available so
once you do one that makes you a mCP
once you do two which is developing and
implementing that makes you a MCS a and
once you do all three that makes you and
CSD so these are these certifications
which are available as far as this is
concerned so this was my last slide and
I hope it was good to have some
knowledge on what s your s and how it
works and their more courses which you
can get more detailed overview or maybe
more detailed information of how this
works now let's just jump onto the
portal and see so this is my fourth
machine so we have to create it so these
two are the ones which we created so
this one is my Windows machine this one
is my Linux machine okay so this will
takes some time I guess maybe another
10-15 minutes or so and once this is
done I will be able to add you to it or
connect to it so if you wanna see how do
I connect to it so just open this
connect okay accesses tonight I guess my
ID does not have access from this so
there's another way of doing it maybe if
they have some problem with the portal
also because every now and then they
have more officials with the portal
because they are still working on this
okay this is the public IP using which I
can access it so let me just copy this
and then
open my atom or desktop and I guess this
is the same idea can just double check
yeah this is the same idea so just I
guess I might have connected this
machine previous
okay so this is my machine which is
running on the cloud and I can access it
from everywhere you see this oh there's
the new updates install office so I
choose the second one so I have this one
CPU VCU 1.7 gig seven five gigs of
memory 2008 release two datacenter
Edition and Windows it's activated so if
I want to go ahead and install is on
this to make this Web Summit so I can do
that or I wanna install sequel for
sequel of course you have less amount of
memory so I have to go ahead and add
more memory so if I go ahead and edit
this I can simply go to the portal which
you see in here and access my machine
and then go ahead and what you call
change the size so if you want to change
the size you go to size and you have an
option to select a new one
of course I don't wanna do that because
it will cost me more money but still you
can do that from so let's just check
what happened to our deployment
okay one succeeded which is this this is
a Linux VM so of course it works much
more faster I mean the deployment is
much more faster we have mine the next
VM and then the other one is still good
one so these are few things which I
wanted to show you now the last thing
for the day before the end is the Q&amp;amp;A
the question-and-answer session which we
have now let's just start with questions
first and then I'll try to answer so
just open this and let me just read the
questions where which people have okay I
hope I answered the certification part
okay when does the course start and I
assume that you are the instructor so
probably you'll have to check the
schedule on the website so I would
appreciate if you can just go ahead and
check the schedule on the website then
does this course prepare you for all the
three certifications to know for all the
three certifications you have three
different courses one as I said is for
developers one is for the infrastructure
engineers and there is one for
architecting architecting is majorly
three days so eight hours each you can
calculate it then the other ones are 40
hours each five days and five days if
you do it at a stretch yeah as far as
the beginner is concerned this course is
for the people who are starting from the
scratch okay so this is for the
beginners SV has an option for archive
storage were similar here yes we have an
option for archive storage in here also
for which of course you're charged less
for being as your developer one must
have dotnet skills yes you should have
dotnet skills because there are lot of
things using which we basically use it
does this Europe has all database
services like AWS which supports to be
much all our DBMS yes not all because as
your is majorly for sequel okay so we
would concentrate on the sequel when we
talk about SEO
now just to answer an L also lot of
applications which do not run on AWS run
perfectly fine on SEO the reason is
because there are applications which are
not paid based right there are locations
which are requiring sequels so they work
good on easier when you compare it with
AWS
what about Google next so Google is
still building their cloud it's not that
matured
if you want to go ahead and get a copy
of this class you can log on to the
website and you'll see the recording
over there then you have Vincent Vincent
wants to know see when you talk about
security I I'm not sure it's it's very
broad term actually when you say how
does security work in is your compared
to AWS so it's so many broad term so
probably you'll have to go ahead and ask
more specific questions
now how automation works in easier so
it's inbuilt first of all so there is
one way of working with automation on
SEO the other one is you can go and buy
a separate product which is Microsoft
who MST's yeah Microsoft operations
management so this is what I was not
able to recall so the automation works
with OMS and then there is also an
automation account which I will shown
you in here so if you want to see this
so we can create run books and the
automation account but if you want go
ahead and do more things so you can go
with operations management so you can
integrate this with your flow so if you
want to talk about this this is a
separate product all together so you
need to buy it separately there is a
separate licensing with this so
approximately 900 one is the most
expensive one which you can use which
talks about automation insights and
latex security in compliance and then it
talks about protection and recovery so
this is again 1800 so this talks about
backing up recovery and so on so this is
a separate product so this is our
automation works have you seen any
client hosting their data warehouse
system is your if yes what is the
performance impact when compared to one
print servers see when you talk about
data warehousing server systems there
are lot of case studies which you can
find over the internet that people
aren't using it for sure
I can follow your case study in case you
want just mention your email id here in
the chat some tools like spark and
airflow don't work on Windows should I
choose Linux on a Zune yes see you can
choose Linux of Israel nobody's stopping
you to use Linux unless your lot of
people still run in reading scenario
only sequel server is there any version
of Hadoop from Microsoft there is no
version from micro
so for a new but yes you have a hydra
cluster which you can build it in here
so if you want to see that I will show
it to you so you have my HD cluster so
you can build the Hadoop cluster in here
without any problems okay then I have AI
mix both AWS and Azure when I'm
architecting some applications yes you
can but what happens is if you are doing
an AWS one thing I want to tell
everybody please never in life and
compare AWS in Azure these two are
different companies have different
products because I have delivered a lot
of trainings on Azure I have delivered a
lot of trainings from AWS when I go to
AWS training people start comparing it
at least with easier when I go for is
your trainings people start comparing as
your with AWS now when you do that you
are basically not understanding the
concept of the technology both are
different as there is also cloud
solution introduces also cloud solution
but there are different companies they
work on a different platform if you talk
about Microsoft the underlying layer of
Microsoft platform is hyper whereas the
underlined layer of AWS is camiÃ³n right
so there are two different things so you
should never left and compare these two
things do we need to know PowerShell yes
we need to know PowerShell if you know
PowerShell your life becomes much more
easier and if you see this there's a
Microsoft PowerShell version in here
which is in beta so they have not
released it fully so you have to go
ahead and create a storage account I
don't want to do that right now because
then network I'll have to check one of
things just create it in here so this is
my cloud shell ok and you can run the
PowerShell of course so you see this
it's covering soon as I said it's in
preview so you'll select PowerShell and
do all those things in here Williams
I'll show you their templates for a lot
of things so you have this so these are
my templates so it might be a
possibility that you have a template
build by default of the apps you can use
the eraser
okay so I guess these are the questions
what we have if anybody has any
questions probably you can ask before we
end for today okay so I guess we have
taken almost all the questions at least
99% of them right in case you want go
