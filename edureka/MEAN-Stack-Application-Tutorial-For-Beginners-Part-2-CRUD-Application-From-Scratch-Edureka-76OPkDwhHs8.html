welcome to this second part of mean
stock crud application tutorial that is
the ninth video of this Enriquez free
angular course for a beginner now in the
previous part we already built or
completed our backend codes there we
created a server using node and Express
and finally tested our API is for all
the crud operation using postman utility
now in this video what we're gonna do we
gonna cover our front-end part that is
the angular part and then finally we
will be having our fully functional
website or web application so let's go
ahead and get started with our
development process so open my text
dieter so this is the Brad back-end part
the folder that we have created in the
previous part where we created this
schema and similarly we created this
entry dot JS file where the execution
begins in your back-end class and we
also created all the abs with respect to
different different crud operation that
has get post put and eat all right so
let's start with our front-end
application now let me give you an
overview what we are trying to do in our
front head application what we'll do
we'll have a component that will have a
form where a user can enter or add a new
item to the database second thing that
we want we want to show the list of item
the shopping items and also we want the
edit and delete functionalities over
there using buttons so that's what we
want over there so for that let's go
ahead and close all these tabs with
respect to our back-end codes and we'll
open the angular project this is the
angular project guys that we have
generated and we will be working inside
the app folder as you know so now what
we want to do is we want to generate a
component so I'm going to open the
terminal and then we're gonna go ahead
with the NGC like come on that is ng g
component G for generate and I'm going
to name the component as shopping item
now we are in the wrong list because we
are in the parent directory so we're
gonna go ahead inside the angular
project directory and then we gonna
issue the command ng g component
and then go ahead with shopping item so
this will generate the component for me
so as you can see we have all the files
being generated over here and this is
the folder regarding that shopping item
company now in this complaint we will be
having forms we'll be having a list
where all the shopping items will be
displayed and we'll be having two
buttons one for editing that particular
item whatever that has been entered by
the user and second one to delete an
item from the list and also what we need
we need a data service class where we
will be putting all those data access
logic so that whenever we make a call
from our component for adding a new item
that particular method that is defined
in our data service class will be
invoked or will be executed that will
make the API call to our back-end
service and finally that particular item
will be added to our database so let's
go ahead and create our service class so
we'll gonna go ahead with ng G service
and name it as theta because we'll be
working around data access logic only
now apart from that what I need is I
need a model for my items so I'm gonna
go ahead and create a file called as
item dot TS alright and here I'm gonna
go ahead with export class item and then
I'm gonna put all this property with
respect to my item that I have so we
have three properties that is one is the
name of the item the second one is the
quantity and the third one is whether
the item has been bought or not that is
the boolean one besides that we also
have one ID as a property that has been
generated by our MongoDB so whenever we
are retrieving data we can use that ID
property in order to identify a
particular object or an item so let's go
ahead and create all those property so
I'm gonna go ahead with optional ID
property because we won't be or a user
won't be entering this particular field
and then we need item name which will be
of type string then we need item
quantity which will be of type number
then we need item bot which is a boolean
value all right now let's get back to
our component now here what we want we
want a form
initially and we want a property to
store the list of items that is there in
our database so before that let me
import the model items slash item all
right
so let's see whether I think we have
created item in the wrong folder
we will in the tree view we will put it
inside our app folder
now it's working your item class and we
have imported it successfully now what
we need we need to create a property
named a shopping item list so this will
contain the list of the items it will be
of type item basically an area and we'll
initialize it with an empty list as of
now now next thing that we need is we
need method that will be called in order
to fetch the list from our database so
let's go ahead and do that so we'll say
get items all right and this will this
method will basically call your method
that is there in your data service class
in all professor lists so let's say to
do later and let's head towards our
service class now since we'll be working
around form an HTTP module so we need to
import these two modules so let's go
back to our AB dot module file and here
we need to import HTTP module from at
the rate angular slash HTTP also we need
to import forms module
forms and then what we need to do is we
need to put it inside our imports iris
let's copy this and we have stated be
model over here and similarly we have
forms model over here all right now
let's get back to our data service class
now here we need to import HTTP from our
HTTP package in order to get access to
all those HTTP methods and besides that
we also need classes such as response
and headers so let's go ahead and import
those so we'll say HTTP and then we need
response then we need headers from at
the rate angular slash HTTP now we need
to go ahead with dependency injection so
as to create an instance of HTTP so
let's say private HTTP of type HTTP all
right now let's go ahead and create a
method called as get shopping items this
will be used to fetch data from our
back-end so we'll say return so
basically we'll be returning the rest of
that items so say return this thought
SCTP dot get and here we're going to
pass the URL to which the call will be
made the API route so I'm gonna say HTTP
localhost 3000 slash API slash items so
in fact let's do one thing let's get
back to our back-end code and if you
check out the route or chairs file you
can see that we had this particular
route forget method so that is what we
are trying to do here we are trying to
make the call to this that particular
API for retrieving the list of items now
we need to map the response as J'son so
let's go ahead and do that map press for
a start chasing now here we are getting
an error as property map does not exist
because we haven't imported the reactive
chairs operator so let's go ahead and do
that so we'll say import rxjs slash add
slash operator slash map alright
now as you can see the error has been
resolved now this is the method that is
there in your data service class then
what we'll do we'll be injecting this
particular service to our component and
from there we're gonna make call to this
particular method for accessing the list
of item or for retrieving the list of it
so far now let's go ahead and create one
more method over here for adding a new
item to our list so let's say we're
gonna have a method called as ad
shopping item and we're gonna receive a
new item from our form so let's put it
over there and here we need headers to
send requests off and then we need to
append the content type so let's say
header start up end and here we're gonna
have content type which will be of type
application slash a zone now let's go
ahead and make the call
the EPA calls we're gonna say this dot
SCTP dot post as you know the post
method is used to send a new data or
insert a new data to your database and
then we're gonna go ahead with the URL
so we can basically copy this particular
URL over here now the route for the post
method is API slash item without an S
and then what we need to provide is we
need to provide the item that we want to
add so that will be new item that we'll
be receiving from our component
basically from the form where the user
will be adding the item and then we need
to append the header so we'll say
headers type errors all right then
whatever respond that we'll be
retrieving or getting from our back-end
we need to map it as JSON so let's go
ahead and do that so service starts JSON
so that's it guys so we have two methods
in our data service class as of now one
is for retrieving the data and the other
one is to add a new item to our database
or to make the post API call to our
back-end so now let's get back to our
component and here first we need to
inject our service so let's do that
we'll say import
data service from data dot service all
right and then for dependency injection
we need to pass that instance or for
dependency injection you have to use the
constructor so we're going to say
private and then instance of data
service class that will be used for
accessing all the methods that we have
defined in the data service class so
we'll call it as data service type data
service all right now let me put this
method below the constructor so as to
make it more organized now what we want
over here is basically we want to store
whatever list that we are getting of the
items to our shopping item list property
so let's go ahead and do that so we'll
say this dot data service dot I'm sorry
for the typo let's get rid of this this
thought data service then we'll be
having get shopping items okay
now basically this will return me an
observable you can think of observable
as an container where your data is
deciding now in order to be an observer
or in order to get the data from your
observable you need to subscribe to that
particular observer so we'll say dot
subscribe all right now here what we
want to do is basically we will be
retrieving the data as a list and we
want to store it in our shopping item
list property so let's go ahead and do
that so we'll say we are traveiing the
data in items and what we want is
basically we want this to be stored in
our shopping item list equals two items
and let's go ahead and do a control log
as well so we'll say data from data
service
and it will say this store shopping item
list all right now before we go ahead
what we need to do is we need to run our
back-end code as well so let me open my
command prompt and also we have to run
our arena and our MongoDB service so
don't forget to do that
else you will get an error so I'm gonna
go ahead with Program Files then we're
gonna go ahead with MongoDB then server
3.4 then and here you will get an
executable as a Mahadi dot exe that you
have to run in order to start your mom
would he be service and then again let's
go ahead with another command prompt and
here I'm gonna go back to my back-end
code and spin my server so I'm gonna say
I'm good tutorial shopping list
crud back-end and I'm gonna use the old
one all right so our server has been
started at port 3000 and MongoDB has
been connected to port a270 and sir
now let's go ahead and run our angular
application so we'll say NZ surf now
once we do that basically we should be
able to get the entire shopping list
that is there in our database and
basically we'll be seeing that a list in
our console of the browser so we'll go
back to our browser and open it in our
inspect mode and then once it has been
done let's go ahead with localhost 4200
and this is our application now the
thing is we haven't nested our shopping
item component to app component so let's
go ahead and do that so we'll copy this
and we'll go back to our app component
we'll get rid of all these things over
here and you're gonna put our shopping
item complaint tag over here so as to
load this or less this component in our
app continent now we are getting an
error over here you can see that a null
injector error no provider for data
service that's because we forgot to
provide our service to component class
so for that we're gonna go ahead with
our shopping component and here we're
gonna say providers and here we're gonna
pass the name of that service class
which is data service if I go ahead with
controllers you can see everything is
fine now this method is not being
executed as of now because you need to
map it with some button or something
like that or else what we can do since
we want to retrieve the data whenever
our component is being loaded into our
comm for that what we can do is
basically we can go ahead and make a
call in this ng on init method which get
executed whenever your component is
being loaded into your tom so let's go
ahead and do that so we'll say this dot
get items now once we do that you can
see that we are retrieving data from our
back-end now let's do one more thing now
let's say we want to have the 0th index
and there we want to have the name of
the item that is there so if we do that
you can see that we are retrieving the
item list from our database and
basically we are referring
the first item that is there in the list
and then basically the name of that
particular item in the list so that is
ik so we are able to relieve the rater
guys from our back-end so for now we
don't need it next thing that we want is
we want to show the list so let's get
back to our item component template and
here we're gonna quit with an s2 tag and
we'll say shopping list all right and
here what we want is we're going to go
ahead with a div tag and inside that we
will have one motive tag for displaying
each item in as a list now here I'm
gonna use ng for ng for is a directive
that basically iterates over the list
what role is that you provided and based
on that it will add those element to
your Dom so I'm gonna say ng for and let
item of the list that we have in our
component the property that is shopping
item list and then for displaying the
name of that particular item we're gonna
go ahead with interpolation and we're
gonna say item dot item name alright so
let's go ahead and have a look at the
output so you can see that we are having
lists as of now we haven't added any
bootstrap class so it's not looking that
good so that we'll be doing later on so
for now we are able to display the list
that has been trimmed from our database
all right now what we want is basically
we want in each row of the list we want
four things first we want the name of
the item then we want the quantity of
that item then we want two buttons one
for editing that item any details that a
person want to edit and the second thing
that we want is a delete button and
besides that we also need one check box
so whenever the person has bought that
item from the shop in that case he can
go ahead and check that particular check
box with respect to the item and the
same data should be reflected in our
database as well so all those things we
have to do so now let's go ahead and add
a bootstrap class called us row now the
thing is that we haven't added bootstrap
so let's go ahead and add bootstrap so
for that kind of go ahead with the
command NPM install bootstrap
it's saying no such file as package or
teasin
all right so let me go back to my
project folder again and then we're
gonna go ahead with the command NPM
install bootstrap
all right so our board
has been added so now in order to
incorporate the stylesheet with respect
to bootstrap in your pandals
what you have to do we have to mention
it in your angular CLI property or JSON
file so here we're gonna go ahead with
the Style section and there you have to
add all the stylesheet that you want to
get bundled along with your angular
application now this bootstrap has been
added to our node modules folder so
inside that if you can see we will be
having one bootstrap folder if you go
inside that then inside this inside CSS
this is the file that we want to add or
this is the style sheet so Ãºnico hit
with copy project path then we'll go
back to our configuration file that is
an angular CLI configuration file and
here we're gonna provide that particular
path now whatever path that you are
providing over here that will be
referred with respect to source folder
as a root directory so what I am trying
to say here is let me collapse this so
this is the source directory which will
be used as a reference from which
whatever path that you have to mention
you have to do that with respect to this
reference so what we can do is basically
now we are inside source folder so we're
gonna go one step back alright so as to
go inside the Knowle models folder we're
gonna go it with node modules and then
we have bootstrap and after that we have
lists then we have CSS then we have
bootstrap got main dot CSS so this is
the flow wise now let me read on the
server so I'm gonna go ahead with ng
serve so that it can bundle the new
style sheet for the bootstrap in the
application that we have added I'm gonna
word with ng server again
now we are getting an error else it's
failed because we have done some error
so basically we forgot it to put inside
the double quotes so let's go ahead and
do that now everything is fine now if I
go ahead and do ng serve
all right so now if I go back to my
browser you can see that there has been
some difference and also what you can do
you can check whether the bootstrap has
been added so in your head section
inside the style you can see the
bootstrap has been added to your bundles
all right now the next thing that we
want to do is we want to add all those
buttons and all those item quantity in a
same row while displaying the list so
we're gonna go ahead and do that so
we'll say one more dev table over here
and here we want to put add our name
alright and we're gonna give it as call
MD - 3 then we need one for our quantity
so let's go ahead and do that so we'll
say item quantity over here and let's
make it two alright so we have got three
to five and we are remaining with seven
now we need two buttons so again we're
going to go it with call - MD - 3 and
here we're gonna go ahead with a button
that will be the edit button and after
that we're gonna have a button for
deletion
and here we wanna say delete all right
now we also need a checkbox so let's go
ahead and do that so we'll say def all
right
called MD - one with an input which will
be of type checkbox and did not require
value as of now now let's see the button
has been added so this is the button now
let's go ahead and add bootstrap so
we'll start with the button so we'll say
class button button danger let's go
ahead and add bootstrap to our edit as
well this will be let's say primary
let's make it blue
we should go ahead with call MD instead
of MIT now you can see that we are
getting the list let's go ahead and add
few bricks
one more yeah so we are getting the list
now now what we need is we need a form
for the user to add new items so let's
go ahead and build that as well you want
to go ahead with the form
and here we want two fields that I user
should input the first one will be for
the name of item the second one will be
for the quantity alright so let's go
ahead with an s2 tag over here or let's
put it inside the form I will say add
item alright then we want our controls
that is the input field
so we'll say def class and let's add the
CSS class as well which will be form
group now inside that will be having a
label and then we'll be having an input
right so let's go ahead with the label
so the label will be named and then
we'll be having an input field the type
will be 'text I'll be talking about this
name attribute later on and let's go
ahead and add one more CSS class as form
control now let me copy this we want one
more field like this for our quantity so
we'll add quantity over here so say
quantity and this will be of type number
alright once you are done with this we
want a button so let's go ahead with a
bottle of type submit'
here we'll say add item now let's add a
CSS class I will say as button button
primary or let's make it as success
because the person is adding a new item
all right so now as you can see we are
having the form for adding a new item
which is fully functional now what we
want to do is we want to have the access
of all the values that a person is
entering in the form for that we need to
create a template reference variable so
let's go ahead and do that so we're
going to go ahead with a hash tag frm
and then we want to use a directive
called as ng form
so basically this will instantiate this
frm template reference variable with
respect to our form objects that's what
we are using over here and also what we
want is whenever the person is clicking
on a button at that time we need to
access those value basically we'll be
capturing these values in a method and
and using that method what we can do is
we can pass those values for our data
service class where we have our HTTP
POST method that will again make a call
to our back-end API for adding that
particular data to our database so
that's the flow guys so we're gonna go
ahead in a catcher and event call as ng
submit and let's map it with our method
let's call it us at item alright and
inside that we're gonna pass this form
object so as to access all the values
that has been entered by the user now in
order to get access of all these values
one more directive that you have to use
in your controls that is called as ng
model so basically this will add a model
to your form so let's go ahead and do
that so we're gonna say ng model again
here also ng model and then whenever you
are using ng model you need to provide
some value to your name attribute
because this will be used as a key for
your entire form data so if I go ahead
and add let's say item name and then we
have item quantity alright let's get
back to our component and let's close
down this bootstrap we don't need this
we don't need trout or chairs we do not
require a broth module or neither do we
declare item dot here's all right now
let's get back to our component and here
let's go ahead and create a method
called as add item that will have a form
object and then let's go ahead and do a
console.log dot form dot value all right
so now
let's go ahead and add a new item let's
say I want a knife and that do I require
two now if I click on this Add button
you can see we are able to retrieve the
values that has been entered by me and
if you notice this name attribute that
we have defined in the control field
that was item name and item quantity
those are used as key by your ngmodel
directive and whatever value that you
are entering in those controls is being
assigned to that particular key so
that's how it works out that's why you
have to define the name attribute
whenever you are working around template
different forms or whenever you are
using ng-model in your forms all right
so we have done our add item part now
let's go back to our component now what
we need to do is we need to pass this
form object to our data service class
that will again pass it or make a call
to our back-end so let's go ahead and do
that so we'll say let new item alright
which will be of type item now we're
gonna say item name and that will be
formed our value dot item name again I'm
gonna make use of the key that we have
defined in our name attribute in our
form objects so that's why we are going
ahead with form dot value dot item name
next field that we want is item quantity
so we're gonna have it as form dot value
dot item quantity
and the reason that I am creating a new
item object because remember I told you
that we added the required field in our
schema so let's go ahead and check that
let's have a recap now here we have
added required set to true in all these
three fields so our database will accept
an object only when we have set values
with respect to all these three fields
in our item object so that's the only
case when our MongoDB database will
accept an item object so that's why what
we are trying to do is basically we are
getting two input from our user for the
name and the quantity and it is obvious
that that item bought field will be set
to false because the person hasn't
bought that item yet so that's why we're
going to go ahead with a new item over
here of type item so let's say item
bought and we will set it as false all
right
now let's see make use of our post
method in our data service class we will
say this thought data service thought ad
shopping items and here we're gonna pass
that particular item that has been
entered by the user now that will send
us an observable as you know so we need
to subscribe it so we're gonna go ahead
with subscribe and let's have item
alright now what we can do we can
console.log it basically we will be
receiving a message as item has been
added successfully so let's go ahead and
do that we'll say item and also what we
need to do is we need to refresh our
list so basically we need to call our
gate items method again so let's say the
start gate items so whenever we are
adding a new item we want our shopping
item list array to be updated as well
therefore we are calling this gate item
method again that will again make a call
to our back-end and update the shopping
item list as per your database now let's
see whether it works or not so again
we're gonna say knife and quantity too
now let's say add item and you can see
that a new item is being added to our
list
so far we have a tattoo functionality
status for adding the one item and the
second one is for retrieving the items
now what we want is we want a
functionality for updating the item and
then we also need a functionality for
deleting one item so let's go ahead and
implement the teet one that is easy so
let's get back to our data service class
and here we're gonna have a method call
as delete shopping item all right now
basically we will be passing the ID of
that particular item which we want to
delete so we're gonna void with ID all
right then let's go ahead with return
they start SCTP toward delete and here
I'm gonna pass the URL for the delete
route so here is it and also if you
remember what we were doing we were
passing the ID of that object in the URL
itself so let's go ahead and append that
so you're gonna say plus ID and then
whatever response that we'll be
receiving from our back-end we need to
map it as well so you're gonna go ask
that map operator and here we're gonna
say Russ restore cheers on all right so
our delete method or HTTP delete method
has been done in our service class now
let's go back to our component and here
we want or delete method as well so
let's create that so we'll say delete
item okay now we'll be passing ID from
our template so let's go ahead with ID
and here what we're gonna do we gonna
write all the logic so as to make the
call to our plate a service class for
now let's get back to our template and
here we had that button for delete now
here we're gonna add that method so
let's go ahead and do that so we'll have
a method call as delete item and here we
gonna capture a click event and map it
to the method called athlete item and
here I'm gonna pass the ID of that
particular height all right
which we want to eat
now let's go ahead and make the call to
our data service method for delete so
we're gonna say this door data service
all right dot delete shopping item and
here we're gonna pass the ID that we are
getting from the list that we are
displaying right and then we're gonna
get back some response now the thing is
we also want this change to be reflected
on our shopping item list array so
whatever item that we are deleting from
our database we want that item be when
we moved from our shopping item list as
well so either what we can do we can
refresh the entire list or else we can
go ahead and do that in our front end as
well let's go ahead and do that in our
front-end application only so you gonna
say subscribe then we gonna get some
data from our back end or result all
right now using that data if you
remember whenever we made the call to
our postman at that time we were getting
the response as some object something
like this where you have n equals to 1
and then you had something like okay
status that was set to 1 now this n
reflected the number of item that was
being deleted at that time so therefore
we can go ahead and make use of that so
as to make sure that that item has been
removed from a database or not so let's
say we're gonna say if data are dot n
equals equals to 1 that is the item has
been deleted what we want to do we want
to iterate to our list so we'll say
where I equals to 0 then I less than
shopping item list dot length then we'll
have I plus plus now here if we got a
match I'm sorry I forgot that this
keyword here when we got a match with
that of the item that we want to delete
then we're gonna go ahead and remove
that item from our shopping item list
array so we're gonna say ID equals 2
equals to the store shopping item list
index i dot ID all right now if that
happens what we want is we want this dot
shopping item list
thought splice this is the method that
you wanna use so as to remove one item
from the array and here you have to pass
the index and the number of deletion
that you're going to perform that is one
all right now let's do one more thing
let's console.log these data so that it
can understand what I was trying to say
no if I do a delete over here so we are
getting one error that is the path has
not been found let's go back to our
service alright so we forgot the
trailing slash because that's why the
road was not being matched so let's go
ahead and check that again you can get
rid of this particular orientation
problem that's happening because we are
using column MD alright so that depends
on the screen size so you can go ahead
and put several CSS classes with respect
to different different screen size for
example SM etc etc so let's go ahead
with treat come on again and now you can
see this is what the JSON response that
we are getting from our back-end that is
an set to one and okay status set to one
so this n signifies the number of item
that has been deleted whereas this OK
signifies that whether the deletion
operation was completed or not so that's
what we are using in our front-end
applications if you go back to our
component so what we are trying to do is
basically if we are getting data as
theta dot n equal to equal to 1 that's
when one of the item has been deleted
then we are iterating over our array the
shopping item list then we are checking
if there is a match with the ID that we
want to delete of that particular item
with respect to the shopping item list
and then we are slicing that particular
item out of a list so that's what we are
trying to do over here so a delete
method has been done now the next thing
that we have to do is about update so
whenever we click on this edit button
what we want basically is we want a form
to be generated over here in that a
person can update the item and also what
we want we want whenever a person click
on this checkbox that should be
reflected in our database and even if
you reload the application the same
status should be maintained and
reflected in our front-end so that's the
whole cool guys so let's go back to our
HTML and here what we need is we need
one more form so let's copy this and
let's add it over here and
here we're gonna have a forum for edit
item so you gonna say edit item alright
and then this will have button as let's
say save alright so let's see we are
getting some error because we are having
the same template reference variable so
let's make it as edit form and let's
copy this and put it inside our function
as well alright let's make it as edit
item method
now let's go back we are having two
forms one for adding item one for adding
item now whenever a person click on that
edit button we want those values to be
in our Edit item form so that the person
can refer to those values and make the
appropriate changes so let's go ahead to
our edit button and here what we can do
is basically we can go ahead with our
method call as show edit form
all right and you're gonna map it with a
click event so let's say click equals to
show it form and here we're gonna pass
that item that we want to edit so we'll
say item all right now let's go ahead
and create this method in our component
so you gonna create a method call as
show or let's copy this show edit form
that will give us an item that we want
to edit and here we gonna create a
property called a selected item for the
item that has been selected by the user
for editing so we'll say a selected item
that will be of type item now here we
gonna say this third selected item
equals to item and one more thing the
reason that I have chosen such a name
called as show edit form the reason is
quite simple the thing is that I don't
want both the forms to be displayed at
the same time the Edit form should only
be displayed when the person has click
on edit button and since I guess I have
made some typos that is edit form and
now everything is fine and now we are
getting some error unexpected closing
tag so that is because we have to eat it
the quotes all right so now everything
is fine now what we want to do is we
need to add and ng-if or directive so
that only one form is being displayed at
a time so for that what we can do we can
go ahead and create a flag call as
toggle form which will be a boolean and
let's set it to false in the first place
now here I'm gonna go ahead and say NJ
if the expression will be toggle form
all right this is the property to which
it will be referring now this ng-if
directive what it does is basically it
adds or removes a certain element from
your Dom based on certain condition the
condition that we have chosen over here
is toggle form now if you go back to our
component so this is a boolean value
which is set to false so initially that
particular form that is the ietm form
will not be displayed so if I save it
now you won't be able to see that our
atom form so we want that form to be
displayed initially so let's go ahead
and reverse it and let's add the same
thing to our edit form so we're gonna go
ahead and add this to our edit form and
we don't want it to be displayed in the
first place so now you can see you are
getting only the add item form whenever
the person click on this edit button
then only I should be able to see this
edit form over here so let's go ahead
and to our show edit form method and
here what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say toggle form and let's reverse it
this dot travel form alright now if I
click on edit you can see we are getting
the edit form but if I click on edit
button again then again we are getting
the add form and also when a person has
take down that edit button it should be
disabled that is like something logical
right so we can go ahead and make use of
disable property so let's go ahead and
do that so we're gonna say disabled all
right and it will be disabled once your
torille form has been set to true right
so we'll say toggle form that is at the
time when you we are able to see our
edit form so now if I click on this
button you can see that button is
getting disabled and you are able to see
your read form
now what we want is basically we want
whenever a person click on this edit
form with respect to any item we want
those values to be displayed in our Edit
item form so for that what we can do is
we'll go to our edit form and then we'll
make use of this ngmodel
property and basically we'll be using
property binding and we'll be
initializing the value with the selected
item property that we have created right
so whatever item that we are selecting
over here those values are or the values
with respect to that item or that item
object is being stored in our selected
item property that we have created if
you see over here and similarly if you
check out this short form button which
gets called once the person has click on
that edit button that particular
property has been assigned with the
value of that item on which the click
was happened so let's go ahead and use
that so we'll say selected item a dot
item name and similarly we're gonna have
the same for our quantity this time
we're going to go ahead with quantity
now if I click on any of these edit
button you can see we are able to get
the value of that particular item on
which we have clicked edit button
alright now next thing is that we want
to update these values so for that we
need to go back to our data service
class and write the HTTP put method over
here write the quotes for HTTP put
method so we're going to say update
shopping item
okay so we'll be retrieving a new item
basically a new item object containing
the new values and this is what we have
to send over there and then we want to
send some response as well so we're
gonna say let headers basically we can
copy this stuff from Earth it will be
same alright then we want to say return
the store HTTP dot put again we're gonna
make use of that ID in our URL so that
the correct item that we want to update
can be identified and finally update it
so we're gonna say again same URL that
we had over here along with the ID of
that items we'll say new item dot
underscore ID alright then we're gonna
say the new item as well so let's go
ahead with the new item and then we're
gonna pass the headers now whatever
response that will be retrieving we're
gonna go ahead and map that to Jason and
there's a typo that I have written as
TPP you have to make it as sut alright
so now let's go ahead with dot map and
that will be Russ restore JSON so that's
it guys
now our update shopping item
aesthetically method has been done in
our service class now let's get back to
our component now here we gonna create a
method called as edit form let's go back
to our template and this is the method
that we'll be using
so we'll say edit form which will give
us to a form object that is a new value
of the item that has been entered by
user so let's say let new item of type
items
and we'll say item name is equal to form
dot value dot item name then we need
item quantity
that will be formed at value dot item
quantity
at last we need item bought so we'll say
item bought and that will be because the
person is not entering the item part
filled from the form so we gonna you
make use of that selected item property
so we wanna say this dot selected item
dot item bought and similarly we need ID
as well so let's go ahead and use that
will say ID is equal to this start
selected item dot ID
now let's push this new auto item to our
asset if we put method in our data
service class we'll gonna say this dot
data service dot update shopping item
and here we're gonna pass this new item
and that will be returning us some
observable so let's go ahead and
subscribe that particular observable and
whatever result that will be gating
basically we will be getting the
original value or the original item that
we wanted to update so we'll say
console.log
original item to be updated with old
values
you'll say result all right and then we
also want to refresh our shopping item
list property the array that we have
with the new values or the updated value
so let's go ahead and say this thought
get items that's it
and now here is some typos so let's
rectify that so now everything is fine
now let's go ahead and check that
whether it is working or not so if I go
to bread and I want to make it as let's
say wrong and now if I click on save the
same thing is being reflected on my
shopping list now once I click on save
method this particular form should be
replaced with that of iodine because my
edit operation has been completed so
let's go ahead and fix that
so I'll say this dot toggle form and
I'll reverse it they start toggle form
all right
let's see whether it works or not so
we're gonna say it this time beer and
let's save it and you can see we are
getting the Eric and Fong we know also
what we can do is basically now a person
can ignore one of the field and then
press this iron atom button in that case
we'll get an error because we have made
all these field required in our back-end
code so for that what we can do is we
can go back to our HTML form and use a
directive called has quad and again here
also we gonna go ahead with required now
once a person does that so we're gonna
say until a person has entered the value
in these two field the button will be
disabled so we're gonna again make use
of this disabled property and we'll say
form thought and valid all right so
initially this button has been disabled
now once you enter some value for
example let's say I want barter and I
want to water now you can see the button
has been enabled now you can click it
alright
similarly our delete functionality is
also working our edit functionality is
also working for example let's make it a
six-pack now go ahead with six now it
has been updated we can go ahead and
basically do one more thing result dot
item quantity all right now let's edit
that particular item again so now let's
make it 12 now if I am click on save so
the item that I am getting over here if
it's the old value to which I made the
update one more thing that is left over
here is this checkbox so we need to go
ahead and add a function for this
checkbox as well so let's go back to our
HTML form and here we are getting the
value as checkbox right now for that
what we want is basically we will be
calling the same method that is the
update shopping item in our data service
and hair basically will be passing and
updated item pot value all right so
let's go ahead with a property called as
checked and we're gonna use a property
binding because whatever value that we
are having in our item bought key with
respect to the party
item we want that value to be reflected
over here so we're gonna say item dot
item bought and next thing that we want
is we want a click method
so whenever a person click it we want
those updation to be reflected in our
database so now again we're gonna map it
to a method call as update item let's
say checkbox all right and then we're
gonna pass this item now let's get back
to our shopping item list and here we're
gonna create that method so we're gonna
say update item checkbox and let's go
back to our component and here I'm gonna
say a bid item checkbox it will provide
me that item and now what I want is
basically whenever the person has
clicked it that it means that whatever
the original value of that item pot was
it was being reversed so let's go ahead
and do that so we're gonna say item dot
item pot this call to reverse of item
dot item pot all right then we want to
send this item back to our database that
is the updated item so we're gonna again
copy this same thing that we have done
over here and we're gonna make the call
to our service class HTTP put method and
here we're gonna pass this item all
right now let's say original checkbox'
value and here we can make it as item
pot
alright now let's see whether it works
or not when I check the egg you can see
the original value was false now if I
click it again I should get the again
the next original value as true see if I
do that you can see the next value is
coming as true or what I can do I can
just reload it and I can see whether the
same thing is being reflected on my
browser or not and this is being
reflected same thing is happening over
here
if I load it again we are getting the
check over there right so our check box
is working as well so finally our code
has been completed we have implemented
all the crud operations in our angular
part we have used the HTTP methods or
HTTP module in our service class and
also we have added two forms for our add
item functionality and Edit item
functionality so this is the entire mean
stack up waste so let me give you a
quick walk through two codes that we
have done so far so what we have done we
have a four HTTP methods in our service
class get shopping item add shopping
item delete shopping item and update
shopping item with respect to each
credit operation and then we had this
component the shopping component that
you are seeing over here in the HTML
part we had two forms one for eating
item one for adding item and then we had
a list displaying each item their
quantity two buttons that is edit delete
and a check box alright and in the
previous part we have created all our
backend codes and we have made all those
credit ApS that we are making call from
our front end and finally we are able to
make our web application fully
functional so that's the entire code
guys and now in the next video of the
series you're gonna go ahead and create
an angular firebase application so there
instead of putting everything on our
node and Express will be using services
from firebase for authentication for
stowing data or images or whatever we
want so I'll show you how to use that
for that we'll be using a package called
as angular fire too so everything will
be explained over there so I hope this
means that video was helpful for you and
you got an idea of how to create a full
stack application using MongoDB Express
node and angular so already I so see you
in the next video till then have fun bye
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it

and queries and we will reply to them at
