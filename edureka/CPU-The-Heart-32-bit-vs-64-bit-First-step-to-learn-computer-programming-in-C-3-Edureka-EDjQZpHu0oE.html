now that we understood what the memory
is made of let's move on to understand
the heart of the computer which is the
CPU you might have heard of
bitch and 64-bit CPUs to understand many
concepts of programming we need to
understand the difference between a
32-bit and a 64-bit CPU the meaning of a
32-bit CPU is that the CPU itself to do
the CPU has about 32 bits to store an
address location tell you bits means
four bytes so we have about four bytes
in our CPU to store some address
location which is in memory now what is
the purpose of these four bytes to
understand this we need to understand
some basics about bits a single bit
can a distort or zero
or the one I cannot represent the
numbers two three four exits are using a
single bit because today placing the
number two I need two bits to represent
number three also I need two bits
represent number four I need
three bits and so on so with just one
bit I can only live in the number zero
or the number one the largest number I
can represent is one which is nothing
but two to the power of one minus one
the symbol over here is ^ now similarly
let's say we have two bits it's two bits
I can represent the numbers 0 0 0 1 1 0
1/1
so I can represent four different
numbers and the largest number I can
represent is the number three that is 1
1 which is nothing but 2 to the power of
2 minus 1 similarly let's say I was
given 3 bits
as per this mat the largest number I can
represent is two to the power of three
minus one
the four-foot to the 8 minus 1 is 7
which is also correct because the 3 bits
the largest number you can represent is
1 1 1 in decimal is equal into 7 so
going with the same math if you have n
bits the largest number you can
represent using n bits is 2 to the power
of n minus 1 to have a better
understanding of the binary number
system kindly go to the Wikipedia page
for the binary numeral system now if you
cpu has 32 bits to store an address the
largest address it can store is you just
learnt the 32 bits the largest address
you can store is 2 to the power of 32
minus 1 this is the largest number the
CPU can store in the 4 bytes that it has
this is nothing but 4 - 9 4 9 6 7 2 9 6
this means we can have a memory with so
many bytes which is nothing but 4 GB
hence with 32 bit CPU you can only have
a maximum RAM of 4gb but these days 4gb
is hardly enough to play games or make
movies this is why we now have 64 bit
CPUs this has helped us to have memory
that can go beyond 4 GB and can go up to
2 to the power of 64 minus 1 which is
extremely large number and should
suffice for a number of decades to come
the CPU basically fetches all your
instructions or the data from main
memory the address from which has to
fetch are stored on these four bytes
so we're just 32-bits the CPU can go up
to an address of 4gb if the main memory
was greater than 4gb it can never access
that part of the memory as it cannot
store that address in the in his memory
location to understand this better let's
analyze that your life scenario let's go
back to our example of the land so I
have a huge piece of land with about 200
plots now I send a three-year-old kid to
this huge land and asked him to go to
plot number 145 let's say which is over
here the plots are all numbered
sequentially so it should not be a
problem finding plot number 145 the
problem is that a three-year-old kid
does not know counting beyond 99 so if
you send him to this plot he would go
sequentially and he would stop at plot
99 after that the number 100 101 102 etc
do not make any sense to him so he has
no idea what to do exactly how a 32 bit
CPU is 32 bit CPU no scanning until 4gb
after 4gb the CPU cannot store the
address in his memory so all the memory
beyond 4gb would be useless so now you
understood the difference between a
32-bit CPU and a 64-bit CPU to be a
great programmer you really need to
understand the binary number system so
please don't forget to go through the
