is fishin on behalf of Erica so we are
supposed to discuss some injury
equations related to the spring
framework for the day so let's begin the
session and I hope the session will help
you and guide you to prepare for your
interview so best of luck right so best
wishes let's start and let's see what we
have got for you so what exactly is
basically of the spring framework in the
market so let's have a look on two first
right so that spring source was the
company created by the founders of the
spring framework right and it merged
into covalent in January 29 2008
so spring source ones are purchased by
BMV for approximately 420 million
dollars in 2009 right so this is
something where we are trying to come up
with some history so spring dominance
over the years has increased right and
it basically is having one monopoly in
the field of web framework specifically
in Java Enterprise Edition so Spring
Framework plays one important roles so
you can see a significant increase from
2012 to 2016 in the market rights as you
can see so spring MVC is one of the most
you know interesting part over here if
you can see has the maximum you know
responding available so let's see some
job trends when it comes to spring
framework so in a country like India we
have somehow you know our demand right
so it fits like more of demand in India
and if you can see various job portals
so an approximate average is nearly 3000
right so in a similar way we got the
trends in US as well right so again so
US is approximately not an average level
of first 6000 right so we we are trying
to come up and show you guys that spring
framework is really into the market and
we got none of job openings available
into the spring primer so this data is
approximately 18 May 2070 so again if
you can see some more trains coming in
so we got the permanent jobs versus the
contract job right so the graph is
driving so it's not falling off right so
so as the years increase right so this
gap is constantly going up right it's
not coming down so again at the data we
have four taken from you know the
various job models so let's see what we
have gotten for the day so we will be
discussing Journal question with respect
to the Spring Framework and we'll see
the dependency injection and inversion
of control right so here I will try to
demonstrate couple of core concepts for
you practically as will they after will
see the beings in the Spring Framework
how we can you know rather than coming
up with the configuration XML files we
can use annotations then what is your
data access layer will you can integrate
your JDBC or hibernate with the Spring
Framework then we'll move on to aspect
oriented programming and in the end
we'll have one introduction to spring
MVC so value fit well let's start with
the first one that like the spring
member now this is very basic equation
when you are going to start with
interview rights we're taking it so what
are you doing about Spring Framework or
what exactly is spring penguin now
that's what the primary equation is to
myspace so in an introductory part so
what you can come up with is so it's a
lightweight framework which basically
focuses on loose coupling so when I say
coupling it means the less dependencies
right and it's an integrated framework
which is created to address the
complexity of enterprise application
development so majorly you are going to
come up with a spring framework when you
are writing an enterprise level
application right and other than that
it's a layered architecture so we can be
selective about what and all components
we wish to use right and thereafter it's
gonna provide us a cohesive environment
for our application development in Java
Enterprise Edition so let's see the
advantages of sprinkling right so what
can be the various advantages if you
wanna come up with a spring framework so
now
it's a layered architecture so here we
got being model or Oh Joe that's like
plain old Java object based programming
then there are two powerful features in
the core layer of Spring Framework
that's like dependency injection and
inversion of control so we don't have
this control in the hands of our program
so this object they will be created by
the spring container right so inversion
of control means you don't create the
object you configure the objects and
objects will be constructed by the
spring timber so again it's an
open-source community so no vendors are
coming in no licensing coming in so
that's one of the major advantage of
using any of the technology right which
is open source now coming on to the
features its lightweight right so when I
select it it means we got memory
optimizations then we got inversion of
control we got the control of object
construction to the destruction the
entire lifecycle will be managed by the
spring container we got aspect-oriented
programming which is going to help us in
writing the cross-cutting concerns for
example security then we got a built in
container and we got MVC framework so we
got a pre you know available snippet as
in MVC so which is Model View controller
as a design pack then we got transaction
management as database entry part right
so d DB T spectra and etc we can do lot
of things in data access layer of our
string member so let's see what and all
are the module available in the spring
framework and what exactly they are
right so guys Spring Framework is a
layered architecture so it's basically a
layered architecture so layers can
interact with each other right in the
upper direction in the lower direction
so the rock bottom layer is like testing
later that's like you can have J unit
testing or you can have unit testing
using gel unit even you can have
integration testing right then we got
the core container which contains the
which is the core of the spring
framework right so here we want to play
with the beans code context and spring
expression language there after we got
AOP that's like aspect-oriented
programming then ask
it's instrumentation and imagine in the
data access layer we got over and
deathlike object relationship mapping
right another tools are also labeled and
the mid layer we got WebSocket web
frameworks
servlets hood - it's basically a
framework of Pringles now right so we
got lot of frameworks available within a
single framework now one of the major
thing which is a you know a core of our
Spring Framework is the configuration
file now this is an example file right
there we will be configuring the values
for the attributes of an object right so
we are talking about inversion of
control you are supposed to configure
your objects in an XML file spring
container will read this spring
configuration files and will construct
the objects for us now that's like
inversion of control so let us see the
different components of a label in the
spring application so right we got an
interface that will define the functions
right the implementation that contains
the properties like or you can say a
student is one you know event of a class
which contains the attributes like a
roll number name you know standard 8 xx
right sector along with a get hood
settled or any other message right so
you got aspect-oriented programming and
we got the spring configuration which is
an XML file and we need to have a client
program where we gonna use our spring
container and we'll be using the objects
constructed by it right so that's like
some various components of any spring
application so what are the major
versions for the Spring Framework so
that we got 2.5 right so this guy is you
know having annotation driven
configuration right so it is possible in
this 2.5 so before 2.5 we we were not
having the annotation of supports
available then entry or 0 so the users
for Java 5 improvement in the language
sites we got some enhancements in the
language itself so in 4.0 it's like the
first version
fully supports all the Java features
right to that like the latest version
even the market so what are the various
ways how we can use this spring plane
right so the different ways of using the
spring finger so we can have full legs
spring
web application that's like through
model view controller we can have a
middle tier that can provide the help of
a third-party web framework then we can
use it if we are supposed to do any
remote you know invocation then we got
enterprise javabean so wrapping up the
existing plain old java objects right so
that like some of the different ways in
which we can come up with a spring
framework
so let's now focus on the core part of
the spring framework that like
dependency injection an inversion of
control right so what exactly is this is
e so that inversion of control over here
means that you don't create the objects
objects will be constructed by the
spring chamber right and we got IOC
container which will do so so we going
to buy other objects right we're going
to configure them in an XML file
management of the entire lifecycle from
construction till destruction will be
taken care by this guy IOC container we
can also come up with dependency
injection like features where we can
punch in the dependent data or you can
say that we got a relationship like
person has an address right so person is
one object and address is the other so
having a dependency of address object
and person objects you know on each
other we can come up with this
dependency injection technique where we
can fulfill this criteria right so it is
basically for has a relation which has
to be perfect so what do you mean by
dependency injection so by d-i over here
means that we don't treat objects but
describe how they should be created not
that like the basic inversion of
toad feature right so we don't directly
connect the components and services in
the code so we need to come up with the
configuration in the XML file itself
right so our dependency injection is
done in your XML structure itself so we
got a container which is responsible for
doing it right so we got spring
container which will do so so how many
days this dependency injection can be
done so that we got three different ways
of doing it we can have constructor
based injection right so it means that
you cannot come up with constructors
then we can have setter injection then
we can also have interface elation so
let's try to see what exactly we are you
know intending over here consider that
you bought one club as person right and
person person can have one let's say ID
person can have an email then person can
have some age right and we can have many
other attributes right so these are the
attributes for person now we got one
more class known as address so when I am
going to come up with the address so
address can have its own attributes so
for example you can have a city right we
can have one address line then you can
also come up with some state right so
you can have a country you can have a
zip code so on and so forth right so
these are the attributes available in my
address now we need to come up with one
relationship that person has an address
so this is one has a relationship which
we have created so person has an address
so that is what we are trying to come up
with so that when there is a has a
relationship then we are talking of
dependency so this is dependency now
right so what we can do now we can have
a person constructor where we can say
address as in a new address right so
let's let us talk of very general things
and in some client class there will have
this dial main methods from not writing
I'm just trying to do it in a pseudo way
so let's say we are going to come up and
we are saying person P as in onion
person right so I'm going to create one
new person and then the constructor of
the person will be executed at that time
the object of address will be created it
means that there exists a very high
dependency that address object can be
constructed only then the person object
will be constructed so such a dependency
is leading to very high coupling right
so we got a concept with person object
then it will be constructed only then
the address object will be constructed
so this is one problem statement and we
need to find out the solution purpose to
find out the solution we will not do it
like this will come down and we'll try
to create one constructor and we'll pass
one address and we'll say copy the a
into address or what we will say we say
let's create one sector like set address
and here we can have an address as in a
right so this is what we would rather
intend to do so
benefit of this will become like you can
take address a as in a new address and
thereafter you can say P dot set the
address as in a or in the other ways you
can say person you as a new person and
here in the constructor you can pass the
guy D so this is like how you are
resolving the dependence so address
object is constructed separately person
object is constructed separately so you
can set the trace either to a setter
method all you can passed it as an input
to the constructor as per your bill so
we are trying to come up with
constructor injection and setter
injection in the configuration
while linked with these two key concepts
right so we call this as dependencies
and here we have resolved the problem of
high coupling we have reduced the
coupling level and we call it like we
have solved one problem where dependency
was very high so let's now proceed and
understand so either you can do it by
constructor or setter or you can even do
it two interfaces right so if you want
to come up with some polymorphic concept
and if you want to come up with some you
know runtime logics you can also write
interfaces which is going to be more
flexible in our programs so what exactly
is the difference I hope one of the key
concept is very well clear now so what
is constructor and sector-based
dependency resolution so in constructors
there is no partial injection but in
separate you can do a partial injection
right so here we don't overwrite the
setter property but here you need to
come up with the set of property define
very good so it will create new
instances if any modification is done
right so here you can't come up without
an object right so you need an object
for sure but here you can skip that and
you can do it later so it is better for
too many properties and if we got few
properties you can always use the second
injection right so these are some
differences between constructor and
setter injection
all right so how many types of ioc
containers are there in the split-finger
so right there are two major containers
in the spring framework of ioc layer so
we got application context and being
packaged right so guys the B Factory is
basically one container right and
application context is implementation
and it's built on top of bean pack races
so it is always better to come up with
application context other than the pin
pack so let us try to differentiate
between bean factory and application
context and let's try to write one
program and see how we can do so right
so let's see one program so let's create
one new Java project
and I'm going to name it like my spring
Denis right so let's say next and let's
say finish so it it's one project in
Java which I have created and within my
SRC directory what I'm going to do I'm
going to click on class and this class
is going to go under the package Godot
edwiga
and since we are on two into equations
let's think of employ class right so
let's say finish so here we are with the
employee I am going to come up with one
employee ID right so that's like the
attributes then we can have a name of
the employee I can have some salary
associated with the employee right let's
see we got Department for the employee
and finally if you want you can have
let's see an email right so we cannot
have asked to do so these are a few of
the attributes which I have taken now we
can create one constructor I it selects
right one in constructor so it's a it is
a default one so here I will just tasty
to employee object constructed right so
let's say employee object constructed so
coming up with next I can write source
and then getters and setters right so
let's write getters and setters for our
class so select all and say ok so here
we are with the getters and setters and
quietly I will generate one to two
methods right so let's see a two string
method so this is my employee class this
is written and we say that this is a
photo or beam or model right so you can
use any terminology right the Buddha is
the plain wood job let's come back and
let's try to write one both clocks and
here I am going to say a flying
laughs with the meal so in the client
class with a main method so what is the
traditional way of creating the objects
or what is the you know as a general way
of creating the objects right so general
way of creating the objects it goes like
you say and employee as in a new
employee right so this is the reference
to the employee object so I can say edit
or set of name for example it goes like
John you say yep dot set off let's say e
ID has 101 so that is the these are some
regular ways of creating the objects
right so here F dot let's say setup
department so I'm going to say it's like
Rd then let's say set of salary which is
like 45 thousand then you say ear F dot
set of email which goes like John at
example.com
now this is one traditional way or
general way how we construct an object
now if I say see so op eds details plus
e tip so if I paint out the e-rep is
going to call the two string method and
here you will see later on it has a java
application so you see it says employee
object constructed and these are the
details available in my employ got it
now this is one general we are
traditionally how you can stop but we
need to understand how the objects are
constructed using the spring member to
do so the very first thing which I am
going to do is I am going to link the
jar file right so how I will do that I
will to right click and I will say build
path and I will see configure my pizza
right smell see configure the build path
I will be my libraries and I am going to
say add external charge so let add the
spring - so right I got this strings are
available over here so
need to add the core their job right so
I'm using the spring core over here so
I'm going to add these cool jock pilots
and then say apply and you can pray okay
so here you can see the reference jars
available for your spring penguin now
the next part is to come up with some
XML configuration file in your SRC
directory to do so so what I'm going to
do I have it with me so let me open that
so I am here with this employee be in
dot XML so going to copy this XML file
and I'm going to paste it in my SRC
directly so point to be noted is that
this is pasted in SMT directly but not
in the package so in my necessity
directory this employee in dot XML it
looks like this so it's basically one
XML configuration file the root tag is
beans and we got the tag as B so I am
going to say bean idat 1 and class is co
dot and record dot employee so fully
qualified a name of my class it comes up
like co dot ed we cannot employ and the
ID is e1 now we got few properties
available over here trid name salary
department and E right so let's start
with e ID so we got t ID then you got
name salary department and email right
so ii ID name salary department and
email so we got t ID name salary
department and email so i have mentioned
this properly so what are the values
that you want to set into this so I will
say one or two the name goes like Jenny
and salary goes like let's say somewhere
around 50,000 department is HR and email
is during at example.com tree so here we
are back so now you can configure as
many as objects you want in your XML
so let's configure one more let's say
the ID is ignore the ID should be unique
right so this ID goes like two not one
and the name goes like George so George
is having a 57,000 and I belongs to
Edmund and let's see the email ID goes
like George at example.com right so this
is one of the configuration files which
we must have enough spring project right
so what we got we got a POJO class we
got a configuration file we got the jar
file and we got a client in class to
test our program so let's see the spring
way so the spring weight goes like with
the help of a concept known as inversion
of control right so what exactly is this
term inversion of control so guys in
inversion of control I am going to give
this right to my spring container so
let's see the first container so I am
going to say the first container over
here as pin Factory so let's see how to
use this guide in practice first of all
I will come up with one API known as
resource from Spring Framework right if
it's from the spring claim of you say
resource resource as in a new class path
resource and here I will see my employee
being dot XML so this is your XML
configuration file right so if you can
see you're here
so this XML configuration file it goes
into the class path resource and
thereafter you say being factory and
let's say factory as in a new XML bean
factory from the resource so that this
is how we use our first guy that's like
being factory right so this is my first
container so it's a spring
IOC container so what's being packaged
this thing is be continued so this guy
is responsible to construct objects for
us I am just going to run the board so
when I run the code so nothing happens
just this relevant information is
displayed now what we need to observe
over here so we are executing the code
Spring Framework the container that like
bean factory is not constructing an
object first but as soon as I will say
employee M one as in fact we dot get the
bean on the basis of e1 right so here
you can see we got the guy as e1 right
and you need to typecast it back to the
employee so when you call its method
get' being at that very instant now when
I am going to run the code right so you
can see employee object instruction only
one object is constructed right so if
you try to get the second I'll as in e2
and when you run the code again you will
find that both objects are constructed
so being factually what it is doing it
constructs the objects when we request
that like the spring IOC container being
packaged so it constructs the object
when we request now you cannot just say
of C so on M 1 as well as M 2 right so
here we are
so let's on the code and you can see the
details coming in so guys this is the
first bean factory as in your ioc
container right so let's see the second
right
that's like application context so it's
also Spring Framework containers right
and let's see how it's going to come up
so it constructs the objects even when
we do not request so let's see how how
it's gonna do so so I
meant out the barcode and let's see the
application context in action so I will
say application context context as in a
new class path XML application context
and here you mention this guy employed
in dot again now it is a very much
equivalent to whatever we have done
before now I am just going to run the
code right so when I run the code I can
see both the employee optics are
constructed even though I have not
requested for any object now that's one
of the significant difference which you
can see over here right as in the
practical environment so if you don't
request even then it's gonna create and
if you are trying to requite so you
request it in the same way so the way
you were requesting it before so guys if
you don't want to typecast it over here
you can just come down and you can say
comma employee dot class right you can
mention the type over here so that's the
second day so both the cases it's gonna
work right so you can mention it over
here right and you can just leave this
from this side so here again so both the
conflicts are they're going to give you
the same outcome back the object
construction if you can see right
application context will come some the
objects even if you don't request for
them now that like one practical example
how we are able to demonstrate both the
content so let's see more of the
differences between both of them so that
was a quick introduction to the Spring
Framework right what is inversion of
control so that in fact in application
context so here we got lazy
initialization and there we got
aggressive initialization now that
relevant concept I think is they will
see whatever we have demonstrated so in
a bean factory explicitly provided a
resource object using the syntax we're
here every resources are managed by zone
so internationalization is not supported
in bean factory whereas application
context that's so application annotation
based or dependency injection is not
supported by bean factory get as
application context will support now
that's also one of the major differences
so some of the benefits of IOC so Gaius
IOC will minimize the amount of code in
application because you will have one
XML configuration file so anytime if you
want to change so you can change the
configuration right so it's very easy to
test our application and coupling can be
you know reduced so it can be a loose
coupling concept which we can promote
and hence there will be leaves inclusive
mechanisms with minimal APIs right so
IOC container they cannot support eager
instantiation and lazy loading kind of
services for you let's see now what are
spring Peas so as a beanie stuffing it's
your Java object which we have seen
already in our program right so the
metadata is provided in the XML file
container will create an object for me
so that's like your basic bean object so
this configuration metadata can be given
in an XML file it can also be supplied
through an annotation based
configuration or it can be even a
java-based confirmation so for them
there are three our main models how you
can configure your objects as in your
IOC console now what can be the various
of scopes which can be supported by the
sprinkling so what is meant by this
scope right so let's try to understand
this spot so by that scope over here
means when you are writing your employee
right so here you can mention a scope so
scope can go like a single term which
means for your entire application base
will be only single object scope can go
like prototype so by default it is
single term right
so when you say prototypes every time a
new object will be constructed for you
so if you want to see a difference let's
see one difference right so I am going
to say the scope is single done in my
client so I am going to work on even
right so in my employ dot Java so here
in the two string method I am going to
say plus super dot - straight right so I
put one backslash N and I will say
object address super dot to sign so in
my client when I am going to run the
code
you also find that or EXO voicing a
little printed it so let's see a piece o
of M one right when I am going to say M
1 so it will now say the address is 2 1
b c FF d5 right so there is one object
it is constructed at this memory
location now let us try to write 1 M 2
this is again we are requesting a 1
right so you are requesting only e 1 so
again I am going to print m2 and now you
will find that both of the objects are
trained right you can see the address so
that is where we call the Dayak
singleton
let's change this to prototype so I'm
going to change the prototype now let's
read on the code and here now you will
find that this is a separate address and
this is a separate at this so that's
like the scope within your beam right so
scope when you're being can be single
turn prototype request session or a
global session requesting for one HTTP
request session is throughout one HTTP
session and global station is valid in
the context of a best availing
application context right so what is the
beam life cycle so that we also have a
life cycle of a beam right so what does
this mean now spring pilferer you go to
the entire lifecycle management
happening by the spring IOC container
itself so the beans going to get
instantiate then it's property is going
to get populated through settlement
codes right so setter methods are going
to get called right and any post
processor if you want to come up you got
a beam post processor API so we can have
after properties being set and custom in
it and custom destroy can also be
implemented like we exceed my it in my
destroyed so we can also have force
initialization like we got the post
processor over gear and once the beam is
ready to use you can use it and once
container is shut down so custom destroy
matter is executed so what our inner
being you guys in a Deans are like if
you have person
as has a relationship in school right so
you can come up with the energy so you
can have a be property and then you can
also create one inner beam and you can
set its properties over there so what is
beam - so guys the beam wiring is
something right which means that beams
are combined together with the spring
container so when we are boiling the
beans the spring container must know
what beans are required and how the
container should use dependency
injection to tie them together right so
what are the different modes to wire the
beans so guys we got my number by name
by type constructor and auto-detect so
these are the different base to which
you can find so what can be the
limitation that you are going to come
with ottawa so that is the possibility
of overriding is there right and then
primitive data types it becomes
complicated it's challenging and it's
again confusing in nature right so you
need to remember what was the name over
there and what has to be kept over here
right so it's a bit confusing all right
so we got spring annotations so that's
the way we call the XML configuration in
a similar way we can have annotation
right so you can mention after a
configuration or at the rate beam so
these are the different annotation
abased configurations for your spring
IOC container so how many can come up
with the annotation value so if you are
supposed to come up with annotation
while you must support context :
annotation config you must write this
property in your XML file right so how
you can do so so you need to come up
over here and you need to say context :
annotation context so if you are going
to support your annotations you can
follow the standard all right so let's
now see what are exactly are the
different annotations which are quite
used in commercial or in industry so we
got component controller repository and
thermic so these are you know a kind of
most used annotations so why is
component basically a generic stereotype
right which can be used across the
application controller is
to leave resent your business spot
service will annotate copies on the
service level layer and repositories
gonna tell you with the database part so
what is this add the rate required a
notation so guys when we are coming up
with the beam construction after it
required is a kind of you can say a1
constraint right so name has to be
populated for sure else it's gonna show
a beam initialization exception so
that's like that you can say putting up
the constraints so address auto while
annotation is basically lotta wiring
right so let's say you got an employee
right and we got this guy name so you
can put it as an average auto wire so
auto wiring you are here by name so you
need not to come up with a different
dependency injection technique you need
to use the same name so what is this guy
qualifier so as there are some
situations when you wanna create more
than one be for the same type but we
want to wire only any one out of them
with a property so we can use qualified
annotation along with auto wiring so
that we can remove this ambiguous nature
right so qualifier is used so that you
can mention which beam is supposed to be
Auto wire right in case you have
multiple constructions for the same guy
now we got a request mapping annotation
so this annotation is particularly for
your HTTP request now we are trying to
come something known as the web part of
the sprinkling book so add read request
mapping annotation it can be applied and
both the levels so class level and
master level so in class level method
it's gonna map the URL request whereas
on the master level it's going to also
take care of HTTP method right so HTTP
method can be either get post delay put
trace any matters right so these methods
can be taken care so let's see what is
the data exists here so guys a spring
comes with the data access our support
right so we got all Dow as a design
pattern concepts which can be you know a
you
soft in our Spring Framework so Spring
Framework data access is aimed at making
it easy to work with the data access
technologies like hibernate if at a JDBC
or Jerry or a Java data objects so it's
very easy to switch between the
persistent technology so you can switch
from one of the framework to the other
frameworks very easily so core will stop
worrying about getting the exceptions
that are specific to each technology so
you can write a very beautiful
independent code so what are the various
exceptions so guys we got data access
exception as the root right so there are
various subclasses to this exceptional
so if you can see there is the one whole
hierarchy in a similar range the basic
code jar context we talked about the
standard edition you got through Abel
coming out with exception and then you
are having a complete exception
hierarchy as in runtime exception ten
versus instead etcetera etcetera so here
we go to complete hierarchy coming it
right so in order to remember that but
you should always remember that there
exists one pin exception charge so what
and all classes are present in the
spring JDBC API so as we got JDBC
template simple JDBC template named
parameters atavistic template so we got
the simple JDBC insert simple get is if
we call so these are some major
important API is with respect to your
data so data the template is again now
used on a very frequent basis so how we
can use hibernate and spring papers
right there are two ways so either you
can do an inversion of control with the
hibernate
template API or you can extend the
hibernate Dao support and you can use a
whoopy - like aspect oriented
programming so what are the types of
transactions our production management
right or types which spring framework
supports so guys there are two things
one is programmatic transaction
management and declarative transaction
management so many times the you as a
developer might be confused over there
so transaction is managed with the help
of programming in programmatic
transaction management so here we got an
extreme flexibility right but maintain
is a bit difficult path but in
decorative part so transaction
management is not a part of your program
so it's basically annotations or XML
based configuration to manage your
transition of that code distance so that
correctly means either annotation based
on XML text so this mailed or Enza are
supported by the spring plain book right
- right
all of the major orange right any
relationship mapping for the objects
fling book so most important we got
hibernate antibiotics which are you know
you see one JPA is also one of the core
concepts now let's see Spring AoE so by
is AO P stands for aspect-oriented
programming now this is one technique
which allows the programmers to
modularize cross-cutting concerns so
what is meant by the cross-cutting
Johnson will see in our upcoming in your
slides so we can also model write the
behavior that's going to cut across the
typical divisions of responsibility now
the core construct of the AOP is known
as an aspect right so with incapsulate
different behaviors affecting multiple
classes into some reusable modules so we
got a base or a core program we got an
aspect and thereafter you want to beat
them together to get a final system
right so let's try to understand it in
mode it is what exactly is this die
aspect so guys an aspect is basically a
modular ization of a concern that cuts
across multiple objects right so you got
a source matter and a target method so
when we are going to call the master so
this aspect will have one point cut and
one joint cut so what is this guy
concern so that for example security is
one concern right so that's like
fulfilled by aspect so let's see what is
this joint point so when you are going
to execute a method so if you can see in
the master execution you got various
joint points right so a point during the
execution of program such as the
execution of a master or handling of any
exception right it is known as a join
point so in spring AOP a
join point always represents a mastered
institution right so any point in the
macro execution is referred to as a
joint point so advice is something this
is an action taken by an ox pit at any
particular giant point right so for any
particular joint point we got an advice
right within an aspect so there can be
around before and after so what happens
before the method execution what happens
after the method execution what happens
around the mastered execution right so
let's try to take one example or if if
you are going to log into the Amazon
right so you are going to come up with
one request so at what time you want to
log in so that's like before right and
what time you log out that leg up you
take it like one method execution as one
interval where you are surfing around
the Amazon and that's like around right
so that's one key example so many AFP
frameworks we got model and advice as an
interceptor and we need to maintain
various chain of interceptors around the
join point so let's see the different
advices so we got before and after right
so this like coming up before the method
execution and also the method execution
similarly we got around the method
execution we got after returning and
after throwing ended so this is quite
linked with exceptions now so let's
point out the difference between concern
and cross-cutting function so that is
what is the concern concern is the
behavior we want to have in a module of
an application whereas a cross-cutting
concern is a concern which is applicable
throughout the application for example
security from writing your code to
maintain it to execution you need the
security on every level right to that
like your cross-cutting concerns so what
exactly are the different quixote
implementation so that we got the spring
AOP apache aspectj and JBoss AUP so
these are the various of AOP
implementations available in the market
so let's start a differentiate between
spring AOP and aspect
jup so by spring
we got reading through proxy right here
we got reading through aspectj within
the Java tools so you'll be in the
spring we'll support only master level
point cut where as in aspect jup even
the field level point cuts are also
possible so we got tot dvd-based so it's
like document type definition right and
the ostriches are schema based or a
notational configuration again so what
is this proxy all about so what happens
whenever you create an object so after
applying and advice to a target object
right so in respect to the client
objects any target and the proxy object
they are the same so you got an advice
and you got a target object so in all
all you get a proxy right so that like
what the proxy is in tentative so what
is meant by society whenever an aspect
is going to be linked with application
types or any object which has to be
created as an advice object so this
particular concept we call it as BD
right so this can be performed on three
instances either it compilation time or
at runtime or even at the time of
loading right so guys in spring papers
when you are doing the reading
performance reading process it is
performed always at running back right
so you need to call up for your proxy
for your target and this particular
reading will be taken here at runtime so
it's all dynamic so lastly we got spring
MVC that like Model View controller so
that is our spring MVC framework helps
us to work in a predefined Model View
controller architecture so we got ready
to use components which will help us to
develop flexible and loosely coupled
their application so we got different
aspects of the application which are
separated now so you can see over here
we got dispatcher servlet as one of the
key important ingredients we got the
mapping handle mapping controller view
resolver and deep so these are the
various components let's see work out
these guys so guys this package servlet
is the one which will handle a
the HTTP request or response so spring
MVC framework is designed around the
dispatcher servlet only so what is this
web application context
so when application context is again an
extension of application context or
application context is the code
container whereas the application
context is a container on the web app
live right so this will have an extra
feature for your gun application so it
is also capable of resolving some themes
and if those big servlet is associated
to bitch kind of resource right to that
like your web application context so
what is this guy controller so my
controller is going to act as a
receptionist
so whenever any new request will come
from the user it will go to the
controller and thereafter controller is
gonna process the data from the model
and then external give the view back to
the user right
so string controller is going to act as
a receptionist now right there it's
gonna handle your request so that's like
the whole agenda for the day so right if
you are going to come up with any spring
interview right you need to follow these
topics you need to prepare these topics
so that you can crack your internals
right so that's all from my side and EDD
later so we wish you all the very best

interviews so thank you very much keep
