Rekha and in today's session we'll be
focusing on data analysis with Python so
let us move forward and have a look at
the agenda for today
so first we'll see various applications
of Python
after that we'll understand the data
life cycle starting from data
warehousing till data visualization then
we'll focus on data analysis and we'll
see how we can use Python for that
purpose we'll also look at what is
panda's library and we'll also
understand a bit about numpy and cipher
then we'll focus on various pandas
operations merging joining all those
things and we'll see after that fight
simple statistics and python for hadoop
so till now any doubts are you guys
clear with the agenda if you have any
questions any doubts you can write it
down in your chat box I will be happy to
help you
alright so Jason says all clear sodas
Dave Jessica what about the others
alright I usually say is all clear
siddharth says move on Nia says go on
alright thank you guys so we'll move
forward and we'll see what are the
various applications of Python
so these are the applications of Python
I've listed only four of those although
there are many more so you get perform
bit scraping bits Python that is you can
extract certain contents from a
particular webpage you can perform a web
development you can perform testing as
well as you can perform data analysis so
for today's session we'll be focusing on
the data analysis part of Python so how
are we guys clear so guys let us move
forward and see what exactly is data
lifecycle
so this is the data lifecycle guys over
here what happened data is stored in
different formats we have a CSV file we
can have an excel file or an HTML file
so data is basically stored in different
formats now what do you do you actually
convert that data or transform that it
data into a single format and you store
it somewhere that's where data
warehousing comes into picture now once
you have stored your data you can
perform certain analysis on it you can
perform predictive modeling you can join
merge data so various other things that
we are going to see in today's session
now once you have done the analysis you
can even plot it in the form of a graph
and that stage is called a data
visualization so this is just a general
overview about data lifecycle if you
have any doubts or questions you can
write it down in your chat box and in
today's session let me tell you guys
we'll be focusing on only data analysis
here any questions guys all right so a
she says he is clear so it's Jason Devon
Jessica Janice are you XI Nia or it fine
guys so let's move forward and
understand what exactly is data analysis
so what is data analysis so let us
understand data analysis with the help
of an example that is there in front of
your screen over here what happens we
have a data set in which we have data
about the unemployed youth across the
globe so country wise from 2010 to 2014
the percentage of view that is
unemployed within that particular
country we have data about that now what
if I want to find only for a particular
country say Afghanistan in this example
and in that particular country I want to
find the unemployed youth between 2010
to 2011 or you can say percentage
increase in the unemployed youth in
Afghanistan between 2010 to 2011 now
what should I do
so basically what I need to do is in
this particular dataset I need to
perform certain analysis that analysis
should give me the percentage increase
in unemployed youth in Afghanistan
between 2010 to 2011
so this basically explains what is data
analysis and why we use it if you have
any doubts with respect to what is data
analysis you can write it down in your
chart box it is a very simple concept
guys I don't think so there should be
any rows but still if you have anything
in your mind you are free to
scream all right so I've got
confirmation from almost everyone we
have no doubt sales so let us move
forward and understand how you can
actually perform data analysis with
Python so basically to perform data
analysis with Python you need to import
a particular module which is called
puranas so let us discuss about pandas
in the upcoming slides
what is pandas pandas is a software
module written for python programming
language which is used for data
manipulation and data analysis now it
can perform that at a fairly high
performance rate when it is compared to
other Python procedures now we can say
that pandas is actually built on top of
numpy Syfy and matplotlib matplotlib is
basically a data visualization module
that we use in Python now when we talk
about numpy and Syfy numpy is actually a
fundamental package for scientific
computing in Python so it contains a
powerful n dimensional array object it
has tools for integrating with C C++ and
it is very useful in performing linear
algebra of Fourier transform
random-number capabilities etc when they
talk about sci-fi sci-fi is again an
open-source Python module used for
scientific computing and technical
computing Syfy contains module for
optimization and linear algebra
integration interpolation special
functions Fourier transforms all those
things right will actually focus on
numpy and sci-fi in the next session for
this session will be only focusing on
pandas and we have a separate session on
matplotlib as well where I'll teach you
exactly how to perform a data
visualization using math dot lip so if
you have any doubts till now you can ask
me any doubts case so we have no
questions till now so I'll open my
pycharm and I will actually tell you how
to import this pandas library and how to
actually create our data frame so for
that I'll open my Python once
some guys over here what I need to do is
I need to first import the Pardo's
module so for that I'll type import
pandas as PD that's what they usually
keep so yeah let's follow the protocols
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to define a dictionary say that
contains the data about say my website
so we can have columns like day visitors
bounce rate alright so let's go ahead
with that I'm going to name my
dictionary say as X Y Z underscore web
so over here my first key will be day
day and largely include the day so it
will have a list of days 1 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6
yeah now my next key value pair will be
actually about visitors so I'll write in
visitors
so visitors on day one say we hired
around 1,000 visitors then we had 700
then we had say 6,000 then we had around
1k again then 400 and then say 350 yep
so the next key value pair that I'm
going to add it's a bounce rate bounce
rate is nothing but the number of people
who have visited your website but I've
left your website immediately so yeah
which is not good for any website bounce
underscore rate so bounce rate will be
around say 20 again 22nd day also make
it 23 then say 1510 and 34 yep so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
close this dictionary and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to convert this
dictionary into a panda's data frame now
how we do that let me first declare a
variable say DF and over here what I'm
going to type in I'm going to type in as
TD for par now speedy dot data frame and
the name of my dictionary which is XYZ
web now go ahead and print this data
frame and we'll see what exactly happens
so up it has converted our dictionary
into a data frame so what all columns we
are we have bounce rate we have they and
we have visitors so this is a very basic
introductory example for you all guys in
order to show you how to make data
frames using pandas library I hope you
all are clear till now if you have any
doubts any queries you can write it down
in your chat box
Ashish Jason Diwan anyone any question
Jessica Joffe are usually they are any
questions please write it out in your
chat box so we have no questions still
lost so I will open my slides and we'll
move forward and have a look at various
operations that you can perform on
pandas dataframe so these are the
operations that you can perform with
Fonda's data frame you can slice the
data frame that is if you want only a
particular
part of that data frame you can do that
you can change the index value you can
convert the data into a different format
you can actually change the kilometers
you can perform concatenation of
multiple data frames and you can even
perform joining and merging of two or
more data frames these are all the basic
operations that you can perform with
pandas so we'll move forward and have a
look at these operations one by one
first we'll look at slicing so over here
we have a data in which there is an
index value which is nothing but the ear
2000 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 here we have interest
rate and here we have USD TP in
thousands now I want to slice a
particular column from this particular
data frame so what will happen if I do
that it should only give me so when I
slice only the starting two rows it will
give me only till 2002 but when I slice
the last two rows it will give me only
for 2003 and 2004 so this is how you can
perform slicing so let me show you guys
practically how to do that so this is
our data frame guys and over here if I
only want say the starting to Rose so
for that what I can do is
instead of sprint DF I can do it as
print D F dot head and I want to leave
the starting two rows so I'll keep two
here and we'll see what happens when I
execute this so yep there are only two
rows that are present so this is all you
can actually print only a part of the
data and if I want only the last part of
the data that is the last two rows so
what I can do is I can convert this to
tail instead and we can do that as well
go ahead and execute this and yep you
can see that it has printed the last two
rows so this is how you can perform
slicing if you have any questions or any
doubts you can ask me right now any
questions guys alright so we have no
questions so I'll move forward and we'll
look at the other operations that you
can perform with pandas after slicing we
are going to talk about merging so what
is merging let me explain you that with
the help of an example that is there in
front of your screen so over here we
have two data frames and in one data
frame we have index values from 2001 to
2004 and another data frame we have
index values from 2005 to 2008 now what
happens when I merge both of these data
frames let us see what happens now these
two data frames can be merged together
to form a single data frame and we can
actually make sure what all columns that
we need to keep common so over here we
have common columns as HPI interest rate
and index but when I talk about GDP if
we have two u.s. GDP one is X and
another is Y so this is how actually you
can perform merging you can actually
make sure what all columns you want in
your final merged data frame so we have
a question from Jason he is asking what
about the index the index has been
changed alright Jason nice of the vation
so what happens is I have actually
removed the index the index values that
was here earlier I've actually made that
as 0 1 2 3 so I'll don't worry so don't
worry Jason I'll actually open my item
and tell you guys how to do that
practically but before that if you have
any doubts you can ask me right now any
doubts all right so we have no doubt so
I'll open my Python once again so this
is my pie charm again guys I'm going to
show you the merge operation so for that
what I need to do is I need to import
this panels modules for that Antartica
import pandas as PD
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to define a three data frames let
me name it as DF one and over here what
I'll type in and type in PD dot data
frame and I'm going to use the top and
inside the topple I'm going to define a
dictionary and I'll be using multiple
lists inside that dictionary so the
first key that will use is HPI house
pricing index and the value that are
assigned to HPI is a list and in that
list I'll play certain values so let it
be 80 comma nine T comma 70 comma 60 all
right so now I'm going to define one
more key and I'm going to name it as
interest underscore rate and the value
that is assigned to this is a list which
contains the interest rate so I'll type
in 2 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 now I'm
going to define one more key and I'm
going to name it as say IND underscore
GDP
and now I'm going to define a list here
so for that I'll type in the values 50
comma 45 comma 45 comma 67 all right so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
close this dictionary and I'm going to
define the index values so for that I'll
type in AZ index equal to whatever the
values that I want in my index so I just
want be here so on type in 2001 comma
2002 comma 2003 comma 2004 so this is a
first date of a when a second data frame
also will do something like similar to
this and type in PD dot data frame open
and close parentheses and over here I'm
going to define the same key value pair
that is HP eyes let me copy it
all right so we have HPI now I'll define
one more key value pair and that is
interest rate so again I'm going to copy
this whole thing and I'm going to paste
it here and the same India's GDP also
I'm going to copy in and I'm going to
paste it here now as in the I've done in
the previous data frame as well I'm
going to define the index values for
that I will type in index equal to a
list then my index values will start
from 2005 so I'll type in 2005 comma
2006 comma 2007 comma 2008 I forgot the
comma here so yeah comma and now we have
two data frames so now what I can do is
I can go on and merge these two data
frames so for that what I'll type in I
will define one variables say merge
equal to PD dot merge and the data
frames that is DF 1 comma DF 2 now go
ahead and print merge and we'll see what
happens
print merge go on and print this so as
you can see that we have merged the two
data frame that is the F 1 and DF 2 and
we have got one single data frame now
what if I don't want to keep certain
columns as common when I perform the
merge operation so what I can do is I
can write in the columns that I want to
keep as common so suppose if I want only
the HPI column to be common so I'll just
type in here on HDI and when I go ahead
and print this so as you can see only
this particular column is common that is
HPI rest everything we have two
different columns for that that is
India's GDP that is x and y again we
have interested as x and y so this is
how you can perform merge operation if
you have any questions or any doubts you
can write it down in your chat box any
questions guys any questions
Ashish Dave Theon Jason Jessica are you
see Java T alright so we have no
questions now what I'll do I'll again
open my slides and we'll see the other
operations that you can perform it's
pandas
so we saw a merging operation right now
let us move forward and have a look at
the next operation that is joining so in
joining what happens the two data frames
are joined on the basis of their index
values so let me show you that so we
have two data frames one is this and
another one is this so over here what
happens when we join both of these data
frames so let us see what happens as you
can see that by joining these two data
frames we get this one single data frame
now one thing to notice here guys as
I've told you earlier as well joining
happens with your index values so over
here you can see that we don't have any
index called at two thousand five over
here as you can see that we have no
index that is two thousand five
but after joining the two thousand five
index appears in the data frame but
there is no interest rate or u.s. GDP
thousands associated with it similarly
when I talk about the data frame - that
is the second data frame over here we
don't have any two thousand two index
value so the value with respect to two
thousand two will be any N and for
unemployment also will remain as n a n
now you must be wondering what is n a so
when there is no value attached to a
particular index it rises as n a n that
means not unnumbered so let me
practically show you how to perform a
joining I will again open my file charm
and we are going to perform joint
operation in that so this is my charm
guys and over here I have two data
frames DF 1 and DF 2 which I asked we
use in order to show you the merge
operation now for join operation what
I'm going to do is I'm going to remove
this HPI key value pairs from the
dictionary and same I am going to you do
it to the second data frame as well and
instead of interest rate I am going to
write in here as low-tier hpi-o
underscore tyr underscore HP I and
certain values to it so yep I'm going to
type in here as 50 comma 45 comma 67
comma 34 and instead of India's GDP I am
going to type in here as an employment
and certain values to it so I'm going to
name it as one three seven six five six
one three five six sorry alright
exercise it anything doesn't matter
now let me just change these index
values so I'm going to type in Harrah's
2001 2003 2004 and let this be 2004 only
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to type in joined equal to DF 1
dot join DF 2 and print joined let's go
ahead and execute this and see what
happens so over here what happens in
2002 we have no values that is attached
to lower-tier HPI and unemployment so it
has actually printed n/a and that is not
a number and in 2004 we actually have
both the values available so it has
printed that so this is how joint
operation happens if you have any doubts
or questions you can ask me any
questions guys so we have no questions
right now so I'll again open my slides
and we'll see the other operations that
we can perform with pandas so we saw
exactly how to join two data frames and
let us move forward and see what is the
other operation now we are going to
change the index and column headers now
let us see what how this actually
happens so we have two data frames here
so one contains index interest rate and
US GDP in thousands another has index as
the year and we have only US GDP
thousands there is no interest rate here
so what happens when I change the column
headers or I change the index so over
here as you can see I've changed the
index value as the interest rate and I
have changed the column header as GDP
instead of u.s. GDP in thousands so
don't worry guys I'll actually open my
pycharm and show you practically how to
do this
now first what I'm going to do is I'm
going to remove all of this and I'm
going to define one data frame let it be
DF and now over here I'm going to type
in key value pairs in the dictionary so
first of all I'll write in say de and
inside that I'll type in 1 comma 2 comma
3 comma 5 or 4 now one more key value
pair so I'll type in here as visitors so
in day one we had around 200 visitors
then we are 100 visitors then 230 and
then we had 300 visitors 230 and then we
had 300 visitors and I'll give a one
more comma and I'm going to find one
more key value pair so for that I'm
going to use the key as bounce rate and
and I've already explained you what
exactly bounce rate is so I'm just going
to type in the values 2045 comma 6 t
comma 10 all right so we have this
particular dictionary so in that
dictionary let me convert this to a
panda's data frame for that i'll type in
pd dot data frame and it will convert
this to a data frame let me open and
close parentheses as i forgot i will
convert this over to a lowercase o and
yeah i've made a mistake in the syntax
so it actually has open and close
parentheses
I need to add ye also here now go ahead
and print this so we have got this
particular data frame now I want to
change this index value say I want de
here to be my index value so for that
what I can do is I can type in here us
DF dot set underscored index and I want
my index to be de
and that's it now go ahead and print
this and we'll see what happens
and overhead I need to type in here as
in place equals to true now when I go
ahead and print this as you can see des
has become my index value so this is
pretty easy guys so you just need to set
your index value whatever you want and
you can get that data frame with it now
my next task is to convert one of the
column headers so say instead of day I
want to convert it to date so let me
first remove this so now I want to
convert one of the column headers so for
that what I can do is DF
so as you can see we have successfully
changed the index value to day so I can
even plot this so for that what I need
to do is I need to just import one more
library which is
my plot lab I'll have a separate session
on matplotlib so you don't need to worry
much about it
plot depth dot pipe lot
as PLT now import from matplotlib
imports time
old-style alright and now what I'm going
to type in here I'm going to type in
style dot use 538 yep I'll keep it as
538
and now I'll remove the spread statement
our I'm going to do is I'm going to type
in D F dot plot
PLT dot show go ahead and execute this
graph in which the bounce rate is
represented by the blue color line and
the red color line represents of
visitors so these are our index value or
you can say the day and these are the
values corresponding to that particular
day so this is how you can actually plot
it though you don't need to worry it
much about data visualization part
because I'll be covering that in the
upcoming session I just wanted to show
you how this works so I've just given
you a good example of that that's all so
you can visualize now our next task is
to actually change one of the column
headers so for that how what I can do is
first let me remove all this now suppose
if I want to change the column header
from visitors to users so how am I going
to approach this task now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to type in here as DF
equals to DF dot rename columns equal to
I want to replace two visitors with
with what I want to replace it I can
replace it with users now go ahead on
print DF and you can see that column
here that has been changed
instead of visitors we have users now so
this is all you can actually change the
column errors and index values if you
have any doubts any questions with
respect to this particular operation you
can write it down in the chat box or
related to all the topics that we have
discussed still no any questions guys
so we have no question still low so I'll
open my slice again and we'll see one of
the other operations that spawned us
concatenation so you have a student data
in which you have name age sex and phone
number now you want to hide email
address to this particular data so you
can perform concatenation and add the
email address field at the end of this
particular data
nobody guys'll actually show you
practically how to perform concatenation
so this is my Python guys so in order to
show you concatenation I'm going to
paste the two data frames that I have
created earlier I don't want to type it
again because it's going to take a lot
of time so I'm just pasting it now in
order to perform concatenation I'm going
to declare a variable say concat equal
to PD dot concat DF 1 comma DF to go
ahead and print this and we'll see what
happens
so yep as you can see that we have
concatenated the two data frames so the
index values are from 2004 for the first
data frame and then it starts from 2005
to 2008 for the second data frame so as
you can see that concatenation has been
successfully performed so we have
indexed values from 2001 to 2008 and for
the first data frame it is still 2004
after the second data frame it starts
from 2005 till 2008 so this is how you
can perform concatenation if you have
any doubts or any questions with respect
to this particular operation you can ask
me any questions guys all right so we
have no questions so I can go back to my
slides and see what is the next
operation that we are going to see
now comes data munging so data munging
basically means that you can actually
convert a particular format of data into
a different format so if you have a data
which is in say CSV file you can convert
it to an HTML similarly you can perform
that operation with the other data
formats as well so let me actually show
you that I'll again open my PyCharm so
this is my Python guys let me first
remove all of this and I'm going to
actually read a CSV file which is there
in my system
locally displays it in my system so I'm
going to read that file so for that what
I'm going to do is I'm going to type in
this this is nothing but I have define a
variable country and in that country
what I am doing is I'm using the
partners module in order to read the CSV
file which is present at this particular
location and finally this index
underscore call equals to 0 actually
make sure that I have no index present
in that particular data frame that's all
so now what is the operation that we are
going to see here we are going to
convert the CSV file into an HTML file
so for that what I am going to type in
country dot to underscore HTML
open closed parenthesis and I can say
edu dot html' now go ahead and execute
this and we'll see what happens
and I'm going to open my project folder
as you can see that edu dot HTML is
added when I click over there it gives
me the HTML code for that now what I can
do I can copy this path and I'm going to
open my browser and I'm going to paste
that path and we'll see what happens yup
so we have got this particular HTML
table so it was in CSV format we
converted this to an HTML format so this
is how you perform data munging with
pandas
any questions they need out still here
guys how to perform data munging so we
have no questions till now so we'll be
more specific and we'll see a use case
in which we have the data about the
global youth unemployment let me show
you how it looks and open my slides
again so we have a data set in which we
have the percentage of unemployed youth
globally so for every country we have
the data of the percentage of unemployed
youth from 2010 to 2014 so what is the
problem statement for this particular
case study let us move forward and see
that so basically I want to find the
change in the percentage of unemployed
youth for every country from 2010 to
2011 so what I want I want to see how
the trend is what is the percentage
change between 2010 to 2011 for every
country so we'll see that first let me
show you how the data set looks like so
it looks something like this we have the
country name then we have country code
for then 2010 the percentage of
unemployed youth same goes for 11 12 13
and 14 so this is how our data set
actually looks like so this is our data
set looks like we have the country name
then we have the country code and then
over here we have in 2010 the percentage
of unemployed youths 4 similarly for 11
12 13 and 14 as well so let us move
forward and actually perform at this
data analysis in which we are going to
find out the percentage change in the
unemployed youth between 2010 to 2011 so
for that again an open by PyCharm so let
me first remove all this so now I
already have the code in order to do
that so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to paste it and I'm going to
explain you what exactly I'm doing so
this is the code guys over at first I
have imported a couple of libraries I
wanted panels I've imported Paula's Matt
Lorde lip for visualization and the
style is 538 let me tell you guys you
don't need to worry a lot about
visualization because I'm going to teach
you visualization in detail in the
upcoming sessions so for now just focus
on pandas and the various operations
that we can perform with it now I define
one data frame that is country and this
is PD read that CSV which is present in
this particular path so I have my data
set which is present in this particular
path and then what I've done I've made
the index value as
that means I don't want any index that's
all after that I've defined one more
data set DF in which there will be only
the top five values of the particular
data set that means it will contain only
the first five rows of the data frame
country after that what I have done I
have defined an index value that is
country code I only wanted country code
to be my index value and after that I
have defined one more data frames SD in
which I want to reindex the columns that
is I want only 2010 and 2011 to be my
columns and so so let me first show you
how this St data frame looks like let me
comment this first
and I'll show you how SD looks like
so you have as you can see we have the
index value as country code and we have
only 2010 and 2011 column headers that
is only for the five rows all right so
this is how is the data frame looks like
now let me uncomment these lines and
I'll remove this print statement
now after that what I have done I've
defined one more data frame DB which is
nothing but the difference of index
difference between the two columns after
2010 in 2011 so that will actually give
me the percentage change in each and
every country between 2010-2011 in the
percentage of unemployed youth so after
that I'm using a bar plot so finally I
have just showed it with the help of a
graph let me show you how this looks
like I'm going to run this and we'll see
what happens so yep this is a graph over
here as you can notice in Afghanistan
between 2010 to 2011 there has been
almost a rise of 0.25 percent of
unemployed youth and when I talk about a
Geo not is Angola in that there is a
negative trend that means the percentage
of unemployed youth in Angola has been
reduced when I talk about Albania in
Albania it has increased that is from
2010 to 2011 there is an increase of
around 1.25 percentage of unemployed use
in the country when I talk about unabled
almost three point one percent of
increase is there in terms respect to a
percentage of unemployed youth between
2010 to 2011 and for a re that is United
Arab Emirates there has been no change
that means in 2010 and 2011 they were
exactly the same percentage of youth
that was unemployed now over here I can
perform multiple operations as well say
if I want to find out this for 2011 and
2012 so I can just keep it that way and
I can just go on and run this so as you
can see here in Afghanistan between 2011
to 2012 the percentage of unemployed
youth has went down by almost one point
two five percent then I talked about
Angola there is no change for Albania it
has increased around 1.5 percent and it
has increased to one percent for a
united arab emirates there has been
no change this so this is an example
that I've shown you where we have
performed an analysis on global youth
unemployment data this is just an
introductory example pretty basic
example that I've shown you there are a
lot more things that you can perform
it's pandas so we are going to discuss
all those things in the upcoming
sessions but for now this is what
partners is and this is how you can
perform data analysis and if you have
any questions any doubts you can write
it down in your chat box so we have no
questions till now again I'll open my
slides and we'll see what it has to
offer us now we are going to see how we
can use spicen for statistics so I've
shown you four basic operations that are
mean mode median and variance let me
explain you all these terms so what do
you mean by mean mean is nothing but the
automatic mean or the average value of a
particular list or any particular
sequence when we talk about median
median is what the median the middle
values so they can be high medium and
low median then we have a sequence in
which there are odd number of elements
so that time Medan will be the
centermost value but then we have even
number of elements in a particular
sequence at that time we have high
medium and low median in high median
what happens the two center values the
higher value is taken as a median and in
low median among the two center values
the lower value is taken as a medium
when we only calculate the beaded for
even number of elements then the two
centermost values the average of those
values will be taken as medium so I hope
you are clear with what exactly median
is there's no rocket science behind it
it's pretty easy
now when we talk about mode mode means
nothing but a value that has been
repeated the most so over here we can
see that one is being repeated four
times three ones four four four thrice
by ones and two was also one now when we
talk about variance variance is nothing
but what is the variation of each and
every element in the sequence from the
automatic mean so I hope I'm clear with
what exactly these four terms means if
you have any questions or any doubts you
can ask me right now any questions guys
all right so we have no question so what
I'm going to do is I am going to open my
pie charm and perform these things
practically
so this is my Python guy so over here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
import certain modules so I'll type in
some statistics import mean and I'll
type in trend mean and the sequence so I
can type in 1 2 2 2 1 3 4 1 5 1 5 now go
ahead and execute this and yep it has
given us the mean value or the automatic
mean of the sequence that we have given
so now from median I'm again going to
import the statistics module and from
that import median print median and the
sequence so let it be 1 comma 1 comma 1
comma 2 comma 2 all right let's give it
as 5 elements so it will print the
centermost element that is 1 as you can
see here 1 is here that is at the third
position we have 2 elements here and 2
elements it has printed the centermost
element of the middle element now it's
the median if I want to find in mode
here so for that I just type in mode and
I'll change this to mode go ahead
execute this and yep as you can see 1
has been repeated thrice whereas 2 has
been repeated only twice so 1 has been
repeated the most so it becomes the mode
now you can even find variants here
variants as I've told you earlier as
well it gives you the variation in the
elements from the arithmetic mean go
ahead execute this and yep you can see
the variation is 0.3 so this is how you
can actually use it for starter fix as
well
any questions any doubts later guys you
can ask me any questions so we have no
questions till now fine guys there are
no questions we'll move forward and
understand how you can use Python with
Hadoop so I'll open my slides once more
so guys you can use Python for Hadoop as
well
now what happens you need to import a
library called PI dupe and you can write
a MapReduce program in Python and
process data that is present in HDFS
cluster now let me explain you with the
help of flow diagram that is there in
front of your screen so you have some
input data which is stored in your HDFS
cluster across various data notes
now what happens you write logic in
Python in order to process that data or
the respective node managers where data
is stored now this stage is basically
called map phase and it will produce
some intermediate output so how much of
a node managers you have you'll have
that many outputs and that will be given
to our reducer now what happens in the
reduce space so this reduced phase
happens with the load balancers what
will happen whatever the output that
comes from the map phase will be
provided as the input to this reduce
phase and it will aggregate that and
provide us with the output now I know
you might not understand node managers
you might not understand data nodes all
those things so we are actually going to
discuss about this later in the upcoming
sessions so you don't need to worry
about it right now but I am just giving
the general overview and I'm just
basically telling you that you can use
Python in order to process big data
across the HDFS cluster which is present
across the HDFS cluster so if you have
any questions any doubts till now you
can ask me guys just feel free to ask me
any questions that you have in your mind
all right fine so we have no questions
as so we'll move forward and I'll just
give you a brief summary of what all
things we have discussed first these
obvious applications of Python we saw
that we can use Python for web scraping
for data analysis for testing and for
various other purposes as well then we
saw what exactly is a analysis and what
is conda's then we understood various
operations that you can perform with
pandas like slicing joining merging all
those things then we saw a case study in
which we had a data set of total number
of percentage of unemployed youth
country-wise between 2010 till 2014 and
we did some analysis and we found out
what is the percentage increase in the
unemployed youth from 2010 to 2011 then
we understood how you can use Python for
statistics and how we can use pythons
