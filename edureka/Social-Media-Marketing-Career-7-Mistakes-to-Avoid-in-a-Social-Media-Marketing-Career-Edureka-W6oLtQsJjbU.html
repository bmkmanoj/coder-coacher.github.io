Maria from across the world
my name is Amin shuffled in the inverter
get started with the webinar for today
the seven mistakes to avoid in a social
media marketing carrier before we get
started I just wanna I mean there is
this question we know that you could see
them if if one of you could just wallet
here saying that you can hear me well
then we can go straight into the webinar
perfect I got the confirmation from
shubra so I'll take that as a yes and we
can jump straight in first of all thank
you very much thank you all for being
part of the webinar today
I just promise you that by the end of
the session today that you guys would
realize possibly connect with some of
the things that you do back at work and
say that oh maybe I have been doing this
wrong on this world and possibly make
some changes to get closer towards
making a social media marketing expert
right alright so just a little bit about
me now my name is Sal of each of the
main I meet in the marketing field for
the last ten years added the digital
marketing created for the last five
years I've seen across the ecosystem in
terms of publishers in terms of product
in terms of analytics
I have many startups in entertainment in
business in FMCG all of them reach their
audience that they require get paying
customers or over might figure out what
their social media marketing plan or an
action plan should be the strategy and
eventually put them on self-starter more
so that they exactly know what to be
doing currently and successfully so I it
now I almost
and breathe social media because in some
sense it is the perfect equation balance
of advertisers and publishers so I'm
very excited to kind of be here talking
to you guys about what possible
challenges or mistakes that we do while
having a carrier in the social media
marketing so I am assuming that all of
you guys who are on the call basically
have some prior knowledge or have some
kind of the job already in social media
but if not not to worry at least you
will learn as to what you could be
getting into if at all you land up a job
and social media at the future right
quick housekeeping announcements so
there is this questions we do or if you
do it my love please go ahead and jot in
your questions at any point in time
during the webinar acid man I feel the
timing is right I could answer it them
up there or if not I should keep it for
the end of the session okay so I guess
we could get started in a bit perfect
okay so first what is the objective of
today's webinar right I mean I'm sure
something caught in this from the topic
so as I said my assumption was you're
already working as part of the social
media job or you were planning to get
into work so for both cases there are
certain things that you need to know
that you should guard against or you
should avoid falling into what why
because you have to stay stay for us as
part of this job because if someone was
already so they need to take your seat
if you for making for you to make that
first mistake right second major
greatest you get to rectify early if you
know these are mistakes that you will
possibly do it as part of your career
you have a chance now
- possibly rectify pretty early so that
you don't actually end up going all
through the mistakes in the driving in
organic growth which is something social
medias a channel promises but people
fail to see it doesn't mean organic
growth channel they think that there is
really startled seen some steps to do so
assuring that you wipe the mistakes you
would definitely seen organic growth
then why we went the wheel why wait for
you to make the mistakes when I'm
supposed to keep the money coming in
terms of ROI so money spent and what is
the return you get without any glitches
even very assured way without any
problems of course I mean you will get
promoted for the work that you do people
would love you because you hardly fail
in this space and people are just gonna
keep you growing and growing because
that's the power of the channel right so
without any further delay first thing
you know I want some participation here
how do you feel thing so she beat us
fully about science I mean this is one
group of people and there is this other
group of people who think that source
should be less fully about art now just
I just want a quick split you know if
you if I say social media marketing is
hundred-percent if you can split it as
let's say in percentage like let's say
you know 50 78357 PR of 60 signs 40 are
I would like to see what you guys think
like like in terms of a splitter let's
just keep it Korea
supercilious 32 signs and 72 art maybe
she picked up on hee hee I'm guessing hu
sorry I don't know but picked up on a
30/70 split of 32 signs and 72 art I
would like to see possibly another
person getting it in the terms of the
split just to get like a different view
if at all you'd have a different view
dog from the spirit of science or not oh
if I don't know okay 5050 says it and
see the beauty of the beauty of knowing
the split of how you see social media
marketing in terms of science or are
exactly tells you what kind of person
you are right if not more the creative
person who believes that any kind of
marketing is about the kind of
creativity you showing each of this it
doesn't have a need to be social media
doesn't need to be digital in any field
of marketing if you feel it's all about
art then you're possibly one of the
street in high school wants to take all
the credit for three too hard
it's if you do the creative right
everything is just well work right but
if you grow up more bias towards science
then you would kind of say that you know
what I don't care what the creator is
end of the day I am sure that if I
follow the process if I understand the
science behind the whole thing I'll be
able to crack it but here's the bad news
right the bad news is for anyone who's
biased towards anyone of this you who
are setting yourself up for failure
so I mean eligible to knives is a
perfect spread right I mean he's he's
chosen like a split of fifty fifty fifty
two sides and fifty two are in theory
this is nice impractical I have not seen
anyone yet who has mastered this so a
good start to her entire career and
social media marketing if you already
have one or your plan
to get into work is to stop evaluate
what you feel about this how do you
split between science and art if you are
growing bias towards any particular
water type you exactly know that
something is gonna go wrong at some
point in time that's why I want to leave
as a thought here the first here is the
first awesome mistake that every one of
us love to be right there like we all
are Lessman we all want to be saying yes
to everything that comes away I mean
it's a immune psychology thing or it's a
general acceptance methodology bit where
people say that hate yeah what oh you
want me to do this sure I'll do it
you want me to execute this sure I will
do this I mean a typical person who who
has this mindset which is like take it
as it comes
it has fast water but it's like if you
hear the word strategy you be like what
what is this word strategy I don't even
know what this strategy is if you hear
the word goals like you know what are
your social media marketing goals you
will hear what is that even water how
does that even matter you're like you
don't believe in something called the
road map you are happy executing
instructions you love running campaigns
you meet deadlines that is the perfect
character of who you are so if you are
one of these persons and if you fall
into these this character then you
better stop and think that if you are
doing this you will continue doing this
for a long long time you will not grow
up the ladder you people will just be
happy that hey you know we give this
person this set of things to do this
person will do it man they're not a good
way to address this is possibly slow I
know it is difficult I mean for people
who just have executed instruction
run campaigns early deadlines it's
difficult or even doesn't make sense for
them to think of words like strategy
goals abroad but a good start is to
start looking at what is the overall
strategy for this engagement what are
the goals this advertiser has Apsara and
goals doesn't eat getting a campaign
done by end of the day what is the death
Road manner when I say road map in a
quick way it is about in the extent of
time what are the eventually wanting to
get it do so stop being yes ma'am and
stop being a mere executor do not take
it as it comes
start seeing the big picture of what is
the strategy what are the groans that
word and what is the roadmap of this
approach well if you thought what I
explained to you in the previous slide
was something very useful the second
mistake that people I mean almost every
person I know who's coming to social
media marketing has made this mistake
which is equating presents to
awesomeness right people get excited
just creating a social media presence oh
this is a new channel oh this video you
know what let me go free it in a photo
video for my advertiser caught up not
realizing hey you know what I just got a
account created for you big deal because
you feel it's just sheer awesomeness to
just create a presence because here is
what you're going through you feel that
you capture as many channels as you can
it's like a pirate method on it when
talent we right I'm like I need to take
any channel out there because end of the
day the number of brands I represent our
presence or number of social media
channels my brand is represented on is
all that matters
you will ensure that the content details
are correct all the regular information
you know what this company does this
this this I will approve the logo here's
the cover page
and you just wait for others or the
audience to discover it right please
avoid if at all anything else if I were
to request you guys any one of you
connecting with this if you think if
just creating a presence is abord social
medias on this get out of that mindset
today we live in a very golden era which
is very few players are out there who
understand the space and soon you will
realize that people who just eat make
presents to us and test will this become
why they will not exist because that's
all they will get to the one that ended
up the social media marketing experience
I have seen people walk them to the
instated yes I know social media
marketing and when I asked them okay
what is the depth on there like you know
I prayed to the Facebook create a crater
them in your page have created a liquid
crater updated all the information I
have ensure that all the details are
correct and that's it the practice
extremely happy do not if you are seen
if you if you're doing this as of today
get all of it
it's not about person so low well the
third one right yeah I already
screwed video few more or do you or do
you guys we would know that this
character insist Uncle Scrooge is this
develop from the yester years of
cartoons
who basically owns a lot of money right
there is a third classical mistake that
people and social media not relate the
most of these guys because they are the
cool guys is the social media marketing
is the cool guys people want to spend a
lot of money of social media marketing
especially advertisers now it's fine
advertisers want to spend money we
survive we live because of these are
but the problem is we are not trained
enough to figure out how I'm there to
spend it so many times what we do is we
know like one or two tips or tricks or
one or two ways of spending money and
that's it now if I find tomorrow
something new comes about go spend
because here is the one basic thing that
is Sigma mind all through I am
continuing to think again and again that
more spend the more I spend I get more
audience I mean it's a some zoo
ballistic world out there right I am
able to order anything online
I am able to pay for anything online i
carded by my audience of course you can
buy your audience which means I spend
more I get more audience okay so here is
a second fallacy that follows it right
oh so poor audience means I get more
customers really good luck with that
because all you pick up is a spend agent
on campaigns even going to get me run
campaign one can't be too careful
he kept it for I'm like wow I ended up
spending ten percent of the clashed
budget in the first day of the month
love that is an improvement now I can go
back to my client colonel tries to say
that hey I was able to spend so much the
capacity so much more the there is an
opportunity to spend more therefore I
get to on a more yes what that client is
going to leave you your advertiser your
brand the advertiser or the brand or the
client are going to leave you if you go
into making this mistake or the
pentateuch basis but obviously you are
the cool person right here is what you
would do you would keep looking for new
channels you would keep looking for new
opportunities new types of apps
new ad formats many times people who are
biased a lot towards creativity
where they think that the majority of my
thing is art end up doing this because
for them they come up with the best
creative there and I need to figure out
they're all I could spend money I am
going to get an organic growth because
my mindset is very simple I spend a lot
more I get more audits and more audience
means more customers I am like super sit
good luck with that
it's not going to work it definitely is
not gonna work so next time you are
caught taking extra budgets without
figuring out the strategy behind why
what how we spend on certain campaigns
on all certain channels please stop
money will cover budgets will come as
long as there is more sites around to it
if you go only with signs are early with
that it's gonna fail you I mean I don't
know how many of you are tidbit my last
webinar which was a framework for you
guys to figure not an effect for the
effective social media marketing which
was the o ABC PPP free book you guys can
actually check that frame-up out on
SlideShare if the Wreckers put it up it
should get you started at least to think
as to where should I start spending why
should I start spending how to start
spending it's a very simple easy to
remember framework that ensures that
even if nothing else is understood you
you still know that you're safe against
you know the random spend so grab the
thoughts when coming up with respect to
social media marketing so I repeat that
for you it's o ABC PPP framework for
social media marketing alright so as I
said as we are speaking if there are any
questions please feel free to do this
lock it down and the questions window
for me happy to take it as it comes
always I'll just wait till there will be
you know the oldest form of
communication was the radio right then
the problem is they called it the oldest
form of communication now here's the
problem I have when you call it the
oldest form of communication
you already assume that the radio is the
form was one form of communication right
what is the problem with the radio the
radio is just one wave you thought
you're not going to share back from your
audience at any given point in time
right so all you end up doing is you
think that becoming the radio is
communicating right so if you capture
yourself doing one of the following
things let's let's go through that right
brand content generation is presenting
which means see think about this equate
this to the radio what what do you love
about the radio you're stuck in a
traffic jam when you have the ready pen
pen when you're stressed when you have
nothing else to do you are watching you
are just listening to the radio regular
talking back you just listening right so
the power behind the radio is the pawn
think there is a lot of pointing that
comes in the radio which you love great
okay
sometimes you don't like it you keep
changing fine but that can't happen for
an advertiser or a brand right the idea
is to keep your audience the brand or
their prizes audience continuously
engaged now as you see if you become the
radio your speciality is brand content
generation you are the best for creating
the part it you meet all these deadlines
these guys said you know what the
advertiser or the brand will cover say
hey I need this this content to be said
I want this this content to be done I
want all of this to be ready
but then what do you do you take this
brand you take this content and then we
meet these deadlines and weighing the
advertisers of the client huh remember
we are not talking of the social
channels yet we are just saying then how
you are the best content creator out
there how you go meet this brand content
delivery deadlines all clearer and then
you are employed just to on the basis of
hate how much content and quality
content that you'll be generating for a
while because deep down you think that
your content is what is driving all the
results why because the perception of
results is based upon you are on thought
of how your content will be perceived
how your world thought that will be
consumed
you think that okay if you stop
everything will fail that's why you will
not stop will continue producing this
content and keep going back to the
audience in football even you're doing
this as 10% of your job where you just
becoming a mere radio just stop look
back in your daily list of activities do
not look for an exact match right all
I'm trying to ask you use this question
that if at any given point in time if
your job fit all in univille so are your
tasks predominantly revolves about pure
content creation becoming the radio or
reaching an audience is the one wave
format you are setting yourself for
freedom a friend stop realize again
again and again it boils down to the
same to fritz
although by splitting between an art and
sites
so what take away from the slide is do
not make up the radio do not become one
way communicators do not become content
generation specialists it is good to be
content Edition specialists but do not
make that as part of your mainstream job
it is always going to go hand in hand
with respect to what is the overarching
strategy roadmap and then if you are
able to bring in your content expertise
on top of it you know mash it up with
some good metrics figure on the
engagement metrics figure out how you're
going to handle this audience based on
different parameters that you lay out
for they gave me strategies so you are
set
okay now that we just talked about
becoming the radio here is taking it to
the next level right the next level is
absolute planting diarrhea show fairness
is the audio coming in and one of you
confirm that you be near me I would
requires a request one of you guys to
confirm that you can hear me please
perfect thank you for that and this jump
right back into it so we just talked
about becoming the radio in terms of
what make communicators becoming content
specialist but then here is the other
thing you take this to the next level
you end up in a state what I call as
content area when I say we content area
of course I mean let me not get into the
process of what content area is but here
is the bill any channel you take you
want to own
three piece of real estate what does it
mean has anyone heard
I mean I'm sure people would have heard
of this term called sheriff voice there
is a reason there is a term called share
of voice right
Shannon Weiss in a very gently terminus
if there for example two people two big
brands of selling shoes like let's take
a little of the selling shoes Nike
selling shoes then if you take all the
conversations surrounding shoes we
measure how many people mentioned Nike
and how many people mentioned Adidas and
what is the percentage split that is
what sheriff voice means so why sheriff
voice is good because it helps an
audience compare branch against a common
point but the problem is since we have
become so popular to him we want to
dominate the share of voice so what do
we do the only way we can dominate
sheriff wise is to pump all channels
with so much content to your relevant
audience that they do not get the chance
to see anything from your competitors
all they get to see is stuff that you
pump in and get us to sweeten the deal
to give them like a bunch of hashtags
each because for you a hashtag
differentiates one content from the
other you use you repeat you reuse you
know you you as I said you become a
content experts fantastic but then it is
all aboard dominance of share of voice
and in
cheering that there are and I don't see
one me you and nobody else
if at all you have that mindset or even
come remotely thinking of something like
this
beware attention Appa stop right now
ensure that there is a healthy share of
voice ensure that Sheriff voice
increases because of engagements not
because of the increased contact there
is a term called optimum font ratio and
it is very important that you do not
beat the ratio to the match because it
is like this curving it's like a curve
ball it will come back and strike you
the same way you want to strike this
chatter voice so just to go through this
you want every piece of real estate you
do not try to give an audience to see
any other content use classic mindset to
dominate loading up with a whole bunch
of hashtags as if each one is like a
great source of part it repeating
reusing is good but people end up doing
it because sometimes the run out of
content I guess that they just chucked
back to their old bag of tricks of bring
them in like you know old woman a new
model you compare your metrics based on
the output of competitors but people
hardly do this is actually healthy
practice but when you do it when this
content data is not good work for you
and you ensure that the same messages go
across all channels again it's a good
thing when content delivery is a little
optimal skill but if you are doing it
across all channels which means you're
ensuring that you will drive your audit
result without a doubt okay
oh wait I am hearing someone saying or
you do not predict it again sorry quick
confirmation are people able to hear me
I would require one more confirmation
please perfect thank you very much
I got the gun formation for the office I
mean I'm sure all of us love exclusivity
wait what do you mean exclusive why why
do why do we like carrying these
membership cards why do we love men
meant someone armed race like no or what
if given a choice if you don't have to
spend money you will obviously take a
business class secret you would not take
that part of the class is the same way
that we all want some form of
exclusivity exclusivity drives people
exclusivity drives engagement
exclusivity drives action exclusivity
makes the audience feel more connected
exclusivity brings you the results makes
them feel at home you can not tell not
overlook this so here is what if you end
up doing missing out on exclusivity this
is what you rendom do you would think
for example maybe you're a digital
marketing manager you have like a set
budget you have to split across like
different channels like I have this
player paid search I have paid social I
have video I absurd I email campaigns I
have all these things and I need to
split Waverly a nice thing that okay
social media is just another channel I
need to just put some money into social
media banner I'm not rigorous for you
one of the biggest objectives asking
digital marketing manager this
sustaining omni-channel content what are
the Sami Channel wanted I mean don't get
like flustered by it it's very simple
basically you think that it's all about
getting the same content for every child
you said he doesn't matter in the social
media display email block for me I have
created some content I need to ensure
that the same content goes for each of
the channels so what does that mean
because you think social media is just
another part of your channel set you do
not change anything specific to social
media for possible we'd also the same
content just close in the safest way in
all of the challenge
and what do you feel that is the
successful thing that you do for you
successes of what consistency here like
bang bang bad I will be consistent I
will be consistent I will be consistent
that's it I mean you are happy when
consistency happens in terms of content
across all channels and if you drilled
out your job if you're doing this job
here I have this content I will take
different sizes of this creative and
I'll put it in each of these channels if
you and if you end up putting up for
long
a wrong landing page
it or some errors in contact you get me
the list if at all this is the kind of
job you are already doing or if you get
a good job and if you end up doing stuff
like this where your coal or the quality
core responsibility is to ensure that
all channels get the same content there
will be no changes the only changes will
be reading factoring the content to
featuring each channel and spending on
them stay away from it
trust me it has no value you will not
see the problem let me let me do this
again all the stuff that we've been
seeing so far the each one of this slide
is what people are doing today they I
mean each one each slide is basically
what people have as a Java
I've seen people as having this a jar
now the problem is these are the people
who will find social media marketing for
it because that's what they do and
that's what they think social media
marketing is so when you say a certain
is text on one social media marketing
carrier it means these are not mistakes
these are the jobs and actions we have
be part of today until and unless you
achieve and attain a bigger purpose of
social media marketing you will find
this very boring you will find this non
engaging and it will be like what does
everyone talking about social media but
really become a social media marketing
expert I know already what social media
marketing is I either I do all of this
stuff so the mistake can also be
relooked us me thinking that what I do
is what social media marketing is about
and a perfect case is this exclusivity
separate you know I mean I could talk to
us about how to garner exclusivity for
social media
but that's all the point the idea is if
you forget but so forget to acknowledge
the social media channel is and I you
have to use the challenge to build
exclusivity in terms of content in terms
of the way you communicate that engage
you lost you lost the whole thing
already at the beginning itself people
even your manager will be happy that
you're doing your list of tasks to
fantastic perfection but you lose your
of the purpose and the last one way
typical behavior of many social media
marketers I mean so this is not specific
to a job but this is what the key
agencies do right when a brand engages
with the agency and if you're working
with an agency of planning to work with
an agency this is what happens you do
not want to respond to everybody out
there you know yeah because people are
always saying some stuff you can't just
be sitting there responding to every lab
right that's what you would think you
would just if someone says something
nice you go and say hey thank you hey
what's up hey lovely it's it's yeah it
was great very nice to engage with you
awesome and you feel that you know doing
and giving response just in a hurry is a
bad thing for you right that would you
feel they could take anyway he's taken
time to say something I will not
immediately go and respond let me take
some time and come back and think about
it I figured what to tell him and then
if at all I need you of course
the good thing is your responsibility
stream gauge with audience and you may
or may not be polled that you will
respond to the people just the good ones
and part of your responsibilities just
about just closing the look
think about it I would not many job
profiles
specifically under the names of it all
social media community managers or
social media channel community managers
are opened up predominantly because
organizations have began to realize what
response time is and how critical having
a shorter response time is how becoming
close to real-time engagement with
audience leads to a healthy atmosphere
how you can convert every negative into
an opportunity for engagement this is
where all the cool stuff happens but
unfortunately I have seen as part of
jobs like this what people do is exactly
this they wait for someone to say
something nice they go paste the
template and answer hey thank you for
this this this in fact they even copy
paste this idea they have the set
templates they control C control V there
is no voice to this book character I
mean there is a the entire set that
makes this channel interesting which is
giving your brand a socialize on social
media giving your brand a character it's
like creating a whole new human being
all of this channel that's what this
channel helps you do but yet we decide
to choose a way which it's task-oriented
just like pandora control me yes thanks
to the good stuff someone says Val you
know what I don't even care let him say
whatever he wants you wait for the good
guys but guess what you are the person
responsible for engaging with the
audience classifiers if you caught doing
them again think twice
and you as future us future social media
marketing experts will be crucial in
telling that fertilizer where to
increase this fence do not make the
classic mistake of I have lots of money
let me go spend it in every place I know
and in every place I can and the results
will be detrimental if you are both more
of an art person than a science person
any other questions guys well if you're
feeling shy just think just shoot
anything that comes up your head always
happy to discuss it up okay so looks
like guys are clear so just some closing
thoughts the mistakes can be a lot more
if I have to break each one of them down
but end of the day my only closing
quarters do not equate social media
marketing to what you're doing some of
these jobs or tasks that is not social
media marketing that is possibly nothing
related to social media marketing
because what you've been doing is more
like a task as some part of it and don't
assume that you that's all you need to
know or that is enough to survive in
this jungle please try to step up try to
learn the entire ecosystem because that
is the way the industry is headed you
will be better placed if you have the
stretch of what you can do talk like an
expert all the money is coming your way
thank you very much guys for being part
of the webinar there will be a link to
the webinar sent across later and
guessing like I think a link in the text
or happy to take any questions that come
across they tell us to come thank you
very much again and Muhammad great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
