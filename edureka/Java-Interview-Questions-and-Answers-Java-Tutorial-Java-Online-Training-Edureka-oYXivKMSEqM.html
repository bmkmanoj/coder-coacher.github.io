we will be discussing some into
equations which are quite crucial and
important with respect to Java so guys
once again this is Shawn
on behalf of Eddie Riga it's been a long
time that I have been associated with
Adriana so I'm an exemplar Espenson RND
so more or less into startups as well
and it's been more than ten years for me
that I am into the Java so I am a
technocrat more or less so love to
explore Java Android and I somehow we
are you know very well connected so I'm
also an aluminized with bricks Palani so
worked across various nation there is a
South korea-us Canaanites expected trap
so this was a little bit about me let's
understand the market of Java for
support right so we're going to first of
all understand that how Java is useful
and thereafter we'll see some various
topics where we will be understanding
some integration so Dow has been great
in number one and TOB popular
programming languages index so even if
you browse on the various job in
different sites sites will be able to
see that Java has been rated as number
one programming language so it's used by
10 million developers and over 15
billion of devices they are powered by
Java and Java is nowadays very you know
popular language especially in terms of
when you come up with a mobile
application development with Android
right and Big Data Hadoop again so any D
th boxes again Java is there so Java is
used almost everywhere now and having a
fair information or the Java is always a
better thing if we compare the Java job
trends we can see the posting in India
versus posting than a US so
approximately 50,000
job postings as off for 15 March 2017 in
India and approximately more than 7,000
in United States right so that's like
the average Java job data which we can
put up it's not from the various
different prototypes right so mockery
and indeed
Lynden that you can see right so depends
now but we have taken up the maximum
from the indeed right so quite quite few
good you know job postings ever labels
now if we talk about the distribution
and the salary trends again Java
outshines right and 62% of the Java
development jobs are available in the
market right we got various different
rules in which the people can fit in we
got engineers architects programmers
lead analysis and consultants right and
we got one or two two four six dollars
per year as in you know the average
salary for a Java developer if you can
see there are various statistics
available for the salaries the gain guys
this data has been you know mine and it
is as of 15 Jan 27 2014 5 in the
interview rounds right other than that
will be taking on to the topics one by
one so will take on two hoops
that's like object-oriented programming
structure and this is the core of your
Java then we got Sollux
so they are the basic components when
you are going to write your web
application then you got Java database
connectivity where we'll be
understanding and we'll be introducing
to few of the concepts in the market
this set to the database connectivity
then spring as in the framework of
frameworks right so we'll be discussing
what is spring and emphasis will be on
the NBC part that's like
model-view-controller and lastly we'll
be discussing the hibernate so hibernate
is going to be the backend framework
right how you can opt for hibernate
instead of JDBC we'll we'll just see
some comparisons and see various interim
equations coming into that part so let's
just start with something known as the
basic questions which are asked to the
candidates in the entry process so the
very first is the difference between
three terms just like dedicate JRE and
JVM so as a Java developer you must have
a fair knowledge what exactly are these
three terms right so that
let us understand now so Java Virtual
Machine is basically an abstract machine
it's a software which is already
provided by the platform so it provides
the runtime and vomit whenever you are
writing the Java source code it gets
compiled into the bytecode so JVM is
back there which is going to execute
your bytecode now other than that you
got GRE which is our runtime environment
now it's basically where JVM is gonna
use the JRE so they are a set of
libraries required by the JVM in order
to execute your cool JDK is one
development kit required by the Java
developer so it consists of various KPIs
for you through which you can write your
code so just one instance right so JDK
will contain your various packages
coming into for example Java dot IO Java
dot util all these API is the set of
library the information that comes from
your Java development kit other than
that it has various tools also available
for example Java and Java C right so
Java C is a tool which is used for
compilation whereas Java is for the
execution of your bytecode so these
tools are also part of dedicated so
let's switch onto the next question
what is synchronization this is one of
the hot favorite questions whenever you
talk trade so we do have this term known
as synchronization so synchronization is
something where multiple threads if they
going to access the same object right so
there is only one resource which
multiple threads they want to excess you
need to come up with something known as
swing to migration so guys what is
synchronization here will take up one
example let's say we want to book a
movie ticket and it's going to be one
seat which has to be booked by multiple
people right so let's say one corner
seat in the last row has to be booked by
multiple people so multiple people over
the web will treat them as multiple
threads they are looking on to a single
object on a single resource act like the
roll Gnostic right so whosoever will
first of all try to block that feat will
be given an excess and no other person
can thereafter block that feat so
synchronization is very much in line to
this concept when you got multiple
threads which are going to work over a
single object you need to use a key well
known as synchronized with the help of
which you will be able to acquire the
lock on your objects so synchronization
is a process it's going to keep all the
concurrent rates in the execution to be
in a synchronous mode one after the
other the lock acquisition going to come
up into action synchronization will
avoid the memory consistency errors due
to any inconsistent view of the shared
memory let us understand the difference
between processes and threads now so
synchronized words came up and we
started off come to the next rate so let
us understand what exactly is process
and what is the thread not so guys in
order to come up with process and trade
let's just have one visual coming in let
us say you got this layer as an
operating system right so we'll say that
this is one operating system it can be
any who is now right it can be Windows
Mac Linux any of the flavor so when you
want to run the program
what OS will do which will create a
process right so this process will be
created by the operating system whenever
you are supposed to execute your
application so other than that what it
does is it will also give you some you
know storage space with RAM will come
into action right so further the RAM can
have various data structures are coming
into it for example you can have the
data being stored in the power of stack
or the heap right so that's like the
storage context let us say I got one
program which I need to execute so
whenever I am going to execute my
program so the running instance of your
program over the operating
system is nothing but it's a process but
in the process we have one guy known as
main threat so main trait is what this
is the guy which will execute some
instructions or you can say some
sequential tasks which you mention in
your main method right so whatever the
statements you are writing in your main
method
they are nothing they are these tasks
which are executed one after the other
via main trade within the process so
guys a process is running instance of
your program over the operating system
and a thread like a main thread is
running within the process so we must
understand threads are available within
the processes and processes are running
on top of operating system there might
be scenario that a particular task like
I'm going to highlight this task over
here so this might take a longer time
right so let us say this particular task
we take a minute off so because it's
going to affect the data from the server
now so in this context right so these
three tasks they will be blocked right
so when I am talking about these three
tasks the yellow state so they gonna get
blocked now so what we can do we can
bring down one more thread and we'll say
that this is one user thread or
childhood so we got various for the
terminologies for this guy right and
we'll offload the heavier task over here
of the main thread to the user trip in
this way what we are able to do is we
are able to outsource the heavier tasks
in some other thread and we will be
coming up with a concept of concurrent
programming that is what we want to
achieve now right so let us
son who has happened over here guys so
let's see this part now so process and
thread there are two different concepts
but we must understand now any executing
instance of a program on top of your
operating system is nothing but it's a
process so on operating system
we got multi processing whereas straight
is something which is a subset of the
process now so within a process you got
my people trick so multiple processes on
OS level multiple threading on flosses
level then you talk about the
communication so one process when it
wants to interact with the other process
we call the processes as inter process
communication we are threads within a
process they can directly interact with
each other when we talk of the control
statement so processes can only exercise
control over the child processes whereas
threads can exercise considerable
control over the threads of the same
process any change in the parent process
will not affect the child process
whereas if there is something where the
main thread is getting affected the
other user threads or the child's rate
then might get affected if you talk of
the Mamre structure so processes they're
running the separate memory space each
and every process will have its own
mammoth space whereas trades don't share
the same memory space which is being
allocated to the process by the
operating system so that once again
process is controlled by OS whereas
threads are controlled by the programmer
in a program right or you can say by the
process itself if you talk of the
dependency level processes are
independent we are threads they wanna
get dependent because if you can rotate
this image right over here so we created
this user thread and there is a
dependency that this task has been
outsourced to this user thread by the
main straight so dependency of the main
thread over the user thread relies and
vice versa right so it can be based on a
logic fever so let us move to the next
concept now so the next fundamental is
what exact
is a wrapper class now this is also one
of you know the hot favorite tuition
which is always asked what is the
wrapper class what is meant by the term
boxing or the auto boxing so let us see
this part right so wrapper classes up
they are the way bill we can convert the
Java primitive into the reference types
that's like the object so each and every
primitive site has a wrapper class
defined and it's in by default they are
available in java dot nine package you
need not to import any package so for
boolean we got boolean right for cal we
got character and for ain't we got
integer for double so on and so forth
life so wrapper classes are the means by
which you are able to convert your
primitive into the references so let us
understand what exactly is this
conversion of primitives into references
let us say I got this I as 10 so we call
this guy as a single value container
because I can continually one value it's
not an object now it's a primitive type
you want to convert this primitive guy
into in all day usage interior is signed
new of integer and you mention this guy
I as a part of constructor so what we
have done we have boxed so it's like
constructing the object now constructing
the object so that's what we have done
guys over here right so this particular
statement over here is known as boxing
on the other way around when you say in
de assign iref dot int value so this
concept is known as unboxing right
extracting
the value from object so you must
understand this concept over here boxing
words unboxing which is achieved with
the help of wrapper classes other than
that you can also save integer KF assign
I so this is known as Auto boxing right
so this instruction is translated
internally by the compiler as in integer
t ref assign new of integer where we got
this guy known as I right so this is
Auto translation you need not to write
the whole statement so you just mention
the partial statement or the implicit
statement we call it as Auto boxing and
if you write down let's say L assign TF
right so this is known as Auto unboxing
so important question again what is
boxing which is unboxing and thereafter
what is part of opting words in Auto
unboxing so the major reason why we do
boxing or unboxing is to convert
primitives in to the objects now if you
are talking about object oriented
programming structures right so we are
always thinking of objects now so if you
are able to convert primitives into the
objects it means that you are strictly
and truly following object oriented
programming structure so we got one way
of doing it and now you can also pass by
reference the primitive so that's one
more way of coming up like why you do a
boxing part so we can pass the variables
by reference is now right because here
you are getting the reference is no
object all right so let's come back now
to the next question number five that
like what are the keywords final finally
and finalized and what is exactly the
purpose of it so they are and now the
three different keywords right so even
the final term is something which
means the last thing but they are a
different meanings in different contexts
now
now finally the kind of a constant so to
mark a variable is final you can't
change its value so here if you can see
a very small snippet right so a is the
1000 and you are try to change its value
the compiler will not allow you to do so
so final is a keyword where you are able
to mark your variable as constant you
can also mark your classes to be final
in that context you cannot inherit from
that class you can also mark the map
search to be final in this regard your
methods they will not be overridden so
final can be used with three of the
concepts final ads of variable finalize
a class and final average method finally
the other context where we use it with
the exception handling techniques now so
what exactly is the place where we will
be coming up with finally so many a
times when you are writing the exception
handling code with a fly and a catch
Clause there might be a scenario
whenever the exception will come the
statements mentioned within the try
block they will not be executed below
the statement where the exception will
come right so let's say there are ten
instruction in the price and on the
fifth instruction in the try you get an
exception so below six seven eight nine
and ten instructions they will not be
executed you need finally block to
mention such instructions which must be
executed either exception comes or it
does not so finally if that piece of
block which will be executed whether the
exception is coming or it is not coming
for example if you want to close the
database connection now exception is
there or not but we would like to close
the connection at any cost
right so you mention all such statements
and yours finally block so the next part
is finalized
so guys finalize is the kind of a
destructor so whenever the object will
be removed from the memory by the
garbage collector so this finalized map
that will be executed
so you can explicitly try out for
example where you can say system dot DC
right and you need to just mention your
references to be pointing to the null
and thereafter your finalize will be
executed so you can just have a small
example on this right so what I can do I
can just demonstrate this so let's say
we got this class known as finalized
demo right and I'm just going to make
this method finalized over here so I'll
say C so object finalized right so here
we go now what I will do I will create
the object or finalized demo so I'll say
find like them FD reference assign new
off finalize demo so here we created an
instance and thereafter I will say be
raised to go as null it means it is not
pointing to anything now so later I'll
say system dot DC so this is called the
garbage collector and it's going to
destroy the objects which are no longer
required so now you can see over here so
let me run it as a java application it
says objects final why is it coming
because it's acting as a destructor call
so anything that you want to do before
your object is removed from the memory
right you can write it into the finalize
method all right so let's go to the next
concept it's a difference between spring
buffer and spring builder right so
before we jump on the spring buffer and
spring builder we must understand they
are both similar concepts when they are
compared with the spring class so string
is immutable version we are spring
buffer and string builder they are the
mutable version right so let me define
this spot what is meant by mutability
versus immutability consider you got
this string str1 which is a new strength
having holo and you got this one mode I
known as spring builder you say
sighs new string builder and you mention
hello similarly you say string buffer
let's take this guy as a buffer you say
buffer assign new offspring buffer again
follow so I have taken up these three
strings let us say fer builder and
buffer and now what is next I will be
appending the data in this print now so
you see SCR dot contact so in spring you
need to say the function as one cat so I
will say hi and similarly let us
concatenated plus a builder dot append
so in the build of the function which we
use is append and same goes with the
buffer so buffer and builder they are
quite similar now later when I will do a
C so on STR and similarly the builder
and the buffer part let us say builder
and then finally the buffer
so the buffer here we run the port you
see one major difference over here is
that you get hollow so nothing happens
when you concat the data into the SCR
right but in case of builder and buffer
the data is concatenated this is why
because strings are immutable
whereas buffers and builders they are
mutable this is also one of the very
beautiful query first of all so guys
buffer and builder they are the mutable
sequences whereas spring it is immutable
you cannot change it even though you are
going to perform an operation so what is
happening over here whenever you
concatenate the data you will be getting
a new string right so you need to store
the data into a new string so
concatenation resides the data coming
out as a new string the old string is
not changed so significant difference
between buffer and builder now we'll be
discussing shrink buffer operations are
straight ship so it means that by
default when you are going to use buffer
it will be synchronized you need not to
worry on top of multiple all conference
reading now whereas builders it's not
resist sling buffer is to be used when
multiple threads they are going to work
on the same string whereas builder is
supposed to be in a single city
environment other than that builder is
quite better as compared to buffer over
the performance part because there is no
synchronization overhead so you can just
try to write out this snippet over here
which will be able to help you to come
up with a timing difference and you will
be able to see that builder will
outshine the buffer in terms of
performance all right so let us
understand the difference between heap
and stack so stack and heap they are two
memories which are very much famous when
you talk about the Java Runtime right so
dollar runtimes the RAM we got these two
major data structure stack and heap so
first of all let us
see how the stack and heap will come
into action right so let us take one
example guys so I'll just remove this
snippet or like so let us understand the
stack and heap into action when we are
talking about the RAM allocation so this
Ram will be divided into two parts the
first part is the stack and the other
part will be the heap so this circle is
representing the heap memory so both of
them are a part of RAM now so it's a
good read of structure they are part of
Ram we got stack and heap so let us
understand this point of stack and heap
how the data will be stored and where it
will be stored I just take up one basic
example from the Eclipse now whenever
you will be creating an object so for
example finalized demo I said FD R if
assign new finalized demo this is known
as object construction statement right
so this is object construction statement
so here what we are doing we are trying
to create an object with the help of new
operator and to be very much more
precise I'll take one class like point
right and we'll define some x and y as
attributes within this class point right
and I can have one function like show
point which can just display me the data
of point so I can say point is plus the
value of X let us say a - plus y right
so that's like a pointer so how are we
creating the object of point now same
way you created a finalized demo you say
point p1 reference assign a new off
point so how this statement will be
represented in the mammal slice for this
statement to be represented in the
mammary what will be going into the
stack what will be going into the heap
let's have a close look onto that
partner p1 riff over here will reside
into the stack like this right so this
guy is p1 right it will
create on some memory location so let us
review its 4001 it will be a hexadecimal
address but I am just assuming it to be
one address over here as 2001 so this
memory location this container p1 ref is
created out over here what is next the
next part is an object which will be
constructed in the heap which will have
two compartments the first compartment
is your attribute that like X&amp;amp;Y and the
second compartment goes like the methods
show point so this is like the attribute
and the second compartment is for your
mappers now what is happening over it so
this object has no naina right so this
is having no name on the heap you don't
have any name for this guy but you can
definitely have an address over the map
let's say this is six thousand one so
this object is constructed at six
thousand one so p1 rip will have the
address of your object and this guy p1
riff is doing nothing but it is pointing
to this guy six thousand one so we say
p1 rep as a reference variable because
it is referring to the object available
at six thousand one it's not a kind of a
point or not right in order to prove
this approve this concept we can just
say this out of p1 rest when I will do a
six out of p1 r if let's say p1 rip is
plus the value of p1 rep now I'm going
to run the code you will understand that
p1 rep over here is showing me some
address of an object of type point right
since we got in the package code or I'd
wake up it will that go dot area dot
point and memory location so this is the
memory location 785 to be 9 to 2 which
p1 rep is holding for your objects so
now once we are good to go what is
available in stack what is available in
heap for this instruction right so there
is anything for which you use the new
operator that will be constructed in the
heat so heap is that memory location
where we use the new operator and new
operator is used to create the things
dynamically when I use the word
dynamically it means at runtime
it means anything which is constructed
dynamically at runtime in your program
it will reside in the heat right so
that's what the new operator will help
us to do now let us have some more
defenses between stack and heap so guys
stack memory is used only by one thread
of execution without heat memory is used
by the all parts of the application if
you talk on the excess level objects
stored in the heap are globally
accessible there a stack memory cannot
be expressed by the other threads memory
is likely foe whereas the heap memory is
basically are the pre structure not
right so the memory management is based
on the generation associated to each
object so here what we try to store at
the data is in the form of key value
pair so each and every object will have
a hash code now so that next is a key
for your object then you talk of the
lifetime so we got existence until the
end of execution of the thread whereas
heat memory will live from the start
till the end of the application
execution and your garbage collector can
anytime free this may be space if you
talk of the usage now when an object is
created over the stack so now please
guys in case of Java every object is
dynamically constructed so there is
nothing like objects being constructed
in the stack right so we are just giving
a general overview of heap and start
over here not typically in line to your
dollar these are the general difference
is now in Java your each and every
object will be constructed dynamically
in the heat space not in the stack space
so in the statue
if you will be getting the references to
the objects now right so guys whenever
an object is created it is always stored
in the heat space and staff memory only
contains the local reference variables
which are pointing to the objects in the
heap so let us move towards the next
base equation that's like the difference
between the ArrayList and a vector so
these are the two data structures these
are the two collection API is in the
Java dot util package so both of them
are quite same the very major difference
is that ArrayList is not synchronized
whereas vector is synchronous right when
your data structure is not synchronized
so the performance will be a bit more
better as compared to the other one so
that's why your ellipse will behave
faster in terms of performance as
compared to your vector if an element is
inserted into the ArrayList it increases
the size by 50 percent whereas vector
that don't do it so but they just double
the size of it sorry write an ArrayList
does not define the increment size
whereas in the vectors you can define
how much size the vector should
increment when it has reached its limit
other than that
RLS can only use iterator for traversing
whereas in vector write expect
hash-table vector is the only other
class which can use in number relations
as well so you can enumerate over the
vector with the help of enumeration we
can also you know it breaks in the
vector so that's that's like some of the
differences which are highlighted over
here similarly the other collections of
hash map and hash table so this is again
a relevant question which is asked in
the includes many times as a basic
question so hash map and hash table
again the first difference is the
synchronization right and your hash
tables they are synchronized whereas
hash map they are not synchronized hash
map allows a null key and another value
whereas hash table is to a null pointer
exception if you
try to add an ulti or on a lolly other
than that since a hashmap is not
synchronized it's gonna behave faster as
compared to the table and we can make
the hashmap as synchronized by calling
the collection synchronized map api so
it's not like that we cannot mock the
hashmap it's English we can come up with
our own logic failure right because hash
map Traverse can be done through a
grater
whereas table can be enumeration as well
as iterator hash map will inherit
abstract map class whereas hash table is
totally working on the dictionary class
now the next concept is the difference
between equals and equal to operator now
this is one you know as a new Java
developer many times will do this thing
will do this big mistake by comparing
the strings with a equal to operator so
unlike your other languages here you
need to use the equals mapper to compare
the spring not right so they'll let us
understand this concept first of all I
just try to demonstrate it by writing
one examples so let us say you got one
string if you are one as new string so
just recently we had this discussion
that this is an object construction
instruction so F here one is a reference
variable whereas a spring object will be
constructed in the heat so STR one is
having one address right so let me write
down this thing F here one is a
reference variable it is having the
address of an object
similarly I'll create one more SPR to
write so X here 2 is also reference
variable it is having the address of
some other object the difference over
here which we need to understand is that
there are two different objects which
are containing the same value hello
right so objects are containing the same
value hello and str1 and str2 they are
the two different references and having
the different value so that's why
if you want to compare it using equal to
operator right so it's gonna say STR one
let me just finish out the program and
in the else part I'll just say not of
equal to right now you will observe that
if here one is not equal to X Fiat the
reason is very similar because you are
comparing a references now so double
equal to we are comparing references
right so that's one important depends
for us to understand now when you need
to compare the objects you don't use
double equal to instead you use this
master known as dot equals right so you
say let us compare the strings using
equals method so here I will say equal
and not equals so we don't compare
strings using the equal to operator
that's very receipts it's one big
mistake you compare the strings with the
equals method equals master is not
comparing the references it is comparing
the values within the objects right so
that's what we are able to understand
comparison of references versus
comparison of value so you can take up
this program guys over here if you can
see right just go ahead and try to run
this execution we got one more program
over here let us predict the output for
this program so in the main method you
are calling the map third one with the
input as 11 so you pass this 11 over
here from here you are invoking the map
set to bypassing 11 into 11 and in the
master - you are passing method 3 which
is division of 11 and then in the method
3 you are subtracting 11 and finally in
the maps at 4 you are adding off 11 you
guys finally we will be getting the
result as 1118 right because 11 into 11
it's going to be 121 divided by 11 it's
going to be
- 11 it's gonna be 0 plus 11 again gonna
be 11 to try out this program right and
3 to 8 if you can get the same output or
not so these are some of the basic
questions right highlighted by us which
are very important and crucial from the
introspective next we'll be jumping on
to the object-oriented programming
structure now this is one key area which
company or an interviewer is looking and
expecting as a developer you should be
quite good on these concepts because the
advanced concepts or any of the
application development model it relies
heavily on object-oriented programming
structure so let us see what we can have
in the object-oriented programming
structure the very first question as in
question number 12 is the difference
between abstract classes and interfaces
so let us see some of the differences
again guys this is quite theoretical
information right but I would like to
take one very small demonstration on
abstract class versus interface but it
is pretty important to have a very fair
knowledge and this concept is linked
with your runtime polymorphism so let us
understand this concept so I am going to
create one class shape and we'll have
this master known as the draw why it so
let's have a draw method and you say see
so drawing the shape now this is
something which even we teach in the
traditional language like C C++ I mean a
native languages so this is the same
concept carried forward
we got a shape class and we got a draw
method so what you want to do you going
to create the object of shape as a sign
all that is in shape s and then say s
assign new of shape and then you can say
s dot dot so the output is very much
simple you get the master drawing shape
but I want my shape to be either as
circle rectangle or polygon right so
what I will do I will just come up with
a class known as circles so I'll say
this guy circles shall extend something
known as shape right and in a similar
way
also try to come up with something on a
rectangle and lastly I'll say a polygon
so shape as three children ah and each
and every child will be redefining the
draw method with the respective shapes
right so here we are now this is very
well understood that whenever you going
to redefine the method
so the concept of overriding will come
into action right so this is overriding
and now if you say Circle C and C assign
a new of circles and you say C dot draw
you will always get going the circle
because overriding has come into action
what I want to do I don't want to do
this concept right it's a basic concept
now that whenever you will create the
objects of size always the definition of
child will come into action as a concept
of overriding what I want to do I want
to say reference variable belongs to the
parent and the object belongs to the
child now this is known as polymorphic
statement so how it is a polymorphic
statement now the guy shape s is
pointing to circle so shape is now
behaving after the let us assume that
now this instruction is equated it's
very very quickly the equation is true
reason is that circle is also a shape
circle is a child of shape so
technically their type is still not
right so I'll say s dot draw so I am
saying s dough what you going to observe
is you get drawing the circle of it is
very well true because there are two
definitions one belongs to the shape
other belongs to the circle and when you
say F dot draw you will be getting
drawing a circle so you will be giving
the preferences to the children over
here and the paint definition they again
want to get overridden what I'll do now
I say s is now a new off
rectangles why'd you pay s not draw and
then you say s is new of polygons and
then you say F not draw so every time
you are able to achieve s dot draw
drawing the different different shapes
right so this is what we call having
runtime polymorphism the same master
draw over the same reference variable s
we are able to draw different different
shapes dynamically at runtime right this
beautiful concept is known as runtime
polymorphism right and what we need to
understand from here is that the guy
draw in the shape method is useless
having this concept over here that s is
a new shape so having the object of
shape and executing this guy s dot draw
makes no sense it's not a pretty good
sense right drawing a shape makes no
sense ship has to be circle rectangle or
the polygon so what we need to
understand from here is we need not to
have the object for this class and we
need not to have the definition for this
guys draw so you can change the
architecture of your program and you can
bring down one more class shape mark
this guy as abstract and Mark the
mastered within your class also as
abstract so an abstract class is a class
for which you cannot have objects now
you can't create objects right so here
you can see it's an error other than
that the master can also be marked as
abstract which means you need not to
have definition so guys when a class is
not as abstract you cannot create the
objects but runtime environment will
create the object right so see so I say
shape is constructed very very important
difference which I am going to highlight
today so when you face the constructor
over here
right so you are able to create the
constructor it means the objects can be
constructed for the shape but you cannot
create it runtime environment will be
able to create that you cannot create if
you will try to create it it's going to
give you an error right so the same
problem statement is solved drawing a
circle drawing a rectangle drawing the
polygon but before the construction of
the child object the parent object is
constructed by the runtime environment
so we say this is object to object
inheritance right so what is happening
over here
inheritance is happening over here from
object to object so the parent object is
constructed by the runtime environment
and then the child object is created so
abstract class is a class you cannot
create the objects but the parental
environment can do so and it can have
abstract method which have no
definitions for no definition for this
guy who has to define these guys the
child has to mandate redefine the
definition for the draw so if the child
is not defining the door mastered it's
going to show an error so let's try to
see this so you try to comment out this
code you can see now it is giving you an
error so if there is n number of
abstract methods in the abstract class
you need to redefine them in the
children now we can understand this part
that this shape has helped us to improve
the concept of runtime polymorphism but
this is again which is like a parent is
writing some rules which are supposed to
be defined by the children now there is
a relationship known as parent and child
relationship so flat class shape is been
extended by the circle it's a
parent-child relationship for example
the parent is giving is depth on making
a rule that breakfast has to take place
at
8 a.m. in the morning now the children
they need to define this rule and they
can come up with their own definitions
ok we'll come up with a break pass at 8
a.m. and I'll have snacks I have bread
and butter or anything right so that's
like a parent and a child relationship
and from basic shape class we came to an
abstract class shape with some you can
sit there were some problems over here
that we didn't want the objects to be
coming up and we didn't want the draw
maps words to take place wait so we
achieved a better way of coming up with
runtime polymorphisms to extract lapis
now I will come up with the best way so
I say one interface shape with the
method as white draw so guys this is the
best way to achieve runtime polymorphism
now so what I will do I've got the
extent sheet but I will say implemented
now this is the difference which we must
observe over here so rather than doing
an extension I am doing an
implementation and in the interfaces by
default the methods are public abstract
so it is by default like public abstract
white draw and in the interfaces if you
will observe now so this constructor is
significantly an error it means that
neither you nor the runtime and warmint
can create objects of shape right
so it's an error right so for the
interfaces neither you can create the
objects nor run-time environment can
create objects it means this is not
objects to objects inheritance there is
nothing like parent and child
relationship over here what is the
problem over here this is the kind of
traffic police or the police department
is imposing the rules on us to we're a
seatbelt and now we need to define that
rule right so traffic police is imposing
a rule to follow the traffic light and
it is up to
is that how we define that rule it's not
a parent and a child relationship kind
of concept it's not parent objects and
the child object concept but I hope you
got the example and you are able to
correlate the fundamental between the
interfaces what is the abstract clapping
now since this method is by default
public so in order to redefine you need
to always have a higher express or the
same exit right so this is how you have
achieved one more refined way of runtime
polymorphism
right guys so what we have understood
let's come back and now summarize the
whole concepts so a flat class and
interfaces they are the two different
concepts but we can accomplish runtime
polymorphisms with both of them
one being the parent other one being one
implementation right because an abstract
class can provide complete default code
or just the details that have to be
overridden
whereas interface it will not provide
any code so it's just the signature
there cannot be any definitions in the
interfaces greater the abstract classes
they can have the definition so we can
only extend a finger abstract class
whereas a class can implement several
interfaces so this is not multiple
inheritance it is multiple
implementation right moving ahead now
abstract classes can have even regular
methods there are interfaces they cannot
have now the instance variables in
abstract class they can add this but an
interface it cannot have any instance
variables its variables are by default
static variables right if set classes
you can use public private protected so
on and so forth whereas an interface by
default the visibility is public or not
right so it is by default public somehow
if you mention nothing it is by default
public now so here we can have
constructors they cannot have
constructor it means that you don't
create the objects but runtime
environment will create here neither you
can create nor the runtime environment
entry substrate classes are faster as
compared to interfaces they are slow
because it requires extra indirection to
find the corresponding map third in the
extra class right so that's what we got
some of the theoretical differences of
the practical implementations so
polymorphism I hope is now very well
clear right you guys are polymorphism
means more than one form where a mobile
phone can serve the purpose of camera
remote mp3 player and alarm clock so on
and so forth right so polymorphism can
be characterized into two parts one is
at the runtime one is the compiler so
why runtime polymorphism is there you
are coming up with this parent and a
child relationship again we saw this map
example shape circle polygon and
rectangle right so what what happened in
the runtime polymorphism you create a
parent class and then you create a child
class child class must override the
method of the parent class and
thereafter you do an up casting by
saying the reference variable of the
parent can point to the object off site
and whenever you will execute the method
you will be able to see the math word
execution happens for your child so what
is the difference between
overloading and overriding so guys
overloading is concept linked with the
compile time polymorphism
whereas overriding is linked with the
runtime so the definition part method
overloading means that the same maps in
name should have different inputs or the
different arguments right every time
they must be different now so in macro
writing the signature should exactly be
C so a return type will not make any
difference but here everything should be
exactly same if you talk of the behavior
method overloading is basically adding
or extending the method behavior whereas
overriding is changing the existing
behavior of the map and all right so
here we are trying to add the
functionality here we are trying to
change the functionality for compile
polymorphism versus runtime polymorphism
different signature versus same
signature and when you are talking of
the inheritance it may or may not meet
inheritance in method overloading
whereas overriding is only linked with
your inheritance so this is one
significant difference guys if you can
see right so this we have already
observed the overriding part but in the
overloading part if you can see over
here the add method with the two inputs
of type integer and two inputs of type
double so this is one significant
example right so guys this is like
overloading and this is like oh right
right so you can just I think this is
done wrongly so overriding is at this
example overloading is diffic map
alright so if there is any method which
is private or static so can you just try
to override such a method where the
answer is no you cannot do so so private
method will not be inherited so it makes
no sense to override it or to redefine
it whereas static method it belongs to
the class so you cannot override a
static method right so it's basically
what we call it as in a class to class
overriding which is known as hiding
right so here the concept is known as
Heidi so if there is a static master in
the parent class and if you want to
create a method in the child class to
override the static method it should
also be static and that concept will be
referred to as hiding now so what is
multiple inheritance and does Java
supported you guys multiple inheritance
is one class extending more than one
classes so this is not supported in Java
so if you can see there is a diamond
problem which comes into action that if
there is a class a right and B and C
class they are inheriting the a class
and there is a class D which is getting
inherited from B and C so two copies of
a will be coming into the last class so
this kind of problem is not solved in
the Java
it needs the virtual concepts to come
into action since there are no virtual
keyword or any other or you know pointer
support available in Java so we cannot
solve this problem now right so Java
multiple inheritance is not supported so
one more very now over here right what
will the output of this program so if
the parent is having this method foo
which is not less static and one map
third bar which is a non static method
and there is a parent-child relationship
where we are hiding a method workspace
overriding a method and you are
executing these method calls right so
guys the output will be so since if you
can see over here so this parent dot foo
and child or food and parent dot bar and
child odd bar right so you will be able
to get all these four outcomes I am full
in super in child then child and then
child right so let's try to execute the
code and get the behavior similarly we
got one more program so guys this is
where we got multiple constructors and
you created the object for the e so by
default default constructor will come
into action but this over the reference
function call will execute the
constructor over here and this over here
will execute the constructor over here
so you will get how are you then hollow
and then the height right so this as a
constructor execution will happen over
here as a function cost so we get output
in the reverse order now right so one
more program guys what's one of the
output for the program so it's basically
one miscellaneous sub program where you
got a block and a static block so if a
block is executed when you create the
object of a class where a static block
is executed when the class is loaded
into the memory so the idea is to define
you guys the role for the static block
and a normal zone so a block over here
if you can see is executed when the
object is constructed and static block
is executed when the class is loaded
into the memory so this
I to run this program and come up with
this output guys all right guys so now
let's understand subjects right so this
is where we're gonna perfu with the
Enterprise Edition concepts of Java so
we have left out the core part of Java
now we are moving into the advanced part
of Java so service is also one of the
core concepts when we talk of the
Enterprise Edition of Java so let us
understand what exactly is a service
right so that's like what is a service
so servlet is one Java program which is
executed over the server now that's like
one very basic definition - what exactly
is a service what happens now whenever
you are writing an enterprise
application you need to have some code
that is executed by the server so if the
client is sending a request via HTTP or
the HTTP request it comes to a server
and the server will execute your Java
program and it's gonna send back the
response to the client now the client
can specifically de browser or it can be
a mobile application on any other kind
of a client base right so Java servlet
is a server-side technology which will
extend the capability of web servers by
providing support for dynamic response
and data persistence
we got Java X dot servlet and da exhorts
servlet dot HTTP package which provides
the various API is for writing the
server program now any servlets program
should implement the servlet interface
along with the life cycle methods where
you can manage your code snippets as
most men applications they are expressed
using the HTTP protocol so we got a
class known as HTTP servlet and we got a
corresponding hierarchy for the same so
over the web we use two of the major
methods one is the get one is the post
so what is the difference between get
and put so guys get in post we got two
major methods
how we can send a request from a client
to the server other than that we also
have various of the masters like sports
delayed pray stone and so forth
so these are the two important methods
yet is when you need to have limited
amounts of data which can be sent right
because the data is sent as a part of
the URL mouth so post is when you have a
large data and you need to send it
across the body so it automatically
comes up that the data is not visible as
a part of the URL and it is more secure
in in terms of force requests right so
security is more because the data is
knows not exposed in the u.s. other than
that you cannot bookmark the food but
the get Stanley bookmark we want
idempotent verses known idempotent so
where is what is idempotent when you
send a request you get a response you
again send a request you again get a
response and you compare the two
responses whether they are equal or not
right so idempotent so the guide get is
more efficient right and it is more used
than the post right where light depends
right so efficiency is like get is more
efficient undoubtedly but it depends
upon a requirement where you need to use
what okay so let's say you want to do a
sign-in so obviously we need to pend the
username and the password to the server
and you cannot send it by across the URL
even though you can send it but you need
to encrypt the data before you send it
right so that like the differences
between get and push now what is meant
by the session management right so guys
session is one term which means that
time interval between the client and the
server so we have techniques to manage
the data within the session so that's
like the fashion management not so what
are the various methods so number one we
got the user authentication then the
hidden form fields cookies URL rewriting
and we got HTTP session API also to
manage the session so session is a
conversational stage between the client
and server
and it can consists of multiple requests
and responses between both of them now
HTTP is a stateless protocol you cannot
manage and maintain the fail so that's
why we need to use some fundamentals
which we can come up with this right
so guys every session will have a
session ID which will be passed between
the client and the server during the
request and response and you can use
various different techniques so to name
few we have mentioned them right now
we also have two API is known as servlet
context versus servlet context so what
is the difference over here
so servlet context and context is where
we need to extract the data which is
stored somewhere as in part of your
death dot XML deployment descriptor so
we will consider that part now so soviet
config is a single object where soviet
context is on a global level now right
so it's like a local parameter associate
with a particular servlet whereas we got
a global parameter so both of them are
the key value pairs right mentioned
within the web dot XML files whereas a
servlet conflict so you mentioned the
data within the servlet whereas service
context is mentioned out of the servlet
acts in the server program you can use
the API you get soviet config and get
servlet context and thereafter on the
basis of the key you can retrieve the
data right so for example shopping cart
of a user is specific to a particular
user so you can use servlet context we
have to get the mind type of a file or
any kind of a global level order a
variable you can use the servlet context
now what is a possible life cycle of a
services are really important when you
talk of servlet Skype right so service
they got five stages when you talk of
the life cycle right the first of all
the sorbets will be loaded then it gonna
be instantiated
initialized then a request will be sent
to a servlet and then finally the
servlet will be destroyed so we got in
it service and destroy as a pre life
cycle callbacks
involved when you write the servlet
program we got three or
API is now in its service and destroy
what is requestdispatcher if you want to
share the data from one server to the
other servlet evenly right so we got
this guy known as the request dispatcher
which can forward the request to the
other resource now the other resource
can be possibly a servlet or an HTML
file or a JSP files and we can do so
using the two different methods one is
the forward method other one is the
include map so what happens over here is
when you send out the request from the
servlet one to servlet two when you use
the forward method response generated
from the servlet two will be sent back
to the client in case of the include
method response from the servlet two as
well as the servlet one will be appended
and then sent back as a final response
to the plane now we got
requestdispatcher coming up with the
forward and include in B two differences
so guys one of the important conflict
associated with the subject session
management is cookies right so what
exactly cookie is so cookies are the
textual data which gets stored on the
client machine and this data is sent
from the server so data is stored in the
local machine of the client guys let us
see this part right so if you can see
over here I will show you this thing so
when you open down the settings of your
browsers right and you try to say cookie
right so if you can see over here so you
get these options of cookie coming up
over here content setting you can see
cookie so allow the local data to be set
which is evenly recommended so that
cookies are the textual data which gets
stored on the machine and you from the
server can diffuse the master known as
get cookies why to read out all the
cookies and you can create a cookie by
using the APA cookie itself it is a
hashmap key
lupe cookie see one fi new cookie with
the key and the value right and if you
want to add the cookie to the clients
machine you just call the method add
cookie over the response object so the
next part is the Java database
connectivity so as this deals with the
database connections not right so Java
database connectivity we got the first
thing as JDBC driver so whenever you
want to create a connection you must
have a driver right so guys driver is
the layer which will help us to interact
our JDBC API is with the database there
are four major types of drivers we call
them type 1 type 2 type 3 and type 4
driver
it goes like DD BC ODBC bridge drivers
native API driver which is a partial
Java driver then if you want to come up
with a client-server model you got
Network protocol driver and lastly you
got the pure kind of a driver
CIN driver the fully Java driver which
we'll be using to interact directly with
the data so Java app it's going to use
the JDBC API and the JDBC driver manager
will interact with the driver and
drivers will further interact with the
drivers for the databases a libraries
and so and hence this whole channel of
communication will be established so
what are the various steps to connect to
the database in Java we use JDBC and
there are some sequential steps which
you need to perform so that we can
perform all the crude operations so what
are we not so there are five sequential
steps which you need to perform so as
any of the database whichever you are
using right so you need to come up with
the documentation over their website
write what is their driver class name
what is the URL so on and so forth
anyway let us have a look onto the
snippet now the first one is registering
the driver which comes through the API
known as class dot for me
so here you managed to write the driver
type for driver or any other driver
which you are going to use then you need
to create the connection this is
created with the help of an API known as
driver manager so you say driver manager
dot get connection we need to pass three
things over here the first thing is the
URL where your database resides
so if it is on a local boat you mention
the hostname to be the local loop and
you managed to write the port number and
the database name then the username and
the password for your database
thereafter you need to fake create
statements over the connection once you
have created the statements thereafter
you will be able to execute any of your
SQL queries but in the finally block you
must close your connection right so this
is important that you managed to close
your connection
regardless or whether exception is
coming or not coming so what are the
different JDBC API components so guys we
got various interfaces and slashes
coming into the Java JDBC package should
we got gamma dot SQL package and many of
the libraries if you can see the API are
mentioned over here in the interface
part we got connections statements
prepared statement results it resides at
medidata database metadata and
Colleyville statements so all these are
the interfaces so connection is used to
have a connection statement to execute
the sequel statements prepared statement
is also used to execute the sequel
statements but if their statement if
different from the statement in terms of
how you are going to substitute the data
into the sequel statement so here we use
something else wildcard characters as
question mark right results it is the
received data from the database and the
data about your retrieve data is known
as resultset metadata and the data about
the database is known as database data
data column of statements are used so
that you can execute the stored
procedures of your databases and some of
the few klappas which are mentioned in
the right hand side it includes driver
managers that you use to get the
connection so be Rome and Phillip are
the two API
very
can manage the binary large objects and
the collector large objects Oh binary
large object means the audio files the
video files right whereas kilo means the
textual pipe then the type will define
what are the various types equal
exception is exception in the jdbc if
there is any connectivity issue or any
other synthetical issue or any different
kind of equal issues which is going to
occur at runtime so sequel exception is
the class to get the error form now what
exactly a JDBC connection interface be
like right the connection interface is
the one which will maintain a session
with the database so here we can use the
transaction management logic which means
a Tommy sitting so Tommy theory means
that all and everything should happen at
once
so let us understand so connection is
one important interface with the help of
which we can manage the transaction for
the transaction let us assume I want to
transfer the amount from one account to
the other account so there needs to be
two possible sequel statements which are
supposed to be five one will be the
updation in my account that will be
deduction of the payment in the other
account again and updation queries it
will be the addition of the payment so
these two ways should be fired at once
and if any one query fails the other
query should be rolled back so for the
transaction management VR the connection
you create the statement and thereafter
you can come up with the auto commit API
where you can mark it as true and then
you can use the API is like commits and
rollbacks to manage your transactions so
close the method where you are able to
close the session with the database
right guys so there is one more possible
difference between three of the API is
that like execute execute query and
execute updates so guys execute query
executes update and execute these are
the three different API all the
behaviors are used to perform the sequel
operations over the database but query
Packard is always focused to door
retrieve operations if you can see now
select operation right so whereas your
execute update method it's going to
perform the DML and the DDL operation
insert update delete create and alter of
the table right whereas execute method
it is able to perform any kind of
operation of so this is typically used
to retrieve the data here the data can
be modified
whereas EDD method any kind of sequel
statements return type of these methods
they are different now so results it
will be returned from the execute query
methods here we will be getting some
interior output and here we'll be
getting some boolean output this matter
is used to execute only select queries
so non select queries and here both the
Select and non-liquid right guys so that
likes are the JDBC part right so how we
got various API is available the java
database connectivity but we need to
come up and understand there are the
five different set so you start from
loading the driver then creating a
connection writing the statements
executing the statement and finally
moving on to the closing of the
statements so the next part is the
framework of frameworks that like the
spring frame so if you know this if you
have a hold on your spring framework
guide so it's like you are done with
almost everything now right so one of
the most important framework in the
Enterprise Edition of Java let us see
what is spring framework so what exactly
is spring right so spring is an
application framework which focuses on a
concept known as inversion of control
for the Java platform so many of the
great technologies they are built
looking on to the architectural model of
the springtime or even the Android
how the UI part is linked with the
layout part so that concept is again
adopted from the spring pattern right so
it is one of the patterns which focuses
on IOT that like inversion of control
so the framework core features they can
be used by any da app for building and
Enterprise Edition applications one of
the major advantage of writing a Spring
Framework app is it's lightweight it is
having an integrated framework
architecture
where we can use it to develop any kind
of an enterprise app in Java right so
it's less on a memory it's high on
performance and it contains various
frameworks available within it to which
you can write a multi-purpose enterprise
application so by what is all are the
modules available in the spring
framework now so spring framework has
various modules to start with we got the
very first layer as the core container
if you can see this four layer so whole
of your spinning framework is dependent
on this core layer so this core layer
focuses on something known as inversion
of control and dependency injection so
we got this a spring context dependency
injection then AOP is aspect-oriented
programming this focuses on how we can
fulfill cross-cutting concerns then the
database module of the Spring Framework
includes Dow JDBC and ORM as in the
design pattern so now the data access
object so here we can write the Dow
patterns to access the database we got
JDBC support we also got the hibernate
or the Orang support which is object
relational mapping the bed module of the
Spring Framework can help us to write
the web application where spring MVC is
one of the major Lee used frameworks in
the market now so model view controller
we our model represents the data
container you represents the UI or the
presentation and controller represents a
business logic event so let's now write
so spring MVC is one of the very
important concernment it comes to
develop the web application and we got
various web services
out in this module itself let us move on
to some annotations which are used in
the spring configuration so guys there
are various annotations now which are
used in the spring framework now add the
rate required right so it's like what is
the input which is required auto wiring
for your dependency injection what
happens pre destroy what happens forced
construct right so before the object is
finalized just after the object is
constructed
what is the resource what is the
qualifiers these are some of the spring
annotations which are used for the
configuration purpose so what is being
in spring and what can be the different
scopes of the bean in this thing right
so guys I pick up one very basic example
earlier to mention this concept right so
let us take one example so I got this
spring demo available with me with all
the jar files available out here we got
this employed in dot XML file so just
give me a moment right so all right so
here you can see now we got this
employed B so this is one XML
configuration for the Spring Framework
so we got co dot edeka dot employee as a
class right and here what I am able to
do is to define the property value tags
for my speed right in the employee dot
java
I can fix basically a bean or a poodle
so what the bean class being class is a
class which will have the attribute
along with the setter and the getter
right so all the sector gates members
are also there in my client class what I
am going to do I am just gonna use this
spring container and thereafter I will
just extract my employee optic white so
just let me do this part all right so I
got the reference of the employee in dot
XML and in my class I got this em bean
one so I will just say M being one and
thereafter I will do a see so off and
white
let's try to run the boat and you can
see that the data over here is coming up
as in ID name and salary but I have just
over righted this two string method out
here so along with this and also suppose
to do a super dot two thing right I will
do a backslash and at a super dot P
shape so now it will show me the data
object object as well as the reference
variable and is pointing to the address
it is showing me the address as well to
the object now so the beam is extracted
from the spring container right so there
are various scopes available now for
example same and been one in my client
if I try to get it again right so let us
try to say get of being again why it as
in m1 and m2 let us say this is n2 and
this is n1 right so I will closely
observe one difference I mean one
similarity that every time then you
request this guy get been for the mbean
one you are able to receive the
reference to the team optic scope of the
being can be mentioned over here using
attribute on a scope and here now I am
going to mention it as prototype you can
see we got this guy as a prototype now
when I run my code again you will find
one significant difference that here the
reference is coming out to be different
it means now by default it was giving me
the singleton as a design pattern but
when I change the scope to prototype
every time I am requesting the objects
of n being one from the spring container
it is now constructing a new object and
returning it back to so by this is what
we got as in what can be the scope of
your beam in the space so inversion of
control container
have various scopes now single domain
only single object which is by default
so prototype means you can have every
time a new objects request means one
object for entire request session means
one object for entire session and
globalization means one object for
entire global session online application
levels so how is it being added to a
spring application so guys you use this
pad known as deal you mentioned the ID
and then you can have the properties
having key value pair right so what is
the role of dispatchers servlet and
context loader lifts nur okay
dispatcher salat is acting as a front
controller in the spring MVC so many
times I will call it as a reception is
not so what happens any requests when
it's going to land up to your bed
application so this guide dispatcher
servlet will dispatch the request to the
corresponding resource available on your
there application so it's going to act
as a receptionist in your program now
whereas contact loader listener it's a
listener which will give you the event
callbacks
when the context will be loaded it's
like startup and shutdown of the web
application context in the spring rules
now what is the difference between
constructor injection and setter
injection so before you come up with a
constructor injection and the setter
injection you must understand what is
dependency injection so guys let us
understand this flow once again I am
having one class employ right and there
is one more class known as address so
employee can have the name employee can
have some salary there will be
definitely one employee ID and employee
can also have an address right so I will
just say an address to be yes Adi so
what we can do we can create one
constructor of an employee
in this way right and here you can say e
ID goes like 101 mail goes like let's
say John celery goes like 30,000 and
address both like some new address right
where address can have some address
lines then you can have some city you
can have a state and lastly we can also
have some kind of a zip code just
mentioning some parameters over here now
what will happen over the client spot
you will be writing employee assigns new
employee so whenever you are creating
the object of employees this becomes the
concept that the constructor of the
employee will create the object of the
address we can see a significant
dependency now when you are creating the
object of employee within the
constructor of employees the object off
head rest will be constructed we say
this concept as high dependency or you
can say we got a higher value of
coupling now we need to reduce it right
so you need to bring it to the lower
level so you need to take it as low
coupling so what I will do I will not
use this technique I will take let us
create one more constructor and pass the
address as an input right and thereafter
you can say address assign it or you can
create a setter you can say set address
and you can say address and here you
pass this size so guys in these two
approaches rather than having a single
employee object you can now create an
employee object you can create address
objects separately right you need not to
be dependent upon the employee objects
and later you can pass the address
object or
you can say employee si new employee and
a dot said the address and you can
pacify a so we want to reduce the
dependencies or we want to come down
with the coupling parameter we created
this logic out here so setter injection
and constructor injection are the two
terminologies laid up in order to
justify these two terms now wait so let
us open up our presentation once again
and look on two constructor injection
versus setter injection so there is no
partial injection so setter injection
can lead to partial addiction here we
need not to override the setter property
but here the constructor property in
case both the things that defines so you
can create new instance if any
modification occurs so you need not to
create any instance if there is a
property change so better for too many
properties better for you properties so
guys depends upon your choice but
constructor and second injection we have
the two key concepts to bring down your
dependency to the lower levels now what
is auto wiring in spring so many times
when we are writing this dependency
injection programs you can perform this
injection program based on the name
right for example you can mention this
auto wiring tag and you can pay by name
so you need not to now write an explicit
injection logic it will be mapped
automatically for you so there are
various modes through which you can have
an auto wiring coming into action so
know is the default mode it means you
don't specify the auto wire it means
here nothing is enabled so automatic is
not enabled so when you mention by name
it means you take the setter method and
you mask the day car corresponding to
the name PI type we'll use the type of
the attribute and constructor will
inject on the basis of the constructor
so how can we handle any exception in
spring MVC framework right guy so there
can be exceptions now when you are
writing the program right so swing em
with
frame work can help us to achieve robust
programming concepts to these possible
ways number one controller based so you
can define an exception handler method
in your controller class itself you can
have a global exception handler where
exception handling is a cross-cutting
concern to AOP right and then you can
have a handler exception resolve so any
spring beam which you have declared in
the dispatcher servlet application
context that can implement handler
exception resolver which can thereafter
be used to intercept and process any
exception which occurs in the MVC system
and it is not handled by the controller
pass so you can use the areas or
different concepts out there if you can
see add the rate exception handler
annotation so that you can specify that
this view will be used to display some
addicts all right so some important
annotations again in the spinning
framework guys we got a dread controller
a great path variable qualified
configuration scope request mapping
response body or the wire service and up
fix right show all these annotations
they are quite important conflict and
you must have a fair knowledge on all
these right for example at the rate auto
wire so either you can configure it in
XML file all you can use a notation so
XML files they come up with the
inversion of control concepts where as
annotations you need not to have XML
file you can use them directly alright
guys so last in the spring framework we
can also have Spring Framework coming up
wizard database connectivity either
through Jerry's if you are to hibernate
or any other framework not right so
spring and hibernate they can work
together we have some foreign models
available within the spring framework
and we got an API known as hibernate
template if you want to come up with the
spring and JDBC you got JDBC template
Yeah right so guys spring over a module
will help us to integrate hibernate
framework into a spring application and
spring for EM also provides the support
so that you can use paying declarative
transaction management you can use
annotation then you can perform the
action sock so now we will be on our
last concept that's like the hibernate
which is a back-end framework based on
object a relationship map right to get
let us see what and all we got in the
hibernate now so the 44th question is
what is hibernate hibernate is an orange
which is object relationship mapping
it's a framework now where you just
mention your Java objects and you forget
about your database tables so by what we
want to do we gonna write down some
mapping files as an internal
configuration files where you will be
mapping that it's attribute in my object
in my class will be a column name in the
respective relational tables so
hibernate provides a reference
implementation of the JPA java
persistence api right and it makes a
great try 700m tools where we got the
benefit of loose coupling now I hope you
got the meaning of loot coupling we're
dependent we have been reduced to the
maximal level so hibernate configures
all the flexible and can be done from
the XML configuration as well as through
annotations programmatically right it
provides us both the ways now so what
can be the benefits with the hibernate
trimmer
so guys hibernate will eliminate all the
boilerplate code whereas in the
traditional approach you need to mention
and write various code snippets and you
need to write the relationship mapping
the cache management everything is you
know eliminated when you use hybrid now
so this framework will provides us
XML
both as in through configuration files
and annotation all supports you JPA
that's like java persistence is like now
hibernate was a very powerful language
that like SQL which is very much in line
to SQL but you need not to learn it it's
more simpler than the SQL even now if
scale itself is very simple language
you got more simpler language than the
SQ that like it's us guys it's an open
source project from the Red Hat
community and it is used worldwide and
very famous especially for any large
enterprise application your hibernate
framework is one of the ideal choice is
not now any database vendor specific
feature hibernate is suitable because we
can also execute native sequel Qin
so I Burnett is not just that we can use
it's a native API and you can't do
anything out-of-the-box you got to
execute the sequel queries also with the
hibernate one of the most significant
features of the hibernate is the cache
management so hibernate provides three
levels of cache through which your
performance of the database operations
they're going to get improved now so
what is the architecture of hibernate
dies so hybrid of having an architecture
in a very similar fashion guys we got a
database on top of database we got a
various you know modules coming in for
example java transaction api's we got
java database connectivity and
thereafter we got j and di that's like
java naming and directory interfaces on
top of it we got the hibernate api so
configuration api will read the xml
configuration files and it will help us
to create a session path tree session
factory will be used to create the
session and session is one api which
maintains and creates a connection with
the database using the transaction api
you can use the commits and rollbacks
features and query API will head
you to create one query and retrieve the
data criteria is one API which will help
you to mention the criteria for example
you got restrictions to you know manage
for example greater than less than or
equal to so all these are criterias when
you are trying to retrieve the data in
the java application you just write a
POJO class you just write a bean and you
give this objects to the hibernate and
hibernate api is there going to manage
everything for you
all right we got the get method and the
load method in order to perform the
retrieve operation so let's see the
differences let's say we don't have a
record available in the database so load
method will throw an exception that my
object not found exception whereas the
get method will return a null event the
object is not found
so they get mastered will always hit the
database whereas load method will not
hit the database right in case it's not
there and you going to get a real object
not a proxy object whereas load will
return you a proxy object so gate should
be used if you are not sure about the
existence of instance now so let's say
that the record is existing or not I
don't know so you you get if you are
sure about whatever you are going to
extract from the database it is existing
you can use the load method so there are
now significant differences between
hibernate and JDBC types this is one of
the major query between you know as in a
part of interviews so why hibernate and
why not JDBC what are the defense is
what are the advantages that you should
be opting for hibernate now if you are
writing a very small app right you need
not to go on the hibernate hibernate
level is required when you're writing an
enterprise app right where you need to
save the time and you don't want to do a
rework and there are various other
defensive so let's have a look onto that
now so guys first of all you need to
write a lot of code when it comes to
JDBC we have hibernate you have
limited instructions you mentioned right
- except orts all the Association
inheritance collection mappings where in
case of JDBC APA you need to write all
those logics so one-to-one one-to-many
many-to-many all these mappings they are
available as a support in the hibernate
hibernate will also give you the
transaction management implicitly
whereas in JDBC again you need to manage
that one
now JDBC API they will throw sequel
exception right so it's a tend exception
so we need to write a lot of try-catch
block code when you are using this a
JDBC but hibernate will internally
manage this try catch block for you
we got hql which is object oriented
programming
whereas JDBC you need to write the
native sequel queries hibernate will
automatically give you the cash
management for better performance in
three levels of cache whereas JDBC you
need to manage it yourself so by default
hibernate performance is higher as
compared to the JDBC path so lastly
hibernate will provide an option where
we can create the database and the
tables too but for the JDBC these
existence should be there before you
dump the data other than that one of the
very significant feature why hibernate
or DD BC is if you want to switch from
one database to the other database it's
going to be very complicated with the
JDBC but in case of hibernate we got a
configuration file you just need to
change the parameters in the
configuration file and you will be able
to shift from Oracle to my sequel or any
other database to any other database of
your choice so guys that will be all so
we just wish you all the very best right
the team advaitha and we shan't you guys
wish you all the very best
thank you very much so any questions any
queries and your feedbacks they are
