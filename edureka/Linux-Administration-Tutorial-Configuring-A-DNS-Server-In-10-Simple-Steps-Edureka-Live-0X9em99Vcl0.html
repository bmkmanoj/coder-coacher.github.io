name is Vardhan and I'm very excited to
be here on a Drakkar life with you guys
and as you all know today's session is
going to be completely about what is a
DNS server and how to set it up in your
machine so do stay on till the end of
the session if you want to learn how to
set up a bind DNS server in ten simple
steps so I'm teaching you this topping
on DNS based on several requests that I
receive from participants of my previous
session this is something I have not
covered before and it's really exciting
because setting up a DNS server is the
biggest headache Linux admins face so
much so that a lot of a lot of them shy
away from this task but the thing with
DNS is that it has to be configured only
once and after that there's no need to
edit any settings unless some kind of
network is down because of some issue
right so that's the only reason you will
have to again change your DNS settings
but otherwise it's a one-time task but
there again it's a very challenging task
for even doing it the first time so
that's about DNS and before I get
started I want to first of all know how
many of you people are aware of what a
DNS is can you people tell me that by
commenting in the comment box
you
okay see guys the thing is uh some of
you might know what it is some of you
might not know what it is but anyways
the thing is I will explain what DNS is
and then I will discuss the ten simple
steps to configuring a bind DNS server
okay I will give you an introduction and
then I'll do that and of course I'll
give you a demonstration at the end and
I can get started with my session I'll
first I'll first of all show you this
customary agent a sleight of mind and
for the sake of the newcomers like I
told you earlier I will go through what
is DNS and I'll then talk about how a
DNS server works and then how it will
look for the various servers in the DNS
root hierarchy how will it look for a
particular IP address from that domain
and how it'll look for an IP address of
a system which is a completely different
geography right so all those things I'll
tell you how that works and then finally
I'll give you a 10-step the detailed
explanation of the ten steps are needed
to configure a DNS server okay so the
first topic for today is what is DNS
well DNS stands for domain name system
and its main responsibility is to
translate Internet domain and the host
names to IP addresses and vice-versa
well most of you might know that every
physical machine connected to the
Internet is identified by an IP address
but most of you might not know that
these IPS are unique only inside that
same domain right and another fact that
you might not be aware of is that when
you type in a URL in your web browser
then it you know automatically gets
converted to the equivalent IP address
of that server that you're trying to
access supposing at random access is
Google calm then when you type in
google.com in your browser then it would
be automatically converted to Google's
IP address right and only based on the
IP address is the system able to fetch
Google's server and display you know
give you the results on your screen
well can anybody tell me why that
happens why do we do that why does there
why is there an internal conversion into
an IP address that happens can anybody
guess why that happens
well that is because the URL or the
fully qualified domain names like
google.com facebook.com yahoo.com all
these dot-coms right these are the
addresses of any server or machine on
the Internet okay and they are however
only easy to remember by the humans only
for us for computers however it's easier
to remember for them it's easier to
remember in the form of IP addresses so
whatever we have google.com has an
equivalent IP address facebook.com has
another equivalent IP address so every
single site and every single URL has an
equivalent IP address right they would
be hosted on a server and to access that
server you have to access that server's
IP address so that's how things work in
the background and yeah so this task of
translating between the IP addresses and
the domain names is what is done by this
by this tool called a DNS ok so the
domain name system does that and well
it's a big benefit and the people
nowadays might not realize is the thing
ok any newcomers might not know because
without the invention of DNS our lies
would have been very difficult because
back in the 80s 90s at that time when we
didn't have ba the DNS then if we had to
access each and every your website with
the help of just by giving the your
hostname so for example if I were to
access Google com back in the 80s or 90s
right instead of giving the IP address
if I had to give the Google Google say
google.com then I have to specify this
in the hosts file okay after map the IP
address and the host name in the host
file and doing that today seems a very
tedious task because we have so many
websites and we have so many IP errors
which we have to manually feed and this
is a manual task right so to over to
illuminate this overhead we came up with
a DNS and boy now it's a very big help
and a lot of our effort is saved so
that's the thing and talking of how DNS
works it works on a concept which is
very similar to a client or a server or
network communication architecture ok so
here our systems will be the DNS client
ok now supposing I am accessing internet
then I would be a DNS client first of
all and then
I'll be sending these requests to the
server okay I will be sending the
request to the DNS server by specifying
the hostname if I type in google.com in
my URL in my in my web browser then that
you are then that hostname would go to
DNS server into the DNS server would
resolve google.com to a particular IP
address similarly if I typed any other
website like facebook.com or calm DNS
server would do the task of converting
that that hostname into its equivalent
IP address and then give back that IP
address to us okay and the very act of
sending a request is called a lookup
request okay and what you get back from
the DNS server in the form of an IP
address that's what a lookup response so
these are the two things that are
involved and wherever you you configure
the DNS server in whichever environment
of virtual machine that's generally
called a DNS server okay you can even it
will be a running environment and
similarly every system that tries to
access that particular server that they
are called DNS clients so we don't have
much of a conversation drew from the
rhiness client side but of course in a
server side we have a lot of
confirmation to excuse me guys yeah so
that's about this example and another
thing that I want to show you is that
dog in this concept of DNS lookup
requests okay now if you see this image
over here you can see that over here
I've specified lookup request response
okay but over here this DNS client is
making the request in the form of an IP
address right and then the server is are
giving back the DNS response in the form
of a fully qualified domain name so in
my case DNS dot Vardhan comm is a fully
qualified domain name that I have set
for my demonstration on this system of
mine okay on this virtual machine now
now you might ask the question why am i
specify IP address now that's because
the fact that of course you people know
right you can either enter the IP
address or the host name so to represent
that I have entered this and when you
enter the hostname into your web browser
and when you and when the server gets
back to you with the IP address then
that's called a forward lookup okay so
it resolves the hostname or the domain
name to the
whereas the reverse lookup this one
results resolves the IP address to the
host name so in this case when I send an
IP address
supposing I know the IP address of a
machine but I don't know the host name
of the domain name then in that case
what I get back the lookup response I
get back from the server that would be a
reverse lookup right so there are there
can be two kinds of ways in which you
can access and lookup so that these are
the two things with respect to DNS now
the question that can arise in your mind
is that where does the DNS server get
the IP addresses of the host name right
you can ask that from there how if there
are so many websites if there are so
many domain names there are so many IP
addresses for those systems inside a
particular domain how with our DNS
server access that particular raw IP
address or that particular server you
can ask me that question and to explain
that question is what Amaral explained
in this next slide right so here first
of all we have a local system now let's
assume it's me okay I'm trying to access
a new website
okay which has not been which is a very
new website so or let's ignore the fact
that it's a new website therefore let's
just consider that we are going to try
and to access google.com okay so when we
try to access google.com then that
request would first of all go to a
resolver okay now the resolver is
nothing but your ISP server and it's
basically built into your network
operating system and the IP address of
google.com would be built inside
resolver okay it would be present as a
cache memory and since the iPad rez
would be present the host name would be
resolved on it the response would be it
would come back to you but in case if
there's a new website which is been
newly newly published and if that
website if that IP address is not in
your resolver what happens google.com is
famous right but hold on this is uh you
know you there is no guarantee that the
website that you are talking about it
has been accessed by someone on your ISP
and it's on there in a DNS cache what
would happen at that time so at that
time the entire we have the we have a
different route hierarchy of DNS right
so those would be accessed now that's
where the whole concept of DNS comes
with the picture
and that's where we have first of all
something called as a root so okay not
the root server sits at the top of the
DNS hierarchy okay and there are about
thirteen sets of these root servers
placed strategically around the world
and about twelve organizations access
these you know they control these root
servers and the thing with these root
servers is that they will not tell you
which exactly which IP address your
hostname is resolved okay if you specify
Vartan comm it's on a return back with
the IP address of that particular domain
what the root server will do is it will
point you to another server okay and
that is called the top level domain
servers also called TLD servers okay now
when they point back to the TLD servers
the TLD servers will have further
information so they can point you to a
direction where you will get the IP
address so the root server will point
you back to the TLD server in which your
domain may be hosted okay
the domain that you're trying to access
that may be hosted in one of the domains
over here and these one of these domains
are what make up these thirteen set of
root servers so from the thirteen you
shortlist one of them and those come to
the resolver it tries to access the top
level domain servers and these top-level
domain servers they store information of
these top-level domains such as calm or
the dotnet or the dot org domains all
these domains right so whether it's
Facebook comment vous Ghulam those kinds
of those kind of information or details
to be present in the top-level domains
hours now even now you cannot totally
resolve to a particular domains IP
address supposing now to access a
particular IP address inside a domain
that I cannot get it here I just by this
time the top-level domain only it only
knows this particular domain is hosted
under these servers okay so what the TLD
will do is it would again return back
the particular domain or let's say let's
call it authoritative nameserver okay
the TLD would return this name server
back to the resolver so based on that
information
the resort of would again query the
authoritative name server ok now the
name servers is what knows everything
about the domain including the app
address so there was roots our would
return back the top-level domain service
such as a.com or the dotnet of the dot
org and these top-level domain servers
they will return back the domains where
your IP address is part of right and
that is through the authoritative name
servers and yeah that's how things
happen and then the resolve would
finally get short you know get to the IP
address inside your authoritative names
over and finally it would it would store
the IP address in its cache locally for
a later use so the next time somebody
else is trying to access this website in
your you know through your ISP then they
can instead straightaway access that
website with the IP address since it
would all be present in the cache and
yeah finally once it's a present in the
resolver there is all over to send the
response back to the local system so
this is how a DNS server works ok now
wha if you guys have understood this
part then you're all set you can
understand exactly how to set up your
DNS server which which which server to
use right so speaking of which server we
have a lot of DNS servers available in
the market and we what I'm gonna use in
my session is that for bind DNS server
so bind is one of the most popular and
one of the earliest DNS servers which
was in use and it's basically a name
server and it also be configured for
mail service and I'm gonna use bind
however you can try out unbound or you
can try out power DNS we have a number
of fun names of DNS servers so moving on
to how to configure a bind DNS server I
can show you that in 10 simple steps ok
now let's see how we do that now that's
the next topic and the 10 store the 10
steps that are involved are mentioned
here right and first of all the most
obvious of the steps is this one you
have to install bind because bind is a
DNS service and will have to install
bind with the help of yum command in
CentOS machines if you are however doing
this on a Oberto machine it would be
apt-get install
bind right so this is the first step the
second step would be to add
static IP address now can anybody guess
why we add a static IP address to your
machine to the to the system that you're
configuring the DNS server anybody well
see the reason for that is because when
we reboot our machine so sometimes if
your server crashes and then it reboots
then at that time you don't want an IP
address will change right so for that
purpose you say boot protocol is static
okay so initially by your default when
you are trying to confident for the
first time you'll find a DHCP over here
that's sans for dynamic host controlled
protocol which would assign a dynamic IP
address every time you reboot your
server but when you change to static
then what IP address you set here this
is gonna be constant it's not going to
change okay so that's the need to assign
rasathi copy address and that makes up
the second step and along with these
unit you need to also add these two
lines of netmask and say which subnet it
belongs to okay and the Gateway so in my
case my IP address is one ninety two dot
one sixty eight dot 56.2 and this is
what I've entered in my at zero file
which is present under this directory at
CSIS config network scripts right and
you also add the Gateway ok and you add
these three lines and the rest remains
the same and you of course change the f0
file and moving on the next step is to
assign a fully qualified domain name for
your server well what's the point in
hosting of domain if you don't want to
give a domain name right so that's the
whole point of assigning it and you can
simply assign a domain name a fully
qualified domain name by entering this
file the SC sis config network file and
you will have two lines we'll have
networking is equal to yes this will be
a line which would be initially there
and even the hostname is equal to
followed by the current machine name
that will be the entry initially in your
system okay so when you configure it you
can change it with the domain name that
you want to give so in my case I'm
giving DNS 1 . Vardhan com ok so you can
now change it up
accordingly you can do that so once
you've set the fully qualified domain
name the next step is to go to the Etsy
hosts file and add the entry ok this
entry you've in your in this file right
in your networks file you've added the
domain name you've said this is your
host name now you are defining an IP
address for that host name over here in
the hosts file right that's the step
you're these lines would be there by
default you don't need to worry about
that and the first step would be to go
to your resolve dot corner file ok this
will again be present under the Etsy
directory and you need to add these two
lines so you need to say search and your
domain name you can ignore the DNS one
part but you got to put your domain name
over your in your case it can be
anything but in my case it's what the
not com otherwise it can be google.com
or yahoo.com excuse me it can be
anything a lot and of course you should
say name server and point the IP address
which you want to act as the DNS server
ok and this is one important step which
has to be configured even in the clients
even your DNS client
ok so supposing if I want to check late
up what is the what if my domain name is
working right that time I will have to
go to the resolved or corner file in my
client and add this particular line I
will show you that later right I will
show you that in my demonstration so
this remember that it's very important
step what you need to do even in your
clients in fact this is the only step
that you have to do in your clients in
your DNS client side right so then this
next step would be to go and edit the
name bit or corner file so from here
onwards is where the actual
configuration of bind starts so tell me
oh you were just configuring your own
network the first five steps from the
sixth step onwards till the eighth and
in fact even the night until the eighth
step it's all about a bind
DNS ok so this name dot the corner file
is a file that comes when you install
bind ok and what do you have to do is
you have to enter the name B dot corner
file and you'll have a number of lines
there which of course I can't I I
couldn't print all the lines in my
slides so I have just the three
lines which we have to change so we have
to edit these three lines and the thing
is initially when you open this file you
will have this line okay Abed in curly
brackets you would have localhost like
it say is here what you have to lose you
have to replace this low closed with
your IP address so in my case I would be
doing it with dot 52 sorry dot 2 56.2
that's my IP address right and you will
have one more line for pointing to the
ipv6 port number and this you need to
comment this you don't need this line
anymore
okay and the third line which you have
to edit is that of a love query and you
will have none initially you should
replace this with any so that is the
sixth step which you have to configure
when you are done with this you can then
go to the other file in the SC which
again the file name is RFC dot 1 n 1 2
dot zones and this of course comes from
comes when you install bind and here is
where you define your zones ok now there
are two concepts of forward lookup and
reverse lookup right so I told you that
when you enter the hostname and then you
hit enter in your browser then that's
called a forward lookup but however if
you enter the IP address that's the
reverse lookup so if you want people to
query your server either in the forward
or the reverse fashion using one of
these
lookup fashions so at that time for that
purpose you have to set up two different
zones so your first zone would have the
rules and settings for what should be
returned to them when they access you
from the forward lookup and when they
access your server through the lookup
through the reverse lookup then the
settings for those would be present
under this zone ok so I've just defined
that it's the hour I've just defined the
forward lookup as my domain name here as
you can see it's in the form of war.com
which is like a domain name and for the
reverse lookup of course it would be
from the IP address so for this reverse
lookup I've said it would be in the form
of an IP address and I have named it as
reverse door zone okay and similarly
fine would be forward dot dot zone
okay now this file RFC your file this is
going to be again a very longer file and
you
a lot of lines there and this would be
this would be placed in that so you
would understand this bedroom and I open
the demonstration so stick around till
then till you understand this completely
because it's a little tricky at this
step okay and then moving on to the next
point the next step is the configuring
of the forward and the reverse zone so
whatever we have configured over here in
step seven we have created the forward
zones here we have created a new file
forward dog zone and created a new file
reverse door zone we have to add the we
have to add the rules over here so
that's what you are doing here
you create one and then you open them
and you will have a basic template and
you will have to edit that template and
replace that template with your host
name and your IP address in the forward
dot zone you would replace the template
the template with your domain name and
in the reverse John you would replace
your template with your raw IP address
so these are the two things that you
have to do and when you do this your DNS
server is well and good okay but however
you might also want to change your group
ownership of those two files okay this
is a minus step that's needed you're
just setting it root access full
permissions and yeah that is the final
step when you do that you can just
restart your run ENB service and your
service would be up and running right so
these are the ten different steps which
are drawn need it
so I can now get started with my hands
on right so let's see how to configure
this binding asawa in ten simple steps
through my demonstration and for my
demonstration what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna open my virtual machine okay
so this is my virtual machine as you can
see I've already set my your domain name
here it says DNS bar not partisan
dot-com this is my machine name so let
me just open this up so first and
foremost let me just check what's my IP
address that's going on in Road 168 or
36.2 the IP address did not change
because I forward my step and lab assign
a static IP address for this right so
okay guys so I hope you can see the VM
clearly now right now the first thing of
course that you have to do is to install
bind right so the command for that is
sudo yum well what I'll do is I would
enter as sudo user okay
yeah the first command is to do a yum
install bind and I'm gonna give a strict
because there are multiple packages that
come with bind so I would want to
install all those utilities especially
the one that's a CH root and Newton's
package so when you give a spec all the
associated dog-pack this would be there
and since i have already the latest one
install i have nothing to do so the next
step would be let's go back to step
number two would be to assign a static
IP address so I've done that and let me
just verify that and show to you once
okay so let me open this and show to you
so I'm gonna do a cat command here or BM
itself let's see
this says config network scripts and I'm
gonna edit my at 0 file ok
okay so one minute oh yeah at zero fine
all right so here we go these are the
settings that I had told you that I had
already done I've assigned my IP address
your of mention it is going to be static
okay
I've also added these two lines and
netmask and gateway along with my IP
address so this is something that you
also have to do so let me just close
this now going to the step two is all
about assigning of you know assigning
fqn DN for my server right fully
qualified domain name so that we can do
by going to my
okay so as you can see my host name of
course it's DNS one dot val de not con
you can again change the domain name as
per your wish
right so this is the important thing and
the next step would be to configure the
Etsy / hosts file okay you have to add
your whatever domain name that you've
created you have to add the IP address
along with that okay so let me just good
my hosts file and show you that I've
done the same thing here my IP address
and I have also specified my domain name
for this particular IP address okay
that's done with step number four now
going to step number five we have to
then go to our resolve odd corner file
okay so our resolved what corner file is
again present over here and as you can
see I've said search Vardhan com okay
now I've mentioned my I mention my
domain name but however there is one
problem over here the name server is
wrong so it's spawning 21.1 so let me
just change this to my IP address which
I want to set for my name server and let
me also okay so I can also comment these
two lines I don't really need these two
lines okay so I'm going to comment them
out I'm gonna just save and quit all
right so going back to my step number
six now is where the whole bind task
starts so bind like I told you it's one
of the most popular DNS servers right so
let's edit the name d dot corner file
which is given by bind
so here we go and this is the file here
and this was the line that I was talking
about okay you would have no clothes
specified over here and you'll have to
change this with the IP address of the
server on which you are changed with the
a period of the machine that you want to
make your server
okay DNS server in my case it's my IP
address and we have to comment this line
of yours and then you will have the
allow query right so here you have to
specify any so these are the three
settings that you have to do in your
name be dot corner file okay when you
have done this you can just quit and
then you can go to the next step
that is configuring the RS you got 1 9 1
2 dot zones okay you define the zones
over here now okay so this is the file
the RFC file and as you can see this is
my yob this is the this is the thing
which is pointing to my forward zone ok
I've said
Vardhan dot-com is my domain and I've
said type master it's gonna be the
master it's all going to be the slave
it's gonna be the master over here and
I've said the file name is forward dot
zone ok when we say file forward on it
basically means the settings for the
rules that you need to follow that need
to return will be present in the file
called forward dot zone and this forward
dot zone would be present in the
directory that is there slash named Lee
ok that is a directive that you can set
in your name be dot koreff so the file
that I opened previously in that we have
to set the path so let me just quickly
open back that file and show you what
I'm talking about
so over here along with specifying these
three lines have something or less
directory right so whatever files that
my DNS bind is gonna create so that it
would it would place it in the slash
slash name B so even the forward zone
and the reverse zones which I'm gonna
configure in my RFC those would be
present on side inside this directory ok
so that's why we have written
powered zone which will be the name of
my file and similarly expanding the
other lines dumb file again over here is
where your cash and your logs will be
dumped okay and then you have a
statistics file man you'll have other
roadie rates well these are not if you
don't need to really worry about these
serials for now okay we need to verify
that it includes the RFC 1 N 1 2 dot
zones because you are defining your
forward and the reverse owns inside this
location okay now now going back to the
RFC 1 9 1 2 dot zones I explained this
part okay now what do you have to do is
one right guys
you
yeah sorry for the delay guys one minute
okay yeah so what I was what I was
talking about is setting the forward
zone we've done that here now we need to
go down and you would see the reverse
zone right here okay as you can see when
someone queries me with the IP address
of my system in that time we are
specifying the rules for that in this
file called reverse dot zone okay and
the second would be present in the same
directory and one thing which you would
find strangers we have we have the
subnet in the reverse order okay no
that's because that's how rules are
defined so you don't this is the only
thing that's going to be different
instead of giving 192 dot 168 got 56 you
would have to give it the other way you
have to first specify the class see then
comes Class B and then Class A Okay the
subnetting order is a little different
over here when you specify the reverse
door zone the reason for that is in the
universe door zone you specify the
number of your IP address so in my case
it's 2 so I've specified 2 and have
followed that up with the rules
so for that purpose be specified in this
order okay you would understand this
better later ok so right now you might
get a little confused so just hang
around so let me just quit and exit this
now going back - lies
the next step is to actually create the
forward zones and the reverse zones okay
and then open them and use the template
to basically create a rough 4/4 and
razones and then edit them so now those
would be present okay let me first clear
the screen rise okay so
let me do /vr /name D and I can do an LS
first okay so as you can see right now
we have something called us named B dot
localhost okay now this is the file that
provides the default template
okay now the forward Godzone and the
reverse door zone is what I created
based out of this so using this I
created these two files and let me now
show you what I have made changes in
these two files okay so this is my
fourth zone which I am first editing and
as you can see we have in the first one
it says TTL so TTL stands for time to
live and we say that as one day okay and
when we say at the rate it basically
means our rules for all okay and in
specific stands for Internet and SOA
stands for seed of authority
now these are a couple of terms which
you might not understand when you get
started with DNS right away okay so the
state of authority we are giving
complete when you say add the rate in
SOA we are giving complete authority to
this particular domain okay
that's what's happening and right after
specifying SOA with the tab space I've
said DNS 1.1 calm this is my fully
qualified domain name - I'm giving
complete authority okay along with that
I'm giving route dot the fully qualified
domain name now the one rule which we
often notice after I give the fully
qualified domain name I finish it with
append that with dot the the same thing
goes over here and over here okay this
is basically to indicate that your
domain is ending okay this is a syntax
so you cannot play around over here so
this make sure that you have a dot and
if there's any time with DES enero make
sure that you check this because most of
the time errors would be because of
giving of failing to give a dot
somewhere here okay
and these are again set of rules which
you don't need to really worry about
these are the rules when something goes
down it it's it's about the backup okay
so what are you just add it is these two
lines
in your forward dog zone when I have
said again with Salford Internet I've
said that the forward door zone over
here would act as a name server okay so
I'm sending up my bind as a name server
which would basically resolve IP
addresses and host names okay so NS
stands for name server if you want to
configure a mail service over here then
you can replace NS with MX and similarly
other options okay with bind of course
you have these two options and added
name servers name server and I've said
my server is a DNS born more than calm
okay
and the domain the DNS one have given
the IP address off one ninety two dot
one sixty dot 56.2 okay so whenever this
domain is queried then the address for
that query over here is the server okay
the server address would be one ninety
two dot one sixty dot 56.2 so that's
what the forward zone does now let me
just talk quickly exit this and open my
reverse zone and here the only
difference that you would see is the
last line over here okay so we the other
rules are the same you're saying
complete set of authority to your pure
domain name here and then these rules
are the same and you're also defining
the name server for DNS 1.1 or NORTHCOM
which is my domain name but instead of
EI we have PDR so yay over there stands
for address right that's pointing to
your address but when you say PTR it's
basically pointing to your IP address so
because it's a reverse lookup right so
from your iPad's it's looking up to your
domain name so that's why we replace
this with PTR this all is the syntax so
you say PTR and then you give the if
it's 56.2 in my case so I have given two
over here okay
now some of you might have had a doubt
why I gave that and reverse one and 2.10
856 so that's because the rules start
from here so it's 2.56 dot one sixty dot
one I know so it would look up in that
fashion right so now I hope or now you
have understood why I did that and yeah
that's pretty much
it and this is all that's needed to set
up your DNS server okay so let me just
start quit this again and clear the
screen so the ninth step that that needs
to be done is that of changing the group
ownership of these two files okay you
give them complete root access this is
something that I've already done so are
doing to brush up on this and finally
the tenth step is to restart your run
DMV service okay now let me just supply
the command for that okay
so service name e restart this is a
command to restart my service and it
says it's stopping my service okay and
it started my name service great now to
check if our connection is up and
running and we can do a dig command
which basically digs for our name
service and as you can see it says that
the status there's no error and it's
giving you all these details but to
understand better you need to just look
at this particular server if this is
coming perfectly right so the server
that you set your DNS service for is
this one one I need to load one succeed
or 56.2 so that is coming up here it's
perfect and it also says it's it's not
port 53 as we suggested now you can now
verify this in another way by supplying
this command and s lookup command and
specify the domain name in my case its
DNS 1.1 calm so when I hit enter you can
see that it says the server is my IP
address the address where it hosted is a
port number 53 inside the same IP
address and the domain name is this and
my IP address now similarly when I do a
reverse lookup I can do a one ninety two
dot one sixty eight dot 56.2 when I do
this it returns me my domain name again
right so
this is the server this is the port
number of edits running and the lookup
done in Reverse fashion right and it's
pointing to my correct domain name so
this is what a DNS server does so this
is how you setup a DNS server guys now
some of you might you know have a doubt
as to ok we have done we are doing the
lookup from the server that's why we are
getting to see the details the correct
details you know right so you're not you
know having your verification you don't
have a verification as to if you can
actually see this domain name from other
systems also now to answer that question
I can show you from a different VM so
this is one VM I can go to my second VM
here right and let me open up my
terminal first of all ok I'm gonna do
one if config and yeah this is my IP
address of this VM ok now let's see if
this from this VM if I do a reverse
lookup sorry if I do a lookup to my
domain name let's see if it's pointing
to the correct address right you guys
notice that this has a different IP
address right now let me supply the same
command and let's look up and say my IBM
my domain name here Vardhan calm ok and
when I hit enter ok so it's giving an
invalid address now that's because we
have not set the name server right so
there was one point number 6 which I
told you that we had to do even your
client side now it is this point this
one right value you will configure the
dissolved or corner file you have to set
the name server which you want your
system to look up to so that is what you
have to do over here so what every
client if you want to resolve the domain
name you have to do that and the command
for that is
resolve got Conniff okay and that who is
the password as you can see we have the
default ones over here now let me
replace let me first comment these two
lines and change the IP address over
here and point it to my name server so
my name server my DNS name server is a
physics dot to save an exit now if I
supply the same command then let's look
up command now you can see that it's
pointing to my IP address and it says
the port number where it's hosted is r53
and it's resolving my domain name and
there's the address from your let's
check you in the reverse lookup okay and
when you do that the reverse lookup also
works exactly the way we wanted correct
so it's pointing to my domain name and
yeah that's how this works guys so
that's how you set up at even a DNS
server and this is a simple 10-step
process it's actually not that simple
when you try it for the first time and
yeah a lot of people break their heads
trying to configure the DNS and probably
if you have to do it anytime in the
future hopefully this video helps and
all the best guys so try doing this in
this way and you will have a very easy
way out right so let me just go back to
my slides and I can finish my session
right
I can conclude today's session so I
first of all spoke about what is DNS
guys that is more than my first topic
then I told you how DNS works how the
DNS server looks for the IP addresses
with the help of the hierarchical names
I was present throughout the world and
then the simple ten step process to
creating your bind DNS over and I give
you a hands-on or demonstration of the
same right so this was what I covered in
the session today
and yeah that pretty much brings us to
the end of my session so guys are can
