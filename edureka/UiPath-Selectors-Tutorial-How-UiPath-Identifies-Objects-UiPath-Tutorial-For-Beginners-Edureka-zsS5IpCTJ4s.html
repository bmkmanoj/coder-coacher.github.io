welcome to this session on water
selectors and uipath today in this
session we are going to see what our
selectors exactly and why do we need
them in your iPod right so without
missing any time let's move on to the
agenda to see what all we'll be covering
in today's session so we start this
session by first discussing water
selectors and then we'll see why do we
need selectors in UI part after that
we'll see how to use selectors in your
path and ending our session with a
hands-on right so today's session is
going to be a quick one but we are going
to know a very important topic in the UI
path studio which is selectors which is
going to help you in doing a lot of
automations in a day to day life all
right
so without wasting any time let's start
with the first topic of today's
discussion which is what are selectors
so they're selectors are nothing but
basically a plain text which is used to
uniquely identify an element on the
screen for example if I am to talk about
this particular image that you can
currently see as a human I would say you
know this is an image which has create
outlines and it has a arrow witcher's of
a semi creek color right it's on the
right side of the screen and it is
aligned in the middle of the
presentation so this is the way another
person who would like to recognize this
particular object on the screen now
imagine a telling it to a computer so if
you were to tell it to a computer you
would do that using plain text or code
right and you would tell them for
example if you want to identify an
element for a website let's say for Eddy
Rekha there is this element which is a
search box on the website right now if I
were to identify this particular element
on the screen if I want to tell the
computer that this is the element that
you have to identify let's see how the
computer would look into it
or how the computer would actually
identify this particular element the
most generic way of you know identifying
elements on a screen is by noting its
pixel coordinates term right so once you
have the pixel coordinates you know
where exactly
to look for that particular element on
the screen and you can easily identify
the element there the other way for your
computer to identify it is by looking at
the URL and it's pointing to for example
if you were to search anything inside
the search box
it'll always point to something like any
record or course slash search slash the
search term that is searching for so it
will always have this particular URL
attached to it right so you can easily
identify the element on the screen by
identifying the you are in which it is
assigned to the next way you can
identify this particular element is by
the CSS all right so you can look at the
CSS of this first box and you can say
okay so this particular way any element
that is looking this particular way is
what is to be selected what is what my
target element is all right so these are
all selectors these are all ways of
identifying elements on the screen of a
computer and they are called selectors
all right now the question that you
might be asking yourself is why do we
need selectors in the iPod so you might
be wondering this is a uipath session
why are we learning about selectors
right so let me explain you how that
makes plen'y why so you need selectors
because sometimes the content that
you're trying to access or the content
you're trying to automate is not static
all right for example web sites so web
sites are not static everything changes
on every page right if the whole page is
being reloaded right for example this
particular web site on this particular
website you will see that the URL of the
page changes every time I click on next
alright also the element like for
example what I want to do when this
particular website is I want to identify
this particular image right so whenever
I click on next the properties of this
image will change all the properties of
this image box will change it will not
point to this particular image which
might have a different source origin it
might have a different name it might
have different dimensions and all of
that all right so everything changes
wherever I am changing the webpage and I
want to solve this animal autumn
this part wherein I can easily identify
the image the main image on screen right
so if I were to do that I would use
selectors because using selectors I can
tell you a path that these are the
properties that I want to focus on and
these are the properties that I don't
want to focus on for example since the
name is changing on every webpage that
I'm carrying or I'm pressing next to I
can ignore the name property of this
particular image I can maybe import or
AG maybe use some other property which
is not changing throughout the website
you know II respect or whether I'm
clicking on next or not so our aim is
using selectors we have to select the
properties that will never change on
each and every page right so this is the
motive of using selectors in UI path now
how can you actually use these selectors
in your path if you were to do
or if you were to analyze these
selectors of a particular element how
you can do that using UI path so let's
share a light in that so in your path
you must have noticed this silicon which
is there on top screen and you must have
noticed this particular tool inside you
have our studio which is called launch
UI explorer now this is where all the
magic happens guys this is where you can
see all the sectors that your UI path
will be identifying or will be fetching
to basically identify that particular
element of the screen so let me quickly
jump to my tool so that I can show you
what I basically mean so this is the
ribbon that I was talking about guys and
this is the tool this is the magic tool
that our radio is based on today
so if you want to analyze a particular
element on the screen you simply just
have to click on launch UI explorer all
right which will give you this
particular screen now if I want to
identify or if I want to analyze say the
run icon on the UI parts to do let's see
how I can select or how I can list the
selectors for this particular element so
you will click on this particular icon
which say select target element I'll
click there and then I will select I'll
over on the element which I want to
identify using selectors so say I want
to identify that run I can on you have
actual UI click on run right and then it
will give me all the selectors which are
related to that particular element now
the waste selectors work guys is like
this now I understand most of you guys
must be from non programming backgrounds
and I don't want to scare you with the
code all right so it is very easy to
understand if you try to see what is
happening so the way this particular
icon has been recognized is like this so
the first line which comes in selectors
is basically the window which will have
that particular element so if you look
at it it is looking for a window whose
title is UI to do dot exe which is
basically this so this is the window
which is being you know recognized in
the whole of the extra power on the
whole of the screen once it finds us to
do dot exe window it will look for the
title which is UI paths to do community
- selector so as you can see it isn't
matching this title so if all these
things match it has successfully
identified the window once it and fires
the window it will go into the ribbon so
as you can see the ID of that particular
element is written so this is the ribbon
for your particular element right inside
the ribbon there is one more ID which is
called part underscore tab strip so
basically it would point to this
particular space on the ribbon and then
so on and so forth in the end it will
have the Run button right and this is
how you will reach the Run button or
this is how your UI path studio is it I
can
it is taking a top-down approach it
starts from the window drills down into
the components and then gets that
particular element all right so these
are the selectors guys this is how you
can identify selectors for a particular
element of the screen now moving on this
roof is a very general example this was
just to teach you how you can identify
the selectors in UI path now let's move
on to the hands-on part where and we'll
be actually seeing which exact places
will use selectors to solve them all
right so let's look at the problem
statement so let's take the example
forward that we took before right so
this is a website which basically gives
you nice quotes on images right now I
like the images guys so I want all these
images where I want a particular number
of images to be downloaded from the side
automatically right so if you want to do
it as a human if you were to do it you
would basically right click on the image
save images and then give the name you
know save it in a particular folder that
you want now say I have more than 50
images from this particular website so
if I were to do so it will be a very
cumbersome task for me and I want to
solve that all right so if I were to
solve that I would be using UI pod
studio and in the password I will be
designing the automation for this
particular demonstration so let's see
how we can do that so let me go to my
tool all right so guys this is the tools
where you will be or this is the area
where you will be designing your
automation so the first thing that you
need to have is a sequence so you need
to have a sequence of steps so let me
type in sequence all right so the first
thing that you need is a sequence of
steps right the first thing that I need
to have in my workspace area is the
sequence let me drag and drop the
sequence over here so I have a sequence
now inside this sequence I will have a
series of steps that I want to execute
one by one so the first thing that I
want to do is go to this particular
website which is having the quotes for
me right so this is the website that I
want to go to let me tell my UI part
showed you how to go to this
website so basically I have to open a
browser and inside that browser I have
to go to this particular link so let me
copy the link from you and paste it
inside the URL bar all right so once I
have the URL bar now my sequence the
first thing that we'll do is lower the
browser and it'll go to this particular
link now which browser do I wanted to
open I want it to open me Chrome all
right so I'll select Chrome from the
browser type of properties of this
particular element next that I wanted
what I want my UI patch to do is take a
screenshot of this particular image all
right so what I do is I'll simply right
take screenshot right I'll get this
element or I'll get this activity I'll
drag and drop it here and now I have to
tell the take screenshot activity what
exact thing do I want this picture off
right so now I click on indicate element
inside browsers once I click here I have
to specify which image the one the
screenshot off so for example I want
this main image to have the screenshot
right so I click on it and the
screenshot is taken next what I want to
do is once I have taken the screenshot I
click on next I'll go to the other page
and I will take the screenshot again and
do it as many times as I want right so
the next thing that I want to do is
click on next so I will type in click I
drag and drop it here indicate the
element inside browser which is here and
that is it right so now my UI path
should your knows that I have to take a
screenshot of the image and once I take
a screenshot I have to click on next and
do it again now I want the input from
the user as in how many images do I want
right so the UI path should I understand
that say I want 10 images so it should
have a interface to interact with me so
that interface is basically input dialog
all right so we'll type in input and
you'll have this activity over here just
simply drag and drop it here it's very
simple and specify what all details do
you want your dialect to display to you
so I
tell my daughter to tell me that enter
the details are entered how many images
do you want download
all right so I've specified that now
whatever entry or whatever number I will
be putting it in this particular input
dialog has to be stored somewhere right
so I'll be specifying a variable here
which could be saying now right all
right so now whatever I'm entering over
here or whatever values I'm entering
into the input eyelid is being stored in
a variable called num now as there is
two ways to declare available one way of
doing it is by clicking on variables and
clicking on create variable and then
specifying the name of your variable and
then selecting the type of a variable
right the other way to create your
variables is like this so you know if I
wanted to relieve this video I just
delete it say I want to declare a
variable over here so I'll just simply
hit control key and once I hit control K
I can specify what variable do I want my
UI power to store over here it's very
simple
so once have specified these variable
where my value will be stored the next
thing that I want my computer to do or
my I want my uipath robot to do is take
this feed shots so basically I have told
my UI Barth robot to take this feature
and create our next right but once I do
that I'll also have to save that image
in a particular location so I haven't
specified that so to do that I will
simply say save image over here and drag
and drop the activity here all right so
if it's taking a screenshot where is it
storing I have to define a variable for
that as well so I simply hit ctrl K and
specify the variable name as image it
will automatically identify where or you
know what type of variable type has to
be assigned to this variable so once it
does that it will store that image in
this particular variable and I want to
save this variable or I want to convert
this variable into file so my save image
activity will help me doing that so
first I have to specify the variable
over here in the first half and then the
location where I want my selector to be
or where
my image to be saved so for that let me
say I want my images to be stored inside
the pictures library and say I create a
new folder here with the title images
alright so I want my images to come here
so what I do is I simply copy the
address from here and save it over here
alright now I specify the name of the
file that I want to see so say it'll be
image dot PNG cool seems fine right now
I want to do this process again and
again till my number of images that I've
specified here is met so to do that I
have to run a loop now there's a loop in
UI path called
two while which basically means that you
will do something while that condition
has true right so let me drag and drop
it here so while this condition is true
it will execute a small or a sequence of
steps until the specified condition is
true alright so what will be the
condition so the condition should
basically mean that there will be
available say I create a variable called
Val
which will basically be an integer and
this integer is the time it is less than
num that is the number of images that I
have provided it should keep on taking
screenshots and once the number of
screenshots reach the number of images
that I wanted it will come out of the
loop so basically my condition should be
vile should be lesser than num all right
now my num is basically a generic value
in variable so I have to convert it into
integer so that it can be compared with
Val right so the way to convert your
variable into integer is C I and T and
then brackets
it basically means convert this
particular variable into integer alright
so once it is converted into integer it
can be compared with another integer
and you know it can be termed as a
condition
now while this statement is true I want
to execute these set of steps so let me
copy these set of steps and paste it
inside my for loop right so let me copy
these steps right and paste it here
inside the for loop and my for loop will
basically go inside the do component of
my browser so whenever my browser will
open it will basically execute a loop
which will execute until my number of
images have been taken or am the number
of images have been downloaded all right
so now as I can see it is taking a
screenshot and just saving the image and
then it is clicking next right now the
only one part is left that whenever
you're doing these kind of automation
and whenever you're doing this kind of
automation you are dependent on the
website right so the website should be
loaded fully so let's give a delay over
here which will basically give our
website the time to load properly all
right so let's drag and drop an activity
here called delay I hope you guys
understand why I'm adding delay because
say I I go to this particular website
and hit on refresh right now it's taking
some time to load so my computer should
give this much time to my machine to
load the web page so that it does not
give me an error that the element has
not been formed for example it clicks on
next now my website is taking time to
you know reload and there is nothing on
the screen and my UI path may go crazy
that I cannot find the element that you
have specified so to avoid that we use
the delay statement which is basically
delay or will basically before going to
the next iteration of taking the
screenshot it will wait for three
seconds and for the website to load all
right so let's specify the time over
here for which it should wait so the
deviation should be three seconds so let
us configure it to be three seconds
which would be like this right so now my
sequence will wait for three seconds
for going on to the next hydrogen also I
would want my valid integer to be
incremented because only then it'll you
know there will be a stage when Val and
num will be comparable over when they'll
be equal so what I do is I will again so
it's for an activity called assign all
right I'll drag and drop the assign
activity here and let me increment my
Val by well plus one I hope you
understand this because my condition is
that until and unless my Val is less
than my num variable this particular
loop has to be executed for example I
want around three images to be
downloaded so my num variables value
becomes three right and a Val you know
its default value let's specify it here
would be zero right so my Val value is
zero and my nums well U is 3 so it will
go to this high iteration it will take a
screenshot it will come here and it will
assign the value of Val to be +1 which
is so now it was zero before now it
becomes one write it again checks the
condition one is less than three it will
again go I take one more screen short
come over here
you know increment the value of value I
want and so now it's two if it again
compares or two is less than three again
do the iteration so then it becomes
three and since 3 is less than three is
four that will come out of the loop and
end of the program so basically you get
and you end up with three screenshots
which are the ones that you want right
so I think this activity is complete now
now let me show you how this particular
program will run so obviously this
program will not be able to run because
at every time the click image or the
click button is pressed every element on
the screen changes all right so let us
see what we get right now so let's say
hit on run so if I hit on run this is
the input dialog that I was talking
about it may ask me how many images do I
want to talk much let me quickly close
this tab so that there's no confusion
and click hit 3 3 is the number that I
want so I click on OK so
this will basically open browser so now
it is trying to identify the image of
the page and if hitting next but the
thing over here is it can only hit it
once right it cannot identify the image
again because everything on this
particular web page has changed right
the text of that image is saying maybe
the source of that image has changed as
well so now it is not able to identify
the image of the screen and hence you
see that it is not automating or it is
not doing anything anymore
right so it will take a few seconds it
will keep on trying and then will hit
you give you an error that it is not
able to find the UI element
corresponding to the selector right so
this is the error that you are getting
when you're trying to solve it so let me
quickly fix one thing which is you know
I want my Chrome browser to open choice
select it Chrome now so whenever I'll be
doing I'll be running this project now
my Chrome browser no I don't want I he
all right so now let us configure how or
let us see how we can actually template
eyes this particular image that we had
right or how we can identify this
particular image irrespective of what
page BR on or irrespective of what
quotation image it is there right so to
do that we have to go into selectors so
the way you can select or you can see
the selectors for this particular image
or that particular image container on
that website is going to target right
and hitting and you know selecting the
selector option over here which is this
so as you can see the current selector
of this element is including the name of
the image as well so guys this is where
the problem is right whenever we
clicking next on the webpage and new
image is coming in and this name changes
and it has no longer able to match this
particular name to that image right and
that is why we are getting an error so
let's see how we can fix it so basically
now what I will be doing is I will be
kicking on launch UI Explorer
so it is asking me to indicate an
element on the screen so let me hit
escape right now to cancel the selection
and let me open the web page where my
image was
so basically I want to templatized this
particular container which will have the
image so whenever whichever page I am on
I want a screenshot of whatever is there
inside this particular image container
right so let's see how we can fix that
so I will click on open UI Explorer and
let me indicate that this is the element
where I am wanting these selectors to be
off right so it will open the uipath
explorer as you can see this is this
selector that we want to be changed all
right so let me quickly select the
target element again so that I get the
original selectors for my image so these
are the original selectors will give me
a top-down approach from the browser
till the element that I'm trying to
target now as you can see even the
browser has a title which is something
like this which is based on the image
that it is showing right so this is
again are not good for me because every
time I hit next this title is changing
all right so I don't want this title now
this is a new thing that you will be
learning is that whenever you are saying
that whatever the right will be or
whatever a particular element be do this
right so that anything that placeholder
for anything which can come into the
existence is called star for example in
this particular case I am saying
whatever in the Chrome browser whatever
the right will be searched for this
particular element all right the other
way to say this could be or let me give
you some clarity you know what I'm
trying to explain if I go to this
particular browser you can see that
there is a quote over here and after
that brainy code is being written all
right let's see if it is same on the
next page as well I'll hit next and if I
see the title now I'll again see that
the code has been changed but what not
has changed is the end statement of the
title which is - brainy code right so if
I come back to my selectors I come back
to the title section of my selectors
it's a star space - space brainy code
which basically means anything can be
before this particular you know word
which is brainy code and not bothered
with that but the title should always
end with - brainy code all right so this
is the significance of star over here
this is what the star is basically me
it's a placeholder for anything it could
be anything that is being filled before
a - brainy code right so now how it is
identifying this particular element is
so any HTML page which is you know in
the Chrome browser if it's having a
title in which in the end it's - brainy
code go inside that particular tab right
so this seems to be fixed we can also
further strengthen it by giving the URL
as well so I can give the URL for that
tab as well over here and if you see the
URL guys so let's try to see if the URL
is changing or not so if I hit next I
can see that this particular section of
the URL is always same and this
particular section of the URL is
changing all right so what I do is I
copy this section of the URL go to my
tool and specify the URL here and say
star after that which basically means
anything which is before star is this
and anything after this could be
anything right anything after this is
and not bother about it
but the start of the URL should be
something like this
and if it is like this go inside that
particular tab right now you can
validate whether it is still able to
identify the element on the screen by
hitting this validate selector so right
now as you can see the image has changed
right so let me hit back right and let
me see if this is the same image that my
selector is pointing to all right so I
feed this is the same so it says there
is only one happiness in this life and
it also said there is only one happiness
in this life so right now if I hit on
validate selector it should tell me
whether it is pointing to this image
or not so I'll hit validate selector it
was pointing to this particular image
all right
but the moment I click on next and if I
go to my UI part selector now and I say
validate selector it'll say to cannot
find the UI object for the selector that
I have provided because now this
particular image of this browser is
having a different name right so we have
to fix that so again since the name is
changing at every page I would not want
the name property to be included when
I'm trying to identify an element right
so let us see what all other things I
have over here which I can actually use
so the title I cannot use because again
the title will change the source I
cannot use because the source of the
image will change as the image changes
right in the parent class I can consider
the class of the file I can consider the
class of the image container this is
basically the class of the image
container which is there and I think
this will do good if you select this as
our selector I think it will be able to
recognize that element of this let's see
if we are right or wrong so we will
click on manage selector the current
selector points when you are different
than one you have selected that is fine
because previously we had some other
image so this morning basically tells us
that now we are being pointed to some
other element right so to fixed is what
we can do is we can go back to the image
that was originally the source for this
selector that you have modified and
click on validate selector so yes the
current selector is valid for this
selector as well which we have just
modified so I think this selector should
work or is working right if I click on
next now and again validate the selector
it says the current selector is valid if
I again change the webpage and I click
on valid selector it again can validate
the image container that I have
templatized using selectors so this code
now is usable I can copy this code and I
can close this and I can paste it over
here so now my image container has been
templatized so on every page it can
identify the main image right so this is
why selectors are important guys now
again if I scroll down a bit and I see
the click button this again can be a
problem but for now let's try to run it
and see if we need to implement
selectors and button as well so we'll
hit run it let us close this tab and
let's enter say I want around forever
juice and I'll hit OK okay so my Chrome
browser has opened so now it has seen my
website and as you can see it is waiting
for three seconds and then clicking on
next taking the screenshot and alright
so our automation works so now the one
thing that I have forgot to do over here
is change the image so if I were to see
how many images I have in my folder it's
only going to show one because every
time that it is trying to save an image
it is saving it by the same name that is
image dot PNG so I have to fix this now
so to fix this I can do a simple math
problem which is basically something
like this so I can add a number in front
of the image name so what number so what
better than our own variable that is
valid right so that val has to be
converted to string if I am trying to
store it as a mean so let's enter the
Val variable here and now save the
project all right so now let's try to
run our program and see if you are
getting different files so it will ask
me the number of images that I want to
remove as they around five images let's
hit OK
we'll go to the page it has saved one
file
see if the second trial
saved third file the fourth file and
then the last time interpreters
and once it has finished the automation
it will close the browser and return to
my new ipod studio so let's see if I
have five images in a folder now so yes
I have around five images so let's check
if these images I can see these images
so yes I have successfully automated
this particular website by template
izing the objects that are there on this
particular website using selectors right
so with that guys congratulations on
your first project on selectors so I
hope you guys have learned something new
and basically this opens a lot of scope
in terms of automation you can just
think about automating something and
using selectors you can do that it is a
very powerful thing that uipath has
given to us and we can basically
implement it on any website that is
there on the web alright so with that
