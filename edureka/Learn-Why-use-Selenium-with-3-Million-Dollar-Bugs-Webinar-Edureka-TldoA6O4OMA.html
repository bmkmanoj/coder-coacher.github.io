Nandan Singh from a Judaica and I'll be
your trainer and instructor for this
webinar first of all thanks for joining
this webinar session this session is
about introduction of why we should use
selenium to find words and why should we
should of this tune for a good career as
a good career option for the automation
industry okay so before going that we
have almost 15 to 20 student in this
webinar so it's very hard to take the
introduction from each one of you from
your side so let me introduce myself I
am Nandan Singh and I have more than
seven Europe experience in both
development and automation and I've used
defend automation tools like qtp
selenium jmeter and so puree so but all
but when all those things are I like
selenium more because it's it's not a
tool it's an API so if you are working
on a selenium just like you are
developing something okay so this a
quick this was about quick introduction
of me and we're going forward and can I
have a you guys are just precious or you
guys are experienced like can I have a
simple word that experience or pressure
from your side quick so that i can
understand to who-who's okay everyone
saying expedience experience we shake it
saying experienced see i got three
answer get to experience rohit but
inexperienced no one is pressure right
now right okay thank you guys so so it
means most of you are experienced in
either in automation and manuel it may
be possible that you guys on experience
on manual maximum of you and some of you
experienced on automation underpin
proves other than say media right so so
let's start let's start with the session
and we have quite a very small window to
cover all those concerned with and we'll
try to cover as much as I can ok guys so
let's start with the book consent we all
know the working set because you all are
experienced with experience having two
or more than a year of on manual testing
of QA bad so let's
white should we use selenium to find
million-dollar works right and whenever
I say million-dollar works it means the
bird which caused around million dollar
of revenue offer of a particular company
right so before that we know what is
worth we all know what is worth can I
get a very good definition of what is
bug one line definition any one of you
what do you think what is a bug but is a
software bug one line definition
anything read this in this is
intellectual I haven't got any change
from requirement dog is I mean Damon
saying it's a chain from requirement
okay something not specified in the
requirement okay a requirement with
doesn't work as expected okay ramanathan
is saying okay so all this the answer is
the moving around requirement okay
deviation from requirement Rohit is
saying quite precise and depth that's
good division for my expected behavior
now this is the answer which i hope i've
actually expecting deviation from
expected behavior what is expected
behavior and how this will this is
actually the deviated see let's suppose
I have then let me take an example let's
suppose I write an application which
which which is nothing very simple
application which actually provides sum
of two numbers a plus B can you see
right if I give a argument as a 2 and B
attitude then you should leave the
answers for right but if it's not able
to provide this for as an answer if it
provide 22 at the answer then still the
application is working but the behavior
is not what is expected right this is
deviation their vision from expected
behavior this is a bird which happen
introduced might be the bad be any any
of the reason it can be from disappear
resigner can be from poor logic it can
be anything visit it is very simple
example of how what is worth will you
okay all know so this kind of work can
impact your business revenue a lot right
so we are starting with three important
million-dollar books which have actually
impacted the business revenue a more
than a million John right let's start
with the agenda of training session we
will cover what is a million dollar
burger I assume you already got the
picture of what is a million-dollar perk
we will see three different examples of
million order work and then we will see
what is the impact of the million-dollar
work on a particular reputation or
ripped revenue of a company then we will
see but the best practices to avoid such
a book right and how selenium come is in
this picture and how sane IAM or the
mission helpers to find this kind of
bugs and how we can prepare ourself in
for the future or depression industry so
after this agenda i will show you the
overall picture of automation the
overall picture of how we can migrate
from manual testing to automation
testing though so just me relax this is
not a technical / we are not I'm not
going to cover any technical stuff for
this but this is about the 30th lots and
we'll take an inkblot an example okay so
let's start with the million-dollar by
example in between if you guys have any
question any queries then just drag it
down on a chat window I will try to
resolve or give the answer for the same
at that instant of time okay so what is
a million order but we already know the
definition it can be a bug which caused
you which took a million dollar to get
detected it can be a bug which caused
million-dollar damage to business of the
company similarly it can be a word which
damaged the company's reputation it can
be a bug which can be reported by a
customer not by your test our internal
thing it can be any one of these read
the definition is not limited to a
particular line definition can be
extended depending upon the context of
the book right so it can be any one of
this if the berk to summarize all this
if the bug is not detected by internal
team of a software company or the
company which of the
company which is developing the product
then that can be devastating to the
revenue as well as the repetition of
that company right so let me take three
example three different examples of a
huge works which caused million dollar
loss to the revenue of company the very
first book is a migration backlog okay I
got one question can we say it high
severity in high priority but da Vinci
see a high severity in high priority is
a bit technical term which have been
used in whenever you are doing a testing
but million-dollar work when this book
comes out inside the product and reach
to the customer this severity terms and
prior to terms just 0 which customer
doesn't use like only term which are we
are going to use once the work the lease
with the product is the loss to the
company if you are detecting this bird
when developing your software then it's
good to be a lateen priority but but if
it's out if its release with the provel
then it's always lost to the revenue as
well as the reputation of the company
okay see I mean is it answer of your
question right okay let me go forward so
very first burg at the million-dollar
burg is immigration backlog but is in my
immigration backlog migration is the
process I I guess we already you guys
know what is in migration when you are
want to live in particular foreign
country for permanent Oh for very long
time then there is a sequence of
processes in which you need to go throw
for my creation so the system this work
was introduced in the US and the system
that they have developed was incapable
of dealing with the backlog what is
backlog backlog is kind of a process or
thing which introduced when you have a
lot more application to process but you
don't have different authority or
resources to complete those projects
within time so what would happen there
will a backlog or the pile of
application just the stove there and
they actually need more time to process
those applications
right so there was a bird which have
been introduced which was not able not
available to dealing with the backlog
cases which results in 29,000
application backlog which means 29,000
application was still waiting to get
process right and due to this work this
work the authorities were failed to
locate more than 50,000 peoples and when
they resolve this and this issue in the
overall cost over the loss for the
coming was up to 1.6 billion dollars the
huge loss due to a single book okay and
this book become our million-dollar Berg
let's move to the second example for the
same which is for the company toyota
there was a model Toyota company model
which is called hybrid prius cars you
might guys have listened about this burg
it's very famous book there was a glitch
on the software of that model that while
driving while on the road that's just
the dead bird potentially shut down the
hybrid system that dick may cause the
life-threatening issue right so and so
for preventing so it has a reputation
what i have done toyota recalled more
than one point line 19 million hybrid
cars so that they can fix this issue for
those individual cars this will save the
 company's reputation but loss but
affected the revenue lost more than two
billion dollars they're actually called
one like 3,000 hybrid cars from Europe
seven lakh cars from North America or
nine like our phones upon you to just a
single glitch software glitch okay you
can understand how a severe how a severe
birth can be then if it's produced if
it's released to the system right okay
let's move the third important work
which caused million dollar loss it is
Amazon's ecommerce ecommerce omni amazon
what happened actually due to this work
the price of some product have
introduced from from their original
price to just a penny so what happened
product on say for just one painting
amazon marketplace the customer just
bought the project but projects but many
pick the items expensive as a mobile
phones for just one penny right so what
happened in order to save companies air
pollution they can't just say customer
to get back our product just returned
our product but they actually absorb
this loss which is around 100 thousand
dollars that's due to one book these are
the examples of three dif million
dollars works which actually affected
the company's reputation as well as
revenue so you know you can take these
ideas how important is to remove the
book if if the work is released along
with the software then if it can be a
very severe it can be a very huge impact
on the community opposition okay this
actually example of million dollar bucks
let's move forward and see what a
different reason so that these birds
just introduced an hour applications
office right you might be here okay my
phone is saying perfect thank you
measuring okay this can be these these
reasons can be a different reason this
decision can be those by which a bug is
introduced or creep in our application
can be a human factor can be a
communication failure when I say
communication failure it can be a
requirement communication failure as
well it can be unrealistic development
time frame like you might feel already
this problem that but I'm the cushion so
these are different
switchable navani icing so this are
different reasons by which a particular
bug can be introduced in our system ok
so the third region was unrealistic
development time frame they it may be
possible due to very tough deadline to
the stakeholders provide unrealistic
timeframe to develop the product which
actually introduced which actually force
our developers to to complete the
project and without taking care of the
quality of the product it mean then this
can also with a very it's actually
they're very important reason why which
burgers introduced in the applications
okay the fourth reason is poor design
logic who are coding practices lack of
words and controlling poor design what
you bring me we know what is design
logical design lot is not bullets very
odd reason who are coding practices for
coding purchasing means if we are not
following the standard protocols to
write the code standard practice to
write the code then that can lead to
different books as well okay third
reason is the lack of version control
you might not hear this this term
version controlling wasn't controlling
is a wave by which you actually create
the version for each builds so if there
is a bird in build too then you can roll
back to the build one without any
problem there are a lot more tools which
actually provide your words and
controlling so it is very good practice
to use version controlling if you are
not using versions and Tony the
developer is not using that version
control is and what it means whenever
there is a bug in the last bill then you
don't have any option to go back to the
previous build and you have to resolve
the book as soon as possible like some
reason is buggy third-party tools
without ensuring how but free the third
party too is if we use their tool in our
software in our application and it might
be possible that work is not in our
application but due to the third party
tool it have been introduced right
important reason is lack of skilled
testing you would develop the software
but the responsibility of removing the
birds is on
you a person cubed ice so if the person
is not skilled then it may possible
those works just kept or missed by the
papers and get introduced and get
released around along with the project
okay the last reason it can be a
last-minute change right so it means a
we're ready to release our put up to the
production and in the last min change of
our product nagising oh god I missed a
change and I miss a requirement you guys
have to build today itself these kind of
things actually introduced and we
haven't got any further time for for
testing this kind of thing can introduce
a lot more bugs in your application okay
hope these points are clear to you guys
if we sell if you guys build at some
point is not clear then please let me
know at that instant okay these are the
major reasons by which words are just
introduced in our system let's move
forward and what is the impact of these
verbs we have already seen this
million-dollar impact on business
revenue as well as business reputation
God ready how we can end if I ask you a
to be scaled what is the minimum
requirement German is saying asking this
question identifying QA skill is very
tough to be honest because development
you can use the use different logic and
different principles but in the queue
way there is no prints for no standard
it's about the experience only so what
actually happened them at the time of
interview on your skilled person can
recognize the candidates in scale or not
the minimum requirement your second
question is what is the minimum of the
comment there is no minimum requirement
you must have the attitude of finding
bugs of cracking the system this is the
minimum requirement rest of them can be
learned while doing testing right there
is no minimum comment of software
testing until unless you are doing
automation or the automation part you
have some different like you should know
programming skills like Java
some other groups and different tools
which have been used by the company but
for as a QA the minimum the common is is
the only attitude of cracking the system
okay Simon hope this dancer of your
question impact value comes I mean so
without depending facts / of these birds
over our system first one is the huge
monetary loss we have seen three
different million-dollar bugs damage to
brand repetition if you have a bird
which is very severe than it obviously
it will affect your reputation employer
dissatisfaction shutdown of a particular
service of company customer
dissatisfaction it may also lead to
legal issues as well so is that
different impacts of a book if it
released along with your product okay
it's a very simple issues where we I i
can assume that you guys already know
this kind of impact report it's a very
common things okay let's move forward
and let's see but our depend best
practices to avoid birds okay this some
tactics is for the developer and some
packages for testers the very first
thing is for the developer avoid fancy
coding and follow standard fancy gorings
about if each one of the developers
start writing code as per their own way
of writing code then it's very hard to
merge all codes and to review the code
which have been written by a particular
code right instead of this if we follow
a particular standard then it will be
very easy to merge code as well as to
review whatever we have written there
right second respected is to use
available libraries by here available
libraries I mean the library which comes
a long way you're different software
package for example if you are using
Java libraries and instead of you
creating your own library it's very it's
try to use the leverage which comes
along with Java or other different to
straight instead of creating your arm
for existing code
learn how to the factor you might not
hear this this term refactor the
refactor is the word is to instead of
changing the signature of the method or
behavior you are actually changing the
definition of the behavior right so what
will happen if you refactor your code by
refactoring you are not actually
breaking some others code you are
actually changing only the behavior the
only real signature remains the same so
the code remains the same but behavior
it changes a bit so instead of changing
entire code we should learn how to
refactor our code the fourth is don't do
anything too quickly so it's obvious
that there is a tough deadline but okay
I got another question once again worms
in the factoring MC asking a fetching
once again okay let me take the example
of refactoring let's suppose in very low
level example I'm taking low levels
example let's suppose you have created a
method 1 i'm giving the example in java
let's suppose this is method 1 which is
returning in teaser and and the name is
get some it is of using two numbers in
deserve a integer number one and and
Deezer numb too okay and what is this
method is going to do this matter is
actually taking creating another
variable which is called a and first
saving this one and taking creating
another variable which is B and saving
this number in this one and then
creating another exam variable which is
insert and saving a plus B to this one
and then finally returning there are
some as this ok this is the matter which
have been created by by a particular
developer so verse which the output eyes
method is always some of this two
numbers so method one will always
provide some of
two numbers okay no no you have created
this method and now another lead
developer actually reviewed your code
and after young he's saying it's good
that you are actually returning some of
the tournaments good but whatever the
the way you have written your code is
not good you are initializing two
different variables without this is not
necessary you should refactor your code
they factor your method and eliminate to
unnecessary and necessity variables so
what would happen the actual behavior
should remain the same now this method
one its method one point one should
remain same like it should return sum of
two numbers but here I am refracting in
this way but how I am refactoring its
signature should remain the same right
and if still take two numbers now one
and um do instead of hitting these two I
am creating a single integer a single
variable result and I'm saving num1 and
num2 directly so but the difference
between these two methods these two
methods is same their result will be
same but inside the definition is
actually change so we actually I reduce
these two variables and created only
single one but they result always remain
the same this is called a real
factorization you have your actual
refactoring your code so that some
others code will not be changed this is
the answer your question which is called
a factorization MC is it clear now
can I get a confirmation from your side
Oh given to thank you welcome home so
let's move forward so learn how to
refactor EV way i will show you
different other techniques to refactor
code and refactoring is an art it comes
with time it it cannot be learning a
very first day it comes with time don't
do anything too quickly okay so sing now
the thing which comes is about testing
followed test-driven development
approach you might hear this word
test-driven development what is
test-driven development can I get any
answer can I get answer any one of you
knows what it says driven development a
single line example testing will be
involved with Emily saying testing will
be involved from the from that's correct
sermon mesh were insane coding developed
based on test cases based on test cases
is ugly somehow true ashita o Jason coat
is returned to deposit test yep first
pervading test and then developed debts
vamsi dad's domain-driven not domain
driven this is called the different
agneta sniffing is different from taps
key point of view testing is along with
development lower nursing that's correct
so what is tested rubin development let
me show you image I'd the same thing in
test-driven development which is called
TDD there is another term called be DD
which is called behavior behavior driven
development right so we are actually
because in not behave EDD we are
discussing about the DD test-driven
development in test-driven development
whenever we write our code we actually
write test cases corresponding our core
so there are two different way to ensure
that you are following ddd first one is
unit testing this
is this should be done by developer so
in short they are called UT they should
write you these so for each piece of
code they should have unit testing
covered right once the Union testing is
completed and your product is developed
and you have functional test cases or
somehow some people say regression test
cases or functional classing this is
actually combination of all different
behaviors different modules functional
testing or regression testing okay so if
you are following these two techniques
along with your deff command you are
actually doing test development
development but BDD is different right
so we are discussing here the test their
wonderful men approach write unit tests
and integration tests indication desks
you can say a can be a functional can be
ignition so if you are following these
two standards this is the best practice
to avoid birch okay after you write your
test cases there must be some peer
review peer review is worth peer review
is when you are writing your test cases
it's nothing but the code right you are
writing some codes but once you are
right your codes thus there should be
some senior guy who should review your
test cases so that no scenario having
missed by you right no one is perfect it
is very obvious it may be possible that
you guys to someone of you may be the
lead or your senior can miss some
scenarios but if there is a peer review
for a code the case of missing some
scenarios introduced right this is
called peer review now try to automate
okay involve your testers as early as
you can so if this testing is earlier
then what will happen the impact on
resolving those issue is very less if
tester founder Berg was the product is
developed already reason the resolving
then it will take a lot more time could
resolve those website you you guys may
already know those concepts get
try to automate try to automate your
test cases for any complex platform why
this automation comes in this picture
because for now now we are actually
there is very time constraint for
testing whenever we are writing our test
is manually and employ want to execute
our discussing manually it is very
time-consuming process so here is
another option to execute or write test
cases which is not required for any
human being to turn right to execute
here Automation comes in the picture so
before that by the glyphs testing is
mandatory we already know my testing is
mandatory to point out defects that may
cause million-dollar laws to ensure what
we create does what it's supposed to
that means that it should behave as
expected to ensure the delivery of the
best product and experience to ensure
that something works on very every
intended machine means if you're if you
are developing a particular application
which is intended to learn Oh on windows
and unix and linux on it should run on
each and every machine equally okay what
we saying is the session of basic of
testing actually the session of both
testing as well as automation so once I
convert this testing I'm coming to the
automation because we expecting both
freshers and experienced ok market ok to
ensure something works on very intended
machine to have effective performance or
software application of product to stay
in the business you are I I assume that
you guys already know this concept so
I'm quickly moving to another slide for
software testing based for difference of
protesting the different ways are manual
testing plus automated then we can
create our software testing field right
but it is not possible to automate your
application 100% then they must we will
find a strategy how much percentage of
horribly action should be manually
tested and how much of a percentage
should be
media test it right let's move forward
he played manual vs auto commission
testing ok before going forward what's
the difference between Daniel and
automation testing I am actually I am
getting a feeling that you guys already
know this concept so I'm quickly jumping
to the point of how selenium will book
how selenium how can selenium affect
automation testing right so for this for
this let me ask you you guys a question
first the question is if I compare what
are different parts of manual testing
versus automation testing I want you
guys to drive down what are different
steps when you start applic testing an
application let's suppose you have
application called X you need to test
this but our different step which you
should follow to application this step
starting from very beginning in second
then next and then next so any any
answer for this question but step you
guys follow navigate to X requirement
gathering gemenese saying first step is
your comment gathering that's correct
one chasing analyze the requirement
that's correct by showing saying
functional testing not function testing
prob a test cases I mean it's correct so
as I mean the force is requirement
gathering okay then prepare test cases
okay okay and the third one is design
test is already there third one once is
saying review fourth is execute after
preparing test cases there is okay let
me write execution I think ocean is the
third step and environments a tabloid
saying yep it's a prerequisite and after
execution then report the burgh okay
let's cover that reporting bug in this
part execution and birds report here
but I am actually is a medication
thankfully the fourth process is very
important step is to reporting because
without reporting as anything retesting
yes without rebooting you can't ensure
you can't say your stakeholders there a
vesting is completed and is this bill
has is is it is the bill is ready to go
for the lease or not but before that
there is another process there is
another step as well which is prepared
test data during during committing the
test cases there is also prepare test
data test data can be your inside can be
your txt file can be inside CSV can be
inside axle can win that XML can be
inside data base again you can take your
test it from anyone of this annulment
right ok this is the manual testing
process this process we already know and
let me come to automation and we will
find how to convert this man were
processed into automation Here I am
taking the example of selenium only okay
and and the language which i'm going to
use with the selenium is java okay so
can we automate requirement the earthing
process is it possible is it possible to
automate the government gathering I know
it is a silicon but still it's not
possible you can't how can you automate
a requirement gathering so for if you
are automating something then you should
first the very first tab yep thanks
chitin it's the very first step is to
recommend gather again right if if if
you are not manually testing a
particular application if you directly
started with the automation and very
first step is to gather the requirement
to understand the requirement to have a
grip over the different requirements
without having live over the
requirements it's very hard to test the
software either by Manuel Arroyo mission
right okay second step prepared test
cases so
is selenium can be used to prepare test
case i have a quick answer from anyone
of you chitin is saying no sell em
cannot be used any other answer can we
use selenium to prepare test cases
though it is asking a question when POC
conspiracy is different when Lex suppose
you are actually saying a you got an
applique you got a particular project
from a client and the client is not sure
that you guys are able to deliver the
quality or node then what will happen
you prepare up you see and deliver the
same you see to the client then it's
nothing but the sample so it's a
different things POC is just 4get or
capture the project okay wait so Devin
is saying are you able to get my answer
sir I have to yep yep zaman I am getting
your answer thank you for that but a bit
because after you answer there will be
there are actually a lot more answers so
I'm sometimes I skip one of you answer
sorry for that ok so I asked the
question Devin is saying yes we can
prepare test cases any other answer guys
can we prepare test cases by using
selenium tool I got to answer what is no
from chicken and one is yes publication
is saying no we can't prepare test cases
by using selenium right because we I
have not introduced its ok but ever
answer you provide it's okay but I just
want to know what you know previously
about the selenium right so the answer
is no we can't create test cases by
using selenium so it leads me another
question but is selling by the way but
you guys think but is selenium and what
is more important question is what is
done by the selenium can hi yes I mean I
will provide you a justification because
I'm just a bit of that query I'm not
completed yet so before that I got
another i got i actually have another
question what is selenium if you if
someone say the answer of selenium then
your query mean you're automatically
answered though because selenium we are
getting automation scripts okay which is
ultimately test cases okay then you
saying function testing on web
application okay exclusive for the
publication vamsi's say any other word
is done by okay let me rephrase my
question and this time what is done by
selenium gem leasing selenium is process
okay know anything it's a Fame accused
to automation automate an application
okay we never had some hot room the Holy
saying testing framework for web
application it's not a framework loud we
need to agree on the framework so what
is done by selenium what is actually
done by selenium try to answer try to
give the answer I'm not expecting
correct so mitigation is saying
web-based functional testing okay okay
okay okay guys I always intend on the
word we used because if you use simpler
words it will retain in our minds for
the long term right if I give the answer
of the selenium silly name is thus an
API as just a core it's not a dude but
it's true it's used for functional
testing but it's not a tool it's a
simple API I mean I will cover but say
by later but what is then why selenium
selenium is just used to browse or to
drive your browser selenium can only
drive your browser but I mean by driving
the browser by dive rouser I mean that
let's suppose move on to write a test
case for google let's suppose you want
to go for google and search for a Eureka
and then you click over the annual a cup
upside so if I but different steps I
followed I open the browser right but
follow I what I have followed for
manually I open the browser I open
google com I tagged over a field called
a Judaica and then finally I have
clicked over the ellicott like our link
right
if I want to do the same process
automatically I need a particular API or
two which should do these thing
automatically but this is not testing if
I open at Eureka is my test case
completed nope this opening is not
testing right you should have a
particular point where you should find
difference between the lab respected or
actual right let's suppose I want to see
this this button is appearing or not
this is my end point of this test case
sign up button is appearing so to reach
to this point I need to follow all those
types open the browser to click over
this thing links and then go to that
Eureka and then assert their sign up is
here or not right so the main
functionality of your selenium is
nothing but to drive the browser this is
the main functionality you're just
driving your browser by using saline you
are not doing testing by selenium you
are going to the point of interest which
is called pui so you are actually going
bitch point want to test my ring
selenium but this is not the entire
automation that's why selenium cannot
create test cases change nathan is
saying not pure image point of interest
eoi also it's a different impaired you
as well point of interest in urging
gentlemen don't be confused with
different view let me let me erase this
work ok it's just a point of interest a
point of where you want to take create
the test Madhvi saying this can be done
by automation tool yep this can be done
by any automation tool you can drive
your browser by using any automation
tool it doesn't mean that you are
automating something for automation we
need to follow all these four steps
right so if I'm saying I'm doing
automation testing by using selenium the
very first step is still requirement
gathering then prepare test cases test
case is not prepared by using selenium
prepare it has been prepared by using j
unit or test angie is another api's
java-based any eyes which
which are used to write test cases these
tools it could be be a medication if you
do me to drive rouser yep actually QT we
have a lot more different options it's a
paid tool and heavily paid tune it have
lot more options apart from driving
browser okay so QT b is also QT b is not
only driving the browser it have depend
in bed functionality which is used which
is used to write test cases and other
stuff transfer working only so a second
step is to prepare test cases we can
prepare the test case is not prepared by
selenium it's it is actually prepared by
j unit or test and jeep api ok third
step or not to point first step which is
preparing test data that for peeping the
density will need to use different other
API as well like for preparing test data
from text file we have Java in journal
library for CSV as well if you want to
prepare your test data from text or csv
you have the internal library for
preparing your text of our test data
from excel you have to use apache p oi
APA APA or ghl actually something like
this okay but are together requirement
phone is saying but we gather the
government's in order machine weh-weh
simply gather requirements same as a
manual testing but in here we are not
writing test cases these steps are
different but the common gathering for
both manual and automation is same yeah
so jxl and if you want to prepare your
test data from maximal you have Java XML
API for if you want to prepare your test
kit just data from database you have
what jdbc write these different api's
its combined with j unit to create the
test data
but still your selenium is doesn't came
into the picture yet okay now the third
step is execution here we use selenium
we combine selenium API with above to
execute test cases test ng is another
API which is used to create test cases
it is test next generation similar to
listen unit so we write test cases I
Brown j unit or test ng then we use
different this tool to kill to get the
taste the test data and once we have the
test data we provide test data into the
script okay selenium script once your
execution is completed by using selenium
finally you create reports by using
report and see are you use xslt reports
finally these reports can be mailed to
your project stakeholder and the missing
thanks I got my answer that we cannot
keep test cases through selenium thanks
Thank You Simon so then we combine these
things reports reports is generated in
the wind send these reports with our
project stakeholders right and then if
we combine all these tools and api's we
are actually creating a framework this
is called framework so what a framework
provides thermal provides a simple
platform to create or write the test
cases okay this is actually different
between your manual testing part and
your automation testing but if you are
doing these things you are actually
doing the automation stuff more locution
is saying give me example of excels LT
reports if you I provide you example of
xslt reports xslt reports is look like
this this kind of thing a pie chart
chaput kind of thing this is very
simpler and very impressive reports if
generated by exercising api ok mole
equation ok guys so this is the way of
creating this is
the way of automation testing if you are
using any automation dual apart from
selenium or any cute any other tool like
qtp you or rain or X or any other tool
if the tool is not providing all these
things then either you need to use other
tools which needs to combine with the a
tool or you need to ask for the
different support because the tool can
be a paid or can be open source okay the
selenium is an open source tool
releasing I am just in the confluence
again and third step as during scripting
we use selenium library to create driver
and object so selenium also come into
picture insects came in second step is
actually we haven't used selenium here
yeah that's true we can use combine this
selenium in the second as well because
when we prepare the test cases we call
selenium epi as well that's why it's
combined thing right also this if you
say same thing then we can combine
reporting as well all this work together
it's not different steps if you are
writing a particular test case in a
single test case we need to use all
these things this in all practical test
steps okay what is the parameter ization
using example equation is saying what is
the ROI okay thanks right oh but
motivation is asking what is the
parameterization using XML and data
provider in selenium see selenium
doesn't provide param transition
parameterization is provided by j unit
or test ng in which parameterization we
but we do we repeat or execute the same
test case for any number of parameters
for example i want to login in gmail by
using thousand different email ids and
passwords i have to option first option
i write thousand different disguises
which is not possible and the second
option is parameterization i write email
ids or password in an axial separate
eczema direction and then i call let
example sheet during execution and what
testing g of j unit will do it we'll
call each line it will execute your test
case for each and every user name and
password that's called parameterization
okay and for using those the username
and password will use selenium so all
these stem works together this is called
framework and a framework can be
data-driven your framework approach can
be data-driven can be key were driven
and can be ivy okay but nowadays the
actual framework which is country using
why you with selenium is page object
morning palm framework okay this is
called form so we covers all those
frameworks in our course recover cedar
driven key were driven hybrid as well as
form nero is saying hello hello need oh
but if i text context medication is
saying I test context is actually a
interface inside the test ng hold
equation and it's addie kind of concepts
we will cover it later because you know
one hour but no it's very hard to cover
this kind of deep concepts okay I'll
cover it later the other thing I wanted
to ask whether they you know testing g
will be easy to use both are exactly
need of almost same and you need to stay
for a particular tool for particular API
it's not funny so be there another is
inferior of j notes very old and most of
the developers rely on the j unit but
but someone is saying that ah but if you
start working on the test engine like it
provides some more annotation as because
it actually provides more features as
compared to the ginge minute publication
is saying i want the session as video
yes you will get this session as a video
ok and you will get each and every
session whatever in the class has a
video a Pankaj is saying do we have any
mechanism for recording our test in
selenium because that time client bought
the test proof ok this can be done
perfecto mobile for test recording and
mobile device so a punkish actually
recording our test is not possible in
selenium but we can record as a proof we
can record or we can capture screen shot
as a proof selenium provide a very
important method very simple
method to capture is getting short for
each and every test case so that can be
provided as a proof okay hey guys so I
need to cover that DVD as well because
it's my duty to cover this Peabody 3
given by a Eureka so we we already know
the difference between manual and versus
automation and anyone can for better
Griffin a pros and cons for manual and
automation anyone can test my manual
exists ways to improve the quality yeah
which you see a great for people who may
not have formal testing experience
that's what the question was some
someone have asked where the minimum
requirement no recon for manual texting
focused on your customers workflow
because we always focus on the customer
part customer requirements automated
testing fostered the cycles able to
identify more defense in shorter time
frame save company's money after third
time after third time the desk a
thousand easy on focus on always wear
work clothes high quality product over
manual to summarize these things there
are some pros for manual testing and
there are some pros for automated
testing as well but it doesn't means
automation testing can replace mad well
it's always we always create how much
presentation how many percentage of
application can be automated and how
much percentage of application can be
mentally tested okay neither was saying
when you emailing the link for of videos
yes that's for sure at the records of
what will email you the link for this
email okay for this video as well okay
as well as this ppt as well ok guys so
second is which test to automate and
which is not this is very important we
cannot automate everything for their
most recent criteria which part of the
application much must be tested and
which application must not be tested
automatically the test cases can be
automated which have the following
criteria but are different that is high
risky business critical test case in
this justice it must be repeat for each
and every time whenever you change your
API so the highest scenario must be
automated test case are executed
repeatedly at sk
which are repeating again and again for
each and every iteration so for that
time we require the test cases must be
automated to save the time span ok test
cases that are very Terriers are
difficult to perform manual you arian
may means a test case which are very
which takes a lot more step to execute
ok for that type of scenario it should
be automated test case which are time
resume again if those which are
consuming a lot more time should be
automated the flow in category of test
case should not suitable for automation
or emission test cases which are newly
designed and not executed manually at
least once so whenever you design a test
case you should manually test at once so
that we get the overall picture what's
the expected behavior test cases for
which the government's are changing
frequency let's suppose you have written
script it for a particular test case and
up an hour in the in the evening and one
in the requirement have been changed and
then you need to change your script
again right for those kind of test cases
for those kind of snails which are
changing for country we should not go
for automation which would go for men
were testing yep test cases which are
executed on ad-hoc basis isn't any
particular neither we sing particular
framework to work on selenium yes there
are a lot more frameworks to work on
selenium you need to create your own
framework but the model of the framework
can be data driven key were driven
hybrid or page of that model these are
the models here we come add salient
features of selenium first one it's open
source so but you guys mean um about
opens already open source software what
do you mean by open source software can
I have some questions some some answers
on what do you think what are open
source open source means free need of a
saint ask affect any other answer guys
publication is saying free which freely
available till pre I same freely
available okay Malika's anything API
problem is saying no need to buy the
software doubt is saying that
for nonprofit okay doubt free and
customizable it is saying free and
customizable okay source code is
available for free dest answer i am
looking forward when i say open source
it doesn't means a software is only free
see if i say a software is free it's not
necessary that software is open source
open source and freeze operator two
different things if a software is open
source it means that for the source code
for that software is open and you can
change the source code you can download
the source code you can view the source
code and you can change the source code
but if a software it's free and it's not
open sold it means you don't have
privilege and only you do not have
creatures who change the source code the
company where produced is still have the
authority to change that software write
it so if in the next any time if you see
the open-source it means the source code
is free and also can be customized well
as per your need okay fungus saying open
software this open resources code used
to create the program freely available
to the public view edit and is 23
distributor ponga just that your answer
is not copy from internet stead true
okay that's a joke okay so whenever you
see open source software it means the
source code is open okay so selenium is
open source and also free at no extra
cost for finding bugs if you go for
other tools like you TB and Renault Rex
they are very highly pigs of nice and
soft you need to pay five or seven lakh
for one year of license right so that
God there is no extra cost for using the
selenium lightweight it's less than
hundred mb so you can download and can
learn on any machine but if you start
with compared with the qtp it's more
than one gb software qtp and need a
liquid machine to run that ok when I
saying will difference between qtp RFP
which is
it's a lot more difference pankaj qdb
rft selenium qtb araphi can automate
your desktop application as well but the
selenium cannot automate and in desktop
application it's for them only is the
major difference okay apart from there
is more lot more difference in these
softwares okay selenium supports
believable language like if you don't
know Java you know see shop you can work
on the selenium you know python you can
work off on the selenium window / you
can work on the selenium right it
supports a lot more browsers it's a
ghost chrome by the Mozilla Firefox ie
Safari Android as well so any all major
browsers are supported by selenium
always supported supports all midgets 00
s like linux windows iOS so if you are
writing your script on window it should
be then on linux on Mac as well yep
neither it supports mac easy bug
reporting white ecosystem support
develops get burnt sun on the same of
the middle blauser handling special
handling of Ajax control their exact
sentiment are different saleem provide
special handling of the friend is
control as well parallel script
execution by this way you can execute
your script by learning right means you
don't have to create you don't need to
run your all script sequentially you can
run same script on multiple browser on
the same machine in the same time this
is called parallel execution ecosystem
means different language + 0 s +
environment plus your browser or this
all combined to provide ecosystem ok
it's about vehicle system palace cream
use mozy chatting mullet headings
different need of mullet heading means
you are doing the same thing vallely
that's correct but here the parallel
means you want to run your script on
Mozilla on your Firefox on all those
different browser average environment
this called perilous crippling okay yes
but it's true it's requirement reading
ok guys so here selenium silent
real event in the browser whatever we
use with the selenium with a real even
like mouse click button click whatever
we do manually we can do by using
selenium drives a specific set of
commands and check status drive specific
set of commands it means we can call it
specific set of methods and check status
to see if the user is logged in if the
book goes into the shopping cart this
kind of status we can check the board
with the number of assertions we have an
ascension sui means a kind of method
with check which is the difference which
check actually difference between the
actual and the reference expected sorry
wherever will take out a report which
with the number of assertions than one
passing and failing and where the error
occurs automate your action in a web
browser automate your action web browser
same as the automated script that you
can replay at a later time you can save
your scrip and ganzen and any machine
any environment okay so this is about
selenium this is about how we can use
and how a multi-million dollar birds can
be introduced in your machine it can be
introduced in your application and what
a different way to avoid those kind of
works and how selenium we can use
selenium and what is actually over all
way of using that selenium okay i just
want to show you a very practical
example to how to use and download and
use selenium of bits selenium scripts in
value by your machine so if you want to
learn anything about selenium then you
should go for this website which is
called selenium HQ dot o RG which is
nothing but actual official website of
selenium just go to download and click
on this download but then you will
download the selenium ACI once you
download a silly name api it should go
for your eclipse which was a file new if
we don't know these at leaves on all
those things then no worries we have
some java basic concepts for starting
the course right go to the your java
project create
project i am creating gamble okay and
now I I need to include the API which
have I ordered it downloaded so right
click on your project go to the build
path and configure build path and select
the files which you want to which you
have already downloaded i have
downloaded my file at selenium this one
and then go to this folder and download
these jar files download libraries as
well once you include those files in
your project then you're good to go you
can use this tool okay then create a
class let me create this is my test
class my demo classf let's suppose and
in order to execute a particular
statement i am using main method I'm not
creating the test case and i want to
show you that how can i open a browser
and fill it something over the browser
okay it's lame 2.47 a dessert 2.47 point
something is the latest 2.4 7.1 is the
latest this is the latest one okay okay
so how to open a particular browser open
browser how to open this you need to
instantiate webdriver you need to
instantiate firefox driver I want to
open the Firefox so i am writing new
fire fox driver let me relax if you
don't know these things it is just for
demo is not the technical part okay i
mean i have imported it will open the
browser so what will happen if i run
this script i'll only i'm running this
script what will happen it will open my
firefox browser there is browser it will
take some time to put depending on a
machine see our all set have been open
but i haven't opened any URL so my next
step is to organizing when we start with
selenium is necessity to have a def
knowledge of java only the basic only
basic is required nero you don't have to
be grew java guru for
King on the selenium it's very easy only
if you know only the second serve then
it's good enough for selenium okay so
this is about opening the browser and
now I'm open I'm opening website so for
opening the website we have mattered
drieborg get here i am passing and the
complete URL of website ok ww.com I'm
opening the facebook website ok so what
will happen if I learn this come on I'm
running this command it will open the
browser and it will open this website
see how is it is and now the script
stopped ok third step is to I want to
provide user name and password so
provide user name it's a comment so for
providing username I need entity and I
need but I need I need a bath of tact
fee so for this we have this kind of 2
i'll explain this later just just see
but i am doing i knew i want to write
first name for this I have sorry I want
to write this username email I have ID
email I'm coughing this and I am driver
dot fine and meant by IT I'm coughing ID
and I am sending my user name and the
date live.com any demi demi ID ok this
will provide this will put this name
whatever I pass here to the field ok let
me show you this this line will open the
browser is lying to open the facebook is
a line well the statement will write
this string into the field ok let me
show you what will happen Roger open
facebook have been open and now have
written my username added live.com over
the desired field so whatever the steps
we are doing manually is actually we are
writing in the form of codes so it's not
very much d figure its way that is
building okay similarly I want to
provide password as well okay so for
this I first I need to identify of this
password field it is nothing but the
pass so driver dot find element x dot ID
and here it is bus okay now i am sending
this thing sendkeys as my password this
is demi passwords and using them now
after this I want to click over the
login button and it will show you're not
in ticket or something kind of
application and this is the ID is is
your login button okay so provide
password and click on login button so
driver dot find element by ID and here
is your this is the or login button and
I want to click over that okay for this
we have method click simple or a
question when I tried to same code i got
the firefox has stopped working may I
know why the code is that Lee as yours
it may be possible that your Firefox
version is maybe was it can be a
multiple reason it may watchfully a
perfect Firefox version is older right
or you have not downloaded the right jar
for selenium jar file okay upon this is
saying our framework development
background working in vb and i am
planning to move to the test automation
what is the good option for me cuticular
selenium to be honest I've seen what is
the trend in the current industry that
the companies at least all mid-level
companies and small level companies are
migration migrating from the queue
typical selenium because they don't have
to provide they don't have to provide my
sense for the two right so what is my
advice that if you already know the QT
be and if you learn selenium then you
have both options so you can switch any
time if the company company doesn't
always stick to a particular tool if
there is the option for the 2tb you can
you can go for qtp if you have option
for the selenium even go for a selenium
so you will be a set for your company so
if you have both to both the option then
you should go for
both because that the industry is
changing if you go for the new header
come you will see a lot more job
opportunities for selenium and there is
less the opportunities for Cutie beam
this shows the trend of moving right hi
guys so let me run this script and it
will show you it will open the browser
it will open the facebook click provide
a username and password and click on the
login button let me show you what will
happen one side in the script facebook
is open username and password it's
printed and it have clicked over login
button is showing your priestly enter
your password wits mismatched ok so if
you see this how it's easy to automate a
particular application right just know
what step you need to follow which is
nothing but the requirement gathering if
your ID or if you know your manual desk
as well then you can automate very
easily can you please rise kit for mouse
over actions yes we can do which is done
by action class theory but i think this
is very little bit high more concepts we
should not be provided on this demo
session i'll provide you later on
because we are covering all these
concepts d concerts but before that you
should learn a lot more thing something
about java something about object
orientation concepts and mouse hoping
and these witting things can be covered
later ok this week they'll be saying if
we are working on agile methodology can
we have can we start writing making
outer sketches at which stage of testing
either p you are working on this
methodology then automation is must
because in all the agile automation is
always needed they just leasing ok thank
you the spirit is my F is lot more mouse
holding yep mouse hole being absent I
auction is very easy but it's a bit
little more of advanced concept which I
don't want to confuse guys at the very
first class okay okay guys so this is
about introduction of
selenium and automation okay so we
already extended 15 minutes so this
other five or ten minutes for queries
okay I got more queries how to avoid
flickering while selecting links while
using selenium what do you mean my
pickling route and the query pankaj
interview generally it is asked that but
or challenge you face while using
selenium and how to found a solution for
the same this is actually a practical
example this is actually they want to
test you that you have actually worked
on your application or not you are you
are just saying that you know the
selenium and you haven't work I actually
I was in the recruiter team recruitment
team for more than three years this is
our revolutions because by this question
I can we can analyze it the person have
were clearly worked out the application
or not so for this but that answer for
this question you have to work on one
application and during the work
definitely you will find lot more
challenges once you resolve that
challenges then you are ready for this
question okay a 32 slide is not
completed ok ok ok here is it is slides
are let me complete all slides can we
avoid but completely can we eliminate
every chance is million dogs a
million-dollar bug by following
respective no one is perfect no matter
what we do we are going to produce code
that has works in it from time to time
it's not possible to remove hundred
percent bugs from your application
that's true but still we will try to
eliminate as much as we can ok if
hundred budget is not visible ninety
percent is visible and if I personally
feasible depending on how complex your
application is ok after this we have
hands-on I have already shown you
hands-on experience over that how to
open the browser how to go to different
elements how to clip over the element
it's a simple very simple introduction
right and then we are on the question
right this is 38 slide and then after
this there will be a survey once you
goes this webinar there will be served
way please provide your feedback how you
require how you require this how you
like the instructor or the content how
explain you
please please provide a survey as well
and this is the end of the slide so it's
still the question time which language
will be better for the selenium to be
honest Java is better why is better
because selenium is itself written in
Java in the codes and whites and so if
you know the Java and whenever they
release a new version Java you can use
AdWords it in mich Italy right so my
opean java is much better than C sharp
or Python but still if you know the
Python you don't need to first and earn
the entire Java can ship and then switch
back but still you just need very little
concept if you know the Python you I
don't think you require a lot more a
time to learn java okay so need of me
saying when will be your next seminar
webinar near for this you need to
contact to a new record support they
will arrange next webinar and notify you
okay munication is saying is excellent
but our time is less debts collect money
because it's just a demo session and I
still feel the same because I covered a
lot more theory and thank you theories
boring we need to cover not more
practical and I'll suggest the same
thing to generator support they are we
saying which framework is best for
bigner the is not big name because in
practically working the company will
provide you framework you are not going
to write your own because the framework
is a very important part so whatever
payment they provide you have to work
over there so this is not good or better
options oh but on the lehman language
framework which is better is palm okay
lemon is saying thank you so much
session very useful Thank You Lavinia
and lavanya and punker is saying what is
the necessary in selenium with Python
she shops a neum in SE train a train is
selenium with C sharp and java python is
easy that's correct python is easy for
java but once you learn the java you
have a lot more opportunities open along
with selenium waiting more webinars in
the selenium thanks livonia xiamen is
saying how can we need to start with the
selenium webdriver I
d how we need to getting start with a
selenium from web browser ID we should
start with the webdriver IDE useless to
be honest munication is saying is in
essence need to know all selenium
webdriver away I know it's not necessary
you start with some very basic internet
continuously increase your knowledge
it's all above it's all depends on how
much practice you are doing Jamie but is
the best practice best practice is to
webdriver here we sing it's really
helpful thanks need of measuring saying
thank you have full and neither wishing
this this will be paid training or free
training throughout or and it will cover
advanced concept needle actually it's a
page saying that web when a demo session
is actually free but it's a page
training a charge you can go through the
at you reckon you can find the charge
yeah the difference between web Devon ID
