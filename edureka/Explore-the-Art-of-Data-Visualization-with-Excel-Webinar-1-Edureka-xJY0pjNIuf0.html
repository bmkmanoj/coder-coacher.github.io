it's a very simple keyboard the
straightforward keyboard shortcut
control page down will always give you
the immediate next worksheet on the
right side and control it up will give
you the immediate left worksheet right

so somebody here you will have the
option of change chart type if you are
using excel microsoft office 2007 or 10

Priscilla perfect great thank you okay
uh also friends now that we are
discussing a little bit about dragging
okay I also would like to highlight you
know that it's not always that you will
start with Lee or gin for example the
financial year begins with april i can
write april first then i can crack it
still works right up in countries like
Qatar and UAE the Gulf countries the
first day of the working week the sunday
because they have a Friday Saturday
details so you can always begin with
Sunday and then cried and you still get
what you want ok of course if you want
you can always remove duplicates okay
all right now friends let's come back to
this data which is up here in the bay
first worksheet I hope you can see this
data I have this weekly dinner now to
prepare a chart in the in another
worksheet we just discussed above the
shortcut which is f11 okay open and then
sane hung up sorry Ivan and then I
didn't get your question what do you
mean by hung up okay other than then you
can type your question in the meanwhile
let's continue alright so friends now

cursor anywhere within the data okay and
then press alt function one or and f1
okay last time we simply press the
function eleventy the top of the
keyboard this time is alt + f1 and tht
one happening in your screen right now
the graph is now in your same worksheet
and do you do you all remember that I
had gone to that change to chart type
come on and had to set the default as
the bar the bar graph the bar chart and
that's why this time when I press the
keyboard shortcut I am getting the bar
graph you give me for instance yes you
can decide which type of a chart is your
frequent requirement and you can set
that as T for T bread just in case you
are using the Excel 2007 or we Excel
2010 version I would like to highlight
here they'd have to click on the
boundary of the graph I mean cheating on
the modhri of the graph is the same for
all versions so click on the boundary of
the graph and for XL seven and then uses
in the design tab you have to go to the
extreme left hand side but it says
change chart type and then you will get
a dialog box that says change chart type
there you can just see set as default
which is a bottom given there right
there at the bottom of the window yeah
but for the 13 version like I'm showing
you right now on the scaling for the
Excel through the inversion you can
google change chart type like the way
I'm doing right now ok select the kind
of chart that you love this prefer and

since you joined in late I just want to
say that function 11 is the shortcut
forward creating a graph in the next
worksheet functionally the chopper on
the keyboard also in Windows magis for
the Macintosh in some more windows
computers also you might want to press
the function key along with the f11 key
not always will you always press the f11
key some laptops some desktops depends
on the keyboard layout manufacturer of
the laptop and stuff like this function
and the f11 key right ok now friends

Delete key on the keyboard and it's gone
right also French keeping your cursor in

remember design tab is the lifeline of
your charge ok so let's click on the
boundary let's again where the design
tab and they're just next to your change
chart type for Excel 13 you have an
option that is its next to it it is it
says select nigga we can add or remove
columns from that which we will see in
some time and also you have switched
rule / just to gauge it up for those
draft you can now see that the various
amounts are plotted on the y axis and
the Monday Tuesday Wednesday the base of
the week is on the x axis horizontal
axis if i click on switch draw and
follows you will notice that the graph
changes yeah so i can always do that but
for this kind of cord attached always
boo knots always good to keep monday
tuesday wednesday on the x axis and data
the numeric portion on the y-axis all
right also friends x 10 collector that
you can always go to design plan
and there's an option here that says
move chart if you like to move your
charge to another location in the new
sheet to you can see doesn't the small
dialog box that opens up this move
jumped okay so it is choosing one scoop
this is a very simple step forward
things too will not discuss in details
right okay are also friends now talking
about the Excel 2013 sorry 10-7 okay
again you will select the boundary of
the graph and the design there you have
the option of switch room and column
again on the left side of your screen
just where you have the change chart
lonely preferences you know commands
like change chart i switch row and
column select beta all these are given
to you on the left hand side in your ex
n 2007-10 but in Exeter teen those are
given to you of the right side okay but
they are all in the design tab in all
the versions of Excel okay I'll be okay
so far from its can I moon okay what we
discussed so far is just you know simple
in the stuff obviously we are not going
into the depth of everything here in
this webinar but yes we will we'll get
something else now right okay so he has
a question here let me take a look at
the questions window okay so for I have
some acknowledgments saying thank you
and all but yes budget theory has a
question you said alt + function plus f1
forge okay result the once again now
let's have a quick recap of the who
shortcuts here really quick f11 the top
row on the keyboard stand alone shortcut
is for creating a chart in next
worksheet okay a new worksheet basically
when the same file okay and if you would
like to get the graph of the chart in
the same Excel spreadsheet then it's fun
alt f1 okay it's all decks one yeah but
but rogers first some laptops you you
might have to press the function key
which is on the lower left of your
keyboard along with the f1 key to enable
that function okay so
they're all depends on the keyboard
layout all right okay friends let's take
a look at let's take a look at the you
know waterfall chart um so I will let's
navigate to the next worksheet so
controlled by h town already Archer
hotel and how sorry if I'm not
pronouncing your name correctly Cheryl
oh no it is not a necessity that the
function key has to be used only in
windows 8 i've got a couple of laptops
we're even all now windows 7 you will
have to press the function key to enable
the functionality of the top of the
keyboard so the top of the keyboard is
like a like a double rule yes it's not
necessarily on functionally of &amp;amp; boos
gate okay uh all right waterfall chart
okay now let me just loopy about why you
would like to prepare a waterfall chart
okay now like the name suggests let's go
show you data as if there's a flow of
water from the source okay please don't
go boom this is not the exact meaning of
the waterfall chart but the water filled
shaft is a form of data visualization
that helps in determining the cumulative
effect of sequentially appearing
positive or negative values so for
example like a bank statement and you
open up your bank statement you have
some beverage of some credit yeah that
could be a good example of a waterfall
chart okay so let's see how do we
prepare that okay now the first thing
that I will be here is of course this is
the rate of just be given to me right
let's take an example I conducted a
training program okay a classroom
training program which involves
projector and one of those two sticks so
I I i earned $25,000 Ortega rupees
okay I have something over London I'm
not sure I given them is trying to say
something but I'm not able to make out
what is trying to save her okay all
right uh I've been under it would be
great if you have questions you might
want to simply just maybe make it more
simple than cycler question please right
okay coming back now I did a training
program I earned amount of 25,000 rupees
of a real survivor and I realized that i
had spent four thousand on advertising
then I realized 3,000 was spent on the
purchase of projector or something then
I have to give out payments to be IT
guys and the house keeping guys that so
I i only got fifteen thousand five
hundred as my net income okay of this
information i would like to display in
an hour in a chart right so the first
thing is if i simply press alt f1 bill
like the way we discussed ok it is just
showing me these words and it's not
really giving the correct figure because
anyone might say that ok my income was
Trey 5,000 plus i had got some more
payments of 4000 once i have some worked
it so it looks like i have all these
amounts coming up in my bank account
that is not the case like I discussed
the scenario mejores I spent the money
on now advertising purchase and payments
and commissions to other people so my
net profit was the income thing that I
see that so this is not what because
this chart is not showing the real
picture of the data right so let's need
the lake this okay of course before I
forget let me come to this change chart
type I always would like to keep it the
columns why Vince a cluster alone
right click and celesta folge all right
okay so right ok ok so just Joe okay if
you wanted to delete the chart you just
need to click on the boundaries of the
and till you clean the people simple set
right great now just next to my amount
column I will
another column that says in the sequel
right and then I will add another column
that says versatile okay so please
remember please keep in mind that these
two columns are just my helping columns
they are not really a part of my data
but for me to be able to prepare the
waterfall chart I am going to take
assistance from these two columns like
in cricket sometimes a batsman has to
take assistance from runner okay so he's
not really going those runs okay but is
this helping okay now for the visible
column okay i will say me just just
select the intelligible column okay and
i will copy down all the values in my
amount column to my physical call okay a
lot of I'm sure everybody knows you know
that i can simply just keep my cursor in
the very first cell of the visible
column navigate towards the left side
and then press enter okay and i can
always drag it down with my mouse again
i cannot base to that I'm sure of your
Mobile's but another way of doing this
would be select the column first again
so my visible columnist from the T to
sell to the d6 cell equal at you okay
and then i navigate towards my left ok
so to the amount column okay and this
time i'm sure we all know that most of
us would now like to say that okay I'm
rich now you can press enter correct but
this time because i have already
selected the entire column okay from
from Jeju 2d6 this time i will not press
enter i will press control enter and
check out guys you see ya so ctrl h oh
ok now all right okay yes thank you very
states yeah all right now thank you for
the acknowledgments okay great now the
invisible column I will start off with
us 0k and drag it here i will put a sum
formula some should be almost some
formula this is not new at all so I just
copy the formula so the meaning of this
invisible column now is I did get a beam
of 25,000 jerk in my bank account but
then actually when I realized that 4,000
was spent on advertising my my profit
was just a 1000 then after some time
when I realized that oh ok well there
was a 3000 among the spend on the
purchase of some equipments I then come
down to 18,000 ok then I fold it
realized there was another 2500 spent so
now my final taken in chemist 15,500
that's a that's the meaning of my
invisible complicated ok now like we
discussed already I will keep my cursor
in any one cell of my choice ok ok
Cheryl I will repeat the invisible
column concept here ok the reason I have
made that invisible column I mean you
can just name it editing ok I mean you
can say a and B over ok so the reason i
mailed that see column is you can just
see her in the in the cell which
contains 21,000 ok i will press f2 I
hope you all know that function to f2
key on the keyboard top of the keyboard
is to go to the editing move so it shows
the formula for the value of the text
whatever alright so address after your
it says some of c4 and d44 so I'm just
adding mom the data which is given to be
right here in the next room yeah I am
just copying this formula through my
invisible column yeah the whole idea of
this invisible problem is to know my
spendings step by step Heyman's Pandey
has a question how can I listen to what
is being said oh ok well even though
that's I mean oh you will have to maybe
check your is your is your leg up on the
more about me the others are able to
hear me so I'm sorry I will not be able
to answer that question maybe something
to do with your laptop okay all right
now I will simply select any one cell of
my choice here ok and i will press the
corner
and f1 key I will notice that I am able
to see the chart but because the default
setting was for the for the solemn march
on I am now getting the column chart ok
now go here and i will say change chart
type right now within the change chart
type i will now select the option that
says stacked column remember every type
of column every type of poem om de Kuff
cart has various sub-options so for the
column thing right now i'm going with
stacked cost right so I San extract
column and I say okay from you so I now
see that job you know my nigga mike
minor office role in the waves you can
see right now right also friends I will
know i will be in select on the boundary
of the chart i will go to select data
which is on top in the design tab ok and
i will go here now the amount column is
something that I don't want right now
because the amount column is just my raw
data ok but my whole intention here is
to make a chart of what of our chart
which will show you the you know oops a
cumulative effect of sequentially added
positive and negative values correct so
I will not really be interested in that
small problems because that is just my
team's data ok but it is the other two
columns which are going to help me to
prepare my or fall short so i will just
remove the amount column from here okay
i hope all of you can see that there's a
smaller window which is opened up right
now it says select data source ok i say
remove the amount is gone iono say okay
from here ok now I i see that my chart
is now divided into two categories and
the bottom here ok you can see there's a
legend here ok this is invisible and
visible ok so i will just delete that
because he make invisible and the
physiological names of the clothes
they're just headers ok I don't need
them now so delete right ok I just click
on the mouse button and say delete Oh
there is a problem with my all right
great okay now my chart now is divided
into two categories the green and the in
the ground okay or you can say mu the
brown portion is something that happens
now look at the screen carefully friends
i am only selecting the ground portion
of the advertising bar okay one more
time I will kick someone out spin now
that just in case anybody has missed
right I will click on this time I will
click on the down portion of the for a
base bar okay and do you notice that all
the brown portions in my chart object
are now getting selected all right okay
now i will just performed by right click
ok i will cook the option that says film
okay now if you go to sit in earlier
versions of MS office you will have to
go to format option small dialog box
will open up okay there on the left side
you can go to fill under the solid fill
you can so here I am going to fill and I
will say no no film okay there in the
earlier versions you will go to solid
fill and choose Rufus a couple of extra
steps there right that's it I now see
that the brown portion now is is gone
okay and i only have the green portion
in my in my chart visible okay now
remember so the Greens the small green
square here which is now showing of the
advertising okay and the next were here
purchase and the next one number which
is payments remember they are all
negative values correct that that is not
the money which is coming to my account
that's been signed by me for the
thinning so that is why but i will do
now so i will select that LSS okay once
again French piece of those observe the
screen when I go somewhere outside and
when I click within one of the box all
the bars are now selected all right
however because I am only interested in
the advertising one right now I will
come again and click on only the
advertising just another trick just
another simple click OK and now I leave
the firm right click again I go to film
and I will say yes
use the red color because it's negative
people from the finance and accounts

red for advertising now i can simply
select the purchased one okay the
purchaser bar and this time i will
simply press the function for key on the
keyboard remember function for is not

will go back again to this invisible
column for those of you or a bit
confused with this press the f2 key and
what I've done is in the invisible
column the first cell was kept as zero
okay and then the next cell has a
formula which is some where I have added
the values in the next row the two
values in the next room have been edited
okay that's my horrible shot ice cream
we can now go to another way of
presenting your data which is
thermometer chart okay again let's not
go by the exact name like the way you
have a mercury level in a thermometer so
it works on the similar concept not
exactly same but yes similar all right
so I do a control paged down right now I
will go to my next your worksheet okay
okay now look at the data here I've got
some sales figures for each of the
months against that Charles different
sales figures and i also have target for
each of the months ok so again now my of
course i can use conditional formatting
here to highlight know which months i've
got i've met the target and for which
months has not met the target that's a
different module all together yeah okay
so uh what i will do is i want to
display this information in a in a chart
okay so figure for this instance we will
use the thermometer chart okay so first
off select any one seller
took long time since I've seen you in
various organizing even people from
finance accounts xbox or Excel you know
they they have this habit of selecting
this entire data like this okay and then
you know they go to the insert tab and
then they choose the type of chart like
the way we discussed right at the
beginning of the session but friends if
you know that there is no extra unwanted
column blank column or unwanted blank
role in your data you might not want me
to select the whole data okay even
forming sorting filtering removing
duplicates pivot records you don't have
to select the entire data that system
extra stick that you guys are doing ok
so whoever is doing it you don't have to
do it simply select one center of your
choice just one cell of your choice and
you can go to alt f1 then I'll to f1 you
get you get the chart in the same
worksheet now what I do do here is just
all right now I see that my sales
figures are shown up in the blue bar ok
and the broomball they show the target
okay the target saves all the months it
may be before in your case oh that's
okay take this knob you won't make any
difference here alright so first i will
select the module one okay the target
okay I they perform for right click here
okay and not just just for formatting I
might want to take it in the black color
okay so that's it right ah next I will
go to the moon again friends for those
of you who are asking if I go out okay
right and if i come back and select one
of these blue bars all the blue bars
will get selected okay and which is what
i wanted this case so right click ok and
I will maybe I can just go to this
bracket and i will go to this option
here which says format data series okay
so let me just click on format data
series right just a minute
okay left to minimize this prey are not
because i am using the Excel 13 version
on the extreme right side I have this
thing that says or med ship can you will
see this format shape pain on the
extreme right side okay great so I can
go to that format shape pain just omit
friends I will just reminds this okay uh
for the 2010 version just because just
in case if you're interested for the 10
version when you perform and I click on
the other powers ok so once all the
parcel selected if you do a right-click
you have format data series okay when
you perform the right click you have
format data series okay and the dance
floor mat it does not the dialog box
will open up that says format data
series okay but then the format data
series of the very first thing that you
will see is series options Phil border
color border styles shadow freedom
format so all of these options will be
available in the new dialog box that
opens up that says format data series
okay Cheryl but for the third inversion
and have to just minus this idea raker
window of questions and the sin that
interface is blocking my IBM does not
adjust
so I go to foreign actor in a series
okay and i will choose the axis as
secondary axis for all my you know for
all my power bars which in the group
okay the sales because the actual sales
leaders know who target okay i might
also want to reduce the adverts to let's
take an example here I'm just trying to
show this with my blinking circles I
might want to move it to maybe fifty
percent so I do that again four to six
fri oh then I will also go to the fill
option and i will say stallard film okay
and i can take a last time you choose a
black color this time we might want to
choose a blue color okay and the
transparency like it's all these options
are available in the man get at today's
dialogue box in the earlier versions of
excel ok so for transparency i am just
making it again you know select to get
to it maybe for its six percent fifty
percent may be incorrect for six percent
okay so can you see the kind of chart
which is now prepared in front of me
okay now i will just come here on the
extreme right side okay on the extreme
right I'll do you see that there is
another axis remember we had taken
assistance from a secondary axis okay
for the bars in blue for the pass for
sales figures i had taken secondary axis
that access is still shows up right
there okay so if I like I might want to
simply just delete that and if I do that
my thermometer chart is ready yeah I am
just
I have a small thing problem which is
open up your rents not just allowing me
to go behind that you are you friends
okay with me so far
okay Cheryl you are saying that you've
gotta kill the transparency perfect
after that all you need to do is you
simply need to go to the graph again the
chart again and simply just believed the
secondary axis unfortunately it's just
I'm allowing you to click on there the
publish it again one grid okay so I come
back good ok once i'm done with the
transparency and we come back to the
axis secondary axis i can just delete
that with my delete key word and you
will notice that my thermometer chart is
ready yeah of course if i go up into the
let's say if i kundo later now and let's
talk about April okay for the month of
April I was 399 and the target was 350
so I am I'm all fine there let's come
back here and say 234 just an example
yeah so obviously the graph is changed
right let me just take a look at the
questions window once again friends I
had a small problem with the with the
interface here I was just not allowed to
go back to the year the excel thing
okay all right just a minute French okay
let's also look at a combinational sharp
right now okay so it's just the next
worksheet right it's the same same piece
of information same printer right like I
did last time I will start off with
anyone's cell of my choice I will say
all function one okay i will start off
with alt f1 right now what I want to do
here is a very there's a slightly simple
thing okay Leo you know for the thermo
member charts I had to you know do a lot
of formatting and stuff but here I will
simply just select the room barks the
target pass it lik I will see a format
notice that was last time we've already
seen the format data series window okay
which appears on the extreme right side
of Excel 13 right this time I will
perform right click and i will go to
change series chart type okay against
change CD chart type now you're on the
new dialog box that we are able to see
okay you must be able to notice that the
bottom your ipod form book selection of
combos right there okay now in the
quango window it currently it says
clustered column for for both okay but
for the target i might want to come here
and stay like just an example ok so
we've gots a line so fun so I see like a
baby there's no point in keeping the
line graph for the target because in
this case that it is same throughout for
all the ones so maybe I will keep it
back to clustered column okay and the
other thing change series trip for the
sales figures if I'd want to choose 9
let's go with this line and I say okay
from your and check it out look at the
beam my graph has now changed
and also it shows all the sales figures
in blue line and it shows all the target
values straight bars simple
straightforward okay oh let me just see
if I can take some questions here I know
we just had six minutes remaining I
wanted to give you a brief about the
speedometer chance we might not have
time for covering the speedometer chart
but just engaged okay you want to look
at this you see here I have this data
here okay so let's say if I am driving a
car at the speed of you know anywhere
between 0 to 15 kilometers and starting
in a phase of my drive my journey of 15
to 45 essential okay and stuff like that
so you know I I just changed the value
here it says 87 right now I will just
change up to 54 for example and look at
the needle look at the needed okay so
this is called as a speedometer chart
amount not sure if you can't do it right
now but yeah so this is done with the
combination of doughnut chart and also
the pie chart just going to wander in
your friends I'm just fine to my
contacts as the questions window you're
so I'm not able to make out whether you
are with me or not just give me one
minute your friends
okay all right okay oh alright so i
think so i can see ok Sharon Parker
wants to know where is the combo option
in the Excel 2010 okay in the XL 10
version shuttle you might not be
required to change the combo thing as
soon as you select there is if you
select the right click on the target or
the sales ok so in this case change okay
you can just say change series chart
type okay and choose tonight from the
smoke Cheryl I with me from the small
dialog box that opens up change chart
type remember we spoke about that in the
beginning right in that simply choose
the choose the line option and you will
notice that your graph automatically so
much one slightly nice thing about XL
10-7 you don't really have to go down at
the bottom and you don't look at the
bottom and choose to finish this convo
okay okay Thank You Cheryl right friends
another question here can you please
show all sheets at once okay I'm not
sure okay okay simple data was the first
sheet there we just spoke about this
types of spin Oh have shortcuts and all
okay then waterfall okay we spoke about
water hole that there is cash flow in
out okay then there is a thermometer
heart that we spoke about where we have
sales as well Esther so there's more
bigger to value here okay and then there
is a combinational chart that Miss also
be used the column as well as the line
here for combination and then we have
the option here that is now the last
chick is speedometer chart okay so i
will show you against this Widowmaker
shot i might not have time to cover that
because it's just 958 but those of you
who are interested those of you who are
interested can send a mail to support
team of and maybe we can do another
session may be on skype or something so
something which I leave to you and the
support staff at Eureka okay yeah so
let's look at the I just move the
question spindle out right so here i
have the bathroom okay i will come here
and i will say 76 quickly the needle
points at the cream zone yeah which is
like the economy's one if i come down
your value i said 12 it comes in the red
zone yeah so yeah okay another thing
friends which sure we might want to do
here is ok i just give you a real brief
on this I memory you know I really
wanted to cover this this is a wonderful
I mean I did spent a good 15 20 minutes
to prepare this example and it's a shame
that i'm not getting time to now cover
this but the speedometer chart love you
what I don't do is just do it really
quick and I'm using the Excel sucking
version for that so I will start off now
you're a bought the speedometer range
and here i have the winder rage data
range ok so i will come here and say alt
f1 area so it opens up the chart for me
next i go to the change chart type here
and out of the so many options given to
me okay i need to choose the pie chart
option and within the pie the last
option that i have here is upon it okay
it's not a cat on it right so I say okay
now bribe us well what was going to
happen now is you see that this chart is
now give us since two parts okay the
blue portion on the left and the
remaining portion okay what I want to do
with I won't move this insect okay and
the blue portion of the government comes
at the extreme bottom okay and the other
portion comes on at the top right so i
will just presented this graph right
click right within the within the graph
and foreign data cds
okay here i will select an angle of 270
degrees did you see I just put up to 70
degrees there and the donor has now
turned the way I would like that to turn
there now i will select the blue portion
like i said i do not want the blue
portion so i will say right click OK and
film and have insane move it or not I'm
not deleting that all right I'm not
deleting that from the further chart
it's just invisible right now because
it's no fit right then I might want to
just select this film and I might want
to put this red color because it's the
you know so it's a danger zone I do not
want a value to be in the 0 to 15 next
I've got 15 to 45 so maybe I can come
here and I can say Phil and I can just
shut down and say should be yellow looks
like he's a foursome and then the best
to right-click and isolate here ok so
until you mouse is I have taken Oh donut
chart I have removed the unwanted
portion ok so whatever it takes to
remove the unwanted portion ever
changing of the angle remove making it
were no more color again though Phil
right and then giving the required
colors in the remaining half of the
color chart right again I can go here
and I can now say select data just like
the way I did the same thing for the
speedometer I will do the same thing for
the pointer okay and I will just do some
formatting and depending on that
wherever I have my failure so it's 34 if
i change it the quanta be
correspondingly point to the the correct
thing okay another thing that i want to
quickly highlight your friends is ok now
i have this part here ok do you see on
top here ok on the Excel ribbon do you
see there is a camera like icon which is
which is headed on the top left of my
screen now I'm sure we all know the Save
icon and through view all motor control
s the undo the tray number Q how camera
icon you can you will see that you guys
may not have it right now because I have
only added that ok so let's see how do i
use the camera icon sucks let's take an
example that I am
creating a new sheet okay so I have got
my new sheet let me rename that as new
sheet just an example okay i will select
the excel rows and columns which are
behind my chart so i hope you can see
i'm selecting the entire XL rows and
columns behind my chart and i choose the
camera icon here okay i click on the
camera icon right and i go into that new
sheet and i will just paste it in the
game chase the benefit is it's like a
screenshot of the graph okay who also
had an option in MS office 2010 and 13
this is insert screenshot it's there for
Excel PowerPoint Word outlook but that
doesn't show for I settle it will not
allow you to navigate between two
different sheets for file the scammer
icon can put your chart as well as a
screenshot in another sheet the benefit
of that is due see there's a small hang
there like structure here you see this
mind so i can just news with those graph
like this i can twist I can turn to the
graph like this okay so you know I can
run of things with that so that's just
another thing which I work I think okay
also friends then you look at the other
okay now i'm back to that sheet we did
the thermometer charm okay i am placing
my cursor right now in the end column
okay i go to the insert tab I go to the
insert tab and I have a thing here that
says colin yeah so i am in the spark
lines group right now okay of this
feature is there in Excel 2010 falls
over it's not there in Excel 7 venue ok
so just keep that in mind so I go to the
insert I in the spark lines group i will
go to column okay it's just what is your
data range i will select this entire
sales row so ctrl shift arrow right is
the shortcut don't use your mouse to do
the a resolution control shift arrow
right okay and where do you want the
spot lines to be placed yes Anthony I
say okay and check it out
issues then you in my end know in common
right now I've got a column wise
representation of the data of all
uncensored one single cell of course if
I change me listen let's go back the
same book okay i will now change
december choose five thousand okay and
see the open data really changes they
can immense may see the last the last
bar is really huge in the others are not
because all other values are in hundreds
this is in thousands right back to it
and it read refreshes right another
thing that I want to highlight your
friends is ok so sensitive I go working
with me so far I also wanted to
highlight this wonderful feature of
Excel called table okay okay thank you
so much Krishna thank you so much they
boob ever keep say skeet wing for some
Buddhist is absolutely how I thank you
yeah okay a kind of Vince is perfect
okay great so yeah that was a nice
option here in the insert tab okay just
before I move on since you guys seem to
be real interested in that another thing
I can just get this system okay in the
thermometer again just a minute okay or
just now oh I'm not sure whether it was
okay in the combinational ok so the end
column where I have my spark line so I
found this feature is called spark lines
okay i have this I can also go back to
the business are in together and I can
if I'm not happy with the column thing
some bleep parabolas I'm sorry guys if
I'm not pronouncing the names correctly
stays great session okay thank you
Jewish we are not then here i have just
got smaller and small piece of
information but if yes you if you have
to go somewhere you can release the
Senate thank you the wish okay i can
always choose I mean from koala my can
always make it two in line if I require
so that n column you cannot see changes
like a little nine like the baby just
saw okay another thing that I wanted to
show you here is okay just leave this
okay let's take a simple example here I
have got
the da speediest so batsman again okay
let's take an example we start off with
such an exam from Mumbai within the
slave of a year okay how can we forget
the rods that's also adds a nice new guy
from Mumbai so I'm just adding some
great players here okay right let's also
have another super clear here okay I've
got the data of waste passed in here
I've got the school so I just put some
random fits right now so let's assume
when this is a cricket je t'aime these
are the scores that these basic scored
in one match okay of course I can always
do an alt f1 to get the graph is a
special should do that by now right now
let's take an example that someone comes
up to me and says I'm reached you know
what are you have missed out one batsman
so I said no problem i can add the
person here okay so we have a person by
the name krishna who is attending this
webinar that's both your name partner
okay okay do you see friends that the
new xmas data is getting ended and
enough or not or you see of course you
can see that it's not getting married am
I correct yeah so I am quite ok friends
so far you'll get the point here so I
haven't data okay and I added some more
rows to my data and now they are not
getting added in my graph okay in my
charge so lot of people what they do
here is they go to the design tab and
they choose the option of that says
select data okay and then from here they
will make the changes to flow from 11
now they will make to each other my
problem with this method is we can't
keep changing it every now and then
every time you are adding more rows okay
you can't keep going to the design tab
and click on the select beta command and
they keep making those changes that is
why I am NOT okay with this method so
let's come to the boundary of the graph
and believes the graph okay it's like to
leave the grotto by clicking on the
boundary till it on the people
what I will do now it's just to make my
craft dynamic okay friends we are almost
done I just thought of covering this
wonderful feature called a table so so
far I ok with me ok great super so
whatever we do now is like I said I will
simply select one cell of my choice in
the data ok just one cell of my choice
right and ok I have an acknowledgement
form of the big other one I hope he's
not the guy from saplings in who though
her head ok so i will select one cell of
my choices all right and I we press ctrl
T evoke angle ok ctrl G right so do you
seek window comes up by the name create
table yea all I'm doing is been prone p
for tango ok t430 just a last name and i
press ok do you notice that my data my
existing excel data gets converted into
a nice film formatting thing which is
what a blue and the white formatting ok
of course we're not doing powerpoint
here so will not bother about the
different colors and layouts and
declaration and the formatting but now
my data has been converted into a table
right now i will again visit that
shortcut which is called self f1 right
on f1 ok and ok i just move the
questions right now you see that the new
person krishna obviously is added now ok
now if i ask some more person so let's
go with the fake who's attending session
right see i had more people now and do
you see that they are getting properly
added in the in the graph you see that
yeah let's add some more here ok so
Rahul ok so add new people and they are
all getting added now in the graph ok
not just for the rose again this is one
last tip here and not just for the rules
also for the call and now we already
have the score column ok let's come back
let's come to the earth column and i
will save Ricketts ok score runs and
wickets ok so let's take an example see
as
as I and the wicked column it gets
quickly added in the in the chart and
let's say 1245 up I think I much in sync
played very well to me he took six
wickets let me just handle 64 my name
here right so not just for the rules is
also working for the quadrants as the
beauty of this feature called Excel
table ctrl T is the shortcut I would
know the strange yeah so this table
thing is not going to you know I mean
the table things on only photograph okay
it can also be available to to anything
I said it also makes your pivot import
dynamic in nature and maybe we can cover
that in some other webinar but ok so i
think yeah i can see some
acknowledgments there thank you so much
pence i think we will have to we will
have to find a cure ok some friends are
asking about the speedometer but I'm
sorry friends and I think we already
have extended to the time limit and I
don't really I don't want to do
injustice to the Prophet calling the
speedometer I don't want to really rush
on that but yes friends if you are
