what means field for last seven years so
even before the howl was even started so
I just wanted to get a bit feedback from
you people are you able to hear me and
can you see my street you can check the
response type your responses which are
pillows so I guess we are all here to
learn more about DevOps divorces what's
this buzzword that's going on these days
each and every company is trying to
replace their managers with very fast
team that's quality ops team that can
handle it and automate all this stuff
but where did it all start
will the SDLC that we have learned
during our college days the software
development model willing to be at least
completely by devoxx so this is similar
is ordered also have a small hand so on
exercise is about showing you how it can
benefit the way people to suffer
debility sticks well this is going to be
a seminar of one we'll try to wind up
the slides in 40 minutes and then I'll
jump back to your questions
so meanwhile we're taking up this your
questions yourself you can type in your
chat windows whenever i get time
wherever there is a logical break in
between I should be able to take your
questions we can answer all the
questions and answer all of them at the
end of the seminar
okay let's start off with that so during
this session today you'll be able to
understand why devups
what's the requirement of it in the
first place and why people are so crazy
ordered that many companies are adopting
DevOps these days it's sunrise
the number of terms that are increasing
with the verbs
I'll use boom this year especially
especially in 2015 so the number of jobs
openings there for the most people have
been on great rights so what is the box
would be understanding about it what are
the processes that are being implemented
in it and how do we do was a smooth
transition between the different
processes that is from a company which
is not on divorce to bring it on the box
what has to be done okay
we'll also be looking to different
statistics from Rackspace this year
regarding the survey that has been
conducted on the box for charities and
different roles that you can so this is
the worst field it's not that one single
box engineer can handle everything well
there are people who can do that but
still to get yourself a bigger picture
of where you can fit yourself where you
can use the skills in the industry you
should have a fair idea about advanced
will be also a key to how to how we
implement all of these concepts into the
organizations and how organization can
benefit from it so this is Theresa Tina
let's start with the first topic quiet
divorce
well everyone requires already speed
efficiency but know what requires cost
that is the primary model companies work
for their own profits their stakeholders
thoughts so when he removes any software
that has to be developed you are also
talking man force which is required and
the number of manuals don't rotate so
that costs let's consider the drainage
tool SDLC scenario where every phase of
development is scheduled after one
another
so requirement analysis the design
testing so unless and until development
is complete is an untested right so
there must rise to remove this problem
Judy when it was first implemented to
software development it was only
implemented at the managerial level how
to manage this office they started a
bulletin down by holding down to the
label where we started developing the
software these buddies using using the
agile methodologies but the problem was
this was only limited to people and
development when people started facing
problems about the infrastructure why's
that infrastructure cannot change at the
base and which he ochio code changes
each thing cannot happen as fast as
people are changing the development so
along with the continuously changing
codebase if you can handle testing at
the same pace that forgiveness instead
of waiting for a complete block to be
developed and then desperate so for this
continuous dream to be possible
it works was introduced so as you might
notice there are two different sections
to it one is development or another one
is the infrastructure wise or the
operational section that's where it's
quality bombs okay so for this primary
requirements these requirements comes in
later on for the parameter requirements
that is qualities yield an efficiency
that has to be there so quality of
product should be good speed of
development should be nice it should be
efficient you should be able to do it
again and again without even and the
course should be lowered
of course if you can save time and it is
efficient its speedy you are definitely
worth to save on cost but the two sides
of the coin the developers who are
continuously making the changes based on
the repo business requirements and on
the second side
the infrastructure is the system admins
the operations team which is working
with you they try to resist the changes
another there's big question why see the
problem here is if something goes wrong
on your developer boxes it's okay
you can fix it you can retest it right
it's nothing that on production
something is going to hamper your price
not good
because but on the other side if the
live machine
that means the machine on which your
host is posted or the polish existence
the web sense that you see like Google
flip card amazing those are all
production systems if any of the
configuration on the production systems
is Mustafa good or it goes down your
real clients that happened that's the
only reason why offs people are so much
pessimistic about making continuous
changes so they've found a team they
they thought about these people who
started the rebuffs almost six years
back in 2009 there were a series of
papers being greeted you from the guys
in Twitter okay then all of these things
started so the team was founded the team
who knows about system architecture
about the coding they also know about
the production systems the machines and
how the pool flows from development
environment to operations so see if
testing part can be added just above the
developmental a instead of after that
means what I'm in sales
one feature is develop test another
feature is develop again develop and all
the three features when they are
intimately developed according to the
methodology should be able to
incremental e test it you should also be
able to build it in incremental fashion
and that has to be done automatically so
these people the name of skies they
understood for the core flows between
the machines between the developers firm
that are open in government through
different stages to its productions and
they try to automate that even the
configuration level automation was done
and achieved using software's like a
potential so whether that happens these
people know of every single week in your
development moment okay either it would
be automation testing or manual testing
several deployments would be
configuration replication the Indian
marbles closer to the weapon systems
setting up the developer boxes
architecture always changes in the code
label box code optimizations so these
people know a bit of each and everything
okay so if you have a zeal for
automation if you like to innovate if
you like to customize solutions to fit
your organization even a trite piece you
should be chosen to the most field so
what happens currently if the software
has been produced it goes to my if
something goes wrong if divorce is not
there in that case so if something goes
wrong the general tendency in
organization says this is not perform so
if something goes wrong on the
production the production I see is that
you gave me the configurations may be
okay the robot says it was working on a
machine is not working your life it's
your fault
so everyone tries to blame one with
DevOps it's culture that stan and so on
three different pills the pillar server
prefers the structure then you need to
set up the structure right that means
the team hierarchy should be right and
at the very last comes pooling to choose
proper automation tools if there are no
tools if still okey you can still write
your own scripts in whatever language
you choose you could do some automation
and that will also be commended as
effective if it works for you it's okay
if you don't
code it from scratch you can use this
systems that are already present uh no
action will be used and what happens
when automation is not done and there is
no proper communication between the
teams
thirty percent of the projects most of
the time it will be too late okay that
happens with majority of the products I
have seen many many projects go beyond
the release deadlines it was supposed to
be released on 30 Petula and I'm just
going to be released then georgie
happens and to reduce this divorce I
have to be done so the creation of SDLC
where it is a phase parfaits
your penis will be sitting idle you will
have to juggle the teams between
different projects the team has to wait
for the early phase to become here and
since you are waiting on something it's
expensive
you're wasting your resources right
that's the traditional hdl-c concept but
when it comes to our DevOps we do
everything in parallel see with our
methodologies we can always chunk down
the things into Spanish then this
friends that means small goals sprint
selection is modes that can be achieved
over fairly smaller amount of time let a
be equal to weeks for maximum three or
four weeks not more than that ideally it
is a week or two and then you turn down
the goals forget daily achievable
milestones so that you get a sense of
achievement and happiness by both the
things that can speed up the process
plus ideas flows from minute so your
developers will come up with ideas you
don't have to spoon-feed them from the
top level focus the manager does not
have to do any of the stuff developers
can come up with their ideas and then
they can implement their most often
achieve the product step by step at time
and at the end of the goal that means at
the end of the Sprint you'll have a
fully functional system please but when
this system is be build incremental step
by step you need an automated system
that will keep track of the things that
are happening and that system is the dev
of system so there are tools that can be
integrated together to form a system
that is called continuous indicator
system water CI then deploys to the test
systems it's called CD
furnace deployment then when it goes
from the internal systems to the
corruption that means it is available
for the like public its quantity is
delivery and everything is triggered
with a single comment I'll show you how
to do that when we get on to the
hands-on exercise so what was the
advantages of it from the business point
of view there are three different
sections organization that performs
and measurement measurement is most
important of it if you can't measure
something you can optimize it so he
should have some statistics on basis of
which you can choose the bleep the
things
so with sdlc and a-bombs there are
differences but Baxter is SDLC it
develops its offering once in a chunk
DevOps can split it down into small
achievable goals ok organization it is a
skill set receivers where you have
people teamed up for faces and their
skills are generally teamed up together
but with DevOps
you do not concentrate on the skills the
family is equal to instead bring all the
people together in a team which can talk
horizontally the communication is
corazon they give you the knowledge and
they can achieve the goals in a
efficient and everything happens
parallel so whenever you do testing
there is but this is happening you know
you get a better picture of what's
happening across the state and you know
that to leave the developing would be
going through these stages to memorize
should be what smoking people have a
sense of responsibility and ownership of
the things that they are doing whatever
in during the scheduling things centrist
SDLC is all centralized whereas DevOps
it is decentralized written distributed
across different people and they are
responsible for the toxin it happens
continuously continuously
achievable small groups at least it is
very high risk even because you are
testing and computer software if fails
complete whoa that we have done over a
year or maybe even more than that he is
at stake at that point it works or it
doesn't work there is no way out but we
DevOps it's not an email
because since you are releasing
continuously you do it everyday you do
it with very small achievable targets
that you develop okay and that happens
continuously so it's like no big deal it
is all the right information is
disseminated it is all documented in
some place people should really refer to
it as a reference one but with DevOps it
is actually all the information that you
have are notifications to do some
actions whether it is a success
notification whether it is a release
notification that is happening or there
are some issues with the code everything
is continuously being thrown at you so
you know what has to be done
the culture is do not feel it is highly
pessimistic system they try to prevent
the failures by at the very last test in
the whole system but with the box it
says fail early
it is optimistic about what the
developer self activity okay and the
things I'm interested every label so we
often see that the boat won't fail if it
has to be failing it has to fail early
the matrix has to be a very strong point
here in sdlc the question capacity of
decided beforehand okay the DevOps
Causton capacity are still dinner this
was beforehand but there is very little
chance of it going beyond the statistics
that you have probably predicted for the
particular system along with that even
the time is calculated and the time is
always maintained that a achieve goals
so it is just like achieving small
pieces of time in a very controlled
fashion that you know that I should be
able to achieve it on a daily basis if
you try to target a big goal at the very
end should be able to achieve it in one
month you are probably doing something
wrong okay one cannot perfectly
guarantee that I should be able to
achieve this in one month exactly one
eighteen to thirty days of thing that is
not achievable that is not realistic
they don't define done in his DLC says I
did my job so that's the consumer defect
where people start blaming one of them
he says that I did module over cleaner
it's young and I hit move it up move to
another phase and you need to take care
of it there isn't a box it's a team
effort it goes till chunks and everyone
knows what's going to happen next
okay and the end product is actually
artifact that is ready to deploy I think
happens spontaneously every day you
don't have to wait for a complete
software to be developed so would IT
benefit cells this is a small survey
from Rackspace this year and with DevOps
the benefits that IBM 3 power is the
Vodafone first time to market a new soft
releases because it doesn't over you the
time to moreover you are increasing your
releasing your application in
incremental fashion so you capital the
brand's earlier and since it is
continuous you release continuously so
you don't have to waste time planning
for the reason that saves a lot of time
44 percent improved application
stability since you're releasing
everything in a very controlled fashion
releasing continuously so people are
very used to this release stuff that is
been done
34% reduced right across I told you how
to how it saves the time and please
don't hang it also save the cost
ready further percent more innovation it
has been found that when people have
given the right to do the things from
there all his stuff telling them how to
do it just tell them what to do okay and
it nurtures innovation in big companies
so the companies like Google Facebook
Seagate or flip card for for this reason
the startups that we have seen so these
companies have
forty-four percent ability has been seen
to respond quickly to the business
requirements because says at every level
we have quick notification systems that
M provide you with actionable
notifications of actionable items you
have better response times and better
turnout rates as well if someone reports
your birth you know that the book can be
fixed or can be released in a day
because release every day 70% businesses
recognizes the value ID can add to their
business these days nothing can
none of the businesses of which has a
global scope can run without internet
and when we talk of Internet we talk of
IT infrastructure right as any personal
business is that considered during this
time a tool that they recognize the
value of devotion to the so that was
about the idea during the development
what's the very main benefit the
business can report of the device that's
the only thing
where your superiors would be
concentrating so the 57 person increased
customer conversion conversion or
satisfaction
now what keeps customer conversion and
satisfaction speed better the ability
for fixing the things good turnaround
times okay so and you better turn around
times for customizations see if you have
faster systems that you achieve that you
develop daily and release daily you can
achieve customizations and modifications
at very less time you know that the
system is not completed and it's easy to
make the changes to any stage possible
it reduces IT infrastructure spend by 57
percent now how that is done is when you
talk of divorce it's not only about the
proper tools but it's also about the
infrastructure so these days people are
all jumping towards
virtualization the concepts like
the containers
the beer machines are infrastructure as
a service that AWS provides okay so you
don't have to set up all your systems
all biome you can use the virtualized
container or machine from here you can
start learning things most of the
startups do the same thing when they try
to depend on the system's are already
available in the market instead of
setting up all of their infrastructure
all by their own it increases this fails
when you are having a system that is
highly responsible
sorry not responsive it has good
turnaround is you have good speed you
can cut down on infrastructure costs you
can spend it on your marketing and that
can increase the sales okay it increases
the employee engagement then they have
the ownership they have the feeling of
being connected to the code to the
product that they are developing it
increases the employee engagement it
does not miss the time they do not
doodle around things
figuring out what has to be done next
they they have the innovation you know
into mindset and they do their work
it reduces the application downtime of
failure rates for 49% now how that is
achieved when you release every day that
is a new biggie for you you are doing it
every day right so you know the the
tricks the failure points the
precautions that has to be taken and it
reduces application downtime and failure
rates increase incomes customer
engagement can be explained as in the
amount of speed that you have the
responsiveness of your website the the
speed at which your website be responses
back to the customers that is a very
important thing when you develop a
highly interactive website for
e-commerce or your customers let's say
if the website takes five seconds of
time to load a page your customers will
not be willing to look at your website
or wait for even five seconds to look at
easting they will jump on someone other
sites and it will cost you money so the
wider businesses has not seen measurable
benefits from the box the wider
businesses in that the businesses that
are not only dependent on internet but
they are working without the internet
like businesses maybe some cool use
there with businesses that has a lot of
lot of things to do with the field work
okay so that was a three percent and
two-person people said that it is too
early to say they need some more
interaction of the DevOps but overall we
see that business can have a very big
impact because of implementing of
divorce so why is divorce being adopted
because of the impact it's having on IP
because the fact is having the
businesses and the carton of says that
about 25 percent of the global 2000
companies are expected to adopt a boss
right around 60
I have already started witnessing it
since 2014 and I have seen a lot of
companies being adopting the most the
big big crimes their work these people
are adopting DevOps like crazy they're
spending a lot on it and they are hiring
engineers who can help them set up
things for them and this matter is going
to be close to two point three billion
buy enough to see if that means end of
2015
it's hardly five more months to go so
definitely simply our demand and the
jobs 66% of IT managers have implemented
a DevOps practices in their own
organizations and those who have not
among those people seven percent of
people that this almost 3/4 of people
could be implementing this divorce thing
in their organizations but what doesn't
repeat so it does not mean that they
will be setting up all the tools that
are available in market it just means
that we what continuous development
continuous testing proper test case
and our deployment to the production
that should be the primary good okay so
you can do it using the small scripts
you can simply use Jenkins ever to do
some automation free so let us
understand what DevOps is exactly so
like I said it is a team of people who
know who knows about all the areas but
they are the experts they don't have to
be experts one experts from one team can
but can impart knowledge to the other
people then bring them to its limits but
the stuff is you should know if
something was wrong
whom to contact where to look for the
errors how to isolate it and how to fix
it okay instead of other people you
should have information and knowledge
about the things for those reproduce it
and how to help someone else with fixing
those things again okay if that can be
done properly
then you can get around problems and fix
them and really instead of wasting and
figuring out people interviewing people
and tell them what it is and there they
should be able to again reproduce it
right so that's the big biggest thing
when you are let us take a use case of
divorce until long we have seen
everybody in the culture rewriting this
development stuff that has to be done
there is another part to it it is called
scalability those big companies are
taking up DevOps mainly not only because
of the quality and the speed development
interesting but also due to its
capability of scaling things for is on
three so let us take an example of some
card comm they plan to have a big video
game where on that particular day they
are expecting that their daily traffic
would be 10 times more than what they
expect
now for this thing to be ready let's say
they are having hundred different
service 100 servers are capable of
serving 10,000 requests concurrently but
if the traffic searches if new traffic
comes in what should they do to take in
that traffic it should be able to serve
it right people should not waste their
time looking at the loading pages of
blank pages definitely if you have more
customers it's good that you have more
customers but you should also be able to
serve them right so how does dev ops
help you so like I said in the very
beginning there was also and give the
tools that help you in configuration
that helps you in setting up the systems
one of the systems is called Auto
elastic scale and scaling system very
free there's some of the scripts that
can generate you that they can generate
some more VMs or some more machines
address that we have so there's one of
the expect of it so let's take on a busy
day I would be having 10,000 a capacity
to 10,000 or 10,000 connections but what
if a new connection from saying would I
be able to solve it right so the
question is that the answer would be
whether I keep it in buffer and wait for
the previous connections to be released
or I increase my infrastructure but if I
increase my infrastructure that should
be done at a minutes notice I shouldn't
be wasting hours to configure that right
so these days you know that you must be
aware of VX virtual machines that we can
subpoena and all the cloud providers is
the same so we can reserve a few VMs
their very last moment we can arrange
for a new VMs gala so let us say you
have a scalable infrastructure free
expense UN 200 more machines to
and you should be able to serve on the
tractor back to you are you are
expecting him once you're done with the
traffic stuff in the draft Lainey you're
gonna get scaled up you can kill all
those instances and be only for the part
that you have used so that would be
awesome right you are not worried about
paying your electricity bills
the cooling sections in your data
centers are paying for the bandwidth or
setting up dummy systems wrong there
when you actually need 100 machines why
when you will be setting up three
ricochets just for handling traffic
surge once a year or once a month right
that makes sense so to reduce the cost
we never do them that kind of things you
only purchase the part which we are
expecting to expect it to use on daily
basis otherwise we go towards the cloud
providers these days people don't even
buy the human infrastructure I rememeber
providers for each and every identity
infrastructure requirement of their
organization okay so then that's what
DevOps can help you that is all done
automatically no manual information is
required so there once is not about
pools it's about automation whatever you
use your target enter bit should be the
things like if you see a stuff if you
see anything in your organization relate
it to a key of course and development
that is repeated at least twice or
thrice a day you should be able to
automate it using some scripts if their
scripts are big enough people like to
call it as tools if they are also having
administrative controls which you can
control from the string it would be a
good software so you can scale up you
build your own software and make it
available for hopefully that some people
build different things like that and
then they made it public we give some
some parts for themselves as Enterprise
editions first completely myself these
people you can do it yourself as well so
you have seen that as DLC is actually
takes time it feels good
and the closest companion with divorce
since everything is automated it is
quick
it is done in parallel and it can also
help us to provision different servers
know some people might be here using
solid hand symbols might be using
sheriff what depends what's that we see
use some people like to go with puppet
for setting up their infrastructure
right so about the careers everyone over
here is looking for the career
opportunity and that might be the one of
the prime reasons why we are looking
forward to getting knowledge about this
favorite DevOps
so with the industry's technological in
this the technology in the silicon is
the IT industry is the one that is
actually benefiting a lot from the box
using this people can keep retargeting
to have lower number of people engineers
in their company but still achieving
maximum productivity on the public that
means the users to engineers ratio is
generally very high in the company which
has evolved and we just adopted to
divorce for an example take example of
Twitter a few years back when Twitter
was serving 1 billion more than 1
million users in its infant stage it was
being executed only by 2025 different
engineers
so that's the kind of ratio that you can
have the figures might not be exact so
that's the benefit with the divorce
rules you can have a different kind of
positive mentioned on the slides
generally the terms that are being
searched a box so that their works the
engineers have a voting score of 31.3%
and that is the percentage of people
working different
now let me choke it down for you in
different sections according to skills
so do obsess for different sections you
could be a release engineer you could be
a engineer you could be landings expert
you could be induce integration expert
you could be tooling integration expert
auto configuration management and there
are also rules which are very much full
specific like its vengeance expert or
puppet engineer or there is even a
postcard chef engine if you know all of
these all together you would be called a
DevOps engineer and then you can go up
and down the screen depending on at
whatever you work ok the entry point
would be a simple divorce engineer on to
this career path supporting to the job
trains it was started the job started
from 2011 now at 2015 you can see an
exponential rise in the amount of jobs
that are available for divorce positions
ok so it clearly shows that many people
you need to have oxygen use in the
states and this still said that is
required is generally a few news strong
exposure to programming any programming
skills ok so that you can customize the
stuff you can integrate tools or you can
wear your own that is the prime
requirement for evolution or if you are
looking at very specific sections in the
Box like a surgery engineer or chef
engineer that is you will need to master
one of the tools that is available for
public online pharmacy which is
extensively being used across the market
ok
so if you are planning to take any of
the courses without deliver we are
covering up the tools like Jenkins and
then maven we also have puppet yourself
doctor this ok so then there are flow
tools
and the salaries are here before him in
this graph the surgeries were like on
the range of travel engineer it would be
40,000 50,000 back in 2011
now this during this you had 2015
engineer in u.s. is generally running
somewhere between $100,000 to 130
thousand dollars with 401k benefits
forum so the cool thing I do you don't
have to be senior most tables but
average DevOps engineer would be earning
that much of course with an experience
more than five for like five more than
five years of experience if you are
sorry for the career it's still a nice
payout so if you are talking of in terms
of Indian Salvage that means taking the
experiment expenses and the earnings in
it would be almost be out of eight to
ten at level of one year of experience
and the experience of more than five
years five to seven years you might be
earning somewhere close to twenty
twenty-five in an average company I am
NOT talking of the companies like Amazon
or cement type or some companies like we
heal or even flip card they have their
own levels of oxygen years so apart from
this if you are willing to really shine
your career battery box you should be
also looking into programming algorithm
in data structures so that you can earn
really maybe
really good salary beyond what was his
net constructive of started
of course it started off with Google but
he came and made it public unless we did
it in 2009 and then we saw that it was
actually been used across all the big
chains who brings of the problems solve
them and somewhere even generous to
expose their problems and solutions to
the world like Facebook exposed
Cassandra or we have some of the
projects from NASA being ported for
watch a open source projects so that's
where DevOps community can pick up the
tools that they are using amazon.com is
the company which is really good at
infrastructure divorce and destroying
services order on the glue so with the
business goals there was a business and
benefits that we have seen only the
business goes according to the latest
survey conducted by rax is it shows that
business efficiency increase has
increased by six thirty percent with the
people who have implemented divorce
that's the general term it would be
closer to six threes then I have found
66% increase in customer satisfaction
that's nice application is increased by
60% what happens is generally when you
release the application not continuously
but wherever you do it you require some
downtime to be taken up for the
maintenance for changing the data the
schemas for setting up the things right
for concealing the infrastructures for
making the changes in maybe if I was it
incur some downtime but the continuous
deployment you don't have to do or worry
about it we plan for around X so 60%
time has been found with applications
the business agility or the ability
taking changes and deliver the things
probably a 15-9
has increased by 55% customers the
conversion has increased specific person
from the
the people who visit your websites
they're just visiting or they are
actually paying you that makes a huge
impact to the business people have seen
food a nine-person increased in value to
the businesses through introducing new
capabilities or new features in their
applications instead of waiting for
produced new changes or new features
down the line and make the stores happy
according to that ok definitely reduce
costs and increases employees
interaction and productivity it also
increases employee satisfaction because
satisfaction the benefits of divorce so
with the demo section that will show you
is more than how we deal with things
like but the sdlc you know that
everything is sequential how do we
convert that from situation into the
parallel systems ok so the tools that I
am using right now I will be using SVN I
am setting up a sphere in front of you
or which is any of a few VM machines and
the machines will be setting up an
infrastructure that could help you do
development and testing ok so the tool
school vary depending on the
organization that you have you might be
using something like did you get any
other thing I'm using SVN with the
ventilation inducing system you might be
using check-ins some I'm using in CTE
travels bamboo anything
theme is it should happen continuously
ok for the code reviews people might use
fabricator or
guarantor some people like to use to do
good all it depends but the phases
through which the court should flow
should be seen everywhere there might be
a few more layers or filters through
which the court passes depending on how
your organization requirements are based
on that you choose the tools effect
so there is no term for that but people
generally like to use the open-source
tools which do not have any licenses
over them generally the open-source
license is like a GPL - sorry GPL
licenses or licenses are the ones that
people generally like to use so what I
have here is a system which I will be
installing SPN so what I prepare myself
for the demo if you have any questions
you may raise your hands or you can type
in your questions I can answer those
things if you want to talk with me you
can raise your hands I can unmute you so
can we can speak speak
you can also share your ideas all right
so I have an SPL system sthe but that is
a fresh machine that I have created just
down in my infrastructure I will be
requiring some systems like DHCP DNS to
be set up now these are also part of
what the most sensitive should be
knowing it is not a thumb rule
definitely your requirements would be
deferring but in the nutshell Automation
is what we require when you talk of you
infrastructure we also talk of networks
right you need to set up some neck
person into a sense my PA says you
should giving of submitting it's all
good to have knowledge it's not
mandatory but it's definitely would do
so I'm sucking of a skill silver from
scratch a prohibition kills machine for
him okay this is just a matter of
installing a few packages intelligence
will be up and running on the system so
don't worry about the details of things
you
but we have a question from tasks that
can be used beyond where we practice
divorce yes definitely you can use any
of the proper tools provider something
these days continues issue is really on
demand and boom so if you really want to
use something that is using production I
suggest you should use dropper VMware's
is a really good starting point I'm
using VM this Oracle VirtualBox because
it's free if you have the resistance for
VMware you can use it does it instead of
pushing
Ubik well let's see how to set up a
sphere a small hands-on demo you can
keep on posting your questions or I'll
try to answer them so I have a question
from Danish he says that he is new to
the box from what he's hearing it's all
about automated provisioning of millions
of hardware what can I do from software
good perspective to adopt today bombs
well you are partially right Danish that
it is about automated provisioning of
games not all - that it comes when
you're talking of automated provisioning
of games you jump into the production
side of it but there's a lot more to the
move DevOps then directly jump into
production cool star so from the devil
machine yourself so in case you are
required to customize the code or
contribute something to it or fix some
bugs you should be knowing a few of the
programming languages or any of the
programming language that your
organization is using during this course
you will be teaching your Python and
also shell scripting so that should help
you be comfortable with different
requirements of customizations that you
might be facing does it answer your
question
I'm not getting a question can you
elaborate more okay so it's jump to SP
answer what I'm doing right now is let's
update the system first well Denise is
that since the question was what can he
do from software code perspective he has
added some more information that he has
an existing je j2ee
application and he's trying to see what
he can do hi Kate alright migration has
in migration from j2ee to different
language or is that what you mean
donación okay can you please help me
understand what you mean by migration
okay just to adopted a of strategy well
that's good if you have an application
you must already be being using some of
the version control systems see so see
when the interpretive structure that has
to be build of course if you're using
CVS is still good you can integrate that
with Jenkins like the way I am going to
do with a sphere okay you can adapt to
the strategy of continuously integrating
the things the way you develop something
you should automatically pass through a
few checks and automatically get
deployed somewhere that can be done as
initial step so there works it's not
blindly doing any automation it's about
reaching some perfect goals so the
initial goals with the code would be to
impart quality to it okay so quantity
comes in by continuously checking the
code whatever you are doing is according
to the standards does it meet the
company requirements is it right of a
three-foot build properly so all these
questions can be asked by implementing
proper checks and checks can be set up
as main steps in circuits so
I'll show you in practice how that is
done you're welcome finish Santa's the
community grew up disk space is required
to install it it works well Shanda
devups is no software raid it's a
practice it's the culture so that you
would be setting up any of the companies
that we're looking so for the tools
definitely the tools comes in with the
different flavors and they have their
own requirements so based on the
requirements you have to go through
document from two that you are trying to
set up okay and this can figure out how
much amount of resources are required
for any of the system okay so there is
no thumb rule for that if you're talking
of general beams that I'm using here for
demo purposes my system is a GB system
it is 2.4 gigahertz I fight for system
and I can speed up almost 20 different
machines on it you can see there are a
lot of machines and I can start all of
them at once and I will still not have
any of the drive on the machine so that
should be sufficient so I have some
hands up here it's Wilson EEP I am
unloading you if you have the question
you can ask is the being covered in the
DevOps course from a Judaica do you
cover the latest technologies like
docker and kubernetes
ok
during the other tools we started with
Jenkins cover a few network concepts
DHCP DNS setup Zod and if it's
functioning as cotton spoil and then we
jump to Jenkins setting it up with a
sphere and get both of them are covered
and get to this co-editor very dust
practical decisions in doing system is
developed in the lab spectacles
finalization so that you know a complete
code flow how it moves through things
for the strip thing because we're Python
and bash strictly from virtualization
point of view we cover Xen KVM then
VirtualBox also game there so that have
covered from time to kind of
virtualization from type one there is a
hardware limitation so we cover only a
part you will not see the systems like
AWS or fokin stack setup all from the
scratch that will not be unfortunately
that cannot became giving classes but
currently covered on that ok thank you
Alicia so I have another hand raised
here mr. muñoz Raju I would be unmoving
you if you have any questions you may
ask okay so can you hear me now yeah so
concept to all our new officers who will
it be specific to the customer or will
it be specific to the testing engineers
or and it will be specific to alpha how
the picture comes there it is not
specific to any of the streams that will
be wrong to everything is being taught
from scratch again so there have been
many people who belong to different
different streams like we have got
testers we have got people who are just
no
everything okay I mean so we are talking
about the entire concept of DevOps so in
that suppose we part of which is going
to be implementing the DevOps concept
only inside R &amp;amp; D inside aren t okay
only inside and then when it can be
packed into a CD it can be forgiven us
downloads can be any other thing so how
we train it has been starter and how it
will be focused in future
see DevOps is not a product it will not
change what you are delivering to the
customers when you transition your
company or product to be made on top of
debuffs kind of process it is a process
that that they are implementing so it
will speed up your internal development
process plus the value that it adds to
the testing and the world of good that
you develop that would be enhanced okay
the process starts from the developer
machine itself and step by step you go
on words or you automate the stuff
towards production it does not start
from other way arm it starts from the
web machine it goes to the production
systems and to the clients what we
deliver is good value in terms of speed
response times better done wrong times
better response times but then that's
what the end product is for the yo
Christ okay so that's what DevOps this
years so it's process that we are
setting okay so I have another I see how
the hand raised here mr.chandu shaking
I'm meeting you you may ask your
question to continue with that previous
question which sure he asked so probably
the Christmas when you're moving into
divorces see I was involved in this
total hdl-c and we were referencing
again Matata where they release what
small patches of code every time and it
will be tested and go back to the
production and again we'll introduce new
code so it's like raising scripts in
patches small patches on so let's we
won't if we're moving it to develop so
so how we do differently you know how
this would be done it's what difference
it will make because we're already
opposite when you make is a yoga
know what I'm saying
already what we are doing this we are
introducing you mean developing
something small and it will be tested
immediately and it will be more to
production and again we not do the small
development and so this will be a cycle
I think this is almost that works what
you are saying so in this if we are
going to hand out to DevOps what
difference if you make or how what are
the things we need to do well the
difference will be currently you are
developing something in small chunks and
then you test it okay so you are
actually repeating the SDS you know the
deviation of SDS is as DLC is short if I
understand your question right correct
yeah right so here in DevOps we are not
repeating the HDL see we are doing badly
we have the stuff we are doing the stuff
in parallel manner see your requirement
gathering plus your development and your
testing all is done in parallel the the
major impact where DevOps will help us
see our testing is generally done at the
very end
unless rantin you've never given up test
right but what if if you continuously
develop keep on developing and you
forget about testing if you forget about
testing and leave testing to the
machines you can save a lot of time
during that phase which is almost a
Google into development 50% and 50% of
tests interpret idea cases so if you can
save the time by implementing this stuff
on machines
that's where develop the most can bring
value to your assistants so we do we're
doing this same paddle what I mean is if
I am writing a single line of code and I
am ready to commit that single line of
code should go get test get bit okay
then we are not talking about complete
features here we are talking of
continuous deployment or sorry
continuous development anything that the
developer is ready to commit should go
through the entire process without even
worrying about who is going to district
who
boy who's going to do it later on okay
that should happen continuously
automatically that's what they was help
you with so this is basically the
automation of further testing not
exactly it is one of the part of divorce
so yes so when we develop a line of code
that will be immediately evaluated or a
tester that's what you say in the
development itself
so once the development is completed
you'll be testing complete it out
yes of course you cannot remove the
possibility of manual testing it has to
be there but anything that you can
automate you should be able to automate
yeah the reason I'm asking is we are
already using Sdn and SVN I my
understanding is version control - right
and we already used that
so we using the Sdn itself to make cover
no process develops or what I'm saying
is yes we are here for automating the
things s when does not impart any
automation it is just history storage it
will store your history and it will
simply track who did what
it wouldn't automatically thing okay so
when we use a package of these all these
tools then it will become and then it
develops will be implemented yeah but
it's all up to you whether you use tools
or whether you go the transcripts okay
okay fine thank you you're welcome
so I have a new person here from Danish
any predict results from our perspective
from your perspective that would help us
in understanding our sahjhan
understanding the course better well I
already answered that
Denisha I hope you got that so I do not
need any research from you guys and
listen you just to understand what the
complete I key thing is what happens in
the company okay and we'll be
concentrating on how to automate that
and all the skills would be taught to
you from scratch so you don't have to
worry you can meet from any background I
have another question here well he says
that so mr. Amin says so TDD and BDD is
a part of divorce as well
well a myth can you please help me
understand what TDD and BDD is what do
you mean by that if you want to talk you
can also raise your hand yes
redeeming space travel under test driven
development years so when we are talking
of automation testing variable talking
automation has a very first we can
definitely indicate that using some shed
case or substance but you should have
some test cases that is the first point
so test driven development is one of the
chunks of complete divorce process if
you won't have given under development
or you don't have automation tests in
first place that count import better
value to your complete divorce process
because the thing is ultimately you need
to deploy something on production and
unless and until your show very much
sure that everything has been properly
tested you cannot deploy tried and we
don't need to have
automated sorry manual steps in between
the computer automation system that's
why this can definitely be a part of the
maps I have another question here what's
the major difference between population
chef well both of them are configuration
management systems puppet did it first
chef did it better
both of them are in Ruby but the
difference only is the way they are
implemented and the features that they
have for public so the interfaces on
both of these tools are different okay
but the underlying architecture has one
on the same so there is no big major
difference you can go that any one of
these whatever whatever you like we have
another question here Satish asks that
may I know what the work of competition
chef and what is the difference between
is - well the work is the same it
manages the configuration when I talk of
managing the configuration it will
configure the machines that means
physical boxes for you according to your
requirements
okay so let us say we have your spinning
up new machine and that machine has to
be configured for deploying your code
now usually you would be setting up all
the software's like I am doing right now
I am setting up SVN and it is taking me
a lot of time right so instead of
wasting my time here on sitting of SVN I
could probably write a script that will
do that for me and that the script could
be written very well in pocket of chef
okay and potentially can configure that
stuff for me all by themselves without
even me best even a lot of time I have
in the stuff I think that's what Papa
deanship would be used for so we have
another question from Mirage
are there any tools available for
continuous integration of database cool
oh that's interesting
with data be schooled I do have to do
some manual tweaking like some manual
suffice to be done along with automation
not all of the databases will be nice
with continuous changes ok the schema
changes not always favorable and not
always see I cannot suggest you to make
the changes for databases continuously
there are a few fun rules that has to be
taken care of like deletion of fields
should not happen most of the times if
they are done you will have to take care
that the scripts are written for that
and everything goes along with code so
your code and database changes should go
hand in hand for the works to implement
on relational databases for
non-relational databases like caps
internal or Big Data you can reduce the
changes according to your DevOps
architecture there you won't have to
worry about continuous integration of
these things they can easily be handled
as you handle the good for the
applications using Oracle specifically
I'm not sure about that be a rescue
thing but definitely that should be
something like dubbing an SQL file which
can be committed into your s field and
if it can be accommodated in class vl'
you can prepare a tool that can
implement the same SQL over different
databases but definitely there has to be
a thumb rule on what you implement and
when you okay
like setting up indexes in between busy
day is not a good decision to make of
course it can be done but it will
definitely result in a few minutes of
content it's not a few seconds thread so
that's completely up to you how to form
your application or not choose to deal
with the particular problem does it
answer your question inertia thank you
we have another question from universe
Roger
I'm already part machine violent release
deeper instruction and corporal extra
should I mean as well if you say so
not only the tools
the transition be stuff that is required
for a company to move from
non-negotiables along with that you also
covering up the cultural stuff that is
required for a property box transition
and today Webster building hotel of
speeds structural changes that are
required for the company to go through
and of course the tools for different
phases in DevOps okay thank you thank
you very much
can you put some line between
differences between the doctor and
containers well
containers are the building block of a
software software that uses containers
to remove forces continues and isolated
units that depends on your underlying
kernel architecture that is generally
common across different Linux flavors so
keeping away the the features would use
the condo that his system uses and on
top of it it would be running a few
processes in isolation that means the
process would be using the underlying
resources but it cannot disturb the
resources that have been used by any
other system any other process so
usually what happens in production is
generally we have one store dedicated to
one single process so instead of having
a complete optimal system with all its
processes and running memory management
and systems all those things running
from which generally a twenty to forty
percent of the resources by the
operating system itself and on top of it
you see I simply run one single cell
would like DNS or DHCP that usually
takes one single process thread so it
doesn't make sense to waste all the
resources in only a spinning up an
operating system okay that's container
system if you do not speed up an
operating system you're here worried
about getting the resources only one
single process executes
so that's the benefit of international
people are moving from virtual machines
through Felicity's doctor is an
application that uses containers they
are not on the same platform continuous
were there since the beginning it it
started off with Solaris when they
started creating parallel operating
systems okay and then it moved to Lennox
and they started creating Alexa
containers with them and using those
Alexa containers doctor is using those
the lexicon dream is to provide you with
isolation between the processes that's
what it is does it answer your question
of it we have another question here from
Satish she was for embedded systems how
can you use either chef or puppet he has
knowledge embedded under lease and was
already trained on it is there any
chances that we can use either ship
definitely puppet is being covered up in
the course I'm not sure what chef but if
you get hold of puppet you can
definitely do the confusion management I
have a question from Dinesh what DevOps
can be managed platform not just to be
it for example I need to create a VM
width of the WebSphere application
server internets skills ever dated is
2012 on it yeah definitely
the do that you'll be using for business
event or chef anything that you would be
using okay that's what I'm saying that I
am currently installing SQL on my system
and while I'm doing this I'm trapping a
lot of things this from that you can
simply create a strip that will spin a
machine for you install the software is
on top of it and get the system ready
for there accusing okay so you don't
have to configure this trick all by
yourself you can do it once right a
strip for it and the tools can take care
of it free you can even create an image
that will have the software installed an
employee can create as many copies as he
want
so that can be achieved with dibs we
have another question here from mr.
Chandra Shekar are there any tools that
are used in DevOps
feebler yes a sphere is one most of the
tools in divorce let people use these
days our figures they are available as
open source systems let me tell you a
few that there are open source versions
of chef about Jenkins a sphere it is
also the source not use which is
Mountain software is open source the one
we'll be covering edges as well a
different session for logging and log
analysis log stash is open source for
data storage your castle is open source
post basis open source so major a team
of software that will be covering up but
all of the software that we are covering
up here in the course our concepts and
they are feeding use people do you have
any move pushes coming you're welcome so
I I think link an hour wind up for the
day most of the questions have been
answered if you still have any questions
you can get back to us
hung me with the support systems that we
have okay he can correct us on the means
you can connect with the people add I
did it I think he can help you out with
the stuff or you can forward your bushes
that you want me to answer okay so can
definitely help you understand the
constructs that haven't been covered so
definitely it is bound to replace the
traditional SDLC people are giving up
their SDLC they're taking up different
approaches like rapid application ever
mix up different models except residency
pardon all of them can be implemented in
HJ in divorce okay so that's how we'll
be doing things these days with the
boxes well so when you leave there is
going to be a small survey you can fill
up the things if you like this session
yeah and your answers have speed he
pushes me around until he can fill up a
survey for us so that we can do next
time for the classes that will be
starting on August 8th I will be taking
up the glass from the 8th of August that
is coming that is coming big for Ganesh
this was free thanks a lot for attending
this session will be winding it up in so
if you still have any questions you can
still post it here and here for another
7 minutes and I will answer to your
wishes now I have a question here from
mr. Reddy clover is also part of DevOps
it's cloud is a part of divorce it is a
infrastructure that tourists just to
infrastructure support say if you don't
have any physical infrastructure of
you're sick and tired from the cloud but
the divorce processes are going to be
one of the same either one is the
machines one figure eight on the px okay
the rest of the things will be same only
the part the scalings you have been
considered where you scale up the
system's horizontally at a minutes
notice leaves can be scaled very rapidly
physical boxes cannot that's the only
plus point of cloud it's also cheap we
have questions from mr. Chandra Shekar
is there any specific tool for
automating the testing well there are a
lot of tools that are used for
automating the tests now based on which
language you use there might be a
different test suit that you might use
I have a question from mr. Linares
review does shrimp
support only outer deployment of the
application or we can do any Windows
installation and run the historic we can
do any we lose MSI installation using
English and it supports most of the
operating systems that'll be used in
production these days okay
only problem with shelf is that the the
core installation of Sheriff has to be
done on 64-bit much Lanice machine ok
and these days the code that is requires
the kernel that it requires is 3.2 so
you need to make sure that the ship
server is installed
chef plans can be installed on all the
there is no question from of this I have
been our shield 7 including storage hcve
and what would be the cupboard concept
except these well I'm not specifically
covering any of the Linux operating
systems but only the part that is
required for implementing the tools and
carrying out your state for the
operation so then it CVA not that any of
these concepts here except that we'll be
covering the tools that's the main goal
of the course
another question is just the DevOps
development requires testing phase
well yes testing is an integral phase of
compute sdlc cycle right so testing
cannot be left out of the verbs it has
to be automated so that people do not
waste time testing the things when we
are committing thousand times a day
let's say a team of 20 people is
committing later today it is going to be
200 times ok so people cannot keep on
continuously testing the things 200
times it has to the automatism his
network a part of divorce this is
question asked why mister this machine
yes networking is part of the box but
not networking at the level of Cisco
people OCC
people will be covering sometimes it's
like DNS DHCP setting up the things
providing IP addresses what are some
nests and how they'll transfer how to
set up things and set up the levels
between the machines so that they can
talk between one another we also will be
covering up the stuff like setting up
firewalls and server hard me okay so
that is what is going to be covered up
it's good to know information for a
tables professional but if you have a
dedicated team that works on it okay you
don't worry about it you can get two
things done
we have another question here for chef
only supports two different machines
diplomat for free right and limitations
on there are limitations with the
license that's the business that's the
way they carry out business if you are
willing to use chef you will have to
paid pay for it well this is true with
puppet as well I'm not sure if any of
the system out there that helps you do
this orchestration for M number of
machines for complete free of cost for
that but that's the way these people
carry on their businesses but one last
thing I just want showing the system
that we did here installed SVN it
actually works
the
question here it's rice question when
the divorce will help in updating the
dependencies when the code is released
well this is a really nice question it
generally works engineers doing the
maintenance fields that can be done that
can really be controlled very nice
fashions where you can set up primary
and secondary system looking on the
secondary ones then move the dates and
changes onto the primary in a very
controlled fashion and puppet can help
you do exactly that
but what you are to do human chef has a
provision for rolling out the
dependencies later on with the coding
for example like the example that you've
said it suppose if a table structure
that is used in script is updated of
course you can do the changes on fly not
just some first I've been changed but
you can also roll out the strip's that
can fire some commands on the systems
and meet them in line according to your
requirements are doing the car after the
deployment whatever the case like it can
be done of this asks that was the
duration of the course and fees for the
course well of this it is already
mentioned on the website and I think I
might not be the right person to
regarding the kind of issues to people
or the website for more and the question
is how does the code they were ping and
testing is done family on the box see
let us say let us take an example that
we have a spin is and there is Jenkins

Jenkins seasoned software that handles
your automation stuff and SVM is the
software that helps you with getting the
history of anything that is being
developed right so I am a developer I am
committing one small feature that has to
be tested later on
and I'm going to release it right so I'm
committing it to the sphere Jenkins will
sense the things that are making changes
to a sphere once the change is received
on subversion or get on CBS or anything
that you use Jenkins will pull the code
from this VM it will test it check it
for syntax build it again when all these
steps are right there is no error in it
it will send me an email that everything
is okay and the code is ready to be
deployed now it can be an automated step
or a manual step if it is automated
Jenkins will trigger automatic
deployment for the change that I have
just committed okay and that happens
continuously there is no one who's
sitting there to test the code so for
testing you need to have automation
tests in case you can also have tests
like checking for syntax or preparing
the documentation later on it can be
automated in a single pipeline okay and
since I am only talking of one single
change there might be 20 different
people who are committing at 20
different times and they don't have to
wait for my testing to complete everyone
can work in parallel right so that's how
the Box can help you achieve the things
in parallel every developer has got its
has got their own instance and attention
from the develop DevOps system and they
feel that they are the only one using it
so we have one of the questions where
can we find the recordings of the
current session well I'm not sure but it
has to be there on the website or you
will get it in a mail from a director if
not you can connect with them you can
definitely get this recording it is it
is being recorded and it should be
shared with you
all right so I think you've already
exceeded our time by a half an hour
holla mangalsutra three minutes it was
nice having you people here it really
felt good answering your questions I
hope you have a great time ahead and
great career so I leave you here with no
have a great day thank you for attending
