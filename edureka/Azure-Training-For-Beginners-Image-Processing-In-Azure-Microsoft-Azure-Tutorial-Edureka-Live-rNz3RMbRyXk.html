your instructor for today welcome to
this live session on Azure in the next
twenty to twenty-five minutes we'll be
learning how we can do image processing
in Azure using cognitive services now
don't be scared with the title guys I
know big words like cognitive and image
processing are there but it's pretty
simple and it's very interesting to
learn now let me share the light on the
processing that we are going to do today
so say we will going to upload an image
with say five people right so we're
going to see what are the ages of those
five people or what is the hair color of
those five people in the image and how
are they feeling in the means are they
happy or are they sad it's all these
kind of processing we are going to learn
today how we can do it with Azure cloud
all right so having said that guys let's
start with today's session and before
that I would like to know what is the
background of you guys like what is the
background of the people that I'm
teaching today so that I know how much
depth I should be teaching today right
so please comment that in your comment
box and I say this in every session of
mine that let's make this session as
interactive as possible so so that it's
in the benefit of both of us
right and any questions that you have
during the session you can comment it in
the comment section and my team is there
if they'll be happy to answer you
alright so with that guys let's start
with today's session and move on to our
agenda to understand what are we
learning today
so I can see that Pritam Raj is a system
admin Shawn is from computer science
Pranav is from BTech CSE alright guys so
you all guys are from technical
background
alright so I will try to keep this
session as simple as possible so that it
gets in sync with every every viewer of
us right so let's move on to the agenda
so we'll start off our session by first
discussing what is Microsoft Azure so
for those of you who don't know what as
the others we'll be discussing what is
Microsoft Azure and after that we move
on to Azure cognitive services right now
under a cognitive sources we have a
bunch of api's which we'll be using to
do the image processing today so those
are the visual API is right so we'll be
discussing all the visual ApS which are
there and towards the end we'll be doing
a demo wherein will be making use of all
the api's that are present and see how
we can implement it in our code all
right so guys this is our agenda or I
hope it's clear to you right so let's
start off with a session now with the
first topic that is Microsoft Azure
cloud so what is Microsoft Azure exactly
so as your is a product from Microsoft
which deals in cloud services right so
it's a service created by Microsoft
which we can use to build to test to
deploy and to manage application in the
Azure cloud now how we can do it how it
actually happens is like this that
instead of using your own infrastructure
for hosting our application you are
using someone else's infrastructure in
this case Microsoft's infrastructure
right and you can end this term or end
this rent out with that with video
Microsoft provider at anytime you want
say after two hours you don't need those
servers anymore
right so you can end that term after to
us or if you if you would like to use it
for say six months you can end it after
six months right so the good thing in
this is is that there is no long term
commitment that you have to give right
and the other thing is you don't have to
buy any servers you can use it as long
as you want right so this is what
as your cloud is all about now as well
has a lot of services guys it has the
compute services it has database
services it has storage services now
among them I'm going to discuss about
the very very important services that
and the very new services that have been
introduced by Microsoft Azure which are
called the cognitive services right so
what are cognitive services so cognitive
services are machine learning API is by
Microsoft Azure so they are a bunch of
very cool ApS that you can use to
extents to extend to give an extension
to your already existing project for
example you have a project which deals
with text analysis right so you take up
a string and you do operations on it now
see I have Microsoft I go on with
Microsoft Azure and I try to use the
visual API with Microsoft Azure so with
visual API I have this option that I can
convert the handwritten text to string
to printed text alright so this gives my
project and extension that it also
includes inputs such as images which
have text written in it alright so with
that your project get gets one more
feature and that too at a minimum your
minimum effort right because just with
10 or 12 lines of code you have actually
included one more feature which if you
would have developed by yourself would
have taken around thousand or two
thousand lines of code right image
processing is a very daunting task but
with Azure it has become very simple
right so we are going to discuss the
cognitive services today moving on guys
now under cognitive services like I said
we'll be doing image processing right so
image processing is all about visuals so
in cognitive services will be discussing
the visual api's now what are those
visual API is let's look at that so
there are three kind of visual API is in
Azure you have the vision API you have
the face API and then you have the
emotion API so what is vision API so
vision API basically gives you a
description of whatever uploading right
it gives you a it proforms analysis on
that image as a whole it doesn't it
doesn't focus on a particular element
right it doesn't
on the image on the whole and gives you
a description a text description of what
that image is for example I upload a
portray of say a city right there city
and there are landmarks and there is a
there are a lot of lights so it analyzes
each and every aspect and gives me a
descriptive text of what that and image
is all about right so this is what the
vision API is all about next we have the
face API so what is phase II P I so face
API basically deals with particular
thing right it deals with faces so
unlike vision API which deals with the
whole of the image face API likes to
focus on the faces and it gives you a
description of the facial features which
are there for example what is the color
of the hair of the person right or where
is the face actually located in the
image right it gives you the pixel
locations so all of that is possible
using the face API next up we have the
emotion API which actually deals with
the feelings of how that particular
person in the image is dealing with
right so for example that person is
smiling right so emotionally API detects
that a person is smiling and gives you a
confidence rate or a probability of what
are the probability that the person in
the image is actually happy or what is
the probability that the person in the
image is actually said right and vince's
this kind of data you can actually
decide what what is actually happening
in the image right so these are all
extensions which you can use in your
code and give an a boost to your already
existing project all right so having
said that guys enough talks let's go on
and see how we can actually use these
services in the azure cloud all right so
moving ahead guys let's go to my as your
dashboard so for using these services
you can use them for free as well if you
don't have as your account you can
actually go on and type in Google that
you say the vision API subscription
right and it can give you the
subscription for free as well but I have
the Azure dashboard and for people who
are older
however as your dashboard you can go
here and click on search and type in
cognitive services as I was saying
you'll go to your Azure dashboard and
you will go to the search box and say
cognitive services right cognitive and
you will right you will click on here
right so once you click here you will
get this page wherein you can you can
see all the cognitive services you have
deployed so as of now I have not
deployed any cognitive services and so
I'll click on add write and then I'll go
down and I look at the vision EPS that I
have to work with right so in cognitive
services you can see there are speech
api's there are linguistic KPIs you have
Search API and others as well but today
we'll be focusing on the vision API so
I'll click on computer vision API right
and I click on create once I do that you
have to give a name for the API now so
let's give it the name as vision
underscore one right and now it's asking
me for the subscription so it's
pay-as-you-go right pricing tier you can
choose what you want one more thing guys
if you have just signed in for Azure you
can see that there's a free tier option
that will be enabled for you but for me
since I have exhausted my free tier I
can only go for pay-as-you-go all right
then you have the option of choosing
your resource group right so resource
group is basically your group of
resources wherein so if you have a bunch
of resources you can easily handle them
if you merge them in a group right so
this is what resource group is all about
so I can create a new resource group
saying say cognitive right and then I
can check I confirm I have read the note
this below alright and I can pin it to
dashboard and that is it or this these
are all the settings that you have to do
I'll click on create and it will take
some seconds and that is it
Awesome's my computer vision API is now
being deployed while it is being
deployed let's deploy our other API as
well
so I'll click on cognitive services I'll
click on ADD let's add a face shape API
now so I click on create same processor
guys nothing is different I'll click
here I'll give this name as face
underscore 1 alright same settings
pricing tier and then the resource group
so I've already created a resource group
saying cognitive so let me select that
right and I'll check this and I'll pin
it to dashboard and click on create so
like I said it will take some seconds
and it will be deployed now again let me
go back and click on community services
again and now I'll deploy a vision API
sorry emotion API right so I'll click on
emotion API I'll click on create I'll
give it the name as emotion underscore
one break pricing tier as we did before
resource group what we already created
cognitive I'll check it and pin it - 4
and click on create so this is that guys
there's nothing much to explain here you
just have to deploy your services that
is your API is in it and it's done now
once you've deployed your API is over
here guys then comes the best part that
is your code right so this is the code
which is available this is a sample code
guys if you want I can give it to you
also you can find it on the Microsoft
web page as well right
so first let's try and do the visual API
so let me open the visual project so
guys this is the vision API code now in
the code you have to change the
subscription key now let me tell you
where will you get the subscription key
so come back to your
- bored and go to your particular API
that you want the code to run for right
so I want the code to run for vision so
I'll go to my vision service right and I
click on these and here is the key guys
so you just have to copy it now you
might be wondering I showed you my key
but don't worry guys just after this
session ends I'll change my keys you can
actually regenerate your keys from here
right so let me copy my keys as of now
and paste them here right so this is the
code I'll paste my key here I save it
and that is it guys this is all you have
to configure now let me run this code
now
all right so you'll get a command box
like this and now you have to enter the
path name for your image right so I'll
show you the image in a while that I'm
trying to process so let me give the
path name so it's 1 2 3 4 5 dot jpg let
me check if it's the same yes it is so
that's it I hit enter it'll take some
time to process meanwhile let me show
you the image that I'm processing so
guys this is the image that I'm trying
to process and there are some penguins
right and now if the API works right it
should tell me that there are some
penguins which are standing somewhere
right so let's see if our API has been
executed so yes there it has been
executed now you will get the response
in this JSON kind of way guys and if you
look at the description here it is if
you can see so under captions under text
there is a thing called a punk penguin
standing in the water right so now if we
now it seems pretty simple but a machine
understanding an image is actually
commendable right so it understood that
there are penguins in the image first of
all it understood that it's an animal
now what kind of animal that there also
is understand that it's a penguin and
it's standing right so it gives you the
descriptive text of that particular
image now this was the vision API now
apart from this you there are a lot of
things that you can do like I said you
can also do text analysis you can also
use it as an OCR that is read text from
read printed text from image and convert
it into a string right and stuff like
that so this is what all about vision
API let's move ahead let me show you the
next API that is the emotion API now so
I'll go to my project and I run this all
right
now again the same processor guys you
have to change the keys so let me tell
you again you'll get the keys in your
dashboard you'll go to your dashboard
over here and you'll click on say I have
to do the emotion API now so I'll click
on emotion right I'll go to keys and
this is the key that I'll be copying and
let me paste it in my code which is here
alright let's save it and that is about
it guys so let me execute it now so it
has asking me the image part so I'll
give the image but and then I'll show
you the image so that you can see what
are we processing on so this is the path
of the image I'll hit enter and while
this is processing let me show you the
image so this is the image this is the
thumbnail that you saw in the beginning
right so this is the image that I'm
trying to process now as you can see
this person looks kind of surprised
right and kind of happy as well so let's
see if this process or the if my API
gave the same response so if you look at
the JSON
it says happiness is 0.14 sadness is a
junk value surprise so it is 85 percent
confident that this image has a person
who is surprised who is giving an
emotion which is surprised emotion all
right so this is cool
so this API works like a charm as well
now let me show you the third EPA which
is the face appear with the same image
now what we're trying to understand here
is how the three API has returned
different results for example my first
my vision API
gave me a result wherein it gave
description of the image right my second
API that was the emotion API gave me the
emotions of how the person how that
particular particular person was feeling
in that particular image right now this
particular API should give you the
facial features of of the person who is
there in the image right so again like I
said you have to change the keys so let
me go back to my dashboard click on face
API go to keys right click on copy come
back to my code and paste the key here
again all right so it's done I'll save
it and I'll run it alright so again it's
asking me for the impart of the image so
let me give the part of the image and we
are giving the same guys image again and
let's see what result we get so let me
show you the image again this is the
image that we are trying to process and
we are trying to detect what are the
facial features of this particular
person right so let's see all right so
I've got a result so to tells me if the
hair color is brown and as you can see
the color is brown of the year right and
what else we can see it can also tell me
whether the person is wearing glasses or
not so as you can see there are no
glasses here and it has given me the
result that there are no glasses for
this particular person this person has a
beard and you can see that the
probability of this person having a
beard is 0.9 which is great right and
the gender is male right so it has also
detected that this particular person's
sex is male right had it been a girl
there would have been no facial hair and
hence it would have been concluded that
it's a girl right but then everything
seems perfect all right
so this is cool guys so this API like I
said so you can use these API is in your
projects and with the help so the output
of this API is are in JSON context right
you can parse the JSON and get the
results that you want and pass it on to
your code already existing code and do
whatever operations you want right
so with that guys it ends in today's I
end that today's demonstration now thank
