drop of 21st century well in this
webinar we can find that out of course
using facts so Audrina is at the end of
the session you will be able to know why
data science is the mossad job sort of
the job in 2005 career opportunities
with data science advantages and
understands how companies are using
their time so that you can mold your
skill sets accordingly so data science
is a very vast domain and and and you
have to focus on certain areas if you
are string that's in most of the areas
when it assigns deals in so in that case
you want to land up being ve
jack-of-all-trades I'm so sorry my
throat is battery so probably have to be
heard this bad boys so why do science is
the most sort of the job in two zero one
five well let's see the answers fortune
hundred come please board the redesigns
flight so with it will send strengths
gain momentum legacy firms build updated
signs teams one let's get a scary pan
left okay so how many of those watching
Fortune hundred companies are actually
using these Alina scientists these
companies basically are using these
language for a certain very specific
tasks so I use one certain and specific
the reason is those tasks for enemies
you know already being done within those
organizations but be as since was not
data now they feel that the data is
really important and data has got a lot
of values they want would tap the Inc
the the all possible
you know breath lengthen breath of the
datasets and to analyze that they need a
data scientist which is probably one
step a couple of steps I had them data
analyst now what kind of work would lead
a sense to data scientist doing it comes
like that so I'm a data scientist I've
been working in this industry for last
six years okay of course before then
before however actually give this term
quadratus itis I've been doing the job
let me tell you the kind I mean the kind
of transition on singing in the
industries is humongous
and transitional space specifically
related to do in a science and billing
update assigns team now for example
weddings to work with the IBM long back
we were to suppose think about
delivering some analytics at certain for
certain client so what we would do is we
would look at the data and put that in
our IBM SPSS or our at the time or SAS
and do certain inbuilt operations well
that's because we do not have the entire
knowledge of how we could know go across
different kind of data sets and that's
when we start figuring out that we could
actually process all those data sets I
mean like the videos you already host
the PDFs and so on and so forth I
thought we could use that in assets and
a caching starting knowledge since for
example how many people will take leave
in the next three months just builds on
the conversations undid the chat
conversations that has big big big jump
for us because we could then figure out
what's gone what sorry you guys do you
want to look like so that was one big
reason of course we still we still you
know predict I still used to predict
before the advent of clear signs that
how many people are actually going to
take leave but also all based on
inclusion and on data this time because
support with data then now what could be
the other reason that these
organizations have started using data
science
well they've seen for example the use
case for for a particular organization
that deals with IP addresses so IP
address IP properties okay the
intellectual properties so they wanted
to see how many research papers that are
coming in in every month coming them are
actually useful and they would want to
find out first 100 which are useful and
that was a great thing because that was
a great idea because that would lead to
better quality of white papers or
research papers so what they did rather
than asking their scientists to actually
go to
research papers use your science now the
exercise that used to get completed and
round about a month time takes a couple
of hours that's a huge you jump because
then because you could use those use
those sinus was a more meaningful now
second is analysts get actually been
left so we see how how the salaries have
gone up that's within USM and any other
in in bandulu air or in Mumbai or in
Pune
so tops expected jobs in the stick here
in the u.s. well in the tech see in the
tech market video game designer is the
highest-paid guy I'll even compare it
with a software engineer to Google
a guy with a game we look him design
capabilities in Nvidia or you know or EA
Sports would make far more money than
anyone second was data scientists have
seen a projected growth of 18.7%
sustainability constant consultant solar
saves concept in social media vanishes a
wind turbine mechanic engine is now one
good thing is that the other guys are
the guys were making good money are
actually from this environmental
background that's good that's good for
us but in the ideal job I mean in the IP
when I say idea I also include the
analytics are all simply the development
that goes wrong so I basically I would
say computer software data scientist is
the high speed jobs if I compare it to
video game designer if I compare it to
trading algorithm guy if I compare it to
investment banker a hedge funds hedge
fund analyst so all them they make
morning and more money than they did a
scientist but eventually what you've
seen is all of them have started using
some or the other kind of data science
concepts so it means that is actually
going to jump all over those particular
kind of rows and probably become the
highest-paid job in the industry not
just Indian dust you gonna say
not just me I need industry in fact any
kind of job
data science would probably become the
hottest possible skill of the market so
there are scientists ice salaries for
Ezek us so if you look at this little
valley side the h1 filings but to 0 81
and you know sent this average beat cell
he was 104 thousand then some in the V
in Texas and you know Dallas area is I
think it seems anchor 61,000 a number of
estrogen feelings with 29 if you look at
the eastern side salad is again on the
high side but that's more with the
inside in front people working on more
of Epidemiology so they are more
specific kind of people and then on the
not silence again around 65,000 so the
rain is 16,000 200,000 of course the one
with 16,000 0 action or data scientists
in most cases the post is a misnomer for
example if you go on LinkedIn you'll see
that so many people are you know so many
people say that they didn't scientist
but they actually have been working in
in QA or in you know 4 nrn software
development for the last 10 15 years in
the certain star coins themselves as
either scientist so that isn't hell so
let's look at the median salaries now 94
K which is probably you know on high
side if you look at that way million
salary needed six twenty one thousand
rupees which is not create but still
okay and I can tell you people
definitely and much more than that much
much more than that if you look at if
you look at the total pay kind of a
thing in u.s. its
ranging from sixty three sixty five to
one three seven five six everything
these are a bit obsolete numbers or in
fact they are not correctly bound to the
right technical scientists I think I
think it's about it's not in the range
of 150 if you're a good data scientist
with a good understanding of AI and mmm
so let's decode what is data science so
data science is the study of extraction
of knowledge from data it includes
wearing elements machine learning
computer
America's visualization pattern
recognition and data engineering so I'll
call it information part of machine
learning only and I'll call machine
learning and pattern recognition a part
of computer programming only okay I
don't call computer programming machine
learning and / - pattern a combination a
part of data engineering and I'll call
visualization machine learning computer
programming pattern recognition power of
data engineering I would add one more
skill which is domain expertise so guy
with experience in epidemiology would
you would be much better than a guy I'm
not better but it would be much
different to a guy who comes in from a
background of insurance of canals right
both of them are in a scientists but
it's not that he can swap these two guys
and add them to each other's work it's
not possible new designs practitioners
they are scientists okay so we've got
statisticians domain is he coming here
or time fencing are those programmers
yeah so I would say a data scientist is
a guy who could who knows how to use
staffs with the middle is or 'litham who
knows how to code the new Gotham apply
that to a logic and make it presentable
that's just a guess I this guy now
Russell Gotham stats program doing it
all applies to what data it all applies
to data that means you should also have
the skill set in to to know how to
manage data so it could be big data in
case if it's really Dutch so he needs to
have skills on big in a programming if
there is not huge if it's really sparse
they should know how to optimize your
since the data is again let's say huge
but it also has a variety that means you
should know certain lab is ritual which
could be used in order to you know take
whatever is there in in files with
different kind of formats Starsky
modeling and technical aptitude business
acumen programming data warehousing and
business intelligence okay I would say
be I ended up warehousing probably are
not that important you should know the
set of skills you should know how to
how do you use it you should know how to
massage it so when I say it's not
important but it does not mean you
should not you know you should not aim
to have that skill of course you can and
you should also know sequel if you know
sequel that's like sequel is might be
basically you know the basic building
block of criticize listen still said you
know architecture programming when
programming is is it's not that you need
to be a programmer to develop an
application think of a case where you're
developing you're solving a problem on a
dataset and you come up with a let's say
a partial differential equation so it
could be a case where you can't solve it
partial differential equation within the
system or within within within a
paradigm of a copy or a pen right so
you've probably need to know how to code
that thing in order to solve that
problem
next is business acumen well business
acumen is settling upon that's pretty
much problem as to what domain
experiences start still modeling and
technical aptitude so starts the
modeling is by far the most important
part so if you aspire to become as great
a scientist you've got to take courses
in stats that's like that's like really
really important then you've got job
Rose this is Ireland's data analyst data
scientist Julie data scientist decision
scientists so business analyst is pretty
much the same kind of guy you bed with
you know business unless the other ones
would collect data put that in the next
cell bring some reports close it close
and I'm not with business and come up
with an answer
data analyst again I think other guys
who probably would not be so close to
business but what stood between some
something or the other on the data sets
probably smaller data sets we talk about
decision scientists and here scientists
so what exactly could be the set of
terms you know referring to here I mean
what is it assigned as one of the
decisions are this honest is being I
think both of them are pretty much same
guys but and in a sentence also need to
be you know Sally with with larger data
management which could be potentially
big data and and you know a large scale
machine learning and all that a
different scientists the one I'm sorry
who is who's like super smart star
exam bottoms and knows how one of a
number which could be decisive in taking
a decision so that's more of a decision
at this I would say I stats every guy is
a decision I just programming I mean I'm
you know a platform I'm a guy but starts
at cause is a data scientist so
advantages of the designs descriptive
analytics diagnostic analytics
predictive analytics prescriptive
analytics and what you see is basically
a optimization process optimization
evaluation
okay so prescriptive analytics what in
the world could be prescriptive right if
it's not written or what in the world
could be predictable if it's not
diagnostic and what could be diagnostic
if it's not descriptive so what it means
here is we've already raised its first
of all we decide define what dataset is
what are its bounty is what are the Year
description smart 30 receptions and what
is the quartile range what is this a
correlation what is the summary what is
the median mode dollar blah blah blah
then we can figure out what could the
reasons we can find the correlation of
the systems now using all this
information we can actually figure out
what will happen let's say you want to
you want to ensure that you want to see
whether a particular set of people in
your snow bank are they going to be at
NP that means a non-performing assets
well you can do like seeing a print of
analytics training for all those guys
but what if I asked you to ensure that
90% of your accounts are not MPA so in
that case you have to apply 1 1 layer of
logic about printing of analytics which
will be prescriptive that means how can
you make that happen
ok one tinges of little sense meaning it
flows more proactive detection using
petrov analytics machining so see this
particular diagram it's fine it's middle
into fraud one biggest area in which
machine learning is now being used is
customer behavior they want to figure
out how customer behaves so that they
could make the best offers they could
put things which they would probably
want to buy they could figure out what
their son is gonna look like they could
see how much tax are they gonna pay all
that thing can actually help us identify
Oh
dreams of a customer which could help us
serve our customers better because no
could be one company could discuss no
could be on national guy group of guys
whatever one of the very strongly used
strongly implementable area of the
designs is Florida I worked in for
analytics and what am i endeavor was too
sorry
one of my endeavor was to find out
whether whether whether a particular
person was trying to make a transaction
is that a lien finder is that particular
domination illegal or not now think of
it in this case how fast you need to
make the decision because the
transaction is not going to be you know
a whole day process a guys wanna make a
transaction I hinted in sure how we can
do that of course I had one particular
you know one particular alien which
fraud was actually fraud was third
analytics was used and left for a short
duration of time but then we have the
problem and to be able to solve that
problem was a big challenge plus if you
saw the problem you save millions for
your actions each year right so just
imagine if you could do that why would
an organization not be happy to be one
few hundred thousand dollars if we can
make them save hundred you know millions
of dollars a year dealers in scary part
guys let me spin some water science for
your path so let's see the job
opportunity so let's not think about
something behind before in July one two
so that the term actually was coined by
a beach party who was actually a member
of our business group also at the time
how it actually came up with this
concept called I read a scientist I was
Tom actually
and since then it's been a buzzword and
growing OKL everyone wants we data
scientist now it is why does it mean
actually big difference we have bring in
some logical difference to your
organization
okay so if you see the trend it's
claimed you know going up I mean the
zeros from indeed calm and currently
person is growth is a thousand which is
super huge major companies using your
signs that means made you come means
hiring dinners and this is our Amazon
Honda then Walmart
Bank of America all the social networks
they're intelligent so many of them not
just these that so many of them they are
doing it so her good data scientists
what good clear your lying ahead of you
real life application let's think about
it so BMW is using printer magnetics to
find a place to park so what they're
doing is basically looking at looking at
the cars the car you know plots and
based on that they are able to find out
based on the history they're able to
find out whether a parking place would
be would be available or not okay so
let's see you start at home and you put
up a lets you use a GPS you put your
final location at at let's say BMW
office whatever so that could tell you
that you'll not find a place to park
even there are some vacant places that's
and that would probably help you see if
some of the time because if you let's
say you don't get a parking in a
particular office then you sometimes
have to take you I mean you have to come
back maybe you search for another
building which probably normal same Lane
and so on and so forth so please think
it's nothing but pritam algorithms
that's what that ecommerce there and
they are using a big time big big big
time
Flipkart Amazon both of them so for
example if you would flip card first of
all you have to finish all that what
every customer is looking for that
should be made available to that to the
customer in next 25 seconds if it cannot
show the required product to the
customer the ring so you have seconds
the customer is most likely not to buy
it
okay so then you ensure that what
customer would probably land a buying
okay
that is one second if this pic shows if
someone bought Barajas
they are most likely you know they've
also bought carrots
I even think of it this way I'll you go
to youtube.com and you search for a
video let's say Tom Cruise now now there
is another guy or they said of guys
who's who's you know who's history on
YouTube is pretty much similar to yours
and that guy so we don't
Tom Cruise and then jumped over yon on
Tom Hanks so you might see you may like
talking about Tom Hanks okay a video
Dominic's application of their designs
companies use me focus my collision
repeat business simple as that so so
basically you could figure out who could
be your customer for example we've got
leads in the system right you know what
it lead lean is something that can
convert into a potential that is a
potential customer and they can finally
convert into customer if we take care of
them and provide them the required
things so for any CRM based organization
who have a good understanding of their
leads
they could use gain science in order to
predict something that deals with their
customer acquisition so maybe for
example let's say you are coming that's
here that sells CRM business to you know
to big clients and you know that let's
say a particular kind of customer has an
issue where has an issue where has some
kind of issue XYZ now you can use data
science to figure out someone when X Y Z
is going to buy a particular kind of
technology solution and that is what he
proposed to the time directly which is
going to give you a high probability
probability that the kind is going to
buy you're offering customer churn
information so custom Chan is like
figuring out if a customer is going to
use your particular service or not or
they are going to drop out of the
service or not okay so for example if my
if my total is number two let's say my
total bill usage is going about 20
percent about 120 percent then the chunk
that I might just by drop of that
particular telecom you know window
that's where these companies come in
come into picture and offer you
something which can help you reduce your
bill okay that's called as customer
churn prevention by analyzing of
customer is going to leave or not
channel well is data scientist really
the sixth is your friend plus century
I say it's a wait time yes because
because of the quality over most
imporantly
salaries are good you get I mean all the
honestly speaking it's not that easy to
be covered in a scientist that's because
it involves a lot of skill set and it's
not something that I can
summoning in each way like a matter of
hours it's it's a it's a month long
preparation okay but of course doing
certain courses can help you get started
fast and can get you can get you on on
the track and from there you can pick up
your journey of becoming a data
scientist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
