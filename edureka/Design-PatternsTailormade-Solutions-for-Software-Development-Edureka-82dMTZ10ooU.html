maybe neuron with design patterns it's
also called we have made a caption like
tailor-made solutions to solve it so
coming to myself I'm a gander i'm
working at the console denting a
generator and I'm as semi or your design
patterns I have a more than 10 years of
experience in software architectures and
designing of complex distributor systems
so today we will be going through the
design patterns for dinner by the end of
the session you all will be able to
understand the need for the design
patterns and you would be able to
understand how we can build a flexible
design using design patterns and we'll
be going through quickly about the uml
diagrams describing the diagrams and
designing the diagrams we will be going
through a quick glance at the code with
abstract factory pattern and then we
will talk about how to use observer
pattern and the mediator that
so let's find a pattern over here here
you have seen you're seeing there are
almost five sequences these are very
popular sequences you might l came
across during any of your school-age
competitive exams in apt to make sense
throughout the killing yourself so on in
the first one if you could find there is
one hexagon and then one diamond and
then three hexagons and one diamond like
that and similarly in the second
sequence we have squares and the
hexagons and starts combination you'll
be able to easily find out what could
come the next blank so that does that
mean like you know you annoyed in
advance know by looking at the pattern
how the previous sequence is going to
you would be able to identify what would
happen next so similarly in the below
sequence 135 obviously one could easily
imagine it would be a 7 because we know
each of these numbers are differentiated
by two so the pattern is nothing but
identifying game sequence of the past
and predicting the next output so you
guys will find out like a patterns or
here the sequences whatever we have
shown in the previous slide these are
all filled up here but
turns are easy to recognize and they are
everywhere and the beautiful thing is we
come across them every day to day life
suppose so we have seen a traffic in one
of your packet by road tomorrow also you
would see the same way but you would not
see the traffic during the weekend and
this kind of pattern will let you know
how to plan for the next workweek so you
would be able to identify when the
traffic would be more and when the
traffic would be less and you normally
do it this is one of the popular this
pattern which everybody come across
during their daily life similarly the
design patterns also follows a similar
kind of principle and hence we are
naming it as a pattern so software
development programming problems what
about the software development
programming problems you have a pattern
for all these yeah we do have a pattern
even for the software your control panel
problems because not only our daily
lives we also face similar kind of
problems during the software development
in Ramat so tin lab since the
development of the Industrial Revolution
or else the software development there
are they were quite a few in
applications have already been developed
and during this development lots and
lots of architects lost a lot of
designers programs we have faced similar
kind of design problems to old they're
clear and throw data products so what
they have done is rather than just
finding out the solution and forget
about it they have noted down that
context of the problem and they have
made a solution and they have verified
it it works
even for similar kind of problems
similar kind of problems through will be
going to the looks like software
patterns describes the classes and
interacting objects use it to solve in
general and repeatable divine problem in
a specific context with the proven
solution these are the whatever you are
seeing the picture we have awakened with
Eddie gamma and returned home Ralph
Johnson and John waves you must have
heard about this gangor for a book which
is famously known as it design patterns
and elements of reusable object-oriented
software is one of the most popular
popular software designers and this
talks about the design patterns and not
stick to the programming language it has
nothing to do with the programming
language it doesn't talk about anything
tactics of semantics it talks about how
the design patterns will be identified
and how what they identified during the
eight years they design issues and there
are very experiences so they have
wonderfully kept on different kind of
design patterns and classifies mm all
the different flavors and made sure most
of the design patterns would be easily
and blindly can be applied to any kind
of the design problems whatever the
general software programmers encounter
the importance of
the design patterns so why do we need to
first of all the when we needed design
patterns is it for a good job or is it
for a good application development there
are plenty of reason to understand to
learn about the design patterns unlike
any other application software
development companies there are few
companies who are completely
concentrated on product development not
for just clients but all for the general
use something like Google Microsoft
dimension all these kind of Taiwan
companies they don't choose for a
particular skill like you know if you
got in it is a data warehouse experience
they don't water if you have some
original product they don't bother they
bother about only the design pattern
knowledge like how you design a
particular given problem or if you are
given some kind of a situation how you
design in terms of software that is the
main still this taiwan big companies
look for so why do why don't they need
somebody who has a particular skill
because skills like you know for a
particular product skill you can develop
by even by or going through the
workbooks or any kind of documentation
but the different patterns is a skill
that need to be involved in once neurons
of the brain so if they have to
understand how to design on how to
visualize a particular problem in
software issues so you can visualize if
the prevalence of design patterns
because most of the current software
applications are being developed by oppa
carving as most of the design patterns
are prone found the object-oriented
programming paradigms also the
programmers think that both are related
in fact as I said the Gang of Four
design pattern book never talks about a
particular programming language
but still most of the current
programming languages have all be
support even the Python repeal will
never targeted or designed in terms of
object-oriented programming principles
but later with the prevalence of the
object oriented programming we have
introduced all the concepts you inside
the scripting languages so design
patterns have nothing to do with the
object-oriented programming is tried and
proven solution to commonly occurring
programming problem to illustrate the
design patterns I'm taking one example
over here let's take this example
problem statement where we had a cement
factory it could be any factory or a
pickle factory chief said well whatever
it could be a factory take the example
of a faculty and if we are asked to
design that factory what all the key
stuff we first look at let's consider
the one of the factory over here it has
lots of our sofa like chains
operation chains waiting there are
multiple materials constantly viewing so
one of the container would be
controlling one all material then
another container will be looking at
another catalyst so each of these
containers need to be monitored in terms
of temperature and flow and speed and
mixture capacity viscosity and all so
the data is captured using search for
all these containers and then pass it to
the master control system waiting the
mass of using the master control system
we monitor and control the ingredients
temperature flow one speed to provide a
better quality final product because
these machines and need to be operate
in a coordination if either of them
operates in isolation the other
dependent components of the containers
or get spoiled so let's suppose if the
temperature of the mixture is left and
required with a master control system
should send the increased temperature
command to the machine so how can we
build an hour such an automated system
there are two weeks the one means using
the procedural programming language and
the another is visualizing the whole
factory in terms of objects and use it
as a object-oriented programming so
let's look at the requirements there are
different entities monitoring the data
generated by these sensors each entity
takes its own decision on data and
informs others as well at times there is
also a master management control room
from where the commands to different
entities may generate and then the data
from these interviews should also report
back to a master management controller
let's look at them in visuals burger
there is a master management control
system and this is the packaging entity
and is a chemical control entity and
this is a catalyst control entity for
giving the final product we need to have
a chemical control along with the
catalyst by and then it should be
packaged as well when the pad caging can
be done using a boxes for the box or
bottles on what or it could be so let's
have a blessed thing if it's a coca-cola
hatchway wearing all the coca-cola would
get filled up in the bottles so in case
if the flow of the borders is not in
line with the coca-cola product what
getting delivered by these both chemical
controller the catalyst control entities
we would waste the coca-cola we do not
our nfo people are coming as per the
flow of the glasses the glasses may get
broke so it's extremely important to
keep the flow of the packaging material
from the product in line so it
considering the similar kind of example
let's go ahead with this dagger the
chemical control entity gets monitored
by two services and also there are two
actuators which may activate more
temperature or it may activate a fun
ways to increase the temperature and the
another actuator is the flow actuator
probably so the flu actuator increases
the flow according to the command given
by the master management control system
and this could be a sensor which senses
the flow then this could be a sensor
which senses the temperature similarly
even for the catalyst control entity and
similarly it is same for even the
packaging continuity so this is the use
case we would be designing using the
design patterns as I said there are two
ways to design this Cuban problem it
could be either using a procedural
programming language or else it could be
we can do using a object-oriented
programming language let's look at the
pitfalls of procedural programming
language procedural programmer it could
be a no eyes to the complete software
industry would put all hanshan allottees
pertaining to the master man
Schmidt control system in two main
functions and subsequent individual
entity functions he would definitely put
it into the subroutines the challenge of
the procedural programming paradigm
revolve around the functionality rather
than the data that's the key problem for
the procedural programming language it
would definitely work even if you do and
even if you design the given problem in
procedural programming but there are
multiple problems that gets associated
with this kind of design which would
unravel only in the future but not in
the present that's the reason procedural
programming languages what failed so
many times as they were quite convenient
while writing the core they were not
standing up to the mark while modifying
or extending the features but the
object-oriented programming solves all
this problem we will have a little
practicing object-oriented programming
merely doesn't solve all the problems
what exactly mean by an object-oriented
programming it's nothing but the
visualization of a given problem in
terms of objects in terms of real time
objects whatever we perceive you see
touch eat daily in our everyday life all
one Nora in one or other sense these are
all objects when our daily life is
completely revolving around the objects
why not have the software programming in
terms of objects that is the main
principle that led to the
object-oriented programming development
as an object-oriented program
he will consider the given use case and
he will take the master management
control unit as one object and
subsequent individual entities as
different objects but sensors and
actuators are as further different
objects the design for the procedural
programming revolves around the
functionality but not the data in
object-oriented programming the design
revolves around the data and these
objects need to be communicated to
achieve the desired functionality we
have visualized the given use case in
terms of objects let's suppose we have
completely returned the programming in
object-oriented that early but does it
solve the problem what we have mentioned
during the procedural programming what's
the problem we mentioned that procedural
programming is extensibility scalability
modify ability but implementing the
object-oriented programming doesn't
solve the whole problem it has to be
more let's look what exactly are we
missing you have created a perfect
object-oriented programming model for a
given loose case but what if you need to
modify the making process in line with
new research results there is a new
research parallely going on in your
factory or the company and you came up
with a new container into nating a new
container they separate catalyst with
the QA more taste to a coca-cola birth
then how do you implement it in a
software design you need to completely
wore all the existing code to make it
work better is it feasible there are
there would be a completely down time
and there will be a need for a training
there are a lot more implications for
the or hauling of the existing design
let's look at another problem what if we
would like to increase the fat to your
application capacity to increase the
application capacity or the factory
capacity you need to put more containers
or of the more objects in case if it is
a software application but does your
design supports inclusion of the objects
or inclusion of the new containers in
the middle without much change and
without affecting the existing
components let's look at another problem
wearing what if you like to add a new
features if we have done the design in
the procedural programming all these
problems will still be there
even in object-oriented programming
model but what is the solution let us
look at how the design patterns
addresses all these problems let's build
the given you escapes using the design
patterns the model of this particular
manufacturing entity without using
design patterns may work at one time but
it will definitely post scalability
issues in the future as mentioned in the
previous slide there would be a lot of
issues which may come up in case if we
do not follow the design patterns such
kind of the design without using the
design patterns will hinder the growth
that's way the design com patterns
constant of a teacher when building an
application it's important that we keep
the future requirements and changes in
mind otherwise you will have to change
the whole or whatever you have returned
not only that implementing a complete
new design our war hauling the existing
design would post new issues it may
create new but building in large
application is never easy so it's very
important that you design it correctly
and then start coding the application
when there are complicated distributed
systems you need to design perfectly
well in advance that's the reason the
design patterns has taken an utmost
importance rather than coal
design patterns provides efficient
techniques to create a flexible
application design we will look at how
these things can be achieved using the
design patterns by going through a small
very few design patterns and
implementing and applying those design
patterns for a given you see you mmm why
why do we need the view mm till now we
have gone through the need for the
design patterns and how the design
pattern solves the problem where does
this unit comes in the future uml is a
modeling language widely used to
visualize the object-oriented Divine's
there are in a complicated distributor
system there would be a myriad of
application developers architects
designers builders and all it will be
very tedious job to get everybody in the
same track because each one of them
would have a different design in their
mind and the nomenclatures they might
use would be completely different to
each other so how the UML solves this
problem
makes it easy to visualize the software
designs uml diagrams can be easily
decoded and converted into em most of
the popular object-oriented programming
languages the third point comes later
the primary the primary importance of
the UML is to visualize the software
design we know the programming can be
visualized using a cool but how the
designs can be visualized and that's
where the UML was taken a book how the
UML visualizes the software design it
does using the diagrams we will look at
the few of the examples of different
diagrams while applying the design
patterns for our given us but before
going through that let's take a quick
glance of what exactly these diagrams
are all about these diagrams have been
broadly classified into two structural
diagrams and the behavioral diagrams the
structural diagrams provides the view in
the model of it structure of the
different objects that are being
designed and the behavior tell us about
how the functionality happens it tells
about how these objects are getting
communicated to achieve the desired
functionality under the structural
diagrams the class diagrams component
Agins object baggins down with composite
structure diagrams to deployment
diagrams and a package records if you
probably look at all these names of
these ladders they have nothing to do
with the functionality they just tell
about the objects what they constitute
and how they are organized they never
tell about how those objects gets
communicated to
the desired functionality but the whole
job will be done by the behavioral agnes
behavioral a grams for the classified
into multiple patterns one is the
activity tracker use case diagram state
machine diagram the interaction diagram
the activity diagram tells an alt the
activities that happens across the
objects the use case diagram tells about
what is the required functionality need
to be achieved using this design in it
extremely simple and laymen
understandable language the state
machine diagram tells about how the
whole system state is being transformed
from one state to another state to all
the course of the application execution
let's take an example of a laptop when
you bought a laptop it would be in a
completely dormant state and if you
power it on it would be in a booting
state and if you completely booted it
would be in the running state the whole
this kind of a different state
transformations will be depicted using
this state machine diagram the third one
like your fourth one is the interaction
diagram the interaction diagram can be
broadly classified into sequence tag and
communication diagrams in the timing
diagram as well as interaction / you
back in the general simple applications
you may not see the major importance of
these diagrams but in a complex
multi-threaded distributed systems
definitely these diagrams takes it
cannot most important picture the reason
is when in a complex
distributed system if all these
different entities works in isolation we
would not be able to achieve a desired
functionality along with the desired
performance the complex distributed
systems main goal is to provide a
maximum performance in a short time and
this can be achieved using a
multithreading or multi-process
communications and all when you are
having a multi-threaded or multi-process
communication our application all these
threads or processes need to be
communicated so that they can coordinate
the data among them to achieve the
desired functionality so how these
different threads or processes need to
be sequenced will be typically using
this sequence diagram and how these
threats are process communicate with a
detection by communication diagrams and
then the events need to be sent and we
see wood across the multiple clips or
process the depiction of using the tiny
daggers the UML takes an at most
important place in the design patterns
because unlike the programming languages
we do not have any other means to
describe our talk about or communicate
the design patterns among the our peers
the UML tools we talked about the
diagrams but how to draw them there are
multiple free open-source UML tools
available the market solve the morado
UML diagram let start sooner let you
create a fast laggards and if you are in
an enterprise there is a plug-in even
further
most of the major enterprises uses in
IBM rational magic draw Enterprise
Architect microsoft visual studio.net
these are the popular you email tools
using which you can design a perfect
diagrams
this is an example of one of them design
pattern which we would be using to solve
the given design problem and this is the
abstract factory illustration using
auriemma what this UML diagram talks
about let's quickly go to the design
problem what was given to us we have a
master management control system and
chemical control engineer catalyst
control entity in a package from
Connecticut let's satisfy this master
management control system / why let's
design the soft parts packaging entity
chemical control entity and the catalyst
ultimately each one has different
objects that are interacting with this
chemical control entity these objects
are sensors actuators just visually
identify the objects whatever the a
perceivable things what you see in this
diagram would end up as an object in
your design visualizing a problem using
object oriented design is a skill that
should be developed by an experienced if
you are a strong procedural programmer
it should take a while to visualize any
software problem in terms of objects so
visualizing the given problem in terms
of objects is must for the design
patterns to better perform if you do not
identify the proper objects that is in
patterns may not so
the whole problem whatever we have
talked about in the previous slides so
as I said here there are four objects
then among them to our senses and the
two are activators so let the design
these actuators and the sensors in a
procedural programming languages
normally people tend to create the
functions for them but here we need to
create objects for the objects whatever
we have us to you there are two entities
actuators and the sensors and each one
of the entity has a different types of
flow actuator or firmness actuator the
lender one is flow sensor in the
temperature sensor so let's suppose if
the client of the software application
would like to design this application
and then he need to create these
temperatures or flow sensors of
actuators for a given entity before let
them communicate to each other or with
the control in 3 the first and foremost
infant point is we need to create those
objects there is a classification among
the design patterns also one needs
creation of design patterns of the most
important one and then the structural
and then behavioral different battles
for any software design problem the
first thing which would come up case how
to create those objects and the
creational patterns addresses quite a
few problems that our software
architects have encountered in their
experiences in the past one of the
popular creational pattern is the
abstract factory value it is a one-level
complicated than
factory at the factory pattern when you
ask the fab 3 2 q will give you an
object depending your own type what you
are asking the fact we would generate
the particular object but abstract
factory generates the factory itself
let's look at the abstract factory this
is an actuator vacuum this is the sensor
factory so the coin has asked this
abstract factory to Q view either a
sense of a clear ops actuated fat once
you have a particular factor p you can
further ask for the floor actuator
object or the furnace actuator object
similarly even for the sensor you could
ask for a flow sensor on the temperature
sensor I had a code ready but this given
abstract factory design let's take a
quick look at this code before going to
the details of each and every file let's
look at how we are using the whole new
whole of this software design so here
let's think this is the client with up
trying to create objects for the
actuators and sensors here the factory
producer is one of the static method you
are asking you to get a particular
factor if you pass on the string as an
actuator if you would get an actuator
actually if you pass on the string as if
lo you would today
flu actuator because as you already born
back to the factory further asking the
actuator factory to create a flow object
similarly once you get this a flow
object you can call that let's pick two
methods on top of the delivered object
similarly you have got this actuator
factory and further you are asking the
actuator factory to provide the firmness
object we are passing the furnace and
then you are getting the particular
furnace watch it on top of the furnace
or check you are asking them to
initialize the element these particular
methods you could add depending upon the
type of the number of the different
behaviors for a given object similarly
able we have a sense the factory as well
and also the flow sensor in the
temperature sensors this is the way how
the client uses of design now let's
start going through the basic design you
have an actuator with a particular
object of particular your method called
initialize element and the flow is a
subclass of the actuator with a low
rating of this but
i film it similarly you have it funny
stuff class with the overriding of the
English lines element you need to
understand that initially the furnace
and Flo are the type of actuators and it
should be able to visualize that both of
these actuators share a common behavior
they share a common behavior you create
an abstract class called actuator and
then you are deriving and war riding
those hell does methods it is extremely
important to identify generalization
also called a like you know the subclass
supercar SS for a given design problem
is extremely important for this abstract
fractal battle you may ask can't I
implement lovesac factory pattern
without these sub classes and subclasses
know the reason is the whole idea of the
design patterns is to simplify and
provide the San extensibility for a
given design let's suppose tomorrow in
case if you bring in new activator or a
lower temperature or pressure of
actuator if you create a completely new
class you may have to then you would
have to chain the whole design of the
the main method right you know how the
client uses the software application if
we know the pressure actuator is also a
type of an actuator because easily
derive the pressure class pressure
actuator class from an actuator
interface
then you may have to create a cup in new
file called pressure not java and you
just need to add another line or here to
get in pressure object from the actuator
fact it's quite simple to introduce a
new feature for an abstract factory
design pattern if you want implement
using that if you view if you use the
programming procedural programming it
will be an extremely tough to do such a
kind of change similar to the actuator
you have a sensor factory as well
temperature and the flow sensors we will
be sharing this code so this is how we
can illustrate the abstract factory
design pattern which is one of the most
important design pattern among the whole
design patterns during my experience
sixty percent of the times I use with
this design patterns I mean abstract
factory different versions because if
you create the objects correctly and
properly it would be easy to continue
the design of the remaining
software there is a if you if you mess
up with the initial creation itself it
will post quite a few problems going
forward in your software elephant so the
creation is the first and foremost step
and these creation or different patterns
solves most of them design problems you
encounter while creating the objects
next the observer pattern so one of them
one of the most popular behavioral
pattern is do something with that let's
let's take a small example like to know
you have a subject and one observer is
observing it and let's suppose you need
to monitor a temperature of the flu or
something but you need to keep pulling
that subject that is a performance
bottleneck what if if subject itself
notifies observe work that I have
changed it would be very simple design
and along with that could add a much
more performance because you need not to
keep pulling the subject which will pick
up the instruction cycles of the erosive
you this is an illustration of the
observer design pattern using uml let's
create a subject initially itself
with the methods that would enable the
observer to get updated we have already
created a subject and observer without
considering their future requirements
you would not be able to solve this
problem you should understand that there
would be an entity's who would be
interacting each other and there would
be a hump an entity called subject and
there would be an entity called observer
let us take the same example what we
discussed as I tell you the packaging
entity should monitor the delivery of
the product so that it can exist the
packaging material as further prop so
whose job is that who has to monitor the
other entity let's take this if you
consider packaging is a subject which we
closer look at it and the another one is
the chemical control it would be an
observer that leading not only gets
observed by chemical control it can be
observed even by that catalyst control
so you have added few of the methods
that would be able to attach an observer
or detach an observer so let's suppose
if the subject gets changed subject no
set that it got changed so what it are
obviously would do is it will notify all
observers that has been attached to the
subject subject the main things all the
observers list who has been agitated
then once it mortifies observer observer
update its state let's suppose there is
a problem in the supply chain of the
packaging material what it would do it
would let all that service know there is
a problem in my packaging flow so
control your chemical composition and
flow so that it would not spoil Norway
store similarly not only the packaging
can be a subject on chemical control
would be an observer it can be vice
versa as well we told the observer
pattern it would be a completely
performance bottleneck if you design
using the procedural programming or any
other object oriented programming as
well without using this observer pattern
final one we would like to give a quick
glance is the mediator pattern we have a
quite a few entities in or given example
chemical control catalyst control and
all packaging control at all and each
one has to communicate with each other
and each one of them again has to
communicate with the master control
entity if we've open multiple
communication channels it would be very
hard to debug a problem in case if some
problem arises in the factory
there are thousands and thousands of
communication channels between the each
and every actuator know isn't it a big
problem its nature for debugging not
been chilling as well we're good but how
to solve this problem the mediator
pattern this kind of media the battles
we normally see in order to be a lives
at many instances
let's suppose you have a on-site
counterpart and then there is a one more
team in on-site and if we have an
offshore team over here of ten people we
let each of these ten people in offshore
to communicate with the ten people in
the US on site or water it would create
multiple communication channels and yet
they're not that I video we would not be
able to know what has happened and in
case if some in communication gap arise
you would not be able to identify which
one and what one what has been gone
wrong and there will be a time waste
even for finally note which what has
gone wrong as well so it is it's not
good for either dividing or maintaining
so what we would do normally in order in
this simple example what you would
normally do we'll be having yonce
coordinator whom you would be talking
every day lingerie coordinator would
pass on the requests to them on cycling
now said coordinator is actually it play
in the immediate
this mediator pattern is nothing but the
similar kind of prints or following so
let's suppose let's quickly go through
this you know the mediator and you are
at itemizing using the concrete mediator
and we have a coulis and the lighting
using this concrete controller of holy
water this concrete controller is our
controllers units for our dune factory
so you can create any number of colleges
over here but to talk to the other side
you the communication passes through the
middle even if it is in between these
two concrete controllers the
communication happens through the
mediator with this kind of approach in
case if something goes bad among the
communications between different
controllers we would be able to identify
easily using the mediator logs mediator
normally causes the logs of all the
communications so it would be very easy
to debug and easy to maintain in case if
you bring a new controller you need not
to create the communication channels
with all the remaining controllers the
new controller should just communicate
to the mediator and everything else
falls in place look at how simple the
designers if you use the design pattern
so the design patterns not only solves
the regular design problems what
software architects and designers
encounter it also solves all the future
problems that it anticipates they had
the stuff you
of the design patterns let's conclude on
design panel session similarly there are
other design patterns to solve majority
of the problems that software designers
encountered during their daily
activities not only these three there
are myriad of design patterns that
solves equilibrium my new problem you
would have definitely encountered during
your experience you need not to be in
with the whole wheel you just need to
follow the design patterns which are all
well proven in multiple contexts it
could be their application no mine or
service domain or a problem the design
patterns some say the column
design patterns compliments one's
experience and helps them deliver a
wonderful and successful software
designs that's the reason with Taiwan
companies like Google Amazon or
Microsoft rakuyo
looks for the people who has an
experience in the design patterns
because the daily wear wonderful designs
and the third way is a common
nomenclature or charging that architects
can easily communicate with each others
in the software design in our day-to-day
lives we talked to the different
software giving people on your
colleagues or peers regarding your cord
and design you need need to give all the
nitty-gritty things we can just tell
them I have followed abstract factory
pattern that would make the other guy
easily understand how the design you
have done it's the beauty of design
pattern sitcoms it it makes the common
normal creature software design is no
more or not it's a skill one can learn
prior to the design patterns people
encounter multiple designs problems and
they everybody does their own design
that is completely different than others
and you need to struggle a lot for that
so it's a no more an art now using these
design patterns it's a skill you just
need to follow the particular design
pattern and code it them in our age wake
of course we would be cowering and the
design patterns in eight modules the
module one would cover introduction to
design patterns module two would cover
different creational design patterns and
module three would cover the different
structural design patterns for would be
behavioral the fire would be concurrency
design patterns six is
anti battles 7 is refactoring
refactoring is one of the key part which
you would be learning how to modify your
existing designs using the design
vessels in the final module would be a
project
so i have seen one and rice may I know
the possible we can put it in the chat
so English done engine may know you're
pushing please I wish I have enables
evil night please go ahead I I want to
basically know the difference between
framework and the same pattern I mean
does it go hand in hand are it's
completely different from what frame of
this end ok and you one popular example
oh this is object broker you might have
seen object book wherein let's suppose
an entity which would be on one system
and an integral which would be on
another system both would like to
communicate each other but there would
be a lot of marshaling and unmask sling
of the parameters and the data need to
be done while passing and receiving the
requests so what this object broker does
is it will mimic you it will provide a a
false or a mock entity in the first
system itself what the rate of does is
it would communicate to the other entity
as if it is talking to the entity which
is present on the screen system in fact
the all underlying or head of
marshalling and unmatched linking of the
data will done
by the object broker so this is if one
of the popular design pattern okay there
is a lot of our research value and there
are a few frameworks designed around
this object broadcaster so if the
application or if you are in a company
where in all the most of the
applications or distributed applications
what they would the suggest you to use
is this object broker framework it's
just it is battered by one of one
proving design pattern still have a
question Kanna village oh yeah I have
given an example like yeah yeah
certainly want to be all the frameworks
need to be back by the design patterns
but this is one of that popular example
I have come across in my experience very
this framework was backed by a design
pattern though none all the application
developer sleep not to bother about the
designing using their code they can just
use this framework it's actually like
you know the design patterns simplified
the object-oriented programming and the
frameworks simplify the design factor
okay I got you yeah thank you thank you
any other questions anybody has
so with this time concluding the session
anybody has any questions on the course
content what we would be covering in the
whole iterator station I'm glad to help
you guys our iterator ocean design
patterns would be completely
comprehensive by the end of the whole
course we'll be able to easily design
any sort of design problems you may
encounter in your regular day-to-day
activities it would simplify the whole
of your software jobs a lot not only
that these design patterns are becoming
a wetted better of all the I one
companies these days if you could go
through the job orders one of the main
skill that tied one companies are
looking at these days in the design
patterns it's not the beta like you know
if you understand there are six fires to
design patterns seven structural design
patterns even if you understand the
definitions that doesn't land us the job
in these Tyrone countries it is the
skill of how you apply them to solve or
a given problem there are multiple
instances where you apply to all design
patterns for problems that would land
into him you know issues that would you
would never imagine this one of the
module covers all this kind of applying
the wrong patterns to the designs at
module six is anti-patterns there are
sub classifications in anti-patterns as
well it would be covering deeply about
these android patterns
and the project and the prospection of
our module 8 is we would be covering a
project which would cover a major design
patterns what we will be learning in
previous modules definitely could be an
added advantage for the people going
through the books there will be a
feedback form coming to you guys
organizers will be sharing the feedback
form please share your feedback
regarding the webinar and if you have
any kind of questions related to the
course content it would be covering I'm
happy to help you and the requisite
contact details would also be shared
happy learning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
