one present today and I will be the
instructor for all of you again my name
is Vinny
so when today's class will be going
through threads the previous classes we
learn hash map hash table we learn
ArrayList
everything now we will move further and
we'll go through threads okay so moving
forward first of all what is a thread a
thread is a part of execution in the
program so what is the use the java
virtual machine allows an application to
have multiple threads of execution
running concurrently so that you can get
the multitasking feature available in
your system in your application so you
have got different you can use different
threads so that multiple tasks are done
simultaneously in the background okay so
one third will do one particular thing
the second third will do something at
the same time this way you're saving a
lot of time a lot of time as well as
your application is becoming fast okay
that is why we use thread as well as
they are very lightweight okay they're
lighter than procedure and processes so
it takes less memory as well as the
execution is faster now let's see a
small diagram where threads are used in
our day-to-day lives in our computer so
you have got your supercomputer right
here anything that is your computer now
if that computer you've got playing
video you've got other tasks you've got
notepad opened up downloading files
playing games browse internet music
player so all these things you can use
simultaneously you would have used it on
your system as well as well so have you
used it let me know do you do multiple
tasks all together yeah exactly so how
does done it is turn through threads
okay these are all different sets that
are working simultaneously that are
running simultaneously now let's
consider one example that off ok
Nichols's I'm downloading a torrent
right now
exactly you're taking class and you are
downloading a torrent right now so that
is multitasking now similarly when we
talk about a music player we talk about
one thread even in that particular
thread you have got different threads
working that is playing songs managing
playlists accessing internet downloading
updates okay so you've got multiple
threads working all over the place like
anything okay they make the processing
faster it provides you multitasking
mozian says many threads can run
concurrently within the poke program
exactly correct it will be running
concurrently or at a very fast pace so
that you're on it you you're unable to
figure out whether they are running
concurrently or not okay music layering
process and others are threads are own
size yes music layer isn't actually an
application okay the previous slider if
I say these are thread so for a
supercomputer these are different
threads right for a supercomputer these
are different threads but when you go
inside so music layer is on itself is an
application in that application you've
got different things present over here
so these are different threads for a
music player right so this was just for
the idea so that you can understand what
is the function of a thread and why do
we use it for achieving the multitasking
now why do we use it threads is a
light-weighted process as it shares the
same memory and the resources of the
process in which it is created okay so
since it shares a particular kind of
memory in which it is created so all
these threads will be using the same
memory this way
they do not we need much resources and
they are very light weighted hence okay
that is why we use thread in our
day-to-day applications that we make
this could be a diagram so it will be
using the resources that are available
in the process right here in this
particular process itself so threads
threads and differences
we'll be using the same resource but and
hence it will be lighter than others
lighter than processes okay because
process require a different resource for
itself so that it could run now let's
see a very small lifecycle of a thread
okay so first of all your thread starts
new program starts thread your program
will be starting the thread using the
runnable you can you make the thread
weight using the weight function that is
available and it will be unlocked okay
you can send your thread to sleep it
will be sleeping for some time and again
it will start executing so you can stop
your thread using a sleep function that
is available similarly when the task is
completed that completes tasks it gets
terminated it ends after that okay so
this is a small life cycle it can go to
weight it can be sleep put into sleep as
well as when the work of the thread is
finished it will finally die it will get
terminated okay so I hope you're clear
with this small diagram moving on now
thread methods that are available for
you okay Marcin says yes clear you
create a new thread ok when you have to
start you'll be using T dot start T is a
thread so when you have to start you'll
be calling this function that is T dot
start it will come to ready state after
that you can notify T dot notify uh
notify all these are the two functions
that are available because
simultaneously there could be many
thread stunning and when you have to
send a message to any other thread but
you can use you can use notify T dot
notify or you can use the notify all
function that is available for you now
after the starting the thread if you
want to run the thread I'm sorry I just
told you notify first after starting the
thread you'll be running the thread by
using T dot run it comes to the running
state either after running it executes
the complete tasks can go to the
terminated State or else you can send
the thread to sleep by using T dot sleep
or T dot wait okay now this at this
particular state it is blog the thread
is not doing anything okay
stagnate at that particular moment after
that pen it is coming back to the ready
stage it will notify the other threat
that I'm coming back
by using T dot notify or notify all
again it will come here T dot try and
come to the running state do its job and
finally terminated or comes back here so
this is the life cycle this is the
function those are called in the life
cycle of a thread all of you write down
on the chat window are you clear with it
everyone please let me know which this
is okay maybe says yes ash table says
yes machine CJ is clear okay then okay
Emma says difference between sleep and
wait both will do actually block the
thread the only difference could be that
is a thread can wait for a particular
resource that is there is a resource
that is available and since I told all
the threads use a same resource okay so
if a particular thread is using a
resource and there is another thread
which is waiting for it so you'll be
using wait for thread that thread until
that resource is free okay so as soon as
the resource is free this thread will
notify and come back and use the
resource okay so you clear now and sleep
is for putting the thread into sleep for
waiting okay now there is one more
property there is one more thing that is
available with the thread that is thread
priorities okay when multiple threads
are running the order of execution of
threads depend on priority given to the
thread okay different thread you can
provide priority to a different set now
it when multiple threads are running it
it will be running on the basis of
priority if you want okay if you put the
priority one two and then seven so first
one will get executed first then two and
then seven okay so priority value ranges
from one to ten and the default values
five because it could be that you
haven't defined the priority of your
thread in that case it will take the
default one that is equals to five okay
and in order to set the priority of a
particular third you'll be using set
priority in priority he'll pass the
priority within that it could be one
Tilton and method to set priority this
is the method to set priority so if the
thread name is T then you in writing P
dot set priority brackets in priority
that could be one to ten okay so I hope
you're clear with priority as well what
is the priority of a thread now creation
of threads in multiple ways the threads
can be created in two ways implementing
runnable interface or you can use
extending threads class you have got a
class that is thread using that class
you can create a particular thread or
you can use a runnable interface that is
available in java using which you can
implement that interface and you can
create a particular thread okay so we've
got two ways in java then it will
interface and thread class now first of
all implementing runnable interface how
to create a thread using the runnable
interface so the code is like this you
have a class that is thread class you
implement runnable okay as soon as you
implement runnable you have a method
that is public void run and within that
you write system dot out println hello
from a thread okay so it will be
creating one thread now you gone to the
main class using the thread class object
you'll write thread class object equal
to new thread class that is object of
class thread class which will be a
thread so thread thread thread and
school runnable is equal to new thread
you pass the object within that okay so
this is the function that you have to
use this is a thread class right thread
runnable and you write new thread you
pass the object within that and hence
using this you can start the thread that
is dot start okay so let's see the
example on eclipse now okay
so first of all I come to creating
threads first through runnable so I have
my examples thread class I have got
thread class equal to implements thread
and I implement the runnable interface
within that I have a function that is
run okay
okay add an implemented methods as soon
as you implement the interface that
discernible you'll have this method that
is public void run and within that you
can print a statement okay
whenever the thread runs hello from a
thread and now you come to the main
method in the main method what you did
thread class object new thread class you
created an object of class that is you
defined right here that class then using
the thread you've got a class thread
available in Javas using that you write
thread right thread runnable you make an
object you write new thread and you pass
the object of this class in which you
have implemented the runnable interface
you pass the object and finally thread
and the score runnable dot start your
thread will start executing so when I
run this code okay as you can see hello
from a thread okay so this is a thread
that is running right now so all of you
are you clear how to use a runnable
interface in order to create a thread
please write down on the chat window
yes machine that is also one way i stuff
says yes it's clear what about others
guys please write down on the chat
window
everyone please let me know if you are
clear with that Aaron says without
creating thread object is it possible
you'll be using thread okay without
using the thread object you won't be
able to create upset so you have to use
the thread class whenever you are
declaring or whenever you are using a
thread in your application
Aaron is that here okay I must let me
say switch to main class code
that class will be used but right now
you're implementing a runnable okay so
fully it is clear to you how to use a
runnable interface let's get back to the
presentation and now we'll be using the
second thing that is extending thread
class what I do I have the same class
that is thread class extense said I have
the function like system hello from a
thread again now package comedy Rekha in
that I create an object okay similarly
so I get back to my presentation I go to
the second one I will just close this
one main thread thread class okay so
thread class extends thread and when I
come here I could do the same thing this
time I'm doing by extending the thread
class and I have to pass the object into
that when I run this code
I have hello from a thread okay this
time I am extending a class that is
thread right here
which is okay so all of you are you
clear with this part please let me know
in the chat window
extend thread again Arun says okay I'll
come with a head again now we have got
the thread class I extend this class
that is thread I have got I implemented
a method so that I can understand that I
am using this class right I come to the
main class in this I have created an
object of this class itself that is
thread class obj new thread class now
you got to think that since I have
extended the class I can use obj dot
start but that will give you an error
why it is because what you are doing yah
you cannot access a method that is start
okay it is not define I will just show
you once again when you come here you
will find that the method start is
undefined for the tight thread class
okay hence you cannot use the start
method to start the thread you will have
to pass this object into thread class
itself on an object of thread class and
then only you can use the function that
is start then only it will start a
particular thread okay so let me know
around if you are clear machine says yes
clear what about the rest of you please
write down on the chat window
okay Emmett says yes clear stuff says
it's clear like you have got this card
okay synchronized void start you can
define it right here as well and in
which it is calling super dot start so
you can use this function right here in
your main thread okay so if I write
let's try it
rule seven I come on the top obj dot
this time I'll have us
new thread class settlers have got a
function that is thought
okay that means we can implement
runnable and extend thread also yes Arun
you can do that okay and the thing that
I was trying to do I'll just try it and
I will post it on the community itself
okay we'll try it once even you guys
tried some things and just post it on
the community that way we'll be helping
each other okay so let's get back to the
presentation now thread class methods
there are many methods available in
threads as well as you saw in the last
one why we call start method which in
turn call run method why not with
directly call the run method okay that
is the myth syntax okay if you just go
back to the life cycle okay you have to
cut the gun first you start the thread
okay it comes into the ready state and
after the read each state it can go to
the running state that is why you start
these thought called the start method
first you create your thread and then
you come to the running one okay so you
clear with this machine see that is why
I showed you this life cycle in the
starting machine says yes
okay any other query any one of you
which is says yes clear so that is why
just see the functions it will be called
in this way only that is you start the
thread it comes ready after that you run
the thread comes to running state from
running state it can go to sleep wait or
the end okay that is it
finished it job it is terminated or it
can go to sleep of wait come to the blog
state and from that whenever it will
assume back to the running one it will
call the notify function or notify all
okay so now we were on methods that are
available with threads so you have got
end get priority for getting the
priority of that particular thread void
set priority you can set the priority as
in the priority you can pass within that
words
that will be of Long milliseconds void
join will be also long milliseconds
threads current thread get state set
name get state and now this there is a
difference between guested one is
returning a thread the other is
returning the string now void start run
wait notify notify all stop and yield
okay these are the different methods
that are available with threads you can
try each and every one of them one by
one okay okay so now we come to
multi-threading but before that let's
see whether we have got some examples
for us or not okay so we saw how to
create a thread let's see a very small
program on priority but in that day will
be certain methods that will be used as
well a lot of things is happening in
this particular program in which I have
created two thread that is my thread
empty one and my third empty - okay and
I'm passing a string that is child 1 and
child 2 within that it comes here now
when you pass a string it will call this
constructor of this class my thread
spread super and you pass the name that
means your thread will be named like
this it will call the super that is
thread class and it will set that name
okay we have a run function in which
you're running it we are printing it a
tilton will just get the name of the
thread and will print the value of I
right here okay use within D run so we
have got the class extends thread one
constructor is it will simply call this
super call that is the constructor of
the thread class second is my thread
string name super name when we pass a
string the name will also set get set
into this constructor right here on the
thread and we have coffee run function
in which I have got a for loop and I am
printing the values that as I get the
name and the value of i okay now we come
to the thread
at ease in which I have created two
objects using my thread class that is my
thread empty one equals two new my third
child one second is my friend empty two
new my third child too
we are passing the strings calling the
second constructor after that right now
we are not setting the priority of the
thread okay so I will come in the rest
of them one two oh seven now thread is
initial name and its priorities empty
one name and empty one not get name will
get the name and empty one priority
empty one dot get priority okay so we'll
get the name of the thread we'll get the
name priority of the thread when I run
this code now it is printing mean
because of the for loop that is present
in the end okay
so right now just comment it now after
that I move on I come to the second path
that is again I do I get these priority
and that of name of the second thread
that is empty to run this code again so
this time I've got empty one and I've
got empty to okay and I thread as if I
just come in this control seven and I
run this code again okay so we have got
empty one and we have got empty to now
okay when we start thread till now we
haven't started we are just getting the
name and priorities of that particular
thread now after that I set the
priorities now I'm setting the name of
the first thread as child one okay set
name and I put the seven again empty one
set priority as six and eight now so I
just come in this part once again
control seven this time when I run
code what I receive third initial name
and property empty one child one and
five
this time it is child two and five child
1 and sakes child to an eight okay so
all of you please write down on the
chart friend are you clear till here I
stop says child one and five exactly
your stuff yeah correct that was the
answer machine Ashraf says right now
what I will do I'll just start the
thread empty one dot start empty two dot
star now run the code again so all those
things will remain the same we have got
child one equals zero
child 2 I equals to zero child 1 I equal
to 1 and 2 so they are running
simultaneously in the background ok now
child one is traveling first because
it's fried is 6 and child 2's priority
is 8 okay so all of you are clear with
that if I just uncomment it I don't
think there is a need of this for loop
right now let's see okay it is for this
one to show that is you have main eye
first child 1 zero child 1 1 and child 1
2 now main is also 1 thread which is
running in which I am printing some
values so it is also running
simultaneously with the other two
threads that is why maybe says what does
set name do set name is changing the
name of the thread it is setting the
name of a threat to child 1 okay so
child one eye for child 2 I equals to
zero now the second thread and started
right now it is style 2 child 1 I equals
to 5 so that means your thread is
running simultaneously in the background
one by one okay here your main thread
finishes it reaches 9 your eye child one
thread is already finished right here it
reaches 9 here itself so after that
meaning child is only running and
finally child is only left which is
running until the end so all of you are
you clear with this example
right down on the chat window F yes in
first default priorities of both thread
is saying yes Vijay the default
priorities is 5 itself in this starting
ok OC in CJ is clear which this is okay
ma che sia clear okay then so let's get
back to the presentation I was on
multi-threading sorry so when two or
more threads are running in a process
simultaneously then it is called
multi-threading there itself we were
also seeing the multi-threading example
as well okay was the example of
priorities but it was also the example
of multi-threading priorities required
when multiple heading is present right
that is multiple threads running
simultaneously okay now Pakistan
multi-threading in that I've got a
second class second extent thread I want
to run implemented in that now we've got
packaged into the car multi-threading
second extends thread we have got to run
so we have got two threads one is okay
so this one will be the first is a small
mistakes are you guys so this will be
the first one and this will be the
second one okay so we have got two
threads now in the main thread what
we'll do we'll call thread thread one
equal to new thread I could pass new one
okay the first class was equals to 1 so
this is 1 and this is second here I'll
call thread thread class new thread new
one and second thread thread 2 equal to
new thread I passed new second ok I
passed the object of the second class
here I passed the object of the first
class after that thread 1 dot start and
thread 2 dot start will call both this
thread will start both the threads and
these both threads will keep on running
simultaneously in the background ok so
let's see a small example of that the
same example that was written in the
presentation so I'll close it and I come
to
multithreading main one and they would
be one more that a second okay so one we
have got right here extends threads and
run this is first thread second one is
x10 said this is the second thread and
in the main function of got two threads
that are created using the first one and
the second one and now I have threads
one dot start and thread two dot start I
run this code now so we have got two
threads running the first thread and the
second third okay you want to add
something so while true system dot out
dot println first we just copy this
second come here
paste and this one will be second and
let's run it once okay let's see whether
the threads are running or not so as you
can see first second first second so
both of the threads actually running
simultaneously since before we were only
printing one statement that is why only
this is the first thread and this is the
second thread was available but if you
insert the while loop or anything like
that it will keep on running okay so
thread will silently simultaneously work
or I can do that I can put a small
condition in teacher I equals to zero I
less than five okay and I open the
brackets I plus plus a semicolon
I'll just copy this part only control
see I come to one control V I'll say
first I save a file I stop this
execution
let's run the code once again this is
the first thread first and this is the
second thread so we are achieving
multi-threading if I make it first one
as 10 or 100 I save it run this code now
as you can see okay in the first one you
could have come up with a question that
is I'll show you once again five I run
this code you could say that second is
running first and then the first one
okay either of two is running first that
is if ii has started even though you are
starting the second thread after the
first one you are having the second
right here okay so you can see that if
one thread starts either of it it will
finish it processing and then the second
thread will start that is not so for
testing that you can just change one of
them let's say I change this one to
hundred value of I less than hundred the
other one was still five itself so what
you can see first the first thread and
then then second thread first is running
and then comes the second so what
happened it came to the first thread
first and then the second thread then
again it ran the loop okay you make few
more changes it will do function
accordingly so what it is showing it is
really showing that your threads are
running in the background simultaneously
they are so fast that you do not get to
know that they are what actually in real
life what happens first one thread
executes and then the second one but the
switching of the threads are so fast you
never get to know that these things are
not running simultaneously it appears
that they are running simultaneously
hence this is how it is done so all of
you let me know how you clear with this
example that I've shown you right now so
this is how you actually play with
threads and you try to understand what
is actually happening in it okay machine
says yes Emmett says yeah okay it was
previous here what about now everyone
please let me know my mistake
is Ashraf say J's okay so today we have
got many examples to see because we'll
be seeing each and every examples we
come to synchronization the process of
making only one thread access the object
when two or more threads are accessing
the same object is called
synchronization did you understand it or
are you confused with this statement
right here
I'll read it once again the process of
making only one thread access the object
when two or more threads are accessing
the same object is called
synchronization so guys let me know are
you confused with this statement right
here no Emma says no that's good now
what it is trying to say is that a chef
says no so what it is trying to say is
that if there is an object one
particular entity like pen and there are
two people like ashraf and heaven okay
Emma the National four there and there
is only one object one resource that has
been both of them want are using the
same pen now what will happen we will
synchronize them that is a first one is
using the pen the second one cannot use
it should not use it when the first one
leaves depend then only the second one
can use the pen so that is what is
written the process of making only one
thread access the object when two or
more threads are accessing the same
object is called synchronization so all
of you are you clear with this statement
now everyone please write down on the
chat window F yes MSA is nice example
thank you my wish also says good example
okay so happy to hear that that you like
the example it was instantaneous right
now I don't say yes sir that's good so
let's see a small diagram right here
which is explaining synchronization so
how to synchronize the object you can
write synchronized and you can pass the
object into that you can make a function
as synchronized okay that is a
synchronized block right here when you
write synchronized or you can
synchronize a method like this
synchronized method you mention the
synchronized keyword then you mentioned
that
ten type and the method name so that
method will be a synchronized one and
few days back Aaron says it avoids
deadlock okay now before that before few
days back I had a question on community
itself and I don't know who asked the
question but the question was whether we
can synchronize the method or not and I
gave the answer yes and this is how you
actually do it okay so let's get a get
to the Eclipse and let's find out an
example for synchronization as well okay
so synchronize demo let's open it up
okay so what we are doing we are
creating two threads right here that is
my thread thread 1 and my thread thread
2 and you simultaneously start board of
the threads ok you have a boolean value
two boolean values 1 for thread one
right here I put if you want I can put
underscore between them and here itself
and also I'll put underscore so that if
you can easily identify these are not
visible right now
similarly I'll do for this one as well
come here
thread 1 is alive and thread 2 is alive
I save it ok first of all we come here
this part that is we have defined few
classes right here first class is my
thread okay class my thread extends
thread class within that I've defined a
static string that is message welcome to
add Erica Havel on Java okay
now I've got a constructor that is my
thread you pass the string ID it will
take parameter as the string ID whatever
you can pass it that will be set as the
name when you call super under statute
ID okay that will be the name of the
thread and you run the function now this
function whenever you run it it will
call synchronize output dot display list
okay so it will call this function that
is synchronized output which has a
synchronized function right here public
static synchronized void display list
which is taking parameters as string
name and string list that is an array of
lists right here which you define will
be passed this is it is taking this
hence you're passing message and it will
come here
it will run this for I equals to 0 I
less than less dot length my thread t my
thread thread dot current thread it will
use the current thread and it will run
it so system dot out println name first
of all name and then the list bracket I
ok it will print the I so I'll just save
this file and we come to the main method
in that you created the thread through
thread will be running and you check
thread 1 is alive and not thread 1 is a
lot alike okay dot is alive is a
function which checks whether the thread
is running or not so if the thread is
running it will give you a value true
okay which will make it false if it is
not running it will give you a value
false which will make true then both the
conditions will be true okay because it
is always true first of all it is true
and now it will also give true when the
thread is actually false it is not alive
it will concern inside and it will
change the status of this boolean value
to false will print
thread one is dead okay so that you can
understand when the thread one is over
after that secondly you do the same
thing for the second send as well and
you mentioned thread two is that this
will keep on checking till either of the
thread is alive okay if both the threads
are true it will get you out of the
while loop
are you clear guys so
just run this code control f11 so thread
one welcome to Eddie Rica here we'll
learn Java thread one is thread and
welcome to Eddie Rekha here we'll learn
Java thread - is that ok if I run this
once again I received now see there is a
difference now thread to welcome has
came on the top so welcome to Java here
till Java now again welcome started and
then it says that thread one is thread
ok so you cannot predict when it is
running now see again it is fine thread
one is dead and then thread two is
showing so they are running
simultaneously in the background so all
of you are you clear with this example
of synchronized method please write down
on the chat window now see till 2 it has
came ok so the output can differ when
you are using threads they are running
by in the background simultaneously
machine says yes clear okay it was a
previous comment what about did all of
you please write down on the chat window
if it is clear to you
this was the code once again if you want
to see it you just have you created two
thread threads are awesome ahem it says
exactly they are awesome as well as
unpredictable do not know what output
you will be receiving on the console
window ok so you've got two threads you
are just using these variables and a
while loop so that you can understand
when the thread is ending ok so you use
this just to get the thread is ending as
soon as you start the third it will be
calling the run function both the
threads it will call this synchronized
output now in both the threads what they
are doing they are using the same
resource that is string that is what I
am trying to explain both the threads
are using the same string hence they are
using the same resource so what is
happening we've made a synchronized
method right here okay so first one will
execute the entire part and then comes
the second one so if I run it again
hopefully you will understand it it
better way this time right here it will
use the
entire part and then thread one instead
okay and then only you will see what
will happen like a very small change
right here as you can see welcome to a
direct threat to also started but you
will never find this threat to in
between like this that is using this
particular resource till the thread one
is over so thread one will do its
execution first and then only thread two
will be able to use that resource so are
you clear now guys please let me know
are you clear with the synchronized
method that I have used right now that
particular string resource that we are
using Ashraf says clear is a shrub the
only one who to whom which is to whom it
is clear marcin says yes what about the
rest of you guys Tsarevich i'm marish
okay Emmett says clear what about the
rest of you guys please talk to me and
be interactive Marisa is clear what
about you are on ok Arun has said clear
okay then so getting back to the
presentation once again we come to inter
threat communication now the process of
communication between multiple threads
is called inter thread communication in
this process in this process of
communication when one thread is
executing the other third will wait for
the thread to be executed okay so as it
is said that only one thread will be
executing and the other thread will wait
for the thread to be executed the method
used for communication are wait notify
and notify all when there is a situation
that you want that this first thread
should execute first and then the second
one in those cases you have got wait
notify and notify all if you want to
have an example like you are standing in
a queue for taking the tickets for a
movie right so what will happen first
will go and it will take the ticket and
for the second one it will say wait
after that when the first one comes he
says notify so second one goes inside
and the second one says wait so this way
it will keep on going and the thread
will keep on executing itself okay so
wait and notify should be understood
quite clearly
whenever the thread is coming back it
has done the execution it will say
notify and every thread will get to know
whichever is the next third which was
waiting it will now start the execution
of its program or its process whatever
it is I would say is please repeat and
what I was saying
I was trying to give an example like
let's try to paint something today it's
been a while so we'll try paint so come
here so I have this method first
going inside okay okay this one first
going inside so what will happen now
everyone is in queue second one third
one now the first one went inside goal
said now the first one wet inside here
it has gone inside and rest for the rest
of them what was said it was said that
please wait now these will be waiting
there is a method that will be called
wait for the rest of them and it is
actually executing right now now when
this one comes back okay when it is
coming back here again comes back it
will say notify or notify all okay it
will notify the rest of them it will
notify all so they will get to know that
this thread has done its execution it
has came back okay that means it was
using a particular resource it has came
back now this thread will move forward
the next one the previous one will again
come here and the same method the weight
will be for this one and then when it
comes back it will say notify again okay
are you clear now a very rough diagram
but yet I think it would have fell to
you please tell me if you are clear with
it Emma
Hemet says I love the way you paint okay
and I love the way you lie everybody I
hope you would have heard this song
Aaron says this notify all and same as
notify and it is almost the same
functionality is quite same okay
notify all is 40 all the threats if
there is only one set in that case
you'll be using notify okay okay then so
we are directly on Eclipse
so let's see that communication okay we
have got a example on threat
communications and zoomer factory
producer a big example guys okay so try
to understand it what we have we have
got a consumer they have got a factory
that produces and we have got a producer
okay
producer uses the factory to produce the
goods and consumer uses the factory to
consume the goods so for the functions
for consuming and producing is present
within the factory itself because
consumer comes to the factory so that he
can consume the goods producer come to
the factory so that it can produce the
goods okay so we come here they have got
in DJI boo Liam items in factory we have
got one variable items and boolean items
in factory now you come to produce first
you have got a method that is produced
which is a synchronized method and which
is taking integer items in it okay
that is how many items has to be
produced so in if I items in factory you
pass it if it is true within this so it
will try okay it will come till wait
okay if it is true after this one
you're checking if it is true first time
it was not said so it will be null as
for headphone come inside it will come
here this dot items equal to items
you'll set the items whichever is passed
right here one to whatever it is you'll
set it after that items in factory is
equal to true you'll convert that
boolean value to drew valuable and
you'll set system dot out dot println
produce items plus items ok that means
these many items are produced after that
you have got a notify you will notify
all the threads again when consumer
calls a function that is consumed it
will check not items in factory ok
because previously it was false this
time it was set to true so you check not
items in factory so it will be false
this time even though you turned it to
true so it will come inside system Lord
and consumed items items that means how
many items were produced they were
consumed totally and then items in
factories again set to false notify if
you see consumer and producer right here
in consumer first first we come to
producer you have got a factory located
object factory producer factory FA we
pass the object to that this dot FA
equal to FA we are passing this object
this is the constructor of this producer
class ok
so we are passing this object so that we
can call we can use the functions like
produce over here or in case of consumer
we can use the function as consumed so
we have three functions thing classes
factory consumer and producer all the
three we are using it right here in the
main method in the main method what you
are doing you are creating an object of
factory and you're passing STAAR same
object to producer FA and to consumer FA
ok you're creating the object of
producer and consumer classes that are
thread classes and that you're passing
fa nfa so first of all producer is call
you come here so you come here in case
of producer FA was passed you created an
object of FA in constructor what you did
this dot F equals to FA can you tell me
that significance of this statement that
is this toward FA equals to FA you side
down on the chart field
anyone what is the significance what is
the use of this god F equals two FA guys
let me know initialize factory object in
producer you absolutely correct with
whatever path object that we are passing
from this main method we want to
initialize it using this this dot fa
actually means we are talking about this
FA and this F is this FA that was passed
from the main method okay now we create
new thread we passed this and we start
the thread okay now after starting there
will be a run function which is I equals
to 1 I less than 10 fi dot produce it
will keep on producing first it will
produce 1 item then it will produce 2nd
item then third similarly if you come to
consumer you have the same thing a
favours past you do this dot FA you
create the thread and in the run if God
I equals to 1 and I less than 10 so
first it will 1 item then to item then
third item on the basis of the boolean
variable that is set over here ok when
the boolean variable is set to true
introduced after that it will check not
equal to true which will be false it
won't go inside it will come here it
will execute it ok so once it is
produced then only it will be able to
eat it okay to consume it or once it is
consumed then it has it cannot consume
it again first it has to be produced so
we are showing this example let's see
what is the output let's run this as you
can see there was while loops even then
it is not working like that produce
items 1 then consumed item 1 then 2
items were produced then two items were
consumed 3 and then 3 4 and then 4 5 5 6
6 so like this it is going even though
they were why you present you cannot say
that first time it produced 1 item right
here first produced 1 item since it was
calling a function it goes back there in
the factory it produced 1 item and this
item in factory was led to true okay an
item was equals to one you come here you
check now not true is false you directly
come here trends consumer items items
that is one was produced so it is saying
that you have consumed one item and you
set it to false so first it will
produced and then it will consume I all
here with this example here also we are
using the synchronized methods right
here and we are using the wait okay the
next time it comes here it will be
waiting we are notifying as soon as it
is done we call the notify function in
the consumer as well we are doing the
same thing we wait or we notify once it
is done which I says okay what about the
rest of you yes I don't this daughter
phase the local variable all of you
please write down on the chat window are
you clear with it I'm sure these are all
new concept from many of you but still I
think you should get something out of it
okay you should understand the flow what
is happening and how to do it all of you
please write down on the chat window are
you clear Emmett says yes what about the
rest of you I should have says yes only
Emma the National are the ones who is
saying yes and I feel that they already
know thread from before what about the
rest of you guys never says yes okay at
least one okay so let's get back to the
presentation and now we come to deadlock
can a consumer consume produced item 5
okay yes produced item 5 is also
consumed by the consumer as you can see
I don't
are you clear now this program has been
set like this that is whatever is
produced has to be consumed first and
then the another production will be done
no no not like this this is nothing like
consumer one or consumer - okay there
are different items which are getting
produced at different intervals of time
the criteria for this program is that
once a toughy is produced let's say we
are considering a toffee first front of
you is produced and then it was consumed
one till the time it is not consumed it
won't be making any more Toffees the
factory won't produce any more toffee
still all the trophies that were
produced are consumed by a consumer okay
witnesses my connection is not working
well today some facing some problems
I'll clear topics from video after class
okay Aaron says okay now so I hope you
are clear what I am trying to say
program has been implemented such that
first whatever items those which are
produced will get consumed and then only
the next item will get produced okay so
we were on deadlock deadlock is a
situation in which a thread has got an
object and waiting for an object just
thread lock is a situation in which a
thread has got an object and waiting for
an object lock by another thread which
is waiting for the object lock by the
first friend okay as just being in the
diagram there are two threads okay the
first thread is waiting for object one
which has been locked by thread one
which is being used by thread one and
similarly of said two is sorry
similarly thread one is waiting for
object - which is logged by thread - so
this way this is in a deadlock because
each and every thread the both of the
threads that are present right here will
keep on waiting for the resources which
has been taken by the opposite one okay
so they are in a deadlock because thread
one needs object two to complete set
complete its operation okay
but object to will won't be released by
threat to till the time it receives
object one so this case is a deadlock
one that is there is no solution for it
it will be stuck like this forever
are you clear with the deadlock part
that I have shown you right now please
let me have you understood what is a
deadlock with this is this is just like
I studied in operating systems okay
absolutely in operating systems you have
got deadlock topic and exactly deadlock
is same everywhere it means the same
machine says yes Aaron says yes okay so
let's see a small example okay we'll
have an example on here itself deadlock
example play one has got a boy back to
ball okay where Blair one has got a back
to ball and waiting for a ball okay
player two has got a ball to play and
waiting for a bad right so that means
player one has got a bad and waiting for
the ball player two has got a ball but
waiting for the bad so both are waiting
for the resources which are held by the
other player this leads to deadlock so I
hope we have so let's try to see the
example of this itself that is the bad
and ball and the player one and two so
we'll open the deadlock example this one
okay so we have got a class that's it
that is assigned resources and get
resource so I'll just change the name of
these classes I will make one of player1
stars the reserves - first one so this
one is player - that is get resources
and this is player one just change the
name player one next and finish and I'll
make the get resources as player two so
that we can understand it easily okay so
we have got two players player one and
player two now player one is a threat
class extends thread string resource one
and resource - we have got two resources
resource one and two now player one
string the source one and two this dot
resource one and the source - it is
passed from the main method itself that
is bad or either ball okay so we run the
void which is a synchronized resource
one is synchronized so player 1 has got
resource that is resource one which will
be a bat or a ball try system dot
sleeping method invoked in assigning
resource ok thread dot sleep we put the
thread into sleep we are using the sleep
method into 200 milliseconds cats now we
come to synchronized one this was -
system dot out dot println piano player
one is waiting for his so that is
resource - sorry player two player one
has got this so player 2 is waiting
similarly player two comes here player
two has got a resource - and it is
waiting for resource one so player one
is waiting for resource one it is also
put to sleep for 200 so that it can wait
but these resources will never be freed
because they'll always be dependent on
the other resource which has been taken
by the other thread right so if I run
this code ok it is keep on printing
something what it is I will just tell
you I just
I just wanted to show you so I placed
line in the second case of player two
okay and in case of player one I am
printing stars which will which is an
infinite while loop okay they'll keep on
running if I save it now and I run this
code you will see player one has got to
the source but sleeping method invoked
in assigning associate to has got a
source ball and then player two waiting
for resource ball and player one is also
waiting for resource bat okay and this
will keep on waiting like this there is
no solution to it if you want to see
that I still keep still running or not
you can just put a while okay this will
execute the while loop so the same I
less than five I guess five is more than
enough integer I equals to zero or less
than five I open up the brackets braces
oh my do i plus plus save the file
I copied this part as well hi Peyton
this third of this I'll print two like
this we need to declare the variable I
as well that is integer I equals to I 0
okay I run this for save this file on
this file once again okay as you can see
there keep on keep on drawing that I get
the resource but none of them is getting
it so all of you are you clear with this
part the deadlock one will keep on
waiting please let me know in the chat
window F yes I should have says yes
clear what about the rest of you
okay then I don't also say yes bidet
says yes what about my wish machine
Sahra okay then so let's see whether we
are okay that was the final topic guys
actually these topics are quite
extensive and stressed interesting but
they are short right so we'll see few
more examples that I have for you so we
are already done with deadlock let's see
the other deadlock example as well okay
this is not really a deadlock example
but we are using two threads okay we are
creating a bank account and they will be
money deposited into the bank account
okay so I'll just show running right now
when I run this you may receive this
example as the assignment as well okay
so creating two bank account mister of
Sheikh account as test and mr. Rahul
account Astaire's prowl balance is
thousand and of Sheikh balance is five
thousand enter amount to be transferred
right now now I have to enter amount to
be transferred so right mm or two mm
transferring okay
it is predefined that is hundred was
transferring so it has not been updated
so it is transferring 100 rupees from
abhishek account depositing into rahul
withdrawing from of sheikh so Rowell
account balance is now minus 1000 and of
Sheikh balance is 7000 okay
now transferring hundred rupees from
Rowell account to this now you can see
razor thread which is running again okay
so the point of staying is it you don't
have to go through the amount that is
written or getting printed you have to
see that there is a thread running in
background after some time okay it waits
for some time and then runs if you see
the code right here okay you have got
the deadlock demo dot Java this is not
really a deadlock so first of all you
print creating two bank accounts mr.
shake this and mr. Rahul this is printed
in the starting the bank account Rahul
that is this one new bank account you
pass the name and you pass the amount
one thousand okay that will be the
constructor of bank account of Sheikh as
I've shaken 5,000 now you move down now
what we are doing right here system dot
on balance dot Rahul dot get balance and
of Sheikh get balance so first we will
see what is the bank account okay
in bank account we have got two
variables one is of double tie one one
is for name okay now bank account beep a
string name and double so we are getting
the string name and double from a itself
we pass the amount that is Rahul will be
thousand and of Sheikh will be 5,000 so
that was set right here itself name was
equal to Rahul and then thousand now
using get name you can get the name of
the account using red balance you can
get the balance now deposit you can call
to deposit the amount in the previous
balance and then the thread sleeps again
for four thousand milliseconds okay this
isn't milliseconds okay
now public guard withdraw double amount
synchronized this before withdrawing
withdrawing a synchronized with deposit
right here similarly same case is done
that is thread has been slept using the
sleep function for four thousand
milliseconds balance equal to previous
violence - amount that was withdrawn
okay when you come to the SBI after that
you're getting the volunteer
the balance for both of shakin Rahul
you're creating two threads thread
account 1 and account 2 new SPI mice PMI
spi pass the name and Rahul growl and up
shake okay you pass the accounts of
shaken Rahul you come to SPI but it is
taking extends threads private bank
account - via constructor is taking the
bank's source that is from where the
money has to be transferred and it is
taking the bank account the destination
bank account that is test you set it
right here and the variables that you
have passed now public word run in that
enter the amount to be transferred it is
taking an input okay and you pass
transfer amount when you see the
transfer amount declaration it has been
done right here the method you pass the
double amount into that yes around my
eyes VI is a class which has been
extended as thread right here as you can
see okay so in the transfer you pass it
on you pass the source the source
account system printing transferring
hundred rupees it is written 100 instead
of that what I will do I will bake plus
here I'll put brackets
now this time whatever amount that
you'll be passing will be shown here so
no for that you need to pass an argument
in this transfer amount one more okay we
have got the amounts ultra paws amount
okay
from put the codes from destination dot
get name to account transferring this
amount from this destination to account
do so store get name okay it is opposite
that is from source it will get
transferred control X it will come here
and now you will pass this amount to the
destination okay
it says here so this is now fine after
that you have got synchronized
destination they're depositing into
source ket name now this is also posit
that as you pass deposit function you
call the deposit function okay
yesternight not the source one here it
will be deposit one test one because we
are saving it in test one so we have
dest dot get name I save the file now
and we have got desktop deposit we are
depositing the amount that was
transferred system dot out dot println
with drawing from dest so whatever we'll
just leave their names right now I'll
just run this code once again this time
as you can see same here our balance is
1000 of Shaykh enter the amount to be
transferred I say 500 so transferring is
500 from ABBA Shaykh account to roll
account not depositing into Rahul right
withdrawing from Rahul again this time
of sheiks balance is 4500 because it was
transferred to Rahul so I guess you are
getting the point right so there is a
thread that is running continuously we
put on put it on sleep that is why it is
waiting for 4,000 milliseconds that is
for 4 seconds so guys are you clear have
you got a feel of it are you declaring a
bank accounts and your transferring the
money using threads he is right down on
the chat window let me know roll account
of a Shaykh account so this time you
1300 enroll account because this time it
has been transferred from Rahul and 47
has been credited last time it was 4500
Aaron says Goodwin but complicated
absolutely around good things come with
some complications right you have to
learn the tough things easy thing
everyone can do you need to learn it are
you sending in the project or maybe I'll
give you this as an assignment what do
you want do you want me to send this as
your project or an assignment Aaron says
transfer mm no okay it is done I'll just
run it once again
so around transfer 2000 this time so I
will get three thousand and three
thousand both the accounts right so the
amount is actually done correct I so
says in project okay I'll give you the
assignment Francis both both could not
be the option both is out of the option
are they used to take it as example or
you take it as assignment that I will
post it on Facebook community today
itself okay and you have to work it and
you I'll give you a deadline for that to
complete that assignment and submit it
with essays assignment earphones is
assignment okay absolutely I will give
you as a sign with then so Aaron did you
see three thousand three thousand this
time if I do three thousand again
transferring 3000 from Rahul account to
of Sheikh account and as you can see
rule is empty pocket now and a machine
has got six thousand now okay so have
you understood what is happening now he
says again now this loop has been run
this thread is only running for three
times okay we actually stopped it for
some time so it is stopped after that
okay is that clear Aaron you have to put
different checks like I'm I think I
understand what you are trying to do you
are trying that now routes account
zero right and you want to trach the two
thousand rupees from his account so you
have to mention a check in your
application in this one this example I
have not placed a check okay because I
just have to demonstrate in front of you
all but in your application the
assignment that I will give you I want
each and every check right so you just
have to place a check whenever it comes
it will first check the amount balance
whether it is more than the transferred
amount if it is more than that then only
do the transfer or else display a
message the system dot out ur statement
that the insufficient balance in the
account okay is that clear to you please
write down only chart window everyone
are you clear with this example and I'll
sending I'll send this example on your
Facebook community downloaded and I hope
you are quite clear with the concept as
well what you have to do you have to
create a bank using that bank you can
create accounts okay to let's say two
accounts and you have to show the
transfer of money make it two accounts
three accounts whatever you want
transfer the money from each other and
use threads in that okay okay then I
think you're clear everyone says yes
let's see would you like to see any more
examples let me know in the chat window
Ashraf says no sir what about others
Erin says yes come on guys Anita okay I
receive a lot of yeses so let's take one
more example let me see I won't take out
of fun this time okay we have got a
example
okay said demo1 and demo2 let's see
thread get time okay this is one another
kind of example within which I am using
a thread so let's see this time thread
get time just don't go by the names of
these classes just save the file and
I'll just run it now keep seeing got
message Thursday March it is fetching
the time the system time around says car
purchasing I don't think so that will be
an assignment for your own so this
thread is key it will keep on purchase
keep on fetching the time for you after
some times okay it is any in an infinite
loop right now
okay consumer and
okay consumer extends thread we have got
producer we are creating an object of
producer whenever consumer is called in
the constructor you have to pass the
object of producer okay and we'll set
that object you have the run method in
that I am writing string message
producer dot get message now if you just
see I'm calling this method which is
defined in producer itself so get
message throws exception in that what
will happen it will notify messages
thoughts I is equal to zero string
message message dot first element
okay so this is a kind of message and
first element messages dot remove
element message and here I am actually
fetching the time that is synchronized
boys put message so I will be using this
put message as well new producer dot
start ok producer is a thread consumer
producer I pass it again in the main
method so it is starting right here I've
got this main method I call the producer
new producer I started and I pass the
producer thread into the consumer and I
started also so when it comes to
consumer it is set like this it comes
here while true it will keep on running
producer dot get message ok it will get
the message that was faced by the
producer itself so it is printing the
message right here and then again it
goes to sleep again comes back it runs
it goes to sleep again comes back now
what has what is happening in producer
you come here now you have got maximum
five you use a vector vector is a
concept like ArrayList you have got
dynamically a similarly vector is a
dynamic list that is available in Java
so you run put message okay put message
is called you have got your put message
right here in which you have this I is
equal to mark you it will run for five
times wait and in this messages dot add
element that is new Java dot util dot
date dot tooth string so I first did the
date that is the system
date and I convert it into to string now
when the thread again rises up it will
notify all that is why you come here
again it gets the message
and this is where you are getting the
message and it is getting printed by
consumer message is fished by producer
and it is said that like that into a
message after that it is first using the
consumer object that is the consumer
thread so it will keep on fetching the
time every second and not just every

that we can say bye-bye to you and we'll
be seeing you in the next class next
Tuesday okay so next time please don't
be late you are already one and half
hours late today okay then everyone bye
bye take care thank you
and guys one more thing I'll be posting
the registration link I'll be posting
the registration link for the next class
as well on your Facebook community
itself okay so don't you forget to
register yourself one day prior to the
class because it is it gets very
difficult for me to approve your request
just as the class starts okay because
what do you do you just register for the
class five minutes before it and it
really creates a lot of problems for me
okay so just take the links on Facebook
community itself you will receive it
very soon I will be posting it by Sunday
or Monday so just register yourself one
day prior to it
Erin says I was suffering from that
absolutely run that is why I'm saying it
that's fine one time is good you
improved the next time that is the good
thing I'm all joined and right now I'm
all Emma says why is it necessary to
receive register always Emma because
every class is getting created
differently okay that is first class was
created and then second suit every class
is a different object different instance
hence you have to register for them
differently it is same like objects in
Java in object every objects holds the
state of the variables similarly a
webinar classes holds the states of the
registrations you have to register each
and every time for the class
Emma chase but we have already
registered for the whole course yes you
have registered for the whole course
that is why you are receiving the
registration lengths right but you have
to register for the class every time I'm
all say is counted in because of loading
shedding load shedding
okay so never mind ahem and I hope I am
clear to you what I said that you have
to register every time because these
classes are created again and again MHA
is played in Java okay
sorry for that Amol says that's fine
Aaron says live example
don't be sorry Amol you'll just watch
the recording of the class right now and
we are on the end of the class we'll be
ending the class now so just go through
the recording in today's class we went
through threads and different methods
available and various examples today
okay so just check the community for the
recording or the email id that you have
that you have registered on that you
also you'll receive the recording so you
can go through that i'm alsace thanks
sir so I think finally I'll leave the
class now bye bye take care thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
