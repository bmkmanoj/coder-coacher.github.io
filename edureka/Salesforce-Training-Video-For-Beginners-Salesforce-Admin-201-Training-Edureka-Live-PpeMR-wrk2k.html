gentlemen my name is Vardhan and I'm
very excited to be here on in tariqa
life with you guys so in today's session
I will start with the differences
between sales flows administration
that's it was development and after that
I will go to details of one particular
interest administration task that is
user management we have a mixed response
so I've got a mixed response we have
Bobby from all domains we've got people
who've attended who've been working on
Salesforce and yeah Nikita's one who is
not so it's gonna be a good session for
all of you and if you guys have any
doubts during the session do drop on
your queries or questions in the comment
box and my team or I will myself ask
them right away so just sit back relax
and enjoy you trigger live for the next
four five minutes you learn something
really exciting about this Salesforce
technology and these will be the topics
that I will be covering today first of
all talk about the fundamental
differences between CA chose
administration and sales force
development and I'll talk about what are
the differences that are there in in
these two job routes and after that I'll
get the main topic of today that is how
to assign profiles and permission sets
to new users and to existing users in
your Salesforce org right so this is one
of the most important and day-to-day
tasks that a synthesis administrator
would work on right creating user
licenses assigning profiles and
assigning permission sets to them so
first of all CA chose administration DS
with managing and administering the
production or you know when you say
production or it's all about making sure
the releases that are deployed they are
deployed to the production on time and
it's also about making sure the
environment is stable after the release
and besides that the administrator also
makes sure that the user profiles and
the licenses comply as per the needs and
he's responsible for keeping track of
the progress of the project and ensuring
that there is no gap between the lucra
and specification and the actual project
development so that is about salesforce
administration and since was development
on the other hand is about is going
about the development or creation of the
actual application and the developers
you're primarily work on apex and before
force to create VF pages or visualforce
pages and these visualforce pages need
to be controlled because users will be
interacting with this VF pages correct
so that's what development is all about
development is all about creating a
visual force page and that because that
is the actual application that's going
to be delivered to your customers and
since was a demonstrator is what who's
gonna you know an address waiter is one
of control and coordinate the activities
of development with the development team
and his sales forces are team they're
right with the clients and with the
development team office and seesaws
development can first fall be done in
two ways one is where the programmatic
approach right so we'll be writing
you'll be you're developing the you will
be dumping code here in Apex language
and thus will be building the
application and then the other way is by
the point-and-click features so when we
say point-and-click features it's all
about dragging and dropping of different
text boxes of drag and or you know
various other aspects and thus you know
creating a pleading visualforce page
with the help of the force.com window
alright so one is where are the
programmatic approach and the other is
via the force.com homepage and when it
comes to say school administration it
involves organization-wide
admins who are first were responsible
for the entire organization and we have
implementation experts so when we say
implementation is when we when we talk
about implementation experts we talk
about the seals managers the marketing
managers the solution managers and the
various other people who are responsible
for for taking care of one particular
domain so if it's a serious manager will
be taking care of the sales aspect of
his company right so he's responsible
for growing the business of his
particular domain and then organization
where a Dennis Rader's are the general
since those administrators would be
controlling the entire organization on
their own so that's the basic difference
between administration and development
and it's important that you people know
the difference because a lot of people
and a lot of my students still ask me
this question during every class right
so there is a to avoid to have a clear
understanding of these two I have spoken
about this line and if you know the
slide then I can go forward and go to my
next slide and talk about the most
important salesforce administration now
tasks alright guys so guys are do let me
know if you guys are rocky or run or if
you are clear on this topic and I can
now go forward
you
you
alright I'm in a couple of responses one
couple from up duel so I can anyways go
to the next slide and here is where I'm
going to talk about the administration
aspect and this is the main topic for
today right so I'm gonna I'm going to
talk about the user and user management
activities that any administrator would
perform so let's understand how he goes
about creating new user profiles you
know managing those profiles are sending
licenses and making sure the profile
permissions are set properly and if
anything extra is needed how permission
sets can be used to extend those
functionalities of profiles so first of
all I'm not first of all ascending
profile is the most important task of my
administrator get anybody guess why I
can give you a hint
that's because any user in a
self-absorbed definitely has a profile
they cannot be anyone without a profile
so anybody who knows answers that cannot
tell me you can do that by putting it in
the comment box below
you
but anyways it's fine if people don't
know
fact is that every every user has a
profile because it is the profile which
controls what a user can see access and
modify in a Salesforce org now let's
talk about a sales representative as you
can see in this image if a sales
representative wants to find out what
are the details of a particular lead or
a particular customer then he has to
have the sales profile assigned to him
and that skills profile will have access
to the sales data right so all the sales
data will be present in sin first object
so in Salesforce data is stored inside
objects right so if he wants access to a
particular object then he has to have a
profile which is assigned to that
particular object and similarly this is
a there's a solution engineer right if
she wants to clear out any cases or any
tickets raised by any customers then she
should have been assigned a profile of a
solution
she should have she should have been
assigned a solution profile and that
profile should have all the necessary
objects and all the necessary data so
and similarly you have an implementation
manager who would would be working on
various various domains right so
there'll be multiple teams and multiple
verticals he'll be working on multiple
of those and if he wants access then he
has to be assigned a similar profile
that is the manager profile so the
implementation managers here can be
anyone can be a sales cloud manager can
be a server store manager a marketing
cloud manager can be anyone who's even
working on the wave analytics it's also
called as the Einstein analytics right
so you can work on all these things and
it should be assigned the right profile
and then there's one more important
thing that you should know about
profiles all of these profiles are
totally unique to each user set right so
each user base each team there has a
different profile and if there are any
additional additional features or
functionalities that a particular user
from a user base needs then he cannot be
you know he cannot be assigned a new
profile well there's a big problem there
can anybody guess what the problem is
you
well the problem is that you know
there'll be multiple users and the
single team now let's say there's a
sales team and then in the CL seam they
can be like 20 people or 30 people and
similarly you will have a support team
which would be taken care of tickets and
that team would have around 20 30 people
right and each of them would be assigned
the same profile now we've just there's
just one person from those teams who
wants new functionalities assigned then
you cannot do that you cannot create a
new profile and things are dynamic right
so new people come and go there are new
functionalities needed and then there
are temporary and you know new
functionalities would probably be needed
only for a temporary time so in that
case it's not advisable to always create
new profiles right it's a tedious task
also so for that purpose you know we
have something called as permission sets
but before talking about permission sets
I want to talk I'm gonna give you this
problem statement here okay so the
problems ask for the problem statement
we we are speaking about the same thing
multiple teams comprising of 20 users
and if there are team leads or managers
who need access to organization wide
data and then what do we do do we create
new profiles right so it's a similar
thing in our case the team leader
managers would probably need access to
the data as present you know in some
other team so if it's a sales manager
you might want to see how many tickets
come for a particular product and which
ticket has the has the most number of
queries and has the most number of cases
pending so all these things you might
want to see it but that doesn't mean you
cannot you can give them a you know
modify all you can give them the country
pump since you cannot let the sales
manager modify details in the in the in
the sales or in the support object you
cannot let them view everything right so
if you want to you have to also Resik
his access in in the other object
because that's not his domain of
expertise so that this is the scenario
where a permission set would be needed
so permission sets are basically those
which extend the functionalities of a
user
now take an example of the same sales
manager that's mentioned here in the
slides so you he has a seals profile and
B initially has a read and a create
permission on his sales profile right
and even all of us are members all
forces are team members in the sales
team would have this
in profile correct but then you cannot
give the same access to the manager the
manager needs something more right so he
might want to check and attract the
performance of each of his team members
and he might also want to see other
things from his team right so you might
want to see what what is the data
present in the other team's objects so
he might want to keep rats or a time to
to specifically give him extra
permissions we can make use of pumps and
sets and this way helia he'll have
access to everything
he'll have access to what is there in
the sales profile and he'll have access
to what is there even in the pumps and
sets so and this is the big the benefit
with Thompson sets is you don't disturb
the profile here and it's all the other
people have the same permissions and
it's just this one particular person who
has this additional credentials so
that's why pumps and sets are always
beneficial and that's how they save a
lot of time and see a lot of energy and
they make things very efficient for the
satio that ass waiter and if you're if
you're a cs4 administrator then you
would probably be working on these
things and you'll be doing this on a day
to day basis because you'll have a
number of users coming in you'll have a
number of people coming into your system
going out accessing you love you love
you all so I want to give some kind of
an access to your clients right so you'd
want to create temporary accounts for
your clients give them you know so
access to certain objects and show them
what is the progress that has been made
in the development of you the
application and all these things and all
these things are the main tasks of a
suppose are in a straighter correct so
yeah I hope everyone is clear on these
slides here and on the content that's
discussed if that's the case do let me
know because next up is the
demonstration which I am where I'm going
to show you how to create users how to
assign them profiles how to manage
permission sets to them okay
you
all right so let me just get started
with my demonstration let me show you
how to create your licenses how to
manage your licenses how to create
profiles for those licenses and then how
to assign permission sets for particular
profiles where you want to give
additional axis so I need to first of
all go to my Chrome window and this is
my suppose all go right so for those of
you who are used to seal who are used to
sales force this is of course the new
application that we are logged into and
this is the one that I created for this
demonstration and on this side here on
the left hand side you have the tabs
right in the tabs you have access to
various objects so these are the three
different objects which I created one is
called the total sales the other one the
total cases and then we have something
called as a break our courses so I've
used the example of a breaker to create
a data set over here so inside my total
sales object I have details about the
different courses that have been sold
all right and inside my total cases I
have a have a list of all the cases and
all the tickets that have been generated
by our customers who have raised queries
and then in the head rake of courses is
a special object which I created so that
I can now show you how permission sets
can be assigned to the sales manager or
someone special so first of all let me
open this object here so inside the
total sales object we have a list of a
couple of courses which I have been sold
so this is sample data set so and these
are the courses which have which we have
sold right there there are four posts
that spark AWS Hadoop and DevOps and the
person who bought it the customer robot
their names are here the email address
is here and their phone number is right
here and similarly if you go to the
total cases in here we have a couple of
cases that have been registered for
different courses so we have these are
the different courses and these are the
different issues that have been raised
by the different customers now what we
would need to do is we have to first of
all create different users and assign
them these objects what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create three different
users alright first of all I'll create
one user and assign them this sales
profile okay and the scenes profile will
get access only to this object and then
I'll create another
sorry I'll treat another profile that's
called the support profile and that
support profile will get access only to
this object alright and then I'll create
another profile which is the sales
manager or or another implementation
manager ok so that profile will have
access to all the three objects and when
I do this I will show you the actual
working of profiles and finally I will
show you how to overcome some problems
of profiles like how to implement
permission sets and I'll show you one
more case where you know if there's a
person from the sales team and he might
want access to the data that is present
in the total cases object so at that
time how do you how do we use permission
sets to give them only the read
permission to get details to get access
to those details right so yep let me get
started with my session then my demo is
first of all going to revolve around
creating users so to create users you
have to first of all go to setup and if
there's anything that you want to search
for in a quick fashion then you can just
type it in here right but otherwise on
the left-hand panel here you have access
to everything if you want to manage
users you can click on this drop-down
and you can choose all these things you
can choose what profiles you want to
create what profiles you want to assign
to different users if you want to create
new users you can do it from here and if
you want assign permission sets you can
do it from here
and similarly if you go down and under
create you have apps objects tabs and
all these things right so here you can
now you can use this to create a new app
or create a new object or create a new
tab and you know create additional
features and build functionality here
but for our purpose I'm going to first
fall go and click on users right so
these are my active users currently
right so we can get to see what the
admin users and we can see all users but
you are currently these are the active
users have already created two users for
receiving some time I have created
Albert and Mike right so Albert your
will have access to the sales team and
Mikey will have access to the support
team and if they want access to what
data is present and you know what data
those teams would deal with then he has
to be assigned
but your profile so there's a profile
folder so you'll see man there's a
profile for the solution team and let me
before I talk about the axis and before
I show you what access they have let me
create a new user and give them access
to everything to give Max's I'll show
algorithm access to the sales to this
total sales object algorithm access to
the total cases object and I will also
do am access to this that'll also help
you in understanding how to create a new
user as a sense of hardness writer so to
do that you can just straightaway click
on this new user over here and over here
you can start entering details of the
customer that you want supposing you
want to give your new employee or your
new user an e and then you can just say
say that here Richard right and if you
want to give them some kind of surname
you can just say say it here and you
will have the alias over here and the
email address field here is a pretty
important field in my demonstration
right so generally what we would do is
we would enter the email address of the
new employee of the new user that we
want to on board in our receipts goes
all but in this case I'm gonna hit my
own email address over here can anybody
guess why I am entering my own email
address in this case does anybody have
any idea what I am doing that
you
all right for those of you who don't
know why I'm doing that it's because
whatever that's because whatever user ID
create right no matter what is user name
is what are what is password is whatever
account he has been assigned the email
to activate the link to activate his
account will be received at this email
so in in in the real world scenario we
would put his email address but if I hit
if I put his real email address over
here then I would not get the activation
link since it's a new user I'm just
going to put my email address here and
the user name field I'm gonna put the
user name of this particular person so
let's say his email address is Ric K dot
Purdue at the rate at Vega dot-com and
the thing you got to notice every user
account in the sense was org would have
a.com right so every user name would go
of this format it would not be in the
dot Co format right so this would be the
format for every user name and yeah the
nickname is again something that you can
customize as per your user or employee
and these were the important fields that
we had to enter these were the
compulsory fields and the next thing we
got to set is the user license right so
we have to set our user license and a
profile for that particular person if
you want to choose a particular profile
then you have to first full choose the
license and each license will have a
number of profiles linked to that and
you have to choose one from that list so
if I first of all choose chatter
external then I'll have a limited set of
options but if I wanted to go for if I
just go for Salesforce and then then
I'll have another set of options here so
I have one profile here called standard
user right so standard user is one of
the most basic profiles standard
profiles for Salesforce which has
complete access so I'm gonna assign this
profile room and I'm doing that also
because he is you know a senior user
right I'm creating him as a
implementation manager right as a sales
manager will get compute access so
that's why that's that's another reason
why I am using standard user over here
and when you've entered these details
you can check on any of these details if
you need to but right now it's not
really matter II so I'm just going to
ignore them for now and I'm gonna scroll
down if you want to add the the personal
details of that part
person you can do so over here and and
you can also set these videos over here
okay and the important thing that you
got to notice you have to check on this
box there's an option of generate new
password and notify user immediately if
you don't check on this box then the
email address specified above will not
get the activation link and the user
will not be created right the the user
will not get the link to activate is
around so when you do that you can just
save it and if you look up yeah if the
user Robbins created so what have to do
now is have to quickly go to my email
address because I've got a link to
activate this user account so I'm just
going to go here yeah see this was
developers right so it says welcome to
your developer edition this is your user
name and you love to if you want to
activate your account you have to click
on this link so I'm just gonna copy this
link and in an incognito window I'm
going to hit this link and when I do
that
see Rose will ask me to log in right so
let's enter the new password for this
person so let me enter the password as
this and let me confirm the same and
there's a security question
so yeah bitch sorry I was born I'm gonna
enter that EDL's too and let's change
the password at first login yeah so as
you can see now Richard has this view
right so he's he does not have the same
as what we had earlier that's because he
was logged on to a different app so this
was a student app now if I quickly go to
the YouTube live demo app this is the
app we were talking about right so he
has a different set of access now you
might ask why he doesn't have access to
total sales total cases and and the
other object that is and the other
object over here right which which was a
trigger courses he does not he does not
have access to that because his profile
has not been assigned these objects now
my question is can I assign these
objects to that profile can I edit that
profiles
that I can give access to these objects
can anyone can any of you hear or tell
me give me give me an answer to that
question
you
you
all right anyway that with the answer
that's because well the thing is I
cannot edit that profile because the
profile is a standard user profile okay
when I say standard user profile it is
profile that was that came with it was
right that's a standard profile it's not
a custom profile what I can do is I can
clone the standard profile I can then
make changes to that profile right but I
cannot straightaway make any changes to
any standard profile in Salesforce so
this is a right time for me for me to
introduce you to profiles now now if you
click on the profiles from this option
you you will get the list of all the
profiles that are currently there in
your sales goes all so we have a couple
of custom profiles over here and then
you have all these other profiles which
are standard profiles so the cia's
profile which I assigned that time was
the standard user profile so I
straightaway assign this profile so I
cannot make any changes in this profile
now if I clone this and if I give my own
name here now let's say my user name is
Richard right so I'm gonna say profile
for Richard okay and if I save this then
I'll have a new profile which has the
same permissions as my standard user
profile but the advantage is I can make
changes to this profile so to make
changes well before my cheat before I
make change let me show you what
functions do we have by default we have
access to all the standard objects like
cases accounts leads opportunities
orders and all these things but we don't
have access to any of these custom
objects right so you cannot see any tick
mark here and that is one of the one of
the reasons why why Richard here does
not have access to those so if I want to
enable those objects to be visible over
here and then after first of all edit
this profile correct let me scroll up
and click on edit and over here there
are a lot of options with respect to app
settings and the tab settings and user
permissions right and a set of
permissions you can set all these your
but we need to concentrate on our
objects and we can do that from here so
if I want to give Richard access to my
your total case and total sales I can
just click on these things right so I
can click on modify all and check on
create also when I do this Richard will
have access to these two objects and
similarly there's a trigger codes over
here so I'll give a max s2 even this
particular object correct and then I
have further wrong I have more
opportunities and have more flexibility
for a security by choosing the number of
times or the choosing the time before
which the account will get locked
because of inactivity if I say two hours
of an activity this means that if a user
is any if a user session is inactive for
more than two hours then he would be
logged over and he has to login again
and then have other permissions you're
right I have other flexibility with
respect to setting a password which
would expire in a per user set of days
and then I can enforce password not to
be repeated for three times and then I
can set the password length I can set
the password type right whether it
should have a mix of fad for numeric
characters and all these things so
whatever if you click on all these
things if you choose to then you can and
what do you do is you need to save when
you see if you have your new profile
which is modified as per your needs and
my profile is profile for Richards is
the name of my profile now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna quickly go back to
profiles and from the list over here you
can see profile for Richard right after
to assign this profile to Richard now to
assign it to his - Richard I need to go
back to users so under Richard I need to
click on edit and here there's something
called as user license so after click on
this drop-down so under Salesforce we
have a profile for profile for Richard
so this is the profile name and if I
click on this and yes this is active
already but in case if you guys are raw
you know if you if I forgot to inform
earlier then only when this checkbox is
checked only then your raw user will be
active otherwise it will be inactive
right so when you've done this you need
to save it and by now Richard would have
the updated profile so if I quickly go
back to
is a counter and if I hit refresh then
you can see that three new courses or
the three new objects have been assigned
to him so a draga courses there are
total cases and total sales so these
three objects have been assigned to
Richard now that's what a profile would
do and similarly on these same terms I
have a profile for Albert and Mike but
for Albert I have only the only the
sales object and for Mike I have only
the solution object because I have
created these profiles and I have given
them access to only those objects now
let me quickly show you them right so
I'm gonna copy your Albert's email
address I'm gonna log of Richard and if
you log back in as Albert this time you
will get to see what Albert has access
to okay it asks for a verification code
so let me just wait for the verification
code here
okay there's the cord and I'm gonna
paste your verify so this is Albert
profile all right so this is his expose
org it was in fact our orbit we assigned
to Albert and if you notice Albert has
only the total sales object he does not
have the the total cases object or he
doesn't have the ED rekha courses object
over here he has only access to total
sales and similarly if you go and check
Mike's profile then he would have access
only to the solution object correct now
let me quickly show you that by copying
his address here and logging out
entering his email address and the
password is this and again there's a
verification code that goes so
verified and now you can see Mike's
profile you're right so this is Mike's
view of the Salesforce organ and he has
access on it total cases and yeah that's
what a profile can do so you can be in
any team you can have multiple teams you
can have 23 teams and each team would
have a different profile and and since
each profile would be assigned only
certain data he'll get to see only that
data if he's assigned to a particular
profile and that's how this works and
now I want to quickly go back to
Richards profile and and show you that
he has access to everything correct I'm
gonna copy Richards address your log out
log back in as Richard
yeah so richard has access to all these
things now but you might also want to
control what richard has access to
correct so if I go to ed Rekha courses
here and if I modify my view by clicking
on the go over your then Richard can
basically get to see all the courses
that are currently there you can see
that there is a spa course as an
interview scores there's a Hadoop
divorce and a since most course now you
know as an administrator what if I want
to reset his permissions over here what
if I want to give him only the read
access can I do that can anyone in the
audience tell me how it's done if at all
I can
anybody in the audience
you
well anyways if you have any answers do
put them in the comment box and in the
meanwhile let me just continue and tell
you that I can control that
from my profiles again so I need to go
back here and go to profiles and under
profiles I need to choose profile for
Richard right so I need to click on edit
over here and if I scroll down I'll get
I'll get to control what he gets to read
what he gets to modify what he gets to
create and if it's a trick of course
which I don't want him to modify then I
can just check on this right and if I
don't want them to modify at all then I
can you know just click on this and also
not let him create now this way I'm only
giving him access to read correct so I'm
only giving him access to read all the
readers present here so if I just hit on
save his profile will be updated and
even his axis would be modified so if i
refresh this page you can see that the
new Enrica courses that button is off
right it's not visible anymore that's
because of the updation in the profile
credentials now that's what I want to
talk about with respect to profiles and
they would also be times when you will
have to use permission sets right so
permission sets is when you have
multiple people in your team and you
know you want to give this one person
from that team extra credentials and
during that time you can use permission
set and for raw showing permission sets
an example of permission sets I want to
quickly again logout and login as Albert
this time okay so we have users over
here Albert
now the reason I'm again going to log in
as Alberta speakers right now Albert
will have access only to the sales data
right he's part of the sales team who's
been assigned the profile and he'll get
access only to the sales data and what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna give him
permission set of the solution data so
whoever's there in the support team
right I'll give Albert the ability to
view what tickets come correct and to do
that first of all let me log in as
Albert and show you what is the status
so right now there's many total seats
visible and you know and the under total
sales I have complete permissions your I
can add new sales details also I can add
new records over here now if I want to
update his your credentials by using
pumps and sets have to check on I have
to go to this tab over here write
function sets have to go on this option
and here I can I can probably create a
new pump since set over here so if I
want to create a new permission set I
can just click on new I can say
permission for Richard correct and
similarly if you come down you have to
choose the license over here now the
license here refers to the the the
license the order profile belongs to now
in case of now in case of Alberta his a
profile is called as profile for sales
team right so the profile for sales team
is under the license of 4.com free so we
have a number of profiles your I
earlier I use standard user which is
part of which is under the Salesforce
category
correct which is under this license I
created the profile under this license
okay but this time the force.com free
profile the force.com free license is
under you know that is the license under
which we have the sales profile and the
service profile created so I'm going to
quickly go there and I'm going to show
you how it works so you want to click on
this hose or come free click on save and
here you can update the pumps and sets
for that particular profile and first of
all if you want to create or if you
wanna update the apps that he can see
you can do so from here and if you want
to update or modify the objects that he
has access to then you can do so by
clicking on this one and since we want
to give them different set of object
permissions then we can click on this
object settings and inside this we have
a lot of options you are right so all
these are the different objects
we have the standard objects here we
also have the custom objects and the
object that we are bothered about is the
profile for is the sales team right so
if I go back here you can see that total
sales this is the object the custom
object which we created and total cases
so total cases is somewhere here and
total sales is somewhere here so right
now he has access to all these things
and if I want to give him read
permission of support data then I can do
so by modifying this object so right now
none of them is none of them are enabled
so I will click on edit and here if I
just check on greed then Albert would be
able to read what is there in this
particular raw object correct so I'm
gonna save this and now that it's saved
let me let me I mean Ken can even tell
me if you know the pumps in sets the
update function set would be available
for for that person for for Albert would
that be the case right
can anyone tell me that
no they would not be because I have
right now only enable the permission set
for that user all right
I have not I have not assigned him that
particular permission set so if you want
to assign permission sets to a user then
you have to click on Mann's assignments
so right now the thing is I have created
a new permission set for my user okay
for my profile for the provide the
profile name is for zorkin free which
has this license and under this for
short come free I need to manage
assignments so to do that you have to
click on manage assignments over here
and right now there are there's nothing
to display so if you click on add
assignments you can choose for which for
which user you want to assign a
particular profile for so in our case we
want to assign the solution data for to
Albert right so Albert is a person from
the sales team and we want to give him
access to our support reader so I would
just check on him and I would say assign
so this has been assigned to Albert and
now if I just go back to his data to
Albert's or Salesforce order and if I
hit enter you can see that total cases
and is another object that is visible
right but the thing is he will not have
complete access so he only has access to
view what is written is a present over
here but however total seasons since
that's his domain of expertise he'll of
access to all the reasons present in
this object and this is how you can also
give extra functions to any managers or
team needs part of your team correct and
yeah that's how CSS works and that's how
simple it is to work on Salesforce on
this is one of the most important tasks
that any Salesforce administrator would
have to do day by day on a daily basis
correct so yeah that pretty much brings
an end to my session here and I enjoyed
this live session on it Salesforce guys

something new the people who are around
