just want to make it very clear to all
of you that this webinar is going to
throw some light on the career
opportunities that you can have when you
move to the cloud online and nobody is
cloud of how because cloud is a very big
turbine right and how to understand the
various perspective the cloud and how
cloud can fit in our road that is also
very important fried because all of you
are from different job articles few of
you or developer skew of your admin fee
of your network engineers and few of you
are architects and a few of you are
startup like the starting to explore so
it's a great opportunity for me right
now oh yeah we'll welcome on Nathan
Nathan is a managed IT advisory so
before we start let me tell you that I i
will be covering here or most of the
career opportunity that is available
with respect to Amazon but equal
opportunity is available with other
cloud windows like Microsoft and Google
which are the alternate cloud wearing
this and are at a very competative stage
with amazon so um and it will not only
help you to define your career path
going forward but will also make you to
identify and make it a current career
choice at any point of time and you feel
that okay my career is not going in the
right direction you can always do a hard
stop for yourself everything well give
it the technology and choose the right a
right right path for you or for example
if you take me i have over does a
hardware engineer your workers and it
look at me i worked as a system at me i
have also worked as a developer i have
been also worked as an architect and i
also a major people i also help them in
finding the correct career path so that
they can grow into the cracker yet the
one thing which i would like to tell you
before i go ahead and start the session
that always evaluate yourself right most
of you would have been so much
you'd have been seeing right now they're
taken now getting there is a parody
inception into the technology and let us
prove it about the technology leaders
see the approach for example 11 mq of
you would have gone through a various
project execution in steps right earlier
liquid 15 10 15 years back we were
following the waterfall model of project
execution rally where two three months
we will do requirement gathering protein
so we will do a system design and we
will see the architecture of the system
find the flaws and then we will take two
signals to go ahead and develop the puc
h2c months we'll go ahead and realize it
into development or a keyword or a
testing wagon train so this was a
waterfall model like they call it
waterfall because we we take long long
long process and we are just going one
way right water always flows into the
one direction it doesn't go and end
opposite direction or the it doesn't
float up side the integration it always
slow down side the inclination correct
so then you might have learned at
recently Ajay has been recently Turing's
right and if you must have poser to
there's I project management and method
of working late so he is quick okay so
quick means you do something and you
test it and then you put checkpoints and
then you go that like what you work for
two weeks you do flow think of the 13
you check what whatever things you have
done whether we can go ahead with this
or not if not then what can be done in
order to mitigate that teaching right so
here or even doing a recheck for
yourself at every stage right so this is
for agile it is very quick you can
execute the project in quick succession
because we are identifying your problem
at right point of time line so stimulate
a career choice would be agile in nature
it should be regularly valuated which
should be regularly challenge and you
should regularly be learning in order to
become a very good of professional in
the domain that you are in or you want
to be
right ah so apart from those kind of
things like here we are just discussing
about the cloud computing as it going
and what are the career opportunities
which is a variable into the club
computing what we're discussing more you
can go ahead type your question are on
the question time out I will try to a
cover up all the questions which comes
as an men are in the resistance of opera
in the sequence right so first thing
that legit ending of this webinar is
what is cloud computing what is the AWS
what are the advantages of a turbulence
demand for cloud types of certification
you needed Lewis types of cloud
professions future trend in cloud
computing right so a cloud computing as
a concept is not a new concept right it
has a pail it it is almost all if i
remember it was actually coined in 1960
in that decade 1960s it was fine for the
first time by you have the professionals
at IBM so the introduction of the cons
of the conceptual part of cloud comes
from ivy but later on there was a silent
wave it like 70s 80s 90s no nothing has
been done however parallel development
has happened during that activity in
order to see you the evolution of cloud
computing like cloud computing as far as
I am concerned I AG I am only hearing
this term 2006-2007 onwards before that
I am never listenable cloud computing
but and many people say that cloud
computing is virtualization or the next
generation of virtualization no cloud
computing has one of the ethyl groups as
virtualization making the out
virtualization we cannot imagine cloud
computing but it is not that
virtualization is the next day for the
cloud computing is the next generation
of the virtualization there are a lot of
things in computing and and and child
computing you can say that it doesn't
income income personally virtual are you
eating but you think of classes also
your business if it is basically target
who's the
business needs right so business needs
is basically scaling right but sometimes
a few months lag a big person comes into
the market opens a swap lady wants to go
to the wrong line right he wants to open
an online shop and then he wants to a
open electrical retail a soft same
original cities and then he was to also
do business across boundaries straight
so this week and he also wants to
fueling a lot of online presence because
nowadays every would like so many
millions of people using internet me
online purchase buying selling stuff
right using Amazon flickered so these
are the result and result of cloud
computing right you cannot marry such
kind of infrastructure who the help of
traditional or data changes right and
and so Oh sometimes you think that ok
it's about infrastructure virtually I
issue no it's not only putting clash of
civilizations it is also about your
application virtualization your app that
is also about your day growth store is
dexter of virtual machines in cloud
everything is virtualized there is
nothing called static everything is
volatile everything is virtualized so we
are going to talk a little about without
computing we will also talk about the
windows into the shower computing domain
ews is the leading ranger then we have
microsoft azure we have x pays me a
Google platform flat right so these are
the multiple windows which are then
McLeod Eden this is leading why needham
this is leading not only because it came
into the market prior to other players
right Irene was already there into the
cloud roaming the time you did not
capitalize on the way amazon get it by
because amazon waving into head and it
solved the user stories the business use
cases it has a better business
justification Lin IBM right that was one
of the primary reason that were you w is
picked up so fast then we will also talk
about remind of cloud types of
certification eeny de minimis types of
cloud professions which is named Gary
now it and in the current
and the present scenario and what is the
trimming of the cloud computing so um
I'm sure you would have so seen or heard
of multiple definition of the cloud from
critical people right and architect
defined the cloud in a different way a
developer defense the club in a
different project manager think that of
a cloud is completely a different story
even write his only user story will give
it to this can master and we will create
multiple tasks on top of that and I need
to the engineers who will start about
right so the cloud you can have
defamation as many as types of rule that
you you are entertaining right now or in
the type of road that you are present
for example a developer can think of the
cloud as a platform where he can go into
a so he did not to install his machine
in you reinstall the toadstool uh
quintals he just has to login provision
a development in vomit and start going
right it is so quick correct and and he
doesn't have to bother about the
infrastructure so this is what
developers think that anything i want to
develop i can develop it at any point of
time when i can sell it on online agents
elite offline as well i can move the
data in and out whatever i want and it
is very secure oh man I'd mean on admin
perspective or whether it's a server
admin or a network admin but an
infrastructure architect of it is
something like they can go ahead and
create an infrastructure they can go
ahead and provision a datacenter they
can go ahead and provision network
equipments right it can't be it is a
virtual equipment but it is available to
make just a drop and drag for them n up
and they doesn't have to bother about
what is in the background right would
want to the hardware what are the types
of I just want a linux x86 real machine
right I don't have to bother about the
real license I can't have to know about
the hardware you know don't have to
bother about the admin will come and
install this rail own system right so it
is readily available to me right
similarly if I want to create a virtual
private cloud I can
go ahead and spin definitive minutes I
want to have an otter scaling
environment I can do it with two clicks
of the mouse right so these are the
things which actually defines a cloud
computing cloud computing you can define
as the technology which income fascists
business needs right and it is filled up
by virtualization this virtualization is
again composed of several level layers
of virtualization like application
storage networks / text off everything
is virtualized it is also contributed
with something called a model so be
model is something like you will have to
pay for the time you are using when
you're not using it you will not have to
be for example if I am using a V light
and I am running a vm m hosting a
website hosting it for only daytime or
not and i am setting it down during the
nineteen right so i have to pay for the
day time for the fall so and the minimum
denomination of using a vm in AWS is one
are right so potter i will be charged
few cents for the IV which i am using so
the payment now or you can see the pay
Modi is is a very attractive for a small
and medium businesses right they don't
want to set up here it doesn't they just
want to get the stuff printed or get a
subscription available to them let them
pay for the time they use the net right
so we have virtualization and then we
have paper using model and the third
model is they don't have to bother about
what is happening in the background no
headaches no unnecessary a bother ation
about the hardware that is needed i need
to put off to the vendor I want this
much of hardware I need this much of the
network equipment stupid septum place
because if you start interacting with
the data center person right you will
get to know all these pains like they
have to go overhead and order a few few
of the servos and equipments much in
advance maybe in few pieces they order a
rating of like
they put order for six months advance or
one year in advance the order is placed
with our way vinda and then the
manufacture a pack it's a bit and then
it creates loosened up and then it is
fitted into the rack and then it has to
the network and destroy it and then it
is powered on solution on the operating
system so I install the application and
then make sure that the power in the
cooling is available around the clock so
there are not a lot of things which you
don't have to bother about so these
three things actually defines a cloud
the virtualization technology that uses
second one is the pay model that cloud
exam and third one is a you don't have
to manage come the harder the power of
the software in this case it is
completely managed right so that these
three terms actually defines the cloud
computing is fiction publix in am a
public cloud computing platform not on
the private side because dr Excel you
would like to create the same kind of
infrastructure in your private data
center but again for that you need to
have a sickness system admin area it
work admin go and raise our proposals
for a hardware vendors to secure harbin
of that so we are just concentrating or
public cloud or public offering from the
cloud computing right so it says that
okay also ver el to the way is to excess
club thanks to clubbing in excess of
ghosts if you are connected to internet
if you're not connected to internet you
will be able to access itself that is
one of the primary connection from use
laptop to the cloud and an equal thing
the power for example a power of
managing and polling frustrates are
using using that you're not even
entering the data center you don't have
to hear those noises of the fan which is
just blowing up the hot air out of the
data center for making lot of noise into
the data center I you just have to plug
in your machine or your laptop in the
internet and it with the internet and
the cloud public cloud subscription that
you are having okay
and so that actually a gateway to the
club now round what are the different
happens of Club which is available in
the market right so basically people
defined in two different wings as I said
that java developer one still have a
platform where you can do the
development right so that will become a
platform and service you just have to
rate that platform for the period eased
in the development and then we can scrap
it we can destroy you can put it to fire
right so you can do anything with is in
a platform infrastructure is so this for
example I am a system admin I want to
put a firewall ray but I am to have
multiple operating systems running and
then I want to create of ecommerce
portal into the troll I can go ahead and
write our infrastructure for myself
right infrastructure can be in two forms
either you ready to a hardware
infrastructure or you read the templates
so let me say how are waiting for the
structure you have the flexibility of
choosing what hardware you what you want
HP hard way I niyama do you want lenovo
hardware della Oh similarly on the other
side if then you go ahead and rent a
template you unknown like you just get
x86 or 64-bit or 32-bit a platform
operating system you need not to worry
about on which platform it is running it
will be running as long as you need and
it will have associated CPU memory and
this piss whatever you want but it will
ask you the underlying hardware so this
kind of offering but whether under the
hardware is masked right this kind of
offering is provided by amazon but we're
done you can go ahead and order for your
own choice of hardware right that is
also available into public cloud from my
guy said it is offered with software
right so there are different kinds of
cloud which is available to you there is
no no needs it is thought so this is
Cole I is so we have discussed as we
have discussed past now third one is
sass
so SAS stands for software as a service
for example I have some 10,000 machines
or maybe I have 10,000 machines laptops
tack shops in my network I want to pass
them on right it's all windows machine
and whenever someone wants to plug in it
will give past and all of my missions
are connected to be in jeopardy right in
that case what are the avoidance means i
can do is i can go ahead by some
software it by some hardware install it
and then create an infrastructure for
that I don't want it I just want to rent
the software which is available right so
we'll just whenever my machine is
getting connected i would go ahead and
the patches which is listed on to the
cloud or range and it will get pushed on
my machine right and and it will
identify my machine and it will put the
patch is correct scope so you what is
happening that you are not going and
getting an infrastructure man or going
inside me a platform you were consuming
a software which is there in the sky or
which is there in the cloud right that
is how sales force works right you want
a database you need not to worry about
the data bits you just go ahead and
create a new instance of into into the
clock sleep their details into your
oracle client or a toad or from nice
equals me and you will be able to access
you want to monitor you take thousands
of servers that is there in your data
center we don't have a monitoring
solution you don't want to set up the
move roofing solution higher and
monitoring of professional and push the
ideas maintain the crates maintain the
patches you go ahead and subscribe the
monitoring software from the cloud and
configure so that your it can identify
your machine in your physical network
all your machine can go ahead and
identify this earth when pull or push
the boundaries and start monitoring the
itself I so these are the various types
of Club which is available based on your
consumption need and this has been
modeled mostly about keeping or the
Apple user the currants
human in mind Lee who is the consumer
what kind of mean working in Africa
moment they are having what kind of
business they are running right so the
fat and their sudden cost advantages to
it right so this is how it is working so
here you can say cleared segregation
what is very nice what is then passed
what is their insides is is as I
discussed it and infrastructure service
we have major vendors like Rackspace
join me where amazon web services amazon
web services is legally right now and it
is not only it is not only in this
stream it is also available in other
tiers like it is also available in a
class model it is also available in SAS
mountain right so amazon is a major
provided here in pass you can see google
ad sales force amazon and again the
leaders in fast mode a local for sales
force perforce note from and Amazon's
are the leaders any n push until now
that you are having an any question from
the audience are you able to let am able
to explain everything that that you are
looking for or is there anything
specific that you want me to acquire in
distance then agency site feature on
which
so so KW afraid so aw it's so hot mess
on one was actually into the ecommerce
business right and Jeff Bezos is the CEO
or you can say the CQ or the overall
headphone jack visibles and the first
already see to you in some other company
and left that company and he wanted to
open what would be kissed a book so
right a place where people can come and
buy the books that that was is bashing
me or do we all have gone reading books
and many other second one to this week's
bought the book we all of probably all
of us had a small repository of our
books read and we look to read through
here either it's a comic what if it can
your science book or it can be
mathematics book and we used to share
right so this concept of Amazon view as
a business plan in the mind of the
freezer she always wanted to have the
biggest library from where you can come
around the hood and and go ahead read it
and then return it or up maybe by try so
this was the initial business plan for
amazon and angles gonna started in 1994
it is still one of the english jumping
into the market and it hit me it has
capitalized to an extent that it has
become even group figure it has grown
like a lucky jack is one of the biggest
retail e-commerce company in the world
and it is challenging walmart or it is
challenging some other like only he come
must complete like EV right it has
already surpassed or ebay a long day so
that that was the whole even concept
from where it can just they were doing
business and the business was growing
and they had big warehouses ah into the
market where they used to keep all these
stuffs and they used to sell it online
but in you and it was family for you as
a New York reason you mean do it has not
yet pleased two thousand about early
right it was a sudden 1995-96 and then
children thousand you didn't even come
to India so they started a of finding a
pattern like people use to do the buying
read only during the festive seasons
like the Thanksgiving seasons or
Christmas season and and and they used
to have a very huge infrastructure to
support that right because first of all
they have to host a website second thing
they have to take care of the security
where the pain people can go ahead swipe
your credit card center the acreage
calyx and Sigma V number and it's a
building to payment gateway which should
be secure and third thing up because of
the uncertain nature right for the
summer it will be very the business will
be like going very slow not much traffic
during thanksgiving and christmas the
traffic will be huge you like nobody can
actually expect what what what is the
soul in the traffic with is it a post oh
and if it is the worst when when when is
the Bulge but i right so like that it
actually they started realizing that
okay during certain reasons i like
certain time frame we have this annual
traffic okay we have the infrastructure
let us rent it out for the remaining of
them yeah right so they started the
concept of for this renting out and it
came from a discussion of jeff with his
grapes right so this started they
started thinking of again and again they
hire some software linnaeus gators and
intense notarial since is working on it
they created virtualization to use they
reused open source components okay and
are they use open source components and
earth after using the open source
components they actually went ahead and
um created a portal created a business
model code amazing web services it's
amazon infrastructure at your doorstep
using internet to ever browser that was
the whole concept so that is how eight
of this came into picture if we do us
proud
satellite computed stories databases app
services deploy deployments right it
also provides money of our feet here so
you can login you can create your
account if you are in India you recharge
rupees to if you anyways you will be
charged rupees of 60 or 62 or of one
dollar right so this is based on your
location they will charge you a minimal
fee to check that validate that your
account is valid or not your credit
credit card is valid or not and then you
can log in and you can start playing me
the services that they are providing
right ah you can also hear a lot of for
keywords like am I instance volleying
snaps or do not worry these are just a
names which is a very odd keywords which
is a specific to AWS hey my name is
Amazon machine images which is just like
a vm template distance means a running
machine bali means the happiest right
and snaps of meals and snaps or or or a
backup pocket right why organization
choose AWS so there are many reasons for
choosing the AWS first thing amazon for
a long period of an election 2005 to
2010 amazon was the only public cloud
provided and they have you played this
time in a much better way how dare you
placed they understood the business of
banned user whether it's a retail
customer a small shop or whether it's a
small and medium business or they want
they are again in from they want to go
online and their user spread across all
over a world or maybe it's the
healthcare company with the data
security is very important the patient
data sonora compromised should not leave
the country boundaries right so they are
lists from the business of the end user
they came up with different services
right they came up with private data
center they came up with the concept of
creating a physical data entry into the
country getting into a legal equipment
with the that country for putting your
confidential data into the
I am inundated into getting the services
certified with thought by the auditing
agency and that's how they have a grown
right so now when as a company like as
in a startup company small and medium
company whenever we think like which
club to choose whether to choose Google
wherever you choose zuhr a rackspace or
aw is our first choices either do this
because it has been into the business
for a long time understands the business
well and they have a very good record of
launching successful business and and
the last in the most important point is
it is infinitely scalable when I say
infinitely scalable means that supposed
to take you want to launch a business
that is what and you want to spend a
some of 7 billion u.s. dollars right you
will need need a very huge
infrastructure right you want to punch
in a day you have a budget of 7 billion
u.s. dollar you have a business plan you
want to spend this money all you need it
you're going to need a very huge
infrastructure and there is no other
company other than amazon which can
provide you such a big infrastructure to
fuse $17 enterprise today's world right
you even you should combine who will if
you combine microsoft a pseudo Rackspace
put together they will not be able to
fuel up the knee joint an infrastructure
which is generated by a 17 online
interface in a single day and amazon can
do it for almost any year right with 365
seven billion enterprises it can like
Plan B can stand still with the help of
a amazon or data centers amazon
infrastructure and I long cloud services
this talks about so I've already spoken
about the paper uses resource pooling
scalable opportunity cost of large
capital expenditure so this is just a
cost comparison right this is just a
cost for managing and and which which
tells you that there is a lot of
opportunity cost I think they'll save
right and you can also see that the blue
line represents a traditional hardware
right and the dotted line represent the
practic predictable demand so if you are
using a pair of this traditional
hardware you always have to predict your
demand and then you have to sell you out
of a right at certain point of time your
demand will be more than your hardware
in that case you will have to go through
a business loss amazon native new list
so i identify this as an opportunity
cost and it goes in sync with your team
are you go bro when your business growth
if your business is going through a bad
freeze or if the business is not making
money you swing down very release the
resources to the Amazon some amazon you
because you don't need it and when again
your business grows you go ahead and a
kick off multiple instances multiple
platforms a little soft feels as as much
as you want right so if this actually
shows a tough fight windows as way now
AWS but there is not much to fight that
one basic differences as a 3pm late as
ray is focused wars windows and Azzurri
is a platform and service it provides
you the platform to develop your
application right it does not meet up
the requirement generated buying most of
the startups or the small and medium
businesses which is basically for
platform application development
infrastructure platform application and
deployments right so and then and it
also generates a need for against the
software services amount of all
available units away as your is also
growing
it is growing because Microsoft has got
a lot of enterprise customers it is very
nice in the interface customers right
because they have that speech they
already have assigned a lot of our de
suite enterprise customers we used to
push our noses in it but when it comes
to small at stardom and small and medium
businesses amazon is the leader and they
are also approaching into the enterprise
section with the services that they
offer right this is the big mind of the
cloud from 2005-6 to 2015 13 man was
exponential till 2020 20 20 25 right the
demand is going to true later on like
even Gartner forester has not been able
to predict because there is always a
piling up stepped into the technology
within a period of five to ten years so
what will be the next generation of the
cloud nobody knows right now but will be
shipped into the club nobody knows in
nobody knows on nobody can predict that
I'm just giving an example when I
entered my college right how we used to
have like we do not use to have any
concept of email addresses here in India
so we used to write on postcards or
later outside and we used to drop it and
the parent and they used to receive it
the they really can get just that good
like to it right from there we moved two
phones we used to call once in a week to
all parents or to our things once in a
week or twice in a week whenever we get
time and whenever our pants l our even
if we have enough money we will go ahead
and make a call to net talk to them
right from that it has come to a place
we are we're living in a world if you
want to call a people person and living
anywhere in the world you just have to
get his number right and it feels he is
having a mobile or an internet
connection he will be able to talk to
you instantly right so the world has
linked correct and this has happened
only in 15 to 20 years
right and there is a lot of Technology
reach as an energetic so that is the
reason that up till now like every five
years we get the the growth report
market forecasting five to ten years but
after that even Forrester and got no not
able to predict what will happen what is
going to happen next right so till 20 25
there is a very good career opportunity
into the cloud you can grow as a club
that not many professional into the
cloud when I say cloud it's not only
just going and using yourselves if it is
about automation it is about the
blocking app on the club it is about
minimizing the time of a development
right it is about a generating lost of a
lot of opportunity cost it's any lot of
money from a company perspective so that
is how it is growing so here are few you
can say a service market highlights it
says that what is good global a child
computing revenge new it is growing very
fast I would not like to like curl bind
it with the the monetary because I can
see the opportunity goes much beyond it
opportunity in the sense that like that
for example few years back I was working
in see right now when I meet the guys
and fuse back whenever the pressure I
was working on see I was working on Rex
programming language I was working on
something feasible visual studio.net
framework has it so it letting those
were pretty new technology right and if
you used to have a very good handle on
one of the programming language at that
point of time I was efficient and I was
very influenced ight okay I know at
least two of cheaper
we'll just watch you came work and and
the King rate so but now when I go and
meet people right I I meet people who
were into the colleges and and and and I
get surprised they call it rings who are
so passionate about technology up they
were started building on top of C and
C++ right they were started learning on
top of it and and what are you achieve
when I was free shirt is now the
platform for hardening our generation
which is coming up people are learning
by 10 people and movie people are doing
analytics fig level all sorts of
development both right and and used the
skills are unmatched they are just
growing growing and growing and these
are the people were going to continued a
lot into the development of cloud
computing into the development of other
leading technology driven companies
right or let me open your own company as
well so this is how they have drawn
accordingly there has been a very
competitive a financial back fee for
example oh when I pass them out from my
colleague or women in 2005 infant 2004
people used to get a standard selfie
they used to work on our and C C++ and
we used to feel that okay this is the
end right now if your Java export you
don't need you not to only over the Java
you need you also need to know the
application you need to know your
business your company's business me how
critical is your work how you can
minimize a time for developing a java
project how you can do is a continuous
integration and continuous deployment of
your java project how you can faster in
the process of the development and how
you can make it cloudy fight how you can
sell it right so everything not only the
technical stuff but also on the business
needs right and help so on the cost
motor right come we do not have billions
of money to keep it in reserve and keep
investing then we English something and
they wait that some some return will
come so
business is also city and accordingly
the industry and technology is also
sifted to to match that business me so
that is how it is growing of course when
it comes to a package cloud engineers on
one of the best p treat of people in the
world right now like even if you are
working in US and your XL proficient
with the key for years of experience
good knowledge on Jada Lewis you can
easily fetch hundred 40k 260k am easily
evening in here it's the very handsome
salary that the people and it's not that
only the enterprises are paying you in
the startup companies are paying that
much money so career wise it's very good
oh the thing is it is very challenging
you have to keep learning and it is not
only about knowing virtualization order
in knowing certain programming language
it is having a holistic me holistic and
you have to master that the master at
least three four domains which will
keeps you which we keep you updated with
the changes that is going to happen into
the cloud or mean over the next 45 two
years wait so this is whatever as I
discussed what is the median salary they
have that make it I won't like to bind
it with the salary because they always
find that for a technologist technology
is more important and technologies are
always intrigued with with the poor stay
right with the technology they were
working on with the end and result the
business that they are fulfilling with
their technology rather than binding in
with a salary salary grows and it will
keep growing it as long as we are
sticking to all the latest ago much
so this is a clear view about the job
opportunities that we are having the
world most of the job opportunities are
there in the u.s. of the relatively
lesser of opportunities in Europe than
in u.s. py is also Europe can match us
but not that that that will you can find
other this is your the job Chris
available that quite competitive rate
here in Australia Brazil these are the
countries which actually says that okay
we have the job and we don't have
resources and when you especially go to
the specialized domain like out and in
that if you for a platformer service and
in platform and so we see where the app
developer or you go as a game developer
right there harlotry people's you can
count on kingís that there are people
to back fill this place of it imani is
huge when there is no one to go ahead
and backfill not no one but well it'll
be smaller number people who were there
right so these are the various things
which is available we have our new
denomination coming up like cloud
developer cloud I mean she sobs product
off SE Cupp do this 32 movie all the
essentials right so when we talk about
cloud a doubles is the first choice go
ahead and develop your career parallel
to AWS because it is going to stay in to
the come into the market for at least
next 10 years there is no doubt about it
second thing in that you get the
specialization whether you want to be an
army whether you want to be a divorcing
in for automation you want to do a cloud
developer for everything ah forgiving
companies other e-commerce ve become
humbly this your choice of your home and
expertise that you liked it but
all of them are very
tative very good and it's good from a
career perspective to stick to the cloud
right certification so there are three
types of certifications available into
the cloud the first one is called cloud
and instructor certifications which is
nothing but it is more of a cloud
infrastructure architect certification
it will get to know about the various
cloud services provided by amazon i like
how to create a VM now to create a
storage and how to need a website how to
create an infrastructure of Artos
killing involvement on how to deploy
automatically like that and then so this
is about sound administrator co-ops or
product of sign of certification that is
available we have another set of a
certificate in which is available we
call it as cloud developer certification
it is a specifically for development
guys so they need to know the program
any in which they need to know the
programming framework with ro ro can go
flying on or they want to use some other
programming framework and and how in
depth then then how would they are into
java and what very good the flavor is
flavor stuff ciao so that is all about
the development certification the third
in the most important domain which has
came right now it's about DevOps like
you must have what about developers even
universe there is a lot of crazy about
her off so you are not able to find it a
correct fit for detective officer DevOps
is actually a rule which lies somewhere
into development and operation right a
developer news in a very well and
operations guys knows the functional
aspect of the half way for example for
example in logging software right but
the developer new moves there what are
the changes we can do in order to
generate more verbose long or Morgan of
mood Oh Ethan said informative laughs
wait he can trick the change he can
create unloaded into the change so he
knows the a very good education very
much developer knows what
to find into the law right so if my log
is in hitting lot of blogs and i'm not
getting any valuable information into
the logs it is useless from functional
perspective right so a divorce are the
guys who sits in between right and and
these are the people who actually knows
development there are no operations
breaks open they know the technical
aspect in that they know the functional
aspect in so and when they know both
they can do an auto machine ate based on
the functional requirement of this line
in go ahead and treat a logger right or
they can write your own locker similarly
if they want to over commit something
they can go ahead and very easily
automate certain things because they
move the system the Acme tunnels and
under functionality and equipment right
so this this zone is very important and
and it is growing if we have huge demand
for DevOps into the market but we are
not able to find suitable tips and this
is world Cardinals and Forester sees it
going forward there will be a huge gap
huge gap between the demand and supply
for automation engineers so this is the
policy sophs it talks about this would
have on me no ammonia of system
administration experience it should be
well versed with Lena's let me know that
means solution can go ahead with it
every certified see subsidence
associate level right yeah this is for
developers these are the basic
certification that you can go ahead I
have it so you should have a very good
experience in 20 the time consider
development development side it's not 10
to 15 it is actually 1 25 years of
experience in in development you can go
ahead with AWS certified a developer
associate and apologies for this typo
here
we have cloud of evidence we have
another separate certification so as I
said that there are multiple types of
certification of Betty basically
categorized in development alterations
and and you can say administration for
development we have a bomb that allowed
our certifications for administrations
we have six offs automation automation
results and then we have fought
administration and we have the cloud
orchid associate outlet also skatin
professional good certifications are
available now I just want to give you a
my perspective leg none of these are
something like you can rank one and the
other right all of them are equal a
system admin for a country is equally
important as a developer which is
equally important and then automation
engineer right so everyone has to
respect the job which are other people
are doing and then only we can learn
from your experience so then we can grow
right so that none that's how it it was
aunt Hannah net so future trading
technologies as I said that oh right now
we are not able to like not be a Batman
and Forrester is not able to predict the
technology evolution after 2025 right
they have only a said they have
forecasted a technology evolution were
the next I to take a guess which says
that it is exponential they it is going
to be a huge demand and the industry is
going to be more consumable centric
consumer-centric in the sense that oh
but you can see right of people nowadays
are not moving and shopping in rita's
option on or in a big markets right
there shopping online and this trend is
increasing and that's how the company
like Amazon and flickered ebay are
making a lot of money right there Gordon
they're they're growing like that so the
market is becoming more consumer centric
right and the technology which
support which supports that it obviously
needs to be very volatile in nature like
cloud so here so it has to prove it has
to swing based on the demand nature of
the team on it also has to change right
for example include a amazon things let
okay from IE for mass-market i want to
switch to some other business things
they need not putting guys they have
enough money there enough infrastructure
i can go ahead and spend few months of
development and they can switch off
their businesses first us switch their
business to some other to meet some of
the user story right so that is how it
is safely this is very important hybrid
cloud a hybrid cloud in something like
where you have private job in publix lab
so let me tell you something about the
private club till now what we have this
is the public club a derby this is the
market leader for public long the same
kind of but that that is for general
businesses the stories like he almost
you can sit a certain extent of
retelling or retail industries or real
estate industries or maybe comment in
the streets it is suspicious if it is
one stops off the public love but where
data security comes into the picture
right data is very very important they
do not want the data to leave the
country or even in certain cases the
estate in us the laws in one state is
different from sometimes it is different
from the laws in other strips right so
they want to bind your data to the
particular strain and the one by the
rules and the regulations right like
banks healthcare industries in the ad
keys a few of the companies right
healthcare industries of that Nolan lexi
diamond and and maybe even state bank of
india they create your own private cloud
but in this private traveling is
actually you can see it's a prototype of
the public cloud he does it it has tried
to imitate all the features of the
public now but they want to secure it
into the only dissenter because of
security concerns
okay so yeah so I'm getting few portions
I will start again to the ocean let me
go ahead and start taking the place it's
gone okay so then you this is saying it
we are you should talk about the
security concerns on public cloud and
then ah what a excellent private cloud
addresses etc so when is yes also vertex
art with a solution public cloud data is
as secure as you are privately out later
but there is a catch here for example it
rules does not have any data center here
in India like and government of linea
has a regulation that the details of the
patients or health care industry for
example all the details of the man
hanging in financial domain company so
not leave the country right it should be
we'll get in the boundary of the country
now these are the earth of businesses
like the banks the health care they
cannot go no.4 cloud services right
because firstly AWS Delta really doesn't
rain in here and secondly they are
bounded by the government regulations
right and so listen on the government
regulations right and then that it
doesn't have little toward above the
security you can always challenge that
to public cloud data is not Sakura
Sakura is a private cloud data but I
will disagree with that why because a
the same technology of for encryption
the same technology for auditing the
same agencies which all or its supply
witnessing to is auditing a public data
center right but you just that your
private it essentially the singleton yet
there is only one customer right and you
believe alike or other flower or the
enterprise owner like who is only the
company believe that much narrator is
secured because it's asim building in
and there is no excess from outside
right but I believe that now beta is
more securing still net aw smooth that
then it's the multi communicating moment
that Moloch
reliance on the cloud right and there is
still able to protect your data it means
that if they actually spawn enhancing
their security technology there has not
been a single beach they reach your data
theft issue into the aid of Lucas in in
the whole history of a double their
senses text existence right so this
shows that public cloud is relatively
more secure because of the technology
that uses for encryption decryption
tunneling which which is the best in the
industry right and second thing it gets
regularly or heated by third party right
which audit see and and there are lot of
brute force or a lot of scans on your a
daytime data center sense try to
double if there is any big chance of
data theft or not that's okay Oh
certified over a double estate as angels
okay i'm getting few other questions
okay there is one question from jenny
didn't see this is recording the rule of
it slow engineer in an enterprise so a
ginseng if you're going up so move it
then the rule of X out engineer differs
from the tight or combination that he is
drawing for example if you were at a
club development so it primarily prince
among the goal that that were there your
developer even automation or a your
system and me make sure your developer
right you will get a opportunity to work
on to the platform which is provided by
either which is hosted on this on to the
club so for example in other developer i
want to have great jenkins install right
and i also want to develop no work work
on uncheck java projects and there are
many people who are working on that and
then we can go ahead and watch the food
we can check out the poor we can compile
the code to online testing we can do
singulation writing within quickly span
of time waiting down to wait for
something to someone to set up now
infrastructure I can do it myself right
and get my afraid so
this is a typical role of your cloud
developer right a cloud automation
engineer what it does that okay so
during evening us on the morning ask
people do online purchases the right or
name is on over flipkart right so the
traffic moves so they have to clean
automation that learning morning and
doing evening ethin when the traffic
rules there will be surging the traffic
and other packing infrastructure should
be warmed up in order to get to that
request and when the request slows down
and goes below a threshold of the
infrastructure to be removed because
they don't want to pay of unnecessary
costs a very bleak a very limited
traffic right this is the work of
typical work of automation king of a lot
of things other than this like they
analyze the logs they also analyze the
cookies they also analyzed from where
the traffic is coming in the traffic is
okay or not oh is that someone is trying
to do it also act that is Tina have
service will have on your website is
there any website which is crawling
you're a plot crawling effect Culloden
eww its website for repeatedly before
knowing what is the price of each items
right so that is how they are take care
of everything cloud or a machine gene
does our division takes care of the
security part also takes care little bit
about the development also takes a few
chunk of their system and I mean walk
right so this these are the different
fools that you will Arjun see saying
that having the job market for any way
to do the certified Fisher with one to
yourself or fix means you have humans
opportunity and see opportunity in the
sense of fulani opportunity in the sense
of getting a good package outside if you
are able to a certified there is no
other certification we can match it in
this certification head of now in terms
of love for the development or the
seesaw ops or maybe a system had me more
architect
so you can see saying that is there any
sequencing with the certification to be
done first so you can see there is no
pulse sequence these are three different
rules so it depends whether you want to
play all the rules in your company or do
you want to learn everything and get
yourself certified or do you want to
toss your career in one of these domain
with practical depends upon you you can
do all the certification there is no
order to it you can do one
certifications are really get it renewed
over period of time and stick to the
domain you should like to so raucous has
one cushion the case cushion is I am
working in the fighting continued I have
much experience in this domain but I
want to learn nanotechnology and want to
keep tight in this domain for
infringement analysis how your course
would help me for that so that is a your
question is quite interest cuboid Valley
um first of all for in doing any kind of
so if you are patient engineer and you
are doing Laura stop on the development
side of automation side or even on on
the infrastructure sector you are you
handing lot of datas or you one put all
su kare here where you want to create
your own pit in infrastructure or you
want to suggest a the company to create
a to actually virtualize the pit Inc of
infrastructure if I correctly understand
you can go ahead and explore it first
let's go and mix story if you feel that
it is something which which fits in how
and if you feel that you have an
opportunity here to learn something new
and then make use of it in your own
domain you're more than welcome do have
to go ahead spend some time alone a
little bits and pieces of eight of us
and and that will give you a glimpse of
hope everything fits in your requirement
or if we pay attention right so
that like self evaluation will be able
to tell you clearly okay someone who is
having a question I am a pocket are you
as I am in 90s m.phil and don't have any
technical profile so my question is will
it be a good idea to the static
variation cloud computing any fears then
what should be the path to start a
second question so should I go for aw
thesaurus go from your perspective so
manager get licked so a given into
ideation please rate and 90s in itself
is a very vast domain right it is more
related to the services in the security
part correct if i'm not wrong if you
know cloud right so imagine a situation
where your duty is working on cloud
right they can be lot of concerns right
you've made a you me up 12 for example
you want to subscriber IDs in a SAS
software to use it and not going to the
business which I'm just telling you as
an example you want to subscribe for an
IT s into and want to use it you are
well aware about the physical
implementation of the tool but you need
to learn them let what is the best ideas
into what are the best places for that
into the cloud right so it may not help
you directly but it can help you in
pointing to the right direction in which
you could cross street you can pause you
a Korean right I dsm as a SAS platform
okay how secure it is okay what are the
various of companies which are framing
right it will be basically SAS model
what are the enhancement on top of it
can be mean like how it fit how it fits
into my career so my recommendation for
you is to go ahead and evaluate more on
itsm as a cloud service provider to you
because you must be working on on
I'm problem management change management
right knowledge management documentation
right got a lot of things you will be
working if not not not even the
technical if you go and go to the
functional aspect of it cloud has a lot
of charity in the to provide you a good
in that into ideas and longing so I
think from that perspective I would also
recommend you to go ahead and really
more on on on like idea same as the
cloud service and then only you will
start realizing that ok I with I have to
go for technical or shall I go for a
functional I dsm roll very so put an N
do miss la is having pushing mud what
was the post syllabus for you double the
certifications so the host the labels
depends upon the certification that you
are choosing it is different for
different horses or cloud architect you
have to move on most of the services
which is provided by year aw this
including ec2v pc of redshift stop in
stock so you need to know all the
services then you need to know what is
the collaborative is stuff you need to
integrate all this difference so this is
then how we can go ahead and create it
with business story so you have
individual services that you have to
study then you have a quiz then you have
projects so it goes like that
so there is a question from gincy can
you please connect the dots between the
Big Data technology and the cloud
computing capias we should have the
certification so beautiful so you can
see a big data is again is not a new
concept right if and any one of you or
even you has been into the big data
domain right Big Data exam a is one of
the oldest is one of the oldest among
the oldest i can say domain earlier used
to him mph cluster right you go ahead
thumb in the job to the NPA in own and
then is a segregate job in christmas
merchants and used to do stick to the
rustlin right and then in that case we
used to have a distributed file systems
and Mitch no talks to each other process
then more one node identifies that okay
that node is unhealthy then committed
boosted master nor even master no moves
ahead and post a worker nodes so that is
how it was working are you the same
thing has gone ahead a step little fun
we have laid the set of services in oh
we have one service I via phone service
we have a few of the services like sdfs
rate we have also other so this is
encapsulated in that and that pretty
much works in the same way right one of
this challenge with Nikita is this king
for example if I want to submit quantity
of data for processing today tomorrow
I'll 1.5 TB of the attack on site then I
have to add few more machines right and
they after and again the 1tb of data
drops to my click on your gb of data for
processing then i have to reduce the
infrastructure right so let me off this
kb it that elasticity is not in building
to the podiatrist structure right when
you start using AWS you will think that
Eden this is having one service called
elastic MapReduce go ahead feed your
feet tight our infrastructure fueling
the data wait for processing to the head
node i'll upload it from some ftp server
it will distribute it will launch as
many incense that's required for
processing the data and then
will destroy instances when it is not
running any data analytics traveled
across three to operate and you'll be
able to save the cost so the elasticity
factor of the cloud is actually back
pain you're a big data of requirements
right so that we it is very useful man
VW's architect certification is the
rights education for this I will try to
pick up few more questions okay so there
is a dress from the book I will take few
minutes for me to this very I just
explained the query from one yeah so we
took this talks about those dissolves
see subsys basically it develops an
automation engineer so they said that
the enemy which sits in between the
development and operations right and
they understand the operation spot Oh as
good as they are they understanding
about development part this is the rule
for those kind of engineers and they are
in very much keema right here you need
to learn a lot of stuff and you can
actually capitalize you can enhance your
knowledge heap and capitalize on it to
be with their units after doing the
certification so yes now let me change
it any question unanswered
okay the UC solution and joe says
they're working in digital marketing
professional 12 locked up and getting it
is excellent go ahead and learn it you
are you trying to use it from technical
perspective if you want to use it from
your perspective I think it is the best
platform 45 knowing something from
dekhna taking your productivity is
equally important knowing it from
functional perspective if I know the
functions of my applications I can get
it a developed for example if you take
the example of I'm just not overstating
but if you take the example of apple
founder right who is the apple founder
one question for you all of you Steve
Jobs right so if you look at the Steve
Jobs right Steve Jobs or nada
technologist but he was a visionary he
was the person who was delic weird about
the functions right he wanted to develop
an underfill of hardware an application
software which actually changed the way
people looked at technology right iphone
nobody thought that i have i will have a
small phone in my pocket which which can
do n number of things iphone was equally
innovative ipad physically in your
innovative and it is carrying into
innovation right so those are the
technology changes so that's why is it
you I say that Steve Wozniak and Steve
Jobs I fully important whether you were
technologist or you I've is no
functional consultant you have a very
good career going I just try to fill the
gap and and thus try to learn as much as
said oh with that said I would like to
end this fashion now any question you
can go ahead and write em into supported
Harry retire who they will be able to
answer it answer your queries or they
will be able to follow it
so I have a very good morning for those
who join from us and have variable
evening for those were going from India
I've already bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
