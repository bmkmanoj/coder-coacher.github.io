today we'll be learning Python scripting
so let's just quickly jump on to an
agenda and let's see what's there in a
plate today so we'll start off this
session by first discussing how
scripting language is different from any
other programming language after that we
will be discussing about Python and the
most popular versions that are out there
in the market today then they will
likely jump on to the practical aspects
wherein we will learn about different
modules in Python how can you perform a
double scripting using the boto module
so under this topic I will be telling
you how can you write scripts to launch
an ec2 instance or create an s3 bucket
in AWS and all of this can be done by
just typing few lines of code guys and
find towards the end we will be going to
the basics of GUI programming and will
implement some of that as well so I hope
you got the objective of this session
now let us begin with the very first
topic that is scripting versus
programming language what is the
difference between the scripting
language and a programming language so
scripting is used to automate certain
tasks now there is one more thing that
scripting language is less code
intensive as compared to a traditional
programming language they do not require
the compilation step and I rather
interpreted so for example a Java
program needs to be compiled before
running whereas normally a scripting
language like Python JavaScript or PHP
need not become pi now as you can see
here in Java it creates a class file and
then the output will be displayed
whereas in Python all the codes are
executed at the runtime so programming
languages are compiled whereas your
scripting languages are interpreted so
basically a compiler translates your
entire code and then runs the program
there as an interpreter if translates
and runs your code one instruction at a
time now I would also like to add here
that python is just not the scripting
language it can also compile a Python
code into byte code and then interpret
it just like Java does and it's nothing
like one language is better or worse
than the other every language has bronze
and cones next let us not deviate at
understand the next topic which is
introduction to Python so python which
is very famous many big clients like
google youtube uses it so it must be
having some great features so now let me
just list a few of them so first of all
python is easy free and open
the first reason Lions held that it is
extremely readable since it closely
resembles our English language also it
was created by guru vandalism in 1989
and was released first in 1991 next it
supports your procedure ended as well
object on the program now I am only told
you that it's an interpreted language
which also a high-level language where
one does not need to bother about
low-level details you can simply write
your code in English and Python to the
intern convert into low-level details
then moving ahead Python is portable as
well as extensible so by portability I
mean it is fit for many platforms the
apply next platform beat Macintosh feed
solar soy or any other then it is
extensible so by extensibility of Python
I mean you be completely integrate Java
as well as dotnet components with it
isn't this great guys you can do a lot
of things with Python next let us move
ahead and talk about the popular
versions of Python so there a lot of
confusion between Python 2 and Python 3
let me first clear this confusion and
then we'll move ahead with the practical
demo so if you're learning new just jump
into Python 3 because it has come up
with some neat and clean features and
also it is the present and the future of
the programming language but if you're
already learning Python 2 or 2.7 or any
version of 2x family don't worry guys
Python 2 is not too different in terms
of your core language they are just a
few differences here and there and if
you learn to code in Python 2 it will
hardly take you some time to learn the
differences and the syntax so we all
know that python 2 is used for many
years many organizations make use of
version 2 or 2.7 which contains a large
number of libraries with a wonderful
support community but again with the
Riesz of Python 3 many libraries require
support of the latest version so let's
say if you are doing web development and
using a lot of libraries then you must
go for Python 3 also python 3 has
recently gained a lot of attention from
the developers there is lot of
additional features such as your overall
performance has been increased then you
have a better interpreter history
also there are Auto completion features
and you have many more like that it has
also fixed some of the minor glitches
from the older version and released
Python 3 which is more stronger so it is
faster and quite a stable version till
now so as I already told you guys python
2
is the legacy whereas Python three is
the present and the future of the
programming language so you can learn
either version of Python which you can
later tailor
according to your needs even if you
start learning from Python 2.7 it will
be a no big deal to ship the latest
version as far as your focus remains to
learn Python so I guess enough of theory
part next let us discuss the various
modules in Python so a module in Python
is basically a file which contains
Python definitions and statements now as
you can see here I will be talking about
these modules so it is majorly
classified into sis module then OS
modules sub-process
Mac random date time model and the JSON
module simply begin with the very first
module that is the SIS module so now sis
module basically provides to the
information about the constants
functions and the methods of Python
interpreter so it is basically
responsible for controlling and
interacting with the interpreter now for
example if you want to know any
information on operating system or the
version of Python you are using you will
be using this module for that so first
let us import sis using the import
statement so it must actively show you
how this can be done so let me just open
my IDE that is pycharm
all right so I'm in my PI chunk
community edition project named as
Python scripting so now inside this
project I will created a Python file
let's say I name this SS module
so now the first thing I need to do is
to import this module so all you have to
do is to just type in import sis now
let's go ahead and print the version
let's say I want to know the current
version of Python so what I'll do i type
in print sister version and let me just
run it
so as you can see here the kind was your
Python that I am using is Python three
point six point one let me just zoom
this a bit alright next if I have to
print the command-line arguments which
is path to the script so what I can do I
can simply type in let's say print since
dot argv
so basically argv is a list which
contains the command-line arguments
passed to a script so let me just run
this again so as you can see here we are
in this location which is indeed drive
in IOC folder then I have a project name
followed by the file that I've just
created so as you can see here argument
follows the script name so whatever
argument we have currently we don't have
it right now but whatever we have it it
will follow the script name now
similarly we have a lot of functions we
have stderr which basically stores your
error messages then we have stdin STD
out which is used to accept the input
from the user whereas your STD out
method prints you to the screen then you
have an exit function which basically
tells your interpreter to quit or you
can say it's a direct way to end a
Python script next let me go back to the
presentation and let's see what is my
next module so next is my OS module
which stands for operating system so it
must be pretty clear that this module is
used to interact to my operating system
also the primary use of this module is
to create folders remove folders move
your folders or sometimes change your
working directory as well so you can
also access the names of your file path
by just typing in list dir so let me
just show you some of the operations
with this OS module if I go back to my
pie chart it will create one more file
here and I'll name it as OS module
so now first of all I have to import the
modules who are typing import OS now let
us first print the current working
directory so I'll type in print oh s dot
get kind working directory that is CWD
and let me just run this now as you can
see here that my kind working directory
has been printed now I can also change
the directory so for that what you need
to do you can just need to type in CH
dir and just give the path so it means
do that as well as well type in OS dot
CH dir that is for change directory and
inside this I'll be giving a path so
let's say I want to go in this type
through only D Aisha Python scripting so
I'll go to my files so let's say I am in
my D Drive and inside IOC folder I am
creating a new fold over here let's say
you let the name be new folder only and
I'll just go inside this and I'll copy
the path from here now I'll go back to
my pycharm again and mint paste the path
over here so remember guys whenever you
copy or paste the path you have to be
careful for the slashes you have to keep
in mind that either double backslash
will book or a single front slash we
work so I'll just type in here double
backslash and I just print my current
working directory so I'll just cut it
from here and it's a spaceship below
that and now let me just run this so as
you can see guys my current working
directory has been changed to new folder
so this new folder is we have just
created and using the command CH dir I
have just changed my path so we have
talked how to create a different
directory all together but what if you
need a directory in an existing
directory so yes you can go ahead and
create a directory as well for that what
you need to do you just need to type in
OS top mkdir and swift me ass typing OS
dot mkdir that is make directory and I
can write the path over here so let me
just take this path only and in spite of
new folder I want a folder named as
Eddie Rekha let me just comment above
sections
all right so as you can see here we
don't have a directory named as a dareka
so now let me just run this
all right so remember guys a double
backslash or a single firm slash will
only work so I just changes to double
backslash and now I just run this
all right so here it says that in the
name only exists so let us type in a
Dirac r1 and now if I just run this
so here you can see inside my D folder
then in ayesha folder I have one folder
named as ad Rekha one chick me just go
to my folder and here it must be a
breaker one so as you can see here I
have a folder named Asteria Rekha one so
if you don't want to do it over here you
can directly do it in your PyCharm also
so for that lets me just copy this path
this is my pressing directory so I'll
just copy my path and over here I'll be
pasting in this path so now this folder
or you can just write area Rekha and
I'll just type in double backslash and
if I run this code you will see the
editor co-director here so let me just
run this code
so if you run this code you will see
that a dreg a folder or you can see the
directory has been created over here now
you can also remove this I trip by just
right-clicking it and delete it but now
if you want to do it by codes so for
that what you can do you can simply type
in OS dot remove directory that is rmdir
and then you can just mention the path
so I'll just copy the path so now I
don't need this 80 legged I trivializes
paste it over here I'll just comment
this line and now let me just run it so
as you can see a draga directory which
was felt over here has been deleted next
similarly you can delete a file as well
so let's say I don't want to delete a
directory instead of that I want to
delete one file so let me just delete
this module so let me just copy the path
from here and to remove a file I just
need to type in OS dot remove and I just
paste the path over here remember guys
to put the double backslash or a single
front flash so I just put a double
backslash I just come in the buff line
and I'll just run this so as you can see
it says model miss peasant over here has
been deleted now next you can also learn
about another sub model of power
switches OS dot path so it provides a
range of useful methods to manipulates
the files and directories should may
implement some of the methods of this
also so first let us talk about join so
OS that path Jo join is one of the
important Oh a spot tools so it takes
one or more paths and joins them by
using the current OS path separator say
to join two paths
so let me just comment this so now I
need to perform the join operation so I
just simply type in OS dot path toward
join and inside this I be writing two
paths so first of all what I will do I
will just simply copy my directory path
so I'll take it from here
I'll pass it over here then I'll be
writing another part let's say I want to
join the OS module so I will just copy
the path I'll type it over here I'll add
the double backslash
all right so now let me just run this
so as you can see here my OS model has
been joined with the Python script ring
so next you can also split these paths
so basically split function it takes a
path name and turns it into the two
parts that is the directory path and the
file name so for that what you can do
you can type in print and say OS but
part
pasty pasty let me just copy the spot
alright and I'll just comment this let
me just now run them so as you can see
it has splitted into two parts first is
the directory and second is the Python
file that is present over here so that
is how you can use another function that
is split next you can also use another
function that is exists so this will
basically tell that whether the path
exists or not so it will return you a
true or a false value so Isis type in
over here exists I need to mention a
path so in spite of this let's say I
want the OS module path so I will just
copy the path and paste over here I'll
add the double backslash and I just run
this so now as you can see this path
exists so it is giving me the value true
now similarly if the path doesn't exist
it will give me the value as false so
these are some of the methods which are
used in the OS module next let me go
back to my presentation and pick up the
next module
so my next module is sub-process so this
model basically lets you interact with
operating system to create new processes
pass the information into and out of
them and then get the return codes so it
can be used by using the coil function
so you can simply write sub process call
and what will it do it will basically
run a command wait for the commands to
finish and then gives back the return
code so this is pretty much basic guys
next let us talk about the next module
that is the Matt module so as the name
says it performs various mathematical
function let's say if you want to find
out sine of X or let's say tan of X you
can do it very easily using this module
you can also convert a number from
radians to degree or vice versa or you
want to calculate the natural log or
let's say log base 10 and a lot of other
things
so using this math module you can
perform angular conversions hyperbolic
functions special functions and you can
do a lot of other things so let me just
implement few of it for you so again go
back to my PI charm I'll create one more
file let's say this is maths module so
first of all I need to import it so I'll
type in import math so now let me just
return the value of constant so for that
what I will be doing I'm typing in math
the first typing in print and inside
that I will be printing the value of pi
all right so let me just run this so as
you can see here the value of pi' has
been printed next what you can do you
can determine the value of a constant
also so if me just type in math dot e so
this one basically returns me the value
of constant e so as you can see here the
value of e has been printed next what
you can do you can also convert an angle
from radians to degree so for that what
I've been doing I will be typing in
print math dot degrees and side that I
will be writing any value let's say zero
point one and let me just print it now
so as you can see here the value has
been converted from irradiance to degree
that is five point seven two similarly
you can find the cosine of X or you can
say any value in radians in degrees or
anything so let me just do that as well
so I'll just type in print math dot a
cause and inside this I'll be giving a
value let's say zero point five and let
me just comment the above statements
and now let me just run this so that you
guys will not get confused so here as
you can see the cosine value has been
printed next I want to do it for sine as
well so I can simply type in a sign let
me just run this so here the value of
sine has been printed similarly you can
do for tan as well let me just type in a
tan and I'll be giving the value let's
say five and it means printed now so as
you can see here the value has been
printed so why am i writing a because it
will basically return the arctangent of
X ingredients which is the value press
it over here you can also type in let me
just copy this and let me just paste it
over here
all right so in spite of writing a tan
you can simply type in course and inside
that I will be given the value let's say
three and let me just print it now so
here it tells me the cosine of X or you
can say the cosine of three ingredients
now we have a lot of other functions as
well so it means implement power and
logarithm functions to let me just
comment this till here and I'll just
copy it I will place it over here so it
must implement some of the power and the
guide tube functions so I will just type
in math dot exp and inside that I will
be giving a value to so this is
basically they turned me areas to part
two so if I just run this so as you can
see here it returns me the value of e
raised to power two
next let me implement my new admin
function as well let's copy this first
and instead of this I'll be typing in
Matt dot log and here I'll be saying X
comma base so here with ban argument you
can return the natural logarithm of X to
the base E and with two arguments you
can return the log of X to the given
base so if me just do that as well I
just typing X space there or you can say
10 base 10 let me just run this now so
we know that log 10 base 10 is 1 so it's
giving me the value 1 next let us go
back to my presentation and let's see
what is the next module so next is my
random module so this module will
basically helps you to generate random
numbers so it's a pseudo-random number
generator for various distribution let's
say you don't want to type the number so
you ask your computer to generate some
random numbers and that is how it is
used
let me just go back to PI Chun and let
us implement few of the operations of
this random module so now let me just go
ahead and I'll create one more file
which I'll name as random module
all right so first of all I need to
import the model that is random next let
me just print some random number so for
that what I will be doing I be typing in
print random dot R and range and I
specify the range so I'll type in 0
comma 50 I can simply say 50 and let me
just print this so this will basically
give me the number
which will never be greater than 50 so
as you can see here it gives me the
number 2 they let me run it again it has
given me 25 let me run it again it is
given 38 and so on the numbers will be
generated but again it will not exceed
the number that is 50 now if I want to
make this in a range of let's say I want
to make it in the range of 0 to 50 so
here it will just give me the numbers
between 0 and 50 and also you can add
some steps to it so let's say I want the
step size to be 10 so let me just print
this and let us see what does this step
size me so I hope you see it's giving me
the result in step size of 10 so it's
giving me 10 then is giving me 30 then
it's giving me 10 again 20 so basically
it gives me the output between 0 to 50
and in the step size of 10 so it will
not be less than 0 and I will not be
greater than 50 now you can also change
the step size let me just change the
step size to 5 and now let me just run
this so as you can see here it's giving
me in step size of 5 so here it has been
printed 25 that's giving me 20 that's
giving me 5 similarly there will be
numbers that will be generated now
next if you want this Interiors so what
you can do you can simply type in print
random don't run in and you can specify
the range so let's say I want the change
in let's say 0 20 it means post comment
this and let me now print this so now it
will give me the random numbers or you
can see the impeding numbers between the
range that is 0 to 20 so here it's
giving me 9 lens giving me 2 it's giving
me 6 and hence the number will be
generated like these so now let me go
back to my presentation and let's see
what is my next module so my next model
is date time module so this model
basically includes the tools for working
with dates time and their combinations
so the time mode
includes the tools for working with time
and dates in the recent past to the near
future so it focuses mostly on
manipulating time based on the
computer's internal representations of
thing so let me go back to pipe job and
it implements some of the functions of
this module so I will just create a new
file let's say time module and first of
all I need to import it so I will just
type in import date time next for nets
prints today's day so for that what I be
doing either typing in print date time
dot date dot today so now let me just
run this so as you can see here the
current date has been printed so today
it's 21st March 2018 so now you can also
perform some arithmetic function on this
for example when you perform an
arithmetic function on date time objects
you will get the result in a time delta
object so basically their attributes are
days seconds and microseconds so i'll
create a new object let's same now i'll
say date time or date time
. today
so now what we'll do I'll bring the
difference between the two dates so what
I will do I am applying some arithmetic
operations to them where you will get
the result in a time delta object shrink
metate one more object let's say other
and say other dot date equals to date
time dot date time and I mention a late
let's say 1994
now let me just print the difference
between these two objects should I say
print now - Adam so now let me just
comment the above print statement so
that you guys do not get confused and
now let me just run this
all right so here I have not specified a
comma so now let me just run this
alright so as you can see here
difference between these two dates has
been printed so I have already told you
that the attributes for these are days
seconds and microsecond so here it is
telling me that 8563 days are there and
then we have the other retailing as well
let's say I see in the last module that
is my JSON module so JSON is popular
communicating between the web servers
and the clients so in Python the JSON
module provides an API singer to convert
in memory Python objects to a serialized
representation that is known as JSON or
you can say JavaScript object notation
and a wiser versa so JSON has the
benefit of having implementations in
many languages and specially JavaScript
making it suitable for your
interrogation communication so this JSON
module provides an easy way to encode
and decode data in JSON so now let me
just go back to my pycharm and i just
implement this as well so I will create
one more file JSON module first of all I
need to import it so I'll just type in
import JSON so now what we'll be doing
I'll be force typing in some data in
JSON so let's say I have an employee
data so I will say employee data equal
to
let's say I have some people
let me just give some attributes to them
so I say the name let's say the name is
Yoshi then I specify and emails well
type in email and then I'll just type in
let's say hey at the achievement calm
and then let me just give one more email
id
let's same hundred email again
then I'll give one more attribute let's
say married or you can say the marital
status will say false and I'll just
close this
similarly I'll take one more so I'll
just copy it from here I just paste it I
just changed the name so let's say this
time it's an ammeter I'll change
some email ID as well and now let me
just print it so I'll just print this
employee data
so as you can see here my JSON has been
printed now let me do it in Python as
well so I'll just take a variable it's a
data and I just load this JSON so I'll
say json dot loads inside this i'll be
just passing my json that is my employee
plus and I'll just print it
let me just run this now
all right just giving me some edit all
right so I haven't closed this so I'll
just close this all right so I guess it
will work now so let me just run this
now yes so as you can see here my JSON
which is being printed over here and
that is how I just load the data in
Python it gives me this result so
basically it has converted your JSON to
a dictionary so whenever you load JSON
into Python it uses some conversions
such as your JSON object has been
converted to dictionary so as you can
see here your data has been in key value
pairs now so this is my key and this is
the value of the key similarly I have
another key which is email and this is
the value to it so basically whenever
you load the data in Python it has the
object or you can see the JSON object is
converted to a dictionary now there are
also few more changes which has been
done so if you see here such as your
array has been converted to list then if
you see here you have a JSON which says
that matter is false and if you see here
it has been converted to the upper case
false
so these are some of the conversions
which Python do this one with a version
where you have a value which is null and
then if you see it over here it will be
changed to none so that is how whenever
you load a JSON into Python it uses some
conversions also this JSON module
provides an easy way to encode and
decoding JSON so there are basically two
main functions which are json dot dumps
and json dot loads so I already told you
about json dot loads so here you have a
function which says json dot load and
inside that you can just load a file
similarly you have json dot loads so
basically this as a difference of s so
whenever you want to load up string so
for that what you can do you can just
typing json dot loads and inside the
brackets you can pass on the string
value now you have another function
which is called a json dot dump so using
this function you can just load the json
object to a file and again if you type
in json dot dumps you will be having an
output JSON object as a string so that
is how JSON object plays a major role in
the modules in Python so now let's move
on to our next topic that is aw
scripting so here we were talking about
the boto module which is an AWS SDK for
Python
so an AWS favorite formal to task first
of all will be creating an ec2 instance
and then we create an s3 bucket now let
us see how you can configure this boto
module so first of all to import what we
just need to type in pip install Bo to 3
and once the installation has been done
you also need to install the AWS
command-line so for that we just need to
type in pip install AWS CLI many times
you have some problems regarding PIP so
what you can do you can go to Google and
you can just download the MSI file for
AWS CLI then one this is done you can
just type in AWS configure and then
they'll be asking you for the access key
so now let us go to my PI champ and let
us implement how we can do that
so I'll just create one mol file let's
say AWS scripting so first of all I just
go to my terminal so I'll just type in
fist install boot o 3
so now this will take some time
so now it tells me that the requirement
is already satisfied so I already have
my Bordeaux 3 installed so next what you
need to do you need to install the AWS
CLI so I'll just type in pip install AWS
CLI and hit enter
so again I have already installed my AWS
CLI so again it's giving me this
statement that the requirement already
satisfied next step you need to type in
AWS configure so I just type in AWS
configure so now as you can see it's
asking me for the a dumbness access key
ID so what I've been doing I've been
going to the aid of list management
console and be generating a user which
has an access key to it so once you
configure your AWS it will ask you for
the AWS access key so now to find an
access key what you need to do you need
to go to your AWS management console and
there you have to create a user which
will be having an access key to it
select Amina's go to my AWS management
console alright so this is my aid of
this management console over here I will
be just typing in I am which basically
stands for your Identity and Access
Management so over here you just need to
go to users and just add a user over
here so I just create one user over here
so I'll say user I give a name to it so
let's say user one let me just give the
permissions to it just click on next
so I'll look at some policies then let
me add some admin sheiter access and
then just quickly go and click on next
so here as you can see I have a username
I have access type and you have all the
required information then you just need
to create a user so I just click on
create user it just takes some time so
as you can see here I have the user
which is named as user 1 then I have the
access key ID and I have the secret
access key along with the password so
here what do you need to do you can
simply download the CSV so I am just
downloading a CSV from here now why I am
telling you to download it because later
if you face any problem with the AWS
authentication you will not be able to
access these keys so the better way is
to just download the CSV
if I just open the CSV and let me show
you what all is present over there so as
you can see here I have the username I
have the password I have the access key
ID and I have the secret access key and
this is the console link so what I've
been doing and we just copying this
access key ID and paste it to my PI job
so here it's asking me the aid of his
access key so I just paste it over here
then ask me for the aw secret access key
so I will again go to that CSV and I
will copy this and paste it over here
then tells me the default region which
is us is 2 okay
and I just click on enter so here my AWS
has been configured and the default
region is the US east so now let me just
go to my coding part and let us just
write the script for it but first let's
understand what exactly they are so easy
to basically stands for your elastic
cloud computing which is a web service
which provides resizable compute
capacity in the cloud so it is basically
designed to make the web scale computing
easier for developers so it allows the
users to rent virtual computers and wish
to run their own computer application so
there are many big companies who use an
ec2 like limbo Guinea Netflix NASA and
many more like that so now let me just
go to my coding part and let us just
write the script for it so first of all
I just go ahead and import boto 3 next
what I've been doing I'll be creating an
ec2 instance so for that what I will be
doing I'll be creating an object let's
say easy - then I'll say ec2 equals to
bordeaux 3 dot resource
and inside this I'll be passing ec2 so
here I'll be writing a script so to
launch an ec2 instance without manually
going to the AWS console and adding the
instance over there
so I can show you that as well so if we
just go to AWS console
so here as you can see the first compute
services ec2 so Isis click on it
so what you can do again come to this
area based management console and launch
the instance from here but in spite of
this what I will be doing I will be
writing a script so that if ec2 instance
can be launched automatically so next
what I have to do I have to type in
instance is equals to e C to dot create
instance
and inside that I will be giving some
specifications to it so first of all I
bet giving the image ID or you can say
the ami which stands for Amazon machine
image so here I'll be giving that so
from where I can find this image ID so
again I go back to my Amazon console and
I'll click over launch instance
so here as you can see I have my a my or
you can say that image I despise this
copy this image ID I'll pass it over
here next I just need to give the main
count and mark out
next time is specifying the type of
instance so I have t2 dot micro
and finally I'll be printing the ID of
the instance that has been created or
that has been launched so I'll say
instance zero and I'll just type in ID
I'll just remove the extra praise all
right so here as you can see I have just
created ec2 instance where and I have
just given the image ID and specify the
min Max and the instance type so now let
me just run this or before that I just
go to my console and show you that there
are no such ec2 instance running so I go
to our instances so as you can see here
I don't have any instance now let me go
back to code and let me just run this
code now
so as you can see here it has printed me
the ID of the instance so now let me go
back to my console and let's see whether
the instance has been launched here or
not so now let me just refresh this so
yes it has been launched it has the same
instance ID which is given over here and
the instance is t2 micro and the instant
state is spending right now but it will
be launched in just a few seconds so let
us just wait for some time so as you can
see how my instance is up and running
now now you can also delete this
instance so you can also go here you can
click on actions and you can just go to
instance state and terminate it but
again if you have to do it to python
script so what you can do you can go to
a PI job again and in the stipend
instance ID so I'll specify my ID which
is this while just copied from here
then what I'll be doing I'll be just
saying instance is equals to ec2
I'll give the instanceid to it
then I'll be having response wherein I
will terminate this ec2 instance so I'll
just type in instance not terminate and
I'll just bring the response so first of
all let me just comment this part so
that the new instance is not being
generated all right so this is the code
for deleting the instance so here I have
just specify the instance ID that I need
to terminate and I'm just print the
response so now let me just run this
so as you can see here it has been
terminated we have the current state
then we have the code we have the name -
shutting down and we have the instanceid
so here it is also telling me that the
previous state was running and now it
has been changed - shutting down let me
just go to my concert in it to see
whether here we have changes or not
shake me just refresh it so here as you
can see it has been shutting down so now
I'll just wait for few seconds and it
will be terminated
so as you can see here my instance has
been terminated without manually going
to the actions and then clicking it over
here so it can simply write the Python
codes and it will indeed do the same
task for you so isn't this easy guys now
let me go back to my presentation and
let's see what is my next task so here I
have just launched an ec2 instance and
then we have terminated the state as
well moving ahead let us understand AWS
s3 so a Douglas s3 is a simple storage
which is offered by AWS so it is
basically a web service interface that
can be used to store and retrieve the
data so s3 basically stands for your
simple storage service which is a
storage for the internet so SC provides
object storage which is similar to your
file system wearing the folders are
represented as buckets and the content
of the buckets are known as the keys so
now that is move ahead and launch an s3
bucket as well so now let me create a
new file let's say s3 scripting so first
of all I need to import my boto module
so now what I'll be doing
I'm creating an s3 storage so a bit I
think in s3 boto three-dot resource the
same thing that we have done for easy to
so inspire this I'm just typing in s3
now let me go back to my AWS console and
let's see where this is present and how
can you manually create an s3 bucket so
I just go to my services and go in my
storage s3
so as you can see here I have a button
over here which says create bucket so
you can manually go and create a bucket
from here and these are the buckets that
have been stored in my account now what
I'll be doing I'll be writing a Python
script so as to create an s3 bucket
automatically for me so I'll just type
in let's say the name of the bucket well
type in bucket name and I specify a name
let's say bucket 1 and I'll try some cry
out to it so I see
response equals to f3 not create bucket
wherein I will pass on the bucket names
well say bucket is reposed took my
bucket name which is bucket one then I
just pass the configuration so I'll say
create bucket configuration
some attributes to it so I will be
giving in the first attribute that is
location constant
and I specify the location so remember
that is when you are configuring your
AWS account they gave you an option to
fill in the access key so they're also
they ask you for the default location so
there I didn't change any so I have the
default location as US East two and here
I'll just print my response
then I be just typing in the except that
is the exception except exception as
error and as print the error if any
other comes so now let me just run this
code
all right so here it's giving me an
error that in by bucket name well it's
well just change his bucket name let's
say I usually bucket so I'll just run
this code now so as you can see here I
have the response which says s3 bucket
and with the name IOC bucket so now let
me go back to my AWS console and let's
see whether the bucket has been created
here or not so here as you can see I
don't have any bucket with this name but
now let me just refresh it so now as you
can see my s3 bucket has been created so
guys this is how you can write simple
codes and implement a lot of things by
using Python so now let us go back to my
presentation and let's see what is the
next task so here we have successfully
launched an s3 bucket next let us move
on to a last topic which is the GUI
programming Python provides a various
options for developing your geo ice
which is nothing but your graphical user
interfaces so many libraries which I've
been commonly used I peek into then we
have Jethro and we have the Blake's
Python so he does just create a GUI
using P character so here this is my
library which is called as tkinter and
this is a simple code wherein you will
just generate a window so now let me go
back to my PI charm and let us see how
take into works so here I will be
creating a new file let's say gy
programming
and over here are the first importing
tkinter so I'll say import tkinter you
can also import these libraries by going
to file just going to settings
and under the project just go to the
project interpreter
and over here you can add the packages
from here so you just need to click on
this Plaza icon and the list of packages
will be displayed to you so from here
you can import any packets so now with
these since you might talk about boto so
we can just type in Berto 3 and here
Bota 3 is presence we just click it on
here and install the package so guys if
you have any shoes or any problems
regarding the code comment below the
video and I will be happy to help you
with the same so now let us just come
back to a program and let's implement
tkinter so thinking it is available for
all the versions of Python now first of
all let us check whether this the kinder
is working or not so for that it may
just type in tkinter dot underscore test
and now I just run this so here as you
can see I have this pop-up coming up
which gives me this window with two
buttons we just click me and quit so
this proves me that my peek inter is
successfully installed now what I will
do and remove this line and I will be
creating a blank window wherein we have
a closed sign minimize and all that
stuff so for that what I need to do I
need to type in from tkinter
import ek so now let us enter some dummy
text to it for that let me just remove
this so here I have just import a key so
you can also import from tkinter import
TDK
or you can simply write in from tkinter
import star now what I'll be doing I
will be creating an object or I can say
let's say it's named as dude so I'll say
it would is equal to Tk
so here the root is basically a class
which is the main window that surrounds
our interface then once we have done
that we'll give a title to this so we'll
say root dot title and inside this I
will be writing some text so let's say
first GUI using Python
adding some button as well so for that
I'll be just typing in ttk dot button
and I'll be passing in the root and a
text to those patterns let's say I want
the text as hello and Eureka I have set
a grid to it so grid is nothing but a
simple layout manager which will help
you to structure different components or
the widgets inside the window next I
just close this loop so I'll just type
in root dot main loop so as I've already
explained you that this window will keep
on running untain this you decide to
close it so here's run this code and as
you can see here I have a title to this
window as well as a button
so now let us see the different
complaints which can be used in GUI
application let me go back to my
presentation once so have discussed that
how you can create a window next what
are the different components in a GUI so
these are the basic competence which are
present in the GUI application so first
we'll start off with labels how we can
add a label then we'll see how we can
create a button so we have already seen
how you can create a button then what
we'll be doing will be creating a frame
wherein we have the label as well as
buttons then we'll go into the details
of grid where this geometry manager and
tells how you can define all the
components within a window then we'll be
talking about the radio buttons and
check buttons as well let me go back to
my PI charminator
implement these so till now we have just
given a title and a button to it
now let us create a frame so for that
let me first comment this code
all right so now let us create a frame
so frame is nothing but our widget which
surrounds the other widgets so I'll just
type in frame and it's a frame and I
pass in the root is nothing but charge
DK or you can say Peking though
next I'll create a label text so let's
say label text I'll say string math so
over here I am just defining this but
we'll be changing the text for the label
components
so now let's create a label and buttons
with some attributes so first of all I
create a labels who lets a label is
equals to label and it should be inside
of frame so I'll just type in frame and
then I have text variable equals to my
label text
so here this label text will be changing
this afterwards now let's have a button
so I say button which should be placed
inside a frame and we have a text tech
tip hey I am a button then let us just
change the text inside the label
component so for that what you can do
you can type in label text
got set inside this I can just change
the text let's say I won't type in hey
what's up and then what I'll be doing I
be just using a pack so pack is nothing
but it's geometry manager which defines
how all components are arranged inside
the window or you can say it's used to
position the widgets inside a label so I
have just packed my label then what I
need to do I need to pack my button as
well so i say button dot pack I'll pack
my frame as well
and finally I'll be just closing the
loop so I'll say do dot mean do I just
run this Sigma just expand this a bit so
as you can see here I have a label and I
have a button and as you can see here my
label text has been changed as well now
you can also have various attributes to
this Geo application you can also fill
the directions to it you can mention
whether it should be stitched among the
x axis or y axis or it should be
stretched from both of them and there
are a lot of things you can do it so
when it means implement some of the
attributes to it so I have just
committed all the above code and inside
this I'll be having one label so I'll
say label it should be in spite of frame
then I have a text let's say say and I
just simply Pat this next I have a
button which is again inside of frame
I have a text to it let's see text is B
Y and then I just bug this now when I
pass this I can mention the attributes
such as I'll say that it should be in
the left hand side then I specify the
field which should be filled in the
y-direction
so this field I actually basically it
will tell you how they will be stretched
so it will be stretched along the x axis
or Y axis or x y axis or both of them
similarly you can have many more buttons
like that so I'll just copy this line
and I'll just paste it over here well it
and I'll just change the text to it so I
will say b2 b3 b4 and then as us change
the side as well so you can distinguish
between the different buttons let's say
it's right now remember guys it should
be in uppercase so I'll say right then
here I'll say it should be top and it
said be left only and then I'll be
changing that direction also so I'll say
it should be X direction or should be
straight
among along the x axis and this should
be Y again so now what I'll be doing
I'll just pack the frame and I just
close the loop now let me just run this
all right so he'll my label should pick
capital all right now let me just run
this so now as you can see my patterns
has been arranged beautifully so here my
b1 has been set to left so here it has
been aligned left then my b2 is been
aligned right so it's again in the right
hand side and it's in the x-direction
similarly your b3 and b4 are aligned top
and left along with the directions so
that is how you again set various
attributes to AGOA application let's let
me go back to presentation and let's see
what all are left so we have learned how
to create labels then buttons then how
to create a frame in with labels and
buttons are pack then let us see how you
can create a grid so now let me go back
to my pycharm let's implement green as
well so again I just comment the whole
code for now so now what we'll be doing
I'll be first having some labels so
let's say as specify a label inside a
root and I have already mentioned root
is equal to Tk
so I'll be giving some text to it so
let's say I want text let's a name and I
want the grid to it so grid is nothing
but a geometry manager which will
basically help you to structure
different components or the widgets
inside the window so here you can
mention the row and remember guys your
index will always start from zero then
you can mention the column let's say my
column is also 0 then I have sticky and
I can give some direction let's say not
so sticky is nothing but how your widget
can expand and in which direction so you
have very directions such as North you
can type in East you can type in W for
West and you can specify according to
your needs
so I just created one label now what
I'll do I create one entry both wearing
the user get take input so I will type
in entry and I'll pass the route then I
can specify the width let's say it is
fifty dot grid and I'll again mention
the road to it let's say Rho is equal to
zero and lets it column is equals to one
and I'll have one more button let's say
button and I'll say it root and I'll
have a text which says submit and then
pass the grid functionality which is in
the row zero and column let's say five
and I just close this loop now let me
just run this code so as you can see
here I have my label which is named as
name then I have an entry box so here
you can type in any name let's say I
want to type in ABC and I have a submit
button so here the submit button will
not do anything but you can actually
save the entries to a SQL database or
anything you like so we'll be discussing
the SQL databases in all those stuff in
our upcoming sessions but in today's
sessions let us focus on GOI also if you
have any doubts you can just let me know
in the comment section and we will be
replying you as soon as possible alright
so this is done so now let me go back to
my presentation and let's see what else
is left so we have covered the various
attributes of grid now let us talk about
the radio buttons and check button so
let me go back to our PyCharm let's see
how can you add a radio button and check
buttons to your code so now what I will
do I have a label I have a entry box and
I have a button so next what I'll be
doing I've been creating one more label
let's say I'll just try it over here
let's say I have one more label inside a
root and I want text as gender
via the great functionality to it so I
say Rho is equal to 1 then Coulomb is
equals to 0 and sticky to north or you
can say n then what I will be doing I'll
be creating a radio button so for radio
button what do you need to do you just
need to type in radio button inside a
root which has the text let's say if
that is for female and I'll specify the
value to it let's say 1 so this will
basically ensures that which radio
button is clicked on next I'll be just
giving the grid so I'll just copy the
same thing from here
and I'll change the column value let's
say it is one now and I'll have one more
radio button where I have a text as M or
you can say mail I have a different
value to it let's say value to it should
be in different columns while specify a
column - and stickety so now let me just
run this
all right so as you can see here I have
my two radio buttons that is female and
male and once you click on this the
value over here that we have given you
can click on these radio buttons now let
us see how we can implement the check
buttons as well so here I have
implemented radio buttons
so check buttons are also very simple so
again for check buttons I will first
create a label so I'll just copy this
label line and place it over here I'll
say the text as courses it should be in
my Row 2 column should be 0 and should
be stick it was the noir direction next
I need a check button so a safe check
button it should be inside route and
specify a text to it so let's say I want
Python then I'll mention the grid let's
say it should be in the Row 3 column
should be 1 and sticky towards the north
direction now I'll just copy this line
and paste it over here so now let me
just change the courses name let's say
it's Django then let's say it's it's
fast which are nothing but the
frameworks of Python so now I just
change the rows that is 4 and 5 and
columns should remain the same only so
now let me just run this code so as you
can see here I have the radio buttons
and I have the check button this will so
if I click on python a check is been
displayed similarly you can do it for
django and class which are nothing but
the python frameworks so as you can see
here i have created a shorty or a
application which has a name which has a
gender and then you have some courses or
you can say the check buttons and
similarly you can create a entire form
and just click on submit so clicking on
submit right now it doesn't do anything
but you can do a lot more when you go
into details of it so let me just close
it for now so here i have discussed all
these comm prints so now let us
implement a basic operation using all
these so now let me just comment the
whole code and what i'll be doing I will
be performing some arithmetic operations
so now what I'll be doing at the first
creating a function so let's shape I
will be creating a function let's say
Square this will basically give me the
square of a number
so here I'll be writing in event so
there I have just created a function
which is Square and inside this I've
given an event now let us first create
the interface and then we'll come back
to the logic so whereas a root is equals
to Tk well it's I guess over here I
haven't so let me just comment from him
all right
before creating a label so let me just
type in label then it should be inside a
root I'll give some text to it to let's
say I want to find the square of a
number
I just type in that and I'll just pack
it next what I'll be doing I will be
taking an entry of a number so I say
number one I can say num 1 is equal to
entry and I'll pass on the root next
I'll just Pat this route and I can give
some attribute let's I want to give it
should be aligned to left next what I'll
be doing I'll be creating one button so
this should be inside a root and it has
a text let's say squares 2
and I'll just bind my button so I'll say
button dot bind and I'll specify the
button let's it's button one
and pass on the function that is square
so what I've done here I have just find
it even handler to a button which is
nothing but bpn so whenever person
enters a number and clicks on button
which is equals to squares 2 it will
just bind or event listener so now let
me just pack this button as well so I
will say button I can see BTN dot back
I'll say sign is equals to left next
I'll have one more entry box which gives
me the result so I'll save results and
I'll have a entry I'll pass on the truth
then I will be typing in result dot pack
and I specify the side as left again and
finally I'll be just closing my loop so
now my interface is ready now let's go
to my method where I will write the
logic so here what I'll be doing I'll be
first needing the number so what I'll do
I say a hint
and I'll say number not gate so this
will basically get my number so next
what I have to do I have to calculate
the square of that number so I say a
into a and stood in the B then would I
need I want the desired which is a
button over here I want to display the
desire in this button so I'll say
dissolve dot insert and I'll pass over 0
comma B which is the square of the
number so now let me just run this and
let's see whether this works or not
so now as you can see here I have the
small Jo application so now let me just
enter the number let's say two squares -
so this gives me the result as 4
similarly if I say 22 squares - so it's
just giving the output after that so
what I need to do I just go over here I
just change a logic a bit so I just need
to delete the previous value so as a
result not delete and say 0 and I'll say
end and now let me just run this
so now I press it two squares - - then I
say 22 squares - for a repo and you can
buy it similarly you need any number so
this is how we can perform various
operations on this GOI application well
now let me go back to my presentation
let's see what else we left with so here
we have implemented all these small
components to create a basic geo
application so let me summarize this
session so first of all we have
discussed how a scripting language is
different from a programming language
after that I have introduced you to
Python and smelliest features then we
have covered the various modules in
Python which are sis sub-process
OS math.random date/time and json and we
have implemented some of them as well
then they have talked about
aw scripting wherein I have showed you
how to create an ec2 instance using the
boto module and then you also created an
s3 bucket with the same and find it well
chain we have learned the basics of GUI
programming so I hope you found this
session informative so if you guys have
any doubts or any questions you can just
comment below and I'll be happy to help
you with the same well thank you
