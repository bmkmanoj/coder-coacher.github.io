now while writing programs the most
important part you need to worry about
is the main memory that everything
finally sits in memory before it is
executed by the CPU so let us try and
understand what the memory looks like
for this let's imagine a huge piece of
land
okay consisting of equal size plots
let's say there are about 200 plots on
this piece of land and each of these
plots are numbered starting from one so
this is plot number one have plot number
two or plot number three and so on until
plot number 200 so now a house
constructed on plot number one we'd have
the address 1 similarly house
construction on let's say plot number 20
we'd have the address 20 of course some
people want a bigger house so they may
buy four plots together so let's say
somebody wants to construct a big house
by his the plots 65 66 67 and 68 then
his house addresses of course 65 because
his plot starts at number 65 the next
person who once purchase a plot by his
plot number 69 and his house address is
69 the main memory looks exactly the
same
it's
a huge piece of land and their multiple
plots but in this case it's an equal
sized equal size plots are called cells
or bytes so the main memory also comes
is of equal sized cells and they call
bytes the difference is the numbering
here starts from zero so the first cell
is 0 then 1 2 3 so if you have a memory
of 1 kilobyte in capacity 1 KB is
nothing but 1 0 to 4 bytes in that case
the numbering would go from 1 starts
from 0 and will go up to 1 0 to 3 the
last byte would have the address 1 0 to
3 0 to 1 0 to 3 is nothing but finally
1,024 bytes so this is what the memory
would look like for a ram with 1 KB
capacity now each cell or byte in memory
consists of 8 bits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
each of these bits get either store or a
0 or a 1
so if you look at the entire main memory
it only consists of zeros and ones is
these zeros and ones together that give
us meaningful data that is stored at a
particular location so let's say I want
to store the number 15 at address 6 so
we have 3 we have 4 5 6 so at this
location address 6 would mean it's
actually the 7th byte 2 3 4 5 6 7
because the numbering starts from 0 the
sixth address is actually the 7th bite
so let's say I want to store the number
15 at address 6 then what you'll see is
that sell a byte would be the number 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 that is the binary
equivalent of the decimal number 15 so
finally at cell 6
the 8-bit would
then the first bit will be zero the
second bit will be zero third bit will
be zero the fourth bit would be zero
the 5th 6th 7th and 8th bits would all
be once so as you can see the main
memory is similar to a large piece of
land with multiple plots with each of
the plots number in sequential order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
