part of the Android course at ed rekha
Dalton but this is basically a shopping
app the first screen includes the
company's logo and the different product
categories available which includes

the sector letcha button takes us to the
second screen now here we have two
spinners the first well lets you choose
the category which under which you want
to show up and the second one shows the
list of products available under that
category so the categories include apple
accessories shoes so choosing
accessories change is the list of
products available under this pin no
