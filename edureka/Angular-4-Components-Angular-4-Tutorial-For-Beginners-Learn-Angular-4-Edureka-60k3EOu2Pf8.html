welcome to this third video of Auriga
three angular course for beginners in
this video I'll be talking about
components in the previous video I've
shown you how to install angler in your
PC and explained the entire angular
project structure besides that I told
you how we can spin a development server
by using ng serve command that will host
our angular application on localhost for
200 so let us go ahead and rerun the
application that we have created in the
last video using angular CLI for that
I'll go ahead with the same commanders
and she served
now if I open my browser and go to
localhost 4200 I'll see my app running
now if you see the angular application
that we created and we talked about
different files that is there inside an
angular project we also talked with a
vote index dot HTML file this index dot
HTML file is the file that is served by
the server and finally gets rendered in
our browser so if we go ahead and have a
look at the page source of our
application we get the code of index dot
HTML file along with few scripts that
has been injected to it which gets
executed in order to start the
application now if you notice the
content that is being displayed over
here that is I am component is same as
that of specified in our app dot
component dot HTML file so how does this
content is being displayed over here let
us again have a look at the page source
so inside body you can see the app root
element and it does not look like a
regular HTML element actually this is
our own angular element now the question
is that why do we have it here is this
element displaying the content of a
broad component or HTML file to know
that let us have a look at our app core
component or TS file here inside add the
red component decorator we learn about
decorator later in this video so inside
this decorator you can see the field as
selector which has been set to a value
approve' a string value now this app
root selector is same as that of the
element that we saw in our index dot
HTML file as you can see over here
basically what is happening over here is
by adding this selector tag that is a
bruit tag in the index dot HTML we are
inserting our app component inside the
body so all the content of our app
component will be displayed on our
browser once index dot HTML gets
rendered over there this is the reason
why app component is called as the root
component that is it is the first
component that gets rendered when your
browser is booting the application so if
I make some changes in the content of
app got component or HTML file it will
be reflected in the browser also so if I
go and make some change like bring or
change
so as you can see the content has been
modified now let us get back to the
slide so this is what is happening over
here as I told you the app root selector
is being replaced by the app component
so these are the key points with respect
to what we have learned till now and all
these key points are important in order
to have a good understanding about
components
the first one is index dot HTML is the
file that is served by the server and
gets rendered in the browser
second is index dot HTML links the
styles and other JavaScript files which
are required for running the application
then the third one is app component is
the root component which gets loaded
first the fourth one is typically all
the other custom components that we'll
learn how to create later in this video
are nested inside app component app
component is inserted in the body of
index dot HTML using custom app root
element a selector tag is used to load a
components instance wherever it is
required so these are the key points
guys that you need to keep in your mind
for moving ahead in this video for now
you'd be confused about what is
component actually but you understood
that there is something called as app
component it is the root component and
it gets loaded into the browser in the
beginning itself and that's why we see
the same content which we have defined
or specified in its template file on the
browser so let us understand what our
components actually this is the
definition of component given in the
official documentation of angular a
component controls a patch of screen
real estate that we could call a view
and declares reusable UI building blocks
for an application it's kind of big but
indeed a good definition let us
understand what does it mean by taking
an example here as you can see we have a
triggers website displaying different
courses in general you will find most of
the website in similar fashion now you
can notice that I put rectangle boxes to
point out different sections of the
website each of these boxes are nothing
but components for example in the bottom
left side you can see a sidebar that
displays different categories of courses
for a user to select this is a sidebar
component similarly the section that
displays all the courses in a preview
fashion is also a component let's say it
courses component now in the top you
have two rectangles inside a bigger red
rectangle the first
dangle surrounds the search part there
are seconds around the section that lets
you navigate through different parts of
the website such as blogs or for
business section again these two are
also component search bar component and
nav bar component but more interesting
thing about component is that you can
nest other components inside a component
for example these two search bar and
never compose are nested inside the
header component so you can say that the
header component is the parent component
of search bar and nav bar component as
you can see and all these components
that is header component the sidebar
component the courses component our
child components of app component which
is the route component
hence app component and all these
components are structured in a
parent-child tree so whenever the parent
app component renders it recursively
renders its children components as well
so this is how you get the whole
application rendered on your browser I
guess by now you would have understood
that an entire angular website is made
up of components apart from the view a
component also contains the logic to
provide the expected interaction for
example if you select the category on
the sidebar component it will show you
all the courses corresponding to the
category that you chose the logic that
makes this work is also contained by the
component itself now let us have a look
at the official definition again and I
am pretty sure that this time you will
understand each part of it the first
part of depression seems to be very easy
that is a component controls a patch of
screen or a view as you can clearly
layer this with the image that is there
in the slide where we have an orange
patch referring to a particular
component which is a mixture of template
that is the view part or the visual part
of a component and the business logic
that provides the responsiveness or
interaction together these two makes a
component the second part of the
definition talks about reusability so
you can reuse a component in multiple
places for example the searchbar
component can be reused wherever it is
required all you need is to put it
inside the component which requires a
search bar so in a nutshell a component
is a reusable UI block of which the
entire angular web app UI is made up of
now that you have understood what is a
component it's time to learn how to
create one
angular a component is a simple type
script class with a component decorator
so for creating a component you first
created a script class this component
class will contain all your component
logic but how will anger know that this
class is a component so what we do we
attach component metadata in our type
script class or in the component class
now to attach metadata for a component
we use at the rate component annotation
and after doing so the very class is
said to be decorated as a component
hence the name decorator so let us have
a look at the exact codes of a component
as you can see we have simple type
script class named as app component then
we attach at the red component decorator
to this app component class to decorate
it as a component now inside add the red
component decorator you can see we are
providing the metadata that is selector
template URL and style URLs so let us go
ahead and create our own component while
doing so I'll explain you about all
these fields that we are passing inside
a decorator in general all the logic
that is related to your application
resides inside the app folder so I'll go
ahead and create my components inside I
have folder only so I create a folder
for my component inside our folder and
we'll name it as first now you create a
type script class for our component so
we'll go ahead and create type script
file and the naming convention of the
component goes as you start with the
name of the component followed by
component and then the extension that is
the typescript dot TS now we'll create a
simple typescript class so export class
first component
so this is how you name the component
class so first you will go ahead with
the name of the component in our case it
is first followed by the term component
now as I said this is a simple Thai
script class now in order to make it as
a component we need to attach metadata
and for that we go ahead with add the
red component decorator so let's go
ahead and attach our metadata so we'll
go ahead with add the red component and
we'll pass on the object that will
contain the metadata for our component
class so the first field that we gonna
provide or pass inside of competent
decorator is selector and as discussed
earlier the selector is the tag that you
can use in your HTML template so as to
load an instance of a particular
component you will go ahead and do all
those stuff here as well so first let's
go ahead and put a value for this
selector for that I'll go ahead with app
first this is a general naming
convention of selector tag that is
required with the app the term app in
the first place followed by a hyphen
then you go ahead with a component name
that is first now I said earlier a
component is a mixture of visual part
and the business logic so we have to
specify our template over here so for
that we'll go ahead and specify template
then I'll be using backticks
inside that takes you can put your
template code all that HTML code also
what you can do you can put your HTML
code or HTML template inside a separate
file and then refer that particular file
over here
so for that what you will do we will go
ahead with template URL and then you
will pass the template URL over here
which is first taught component dot HTML
so since we haven't created our first
dot component or HTML file so we're
gonna go ahead and create that for a
stored component dot HTML now let us add
a h2 tag in our first component we will
go ahead with h2 tag and I'll say I am
component first component
that's it now the third field that we're
gonna pass insights are at the red
component decorator is style URL which
is inherited so I'll go ahead with my
first taught component taught CSS you
can put multiple files or multiple style
files over here because it's an array so
for that now I need to create a file
called as first god component taught CSS
as of now we are not gonna add any
styles to our template so for now we'll
just ignore this file now as you can see
we are getting some air over here and
the error says cannot find name
component the reason that we are getting
this error is because we haven't
imported the component from our
dependencies so for that what we'll do
we'll go ahead and import components
from at the rate angular and inside
angular will go ahead with core so this
package at the red slash co resides in
our node models folder now as you can
see the air has been resolved now as we
have learned before that we can use this
selector tag in order to nest a
component inside other component and
also we know that the first component
that gets loaded into our browser is app
component so what we will do will put
our silky tag inside the template of app
component so here I'll go ahead with ah
first
all right then let's go to our browser
now as you can see we can't see any
content being displayed over here even
the content of app component has gone so
let's go ahead and see what is the error
so as you can see we are having a
template parse error and the reason is
app first is not a known element so what
is happening over here is our angular
doesn't know that there is a component
called as first component and there is a
selector tag called as F first for that
particular component so for that what we
do is we have to go to our got module
and we have to import the component that
we have created so we'll go ahead with
first component from dot slash first
slash first dot component
now signal to your decorator in
components you have a trait ng-model
decorator four modules this app model is
a root model and we're gonna talk about
app model in great detail in the last
section of this video for now any
component that you create in your
Android application needs to be declared
inside your module or inside your root
module so here we're gonna go ahead and
declare our component inside the
declaration array now it's done so now
you can see the content of first
component is being displayed over here
along with the content of your app
component so this was all about
component guys so this is how you create
your own component and then you nested
inside your root component now let us
talk a bit more about how app component
gets inserted into an index dot HTML
file or about how an angular application
gets started or gets booted the angular
application are started with the help of
a process called as bootstrap the
bootstrap process begins with the main
tortillas file which you can think of as
a main entry point of the angular
application this main dot PS file sets
up the execution environment that is the
browser in our case for running the
angular application then this main dot
t-- s file bootstraps the app model
which is the root model of our
application then this app model for the
bootstraps our root component or app
component finally the app component is
inserted into the index dot HTML file or
the browser Tom so let us have a look at
this main dot TS file so as you can see
over here by initializing platform
browser dynamic it is setting up our
execution environment that is our
browser and then it puts wraps the root
model which is app module now if you see
the app module here you can find the
bootstrap array where we have specified
our food component that is app component
that is how your app model or the root
module bootstraps the app component in
the end once the bootstrap component or
app components start rendering all the
children components start rendering - so
this is how you create your angular
application or this is how your angular
application starts the reason that app
model is called as root model is the
same as
my app component is called a solute
component that is this model is loaded
in the first place or in the beginning
same as that of your app component now
it is allowed to have more than one
component tree on your host webpage that
is you can have multiple root components
but most of the application have only
one competently and they bootstrap a
single root component also you can call
the root component anything you want but
most developers call it app component so
this was all about app component how it
gots rendered or how it's got loaded
into your index dot HTML file also you
have learned how to create your own
custom components so in general whenever
we will be making or developing an
angular website you will be thinking in
terms of components so what are the
components that I require in a website
for example you will have a component
for your navigation bar as we see in our
Enriquez website similarly you will have
a separate component for search bar or
maybe for different different purposes
this makes your entire application easy
to maintain so for example if I want to
change the search algorithm or if I want
to add a new feature in my home screen I
can go ahead and make the changes in the
corresponding component instead of
making changes everywhere so I hope you
understood how angular application are
loaded and what is a component now the
question that comes over here is why am
your apps are bootstrap or you can say
why does angular bootstrap itself in
such a complicated fashion well there is
a very good reason behind this actually
angular is not a framework for creating
web application only you can also create
application or write components that
will run in some other environment that
can host angular application such as
native script or Cordova so with the
bootstrapping process what we can do we
can import the platform that we want to
use depending on the environment that we
are operating under in our case since we
were running our application on the
browser we use the bootstrapping process
that is there in at the rate angular
slash platform browser dynamic as you
can see over here in our main dot TS
file also it is a very good idea to
leave your bootstrapping process in a
separate file called as main door TS
this makes your application easier to
test it also it provides you a better
organization
to the application so finally guys this
was all in this video so we learned a
lot today we learned about how to create
a component how an angular application
gets started right
what are decorators what is a root
module what is a root component now in
the next video we'll be learning about
data binding so data binding allows your
template that is the visual part of your
component to connect with your business
logic the logic with which you perform
interactions so we learned about all
those techniques that angular provides
for data binding and how to use it
inside an angular application so I hope
you enjoyed the session in case of any
doubt or query you can go ahead and
write your feedbacks or your questions
in the comment section below now thank
you for watching this video so I'll see
you soon in the next video where we'll
be talking about data binding till then
have fun I hope you enjoyed listening to
this video please be kind enough to like
it and you can comment any of your
doubts and queries and we will reply to
them at the earliest do look out for
