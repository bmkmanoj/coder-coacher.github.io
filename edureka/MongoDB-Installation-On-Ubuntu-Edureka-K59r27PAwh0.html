installation of MongoDB on Ubuntu Ubuntu
is a Linux operating system in which we
are going to install a MongoDB server as
a database now first of all what we
require we require a virtual machine
called a VMware Player which ever our
VMware virtual box whichever is
convenient for you you can do that
I have a Windows operating system so I
was installed of being we're playing
after that I have downloaded Ubuntu and
configured that Ubuntu into our VMware
Player once it is configured you will
get a screen as you can see in my now we
have to open a terminal to write the
command inside that for that just move
to dash home and in the search light
terminal okay from here you select it
out and terminal is open for us now
first of all we have to login to a root
user for that we have a command su enter
it will ask the password password is
password PA SS wo ID now I'm logged in
as a root user now first of all we need
to check it out our OS bit whether it's
a 64 bit or a 32 bit because we have to
perform the solution accordingly for
that we have a command you name - M it
displays me I 686 it means it's a 32 bit
I'm already in a root directory now we
have to download a momo DV for our Linux
as you can see let me show you I have
already downloaded and it's my
expression in the Downloads folder let
me just move inside that ok as you can
see a MongoDB file is already present
with the version of two point four point
one one okay now
what we have to do let's okay now we
will create a user over here on which
you will be running the Luongo DB
database okay
swell okay for that we have a command
username let's kill it as a mark
oops
something went wrong over here okay
because we need to add a the command is
something else
by mistake I have given username okay so
this is a command used to add any user
now we have to set the password fight so
for that we have a command PA SS WT
let's set the password as Mark itself it
asked me to give any new password so let
me give mark one I need to retype it
parce was successfully updated okay now
we have to make a directory opt okay a
time three has been gated with the name
opt mangu now we have to move the files
from download directory to opt Mago so
for that we have a command CP
I'm already in the root directory and in
our downloads so I can directly write
mango name of the file where we need to
copy it OPP Mongo it's moving the file
ok it has been copied now now let's move
to opt Mango diet train to cross verify
it ok now we are in opt memo let's press
LS it will list all the files that are
present inside that and we can see a
MongoDB file which we have copied to a
MongoDB opt mamadi now what we have to
do we have to untie the file so for that
we have a command tar space - xvf space
name of the file ok after that we have
to press ENTER it will untie the
packages of MongoDB the version we are
using over here it's two point four
point one one as we can see that it's an
tard now now we can proceed further now
let's rename the file because as you can
see the name is quite long
MongoDB - Linux so let's rename it to
only Mongo so that we can use it easily
for the further use let's
it has only mangu okay now what we have
to do we have to move to manga directory
let's cross-check it in which which I
have trivia in we are in Oh booty Mongo
Mongo let's see
is anything present inside that okay we
have a bin folder genial and third party
notes and a readme file these are the
things present inside the MongoDB now I
have made a user with the name mark
earlier now what what I will do I will
mark mark as a user for this particular
file for that we have a command CH o WN
- our space mark okay after that the
type 3 okay after that - bin ok now
let's move to bring Gayatri let's see
what all files present inside that we
have a Mahmud II mangodi Mungo dumb
Mongo export long files mono import we
have a lot of files related to that okay
let's get a directory where mom ODB
database file will be stored so for that
we have a command mkdir space bar lab
space Mongo okay adaiah tree has been
created now let's give the permissions
to that
oops something went wrong over here okay
because I have used mark over here sorry
MongoDB and basically our user is mark
so we have to write mark now it will not
display the error to us yeah it's fine
no what we have to do we have to create
another directory with the name block
mkd is space where log mangu okay now we
have to mark mark as a user for this
particular file and directory you can
say mark okay now I have marked Marquez
a user for valium Mongo and var log
Mongo okay now it's all set now let's
get a directory where MongoDB files log
file with this story photo generally oh
there's any once we are starting a
database and all so it will collect all
the locks means it will display all the
listing over there in the log file is
how the service started if there is any
error we can cross-check the log file to
cross verify and check the get it sorted
out
after getting a deities we have to give
the permission readwrite in so that we
can do and make any changes inside the
valley Mongo and we're locked Mongo so
to keep the permissions we have a
command CH m OD space - our triple seven
after that astray we're late
Mongo okay
I've given all the permissions to that
it in the same way I have to give the
permissions to where we're log Mongo
also okay I have to come given the
permission to log file as well now I
have to logged in today as a user mark
over here to start the MongoDB because I
have given each and every permission to
use a mark so let me type a command for
that su mark I'm logged in as a mark
user now
as you can see that it displays me which
user I'm logged in that is Mark now
let's move into mangodi bin directory to
start the database for that you have a
command CD space backslash opt we have
to move to opt slash Mongo for that
again among go in a bin directory
okay we are inside that now let's start
the services would be - DD and BB path
live below ok as you can see that I
started let's wait for that till it
completely comes up now we have to open
a new terminal you start the service
okay first of all let's logged in as a
root user after that we have to move to
in CD space opt memo Mongo
and been directly okay we are inside
that now let's finally start MongoDB
server okay now we are in a MongoDB
