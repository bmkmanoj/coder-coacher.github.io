today's session is on Microsoft Azure
certifications so we are going to
discuss why certifications are important
and then we are going to see the
different certifications offered by
Microsoft and different domains and
we're going to focus on the cloud
certifications today right so without
wasting any more time let's move on to
the topic of today that is the your
certifications so give me a second
all right so guys as you can see these
are the domains in which Microsoft
offers its certifications and mind you
guys these certifications are the thing
that I'm going to tell you today are
based on the latest release that
Microsoft has said in terms of state
certification they have changed quite a
few things and it's dissipated in
September 2016 right so there are quite
a few changes now and I will tell you
what they are right so these are the
domains in which Microsoft is offering
certifications right now so you get
certifications in mobility you get
certifications in cloud platform and
infrastructure you get certifications in
productivity you get Microsoft
certification in data management and
analytics then you can get Microsoft
certified for being an app builder there
is an application builder and then for
business applications all right so our
focus area is around cloud platform and
infrastructure since we are learning as
you're right so we are concerned with
these your certifications so let me
share a light on that guys let us move
down through the cloud platform
infrastructure path all right so this is
the path to your certifications so
basically each and every domain has been
divided into two levels right you have
an associate level and then you have the
expert level now in the cloud platform
and infrastructure path for becoming an
associate it is imperative that it pass
more than one exam right if you pass one
exam you become a specialist in that for
example if you're passing say the five
three three or five three two exam right
so then you become a Microsoft
specialist in developing Microsoft with
your solutions right so this is
a confusion which people have that
passing an exam will give you a
certification no you get certified that
you have passed this exam but the
certification which is the MCA sip
certification this is for the cloud
platform you will only get that when you
pass any of these exams that is any two
of these exams right so for becoming an
associate that is a Microsoft Certified
associate in the cloud platform you have
to pass either of these two terms and
then the first exam is the five three
two which is developing Microsoft Azure
solutions right so developing Microsoft
with your solution is basically the use
with a developer right if you are a
developer you're from a developing
background you can go for this
certification it involves quite a few
things if you are going to discuss in
the next coming minutes then there is
five three three which involves managing
Microsoft with your infrastructure
solutions so again with this you get
basically a microsoft specialist'
certification which is certified that
you have cleared this example but for an
overall associate certification on cloud
complot form like I said you have to
pass minimum two exams in this category
all right the managing Microsoft is your
infrastructure solutions is basically an
exam which is related to system
administrators right so if you are a
system admin you have the experience of
a system administrator this exam is for
you right then you have the five three
four which is architecting Microsoft
Azure solutions so this exam is
basically for people who are looking
forward to architecting solutions in the
cloud so if you have any prior
experience in architecting you can take
this exam right so basically you should
know so usually when people go for
certifications or when people are
appearing for exams they don't know
which example take because they don't
have the knowledge on that right so
firstly if you are a developer like I
said you should go for five three two if
you are a system as Ben you should go
for five three three and if you are a
system architect or solutions architect
you should go for five three four
all right once you have done this exam
when you want to reach to the next level
you should probably up for exam which is
more closely related to your own right
so we'll be discussing curriculum in a
while but then before that now once you
become an associate level certified
person you should go ahead and get
certified for the expert level right
because there's an expert level
certification and the expert level
certification works like this so in the
expert Nilla certification you have
these when exams right and out of these
exams you have to attempt only when it
comes now it's quite a bit confusing but
because if you can see the 5 3 to 5 3 3
&amp;amp; 5 3 4 or 4 7 3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5 but all the
exams which are listed here is it then
what are the difference like you took
attempt two exams here and then attempt
one exam here which is the same you will
get exposed certified so it's not like
that the wavefunctions is like this so
the two exams that you will be choosing
over here
and not the exams that you will be
choosing here right so you should be
choosing a unique exam in this pool that
you will be appearing for and once you
pass that exam including the exams that
you have passed before there are the two
exams that you have already appeared for
you become a Microsoft Certified
solutions expert all right so this
certification is also a very important
certification and the thing is the guys
that you might be wondering if a man
what is the difference between an expert
and an associate so the difference is
experienced and the difference is
obviously the domain knowledge right if
you have appeared for more exams if you
are given more exams you pass those
exams that basically shows that you are
more proficient in the subject all right
and that is what makes a difference
having said that let's look at the
curriculum that each exam is having so
my focus would be on five three to five
three three and five three four all
right four seven three basically deals
with SQL and four seven five basically
deals with big data analysis which we
can this
but I think when your goal is to become
a Microsoft Certified solutions expert
you should appear for only these three
exams this is 5 3 2 5 3 3 &amp;amp; 5 3 4
because these are the exams which
basically take out cloud person you
though all these 3 exams are centered
around John right so when I talk about 5
3 2 you are basically building solutions
in cloud we'll talk about 5 3 3 you are
basically managing these solutions and
implementing them and when you talk
about 5 3 4 it all basically talks about
bit service to use on the other servers
right so a job of a solution architect
has to identify which serves the best
for the particular use case right so for
example if I talk about say in Microsoft
computing domain you have three kind of
services you have virtual machines you
have app services and then you have
functions right and if there is a use
case a use case comes up that say you
want to make an image processing
application so you should understand
that use case and then opt for service
rate so if you talk about absolute so
app service basically gives the
deployment of an application and we talk
about functions it deals with the
background tasks right and if you talk
about virtual machines it is basically a
server that you get a negative in any
thing with it now the smart thing would
be to basically deploy the application
on a web app or on the App Service and
the tasks which are to be done it should
be done using functions now I know most
of you might not be knowing what I'm
talking about but this is what the
architects shop is all about once you
get proficient with each and every
service in the Azure cloud you can take
this call you can make this decision as
to what service you take all right so
this is what is the role of an architect
he decides which service should be used
in which use case and he comes up with
an architecture right once the architect
role is done once architecture has come
up when he discusses it with its clients
and his business operatives
he passes down this architecture to
system admins
right so the job of the system
administrator is to implement this
architecture and manage it afterwards so
when she implements this architecture he
can actually manage afterwards because
once so in architecture has been
implemented obviously this is bound to
have some problems some managing
problems or some configuration problems
as in which some servers as to how to
actually deploy this architecture you
want it to be geo redundant you want it
to be locally returning it all depends
on usage then it is the call of a system
administrator to decide what to do and
afterwards the maintenance is near as
well right
then comes the role of a developer so
what a developer would do is a developer
would basically build solutions on this
architecture right so whatever
application that you have he will build
a tower plication and the application is
to be then deployed on this architecture
right and that is the reason that we
talk about the exam 5 3 2 it includes
the implementation part as well that is
implementing the solutions on the cloud
because sometimes the developers also
get to do that all right and that is the
reason that 5 3 2 5 3 3 &amp;amp; 5 2 4 exams
are very closely aligned so if you get
prepared 2 5 3 2 right and you will pass
fic to exam should be not that difficult
for you to pass the 5 3 3 exam on the 5
3 4 exam you just might have to brush up
on a few more topics and you are set you
can pass the 5 3 3 at the PI 3 4 X a mix
well and if you pass the 5 3 3 &amp;amp; 5 3 4
you can become the expert level
certified professional all right so
having said that let's see what is the
curriculum in each of these exams so
like I said so 5 3 2 basically deals
with these things of the 30 to 35
percent of your exam will deal with
create and manage as your resource
manager right so what is your resource
manager it is basically a place where
you can manage your resources right so
you should be able to create and manage
this resource manager and virtual
machines is where so virtual machines
like I said are just so
that you deploy on Azure with your
choice of operating system on it so you
should be able to create and manage it
right and exam it will have questions
around the deployment part around the
managing part all of that right so you
should be able to identify workloads
that can cannot be deployed so for
example like I said if you talk about
functions functions cannot be used to
deploy an application it can only be
used to execute background tasks so if
you are taking this example this kind of
clarity should be there in your - and
what can be done and what cannot because
the questions will be tricky guys the
questions will ask you these kind of
things
then comes automate configuration
management so you should be able to
automate configuration using PowerShell
which is a command line tool offered by
Azure right so basically if you go to
this particular link you can read what
all is related to you or what all you
have to study in your this particular
exam all right then comes design and
implement a storage and data strategy so
you should be able to design and
implement the storage system that you're
making in place the way your application
will be storing files on your
architectures you should be able to
design that and also implement it so
like I said it rosalie resembles the job
of an architect as well right so you'd
be evaluated on that as well so on this
you have 25 to 30 percent of an exam
will be based on this then comes manage
identity application and network
services right so for your Azure you
should be able to manage the identity
application a network services so you
should be able to manage the
applications which are deploying on your
Azure cloud right and the network
services as well because there are a lot
of firewall settings that you will be
doing it is called security
configuration of your each layer every
application because when you deploy an
application in the azure cloud and there
are basically a lot of things that you
have to configure if you want to connect
to that particular service for example
if you deploy a MySQL implementation on
your and you want
connect to that MySQL installation you
have to configure that installation you
have to go to the configuration
management you have to add your machines
IP address over there and once the IP
address is added over there then only
your computer will be authenticated
through the particular - skill service
alright so like I said with this
knowledge I know I'm passing it down to
you but you should be able to do that
with other services read so this was my
SQL you should be able to do that with
virtual machines so basically if you
want to access your virtual machine how
would you do that and everything all
right
then comes design and implement as your
platform as-a-service compute and web
and mobile app services so design in the
sense you should be able to create
applications and implement them using
the application services right so
platform as-a-service basically the app
service that is there in Azure an app
service you have a lot of stuffed parts
it contains Web Apps which is used to
deploy web applications
it contains mobile apps that are used to
deploy mobile app engine so it has a lot
of things so it expects you to have a
proficiency and app services as well all
right so this is the curriculum around
the five three two way exam if you go by
five three three you noted there are
quite a few things which are common so
like I said design and improvement as
your app so list so app service is the
platform as a service that we adopt mode
it contributes to 15 to 20 percent of
your exam and then there is create and
manage as your resource manager which is
the same as the previous exam
design and implement a solid strategy
same as the previous exam implement and
as your active directory right now this
is something which is different from the
52 exam so you might need to study this
as well
then comes implement virtual networks
this is also a part of your pi32 exams
because when you will be dealing with
applications you'll be dealing with
virtual networks as well right then
comes design and deploy erm templates
right so this is the azure resource
managers who should be able to design
and deploy the template and erm so this
is the curriculum around five
you pretty simple around 60 to 70 or I'd
say 80% of the curriculum is the same as
5 3 2 all right
let's come down to 5 3 4 so 5 3 4 has
design as your resource manager
networking okay this is something
different and it contributes around 5 to
10% of the exam secure resources so you
should know all the security best
practices as an architect because 5 3 4
is an architect exam so you should be
able to design security rules which can
be followed to basically have the
maximum security on your application so
now as your security best practices are
also distance should be acquainted with
those bricks best practices so that you
can apply it on your architecture right
then comes the design and application
storage the data access strategy which
is the same as that of a 3 2 &amp;amp; 5 3 3
then you have design advanced
applications so you should be able to
architect advanced applications then you
have design as your web and mobile app
so you should be able you should have a
proficiency in designing and deploying
the web avoid mobile apps which is a
part of the app service which is already
a part of 5 3 2 &amp;amp; 5 3 3 then you should
be able to design a management
monitoring and business continuity
strategy all right so now and as an
architect you would be expected to
monitor all the resources on Azure same
is the case of system administrator as
well because he will be the person will
be managing it later but as an architect
you should be acquainted with the fact
that you should be able to monitor the
resources which you have deployed on us
yon all right then comes architect and
assure compute infrastructure so like I
said given a use case you should be able
to architect it using these services in
the azure cloud all right so this is
what it is about the architect role in
short 5 3 3 is with the system
administrator so it's all about
implementing and managing the resources
once they have deployed and the
developer role is all about the
application that the architect is
building the architecture for right so
basically the architecture is built for
an application right so the developer
has to write that application I should
be able to deploy it on the azure in
mind having said that guys so this
covers the 5 3 to 5 3 3 &amp;amp; 5 3 4 exam
which is essential for you to gain the
expert level certification so first you
might be a pairings for say 5 3 2 &amp;amp; 5 3
3
once you do that you can go for 5 3 4 in
the elective example and you'll have the
MCS according to me if I have a you I
would go with this now if you have an
experience with SQL you can go with 4 7
3 right 2 4 7 3 basically deals with the
SQL share of things so it is a center
around SQL Server databases so you'd be
asked extensively around that then comes
4 7 5 so if you are from background who
has been into big data analytics or big
data right so 4 7 5 exam is based around
big data management right so you can go
in a pair 4 4 7 5 and hence prioritize
your exam for the electrical as well
alright so guys this is what you have to
prepare for now the things that why
certification so you get certified but
what is the benefit of getting certified
so first of all guys let me clear it out
to you just because you're certified
that does not guarantee you a job right
so for getting a job you again have to
sit for interviews but because you'll be
certified with an ad Theory zoomit you
can be given more preference over others
when you appear for interviews but like
I said you again have to go through the
process of interviews even when you are
certified and that is the reason I tell
people to actually go or actually
prepare for the course rather than going
for dumps which are available online so
dumps are something which people who
have appeared for the examination they
tend to leak the questions that they
think they have memorized and delete the
questions online now these questions
might help you in a way that you might
mug up or cram the answers and
spill it out on your own tested but that
won't help you when you go for an
interview because once you get
interviewed all will be upright
everything will be exposed they will get
to know that you don't know anything
about a zero right so it is better to
actually prepare for as you're in the
normal way and then get the exam because
that will not only get you certified but
that would also give you an extensive
knowledge of the subject all right and
it will give you an edge so first of all
once you get certified it will only give
you an edge over the other candidates in
the first round
once you've clear the first round you're
all the same your certification doesn't
help right it will only help you for the
knowledge that you have gained and it
will be reflected in the interview when
the interviewer will ask you questions
all right so with that does one more
thing the five three two exam like I
said is there for MC se or MCS a but
with the newly developed system you can
also become an apple so if you are a
developer who has extensive knowledge on
c-sharp
or deploying or creating applications
you can go for the app builder
certification as well so with the app
builder the thing is like this that
first you have to attempt four four
eight three one three five seven which
these support three examinations is
programming in C sharp and the three
five seven exam is developing mobile
labs right so that will earn you a
certification which is called Universal
Windows platform so you'll be an
associate level in this exam right and
when you go for if you want to become an
associate in web applications you may
need to attempt for it zero which is
programming in HTML 5 with JavaScript
and CSS 3 and 4 8 6 which tests your
knowledge on asp.net MVC web
applications and once you clear these
two examinations you also have an option
between for H 0 and Foley 3 that is
programming g-shock so once you clear -
examinations you become an MC essay
right once you become an MC essay in web
applications or Universal Windows
platform
you can become an M CSD by giving one
exam in the elective example and the
thing here to notice is that you have
the five three two at the five three
four exam here as well right so if you
are a developer you can clear these
exams and for earning the expert level
that is the Microsoft Certified
solutions credible certification you can
appear for either five three two which
is basically involves your knowledge on
us you are and how to deploy
applications on Azure and the five three
four which is architecting Microsoft
with your solution so in both these
services and both these cases basically
they will get to know that okay that you
know as your cloud as well and then you
can become an expert in that domain
because not only you know how to code an
application but you also know how to
deploy that application on the cloud and
that is why it makes sense for the
developer or the expert level
certification to know about PI 3 2 and
PI 3 4 if you want to make a courier
ship into cloud I would suggest you
would go with this certification which
is MCSA cloud platform but if you want
to stay on course and become a code
developer it would be better if you go
for a build apart now guys this clarity
you should have this should be the
clarity you should have that a bit
certification to a pair for right and
once you have this kind of clarity it
becomes very simple for you then - what
exams you write so with this guys I
would like to conclude and wish you all
the best for your exam whatever exam
you're giving I'd always stay informed
on what you have to do or about the
things that you're going to do never
follow somebody else's footsteps ok just
because that guy is driven to fight
through two exam let me give a spicy two
exam as well right so don't be like that
be informed of what you are trying to do
and that will give you the maximum
results all right guys so with that
let's conclude today's session thank you
