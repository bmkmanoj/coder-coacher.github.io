welcome to this introductory video of a
relay cars free angular course for
beginners now without doing any further
delay let us have a look at the roadmap
that will be followed for this entire
tutorial series on angular as you can
see over here there will be a total of
10 videos in this playlist starting from
this one in this video I'll be
introducing angular to you and we'll
discuss some of its prominent features
like modularity typescript support etc
I'll also talk about different versions
of angular which is out there
our actual learning will begin from the
next video where I'll show you how to
install angular into your PC then we'll
quickly have a look at the angular
project structure and different files
present in it then our next video will
be on components here you will learn
what is the role of a component in an
angular application and how to create it
after that we will understand the
different types of data binding that
angular provides basically data binding
is a mechanism by which you connect your
application user interface and business
logic then we will move on to directives
which allows you to manipulate your term
here you will learn how to use different
built-in directors that angular provides
like ng F and G for etcetera apart from
this I'll also show you how to create
your own custom directive and use it in
your application then comes routing
routing help in directing a user to a
different page or section of your web
app for example you are on the home page
of an angular website and you clicked on
a button for viewing the About section
or the about page this would open the
about page are about component for you
this is what routing does so basically
the routing helps you to navigate
between different different components
in your web application so we learn how
to add routes to different components in
this section after we are done with
routing will move on to angular forms
here you will learn about different ways
to implement forms in angular along with
that I'll also show you how to add
validation rules or error handling rules
to a particular form then we'll move on
to services a service in angular is a
class
that encapsulate some sort of
functionalities which can be rewarded to
the rest of your application for example
you can put your data access logic or
search logic inside a service then you
can inject it to a particular component
or all those places in your application
where it is required so instead of
writing the same logic or the code for
search logic again in again in all those
places where the search logic is
required in your application what you do
you put it inside a service class and
you provide that service to all those
places so this helps you to reduce the
redundancy in the code in your
application once we have covered all
these so-called building blocks of an
angular application I will show you how
to make a simple angular crud app crud
is an acronym for create read update and
delete operation so we learn how to
implement all these for operation in our
Android app at last in the final video
I'll show you how to use firebase along
with angular furgus is a back-end
service that provides two
functionalities like file storage
database authentication etcetera so we
learn how to implement all of these in a
angular app and it will be pretty
interesting session as you will be
creating a full-fledged application
using firebase and angular so guys this
was an entire road map of this tutorial
series now let me mention this here
again that this entire tutorial playlist
has been designed for pig-nuts only so
i'm not going to cover any of the
advanced stuff over here for that I
would definitely recommend you to check
out our ETA cos angular certification
training this course has been explicitly
designed for professionals who want to
make their carrier as an angular
developer so as you can see over here
has the code structure for angular
certification training program at a
Drakkar along with these concepts you
will be also handed over some of the
assignments and projects during the
training to know further details about
the training can visit our web site at
www.extracareanimalhospital.net
so I think it's time to start our
learning so we'll begin with the
question what is angular for starters
it's a JavaScript framework that lets
you create highly responsive single page
application so being a framework it
provides you all those tools
functionalities and packages so as to
build a website from scratch but I think
you will be thinking like I know what a
web application is but what about single
page application what is the difference
between a regular website and a single
page app or single page web app so let
us understand this difference by
comparing the single page application
approach with that of our traditional
website approach in a traditional
application generally you have a website
organized as bunch of static pages now
each time you perform an interaction for
example suppose you clicked on a signup
button the request for opening this
signup page will be passed on to
yourself then the server will respond
back with a brand new signup page that
will be loaded up on your browser so
each time you are interacting with the
web app the website will contact the
server for serving a brand new page
containing the response these have used
to achieve responsiveness in a
traditional website now let us have a
look at a single page application and
how does it work unlike traditional web
apps a spy's made up of a single web
page that is loaded once in your machine
that is at a time you visit the web site
now suppose you again clicked on a
button for opening about page this time
instead of requesting a new page from
the server only the data or content
required for the about page will be
retrieved because of this spa are faster
and much more responsive and gives you a
feeling as if you are using a native or
mobile applications so this is the
overall idea behind single page
application base now let's come to a
very interesting question I have seen
that lots of people have confusion about
different versions of angular and have
often seen people asking questions like
are angular 2 and 4 same or do I need to
learn angularjs or angular 1 in order to
get started within your angular
let me clear this confusion for you
basically it all started with angularjs
which was released by Google in the year
2010 angularjs is a JavaScript based
framework that allows you to create
modern brave apps just like angular 2 or
the newer angular but after a few months
of its release
angularjs became quite popular because
of its rich features but then around
2012 and 13 frameworks and libraries
like ember door chase and the act or she
has popped in with a better benchmark
result so the angularjs team decided to
go ahead with a new project which became
the foundation of the newer angular that
we see today as this was an improved
version of the angularjs they decided to
keep the same name except the JS part
the new angular which started from
version 2 was officially released in
September 2016 it is a complete rewrite
of angularjs guys so you don't need to
learn angularjs at all for getting
started with the new angular
in fact annual community has announced
that no further development will take
place for angularjs
so I don't think it would be wise to go
ahead with angularjs nowadays now I'm
with community has adopted something
called a semantic versioning approach
and have announced that a major version
of angular will be released every six
months so here goes the new versions
that you see every six months that is
version two then you get four and right
now the current version is five and with
every new version you can expect some
bug fixes some new features and under
the hood changes that anyways is the
whole point of releasing our new version
but it's not like you have to learn
angular 2 in order to go ahead with
angular 4 or 5 so I would recommend you
to go ahead with the recent stable
version of angle so that was all about
different versions of angular guys I
think now your confusion would be clear
that what is the difference between
angularjs and angular 2 and you do not
require to go ahead with angularjs in
order to get started with the new angle
now it's time to have a look at some of
the cool features of angular that makes
it so popular around the globe
so angry abs are composed of modules
think of modules as an individual level
blocks in a Lego toy basically an
angular model allows you to group
similar kind of functionality together
for example in a website you can have a
separate model for your admin
functionality similarly you can have a
separate model for your homepage or your
about page this makes your app easy to
maintain so whenever you want to add a
new feature to your homepage you will be
only making changes to the corresponding
module instead of rewriting the entire
code also if you are working along with
a large team having people with
different kind of experiences modularity
makes the overall development process
lot more easy now let's talk about speed
and performance angler apps are very
fast angular turns your template into
course that is highly optimized for
today's browser one other reason that
makes angular app highly performant is
angular router though we will learn
about routers later but for now just
understand that angular router splits
the entire app code in such a fashion
that only the relevant part of your
entire code is rendered that is required
for rendering a requested view it is as
simple as that so it splits your code
according to the different views and
suppose if you request for an about page
only that part of code will be rendered
which is required for rendering your
about page
next comes typescript and he has six
support you can use plain typescript or
plain es6 for writing angular app if you
are more comfortable with JavaScript you
can go ahead with JavaScript as well but
I would recommend you to go ahead with
typescript as it provides you some of
the amazing features like auto
completion navigation and refactoring
having such tool is almost a requirement
for any last project also typescript is
a superset of JavaScript so you don't
need to go through a big rewrite
whenever you are migrating your
javascript code to a typescript code
having said all that type dude codes are
lot more easier to read and understand
and it is also add for developers who
are coming from Java background or
c-sharp background as it follows the
object-oriented programming approach
you can create native mobile application
using angular with the help of ionic and
native script frameworks but it doesn't
mean like you have to learn native
rhyming languages as well
or would require much of an extra
knowledge other than angle in fact you
can go ahead and build mobile apps using
the same HTML Javascript and CSS code
that you have already coded for your way
back pretty cool right and to extend it
further you can build a cross-platform
mobile application that is you can paint
the application that is supported in
Android or in iOS with the same skill
with the same web development skills
that is HTML Javascript and CSS and with
angular this transition will be a piece
of cake for you so that is the best part
about it without putting much of an
effort without hiring people that are
good at iOS app development or people
that are good at Android app development
you the same knowledge that you have for
developing web app you can build native
mobile apps now for ionic you can go
ahead with hybrid apps basically hybrid
apps are a mixture of native application
and web application now that we have
covered all of its features there are
plenty of other features of angular as
well we'll cover all those features
while going around in this beginner
course now it's time to look at an
angular application that I have created
so that you can have an idea what kind
of application you can create using
angles so let me open my IDE first where
I have already opened my project folder
so this inside this source folder all my
source code resides so these are my
components as you can see I have a
component for my home page from my about
page for movie details it's a top movies
website that shows you a list of top 250
movies that you should watch before you
die now for rendering this web app on
your web browser you go ahead with a
command ng search if you see over here I
have written this code using typescript
that's why the dot TS extension and your
browser does not understand typescript
it's well familiar with JavaScript but
it doesn't know how to render a
typescript that's why what I am trying
to do over here is when I execute an NG
serve command you
Angela framework you compile your
typescript file into JavaScript files
that can be rendered on your local
machine so I have got this for
JavaScript file as my output of that
compilation main what bundler chair
style dot burn law chest and vendor or
burn law chairs at last we have inline
dot onload gist
finally these files are being rendered
on 4200 in my local PC so this is the
website that I have got over here now if
I click on movies list you can see the
website a list of movies now if you
click on any of this movie you can see
the details about that movie the
interesting thing about this application
is it's a single page application even
if you feel like you are browsing
through multiple pages in a website it's
actually a single page being rendered on
your browser that's the power or that's
the responsiveness that you get out of
your single page application and how do
you navigate within different different
view or different different pages
through routers that we'll learn later
on in our session so I hope you enjoyed
this first video see you in the next
video where I'll teach you how to
install anger in your local machine
which is a piece of cake and I will also
show you the entire project structure
basic angular project structure for now
it may seem a bit confusing or very much
difficult but it's not difficult like
that
I will explain you what each file does
in your project structure thanks for
watching bye I hope you enjoyed
listening to this video please be kind
