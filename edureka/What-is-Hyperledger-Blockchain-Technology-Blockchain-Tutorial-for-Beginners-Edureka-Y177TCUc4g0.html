Erica today I'm going to be talking to
you all about high Palazzo we're going
to see what all the jars behind hyper
ledger is about why exactly does it hold
a certain amount of significance in
today's IT industry then I'm going to
briefly demonstrate through a simplistic
example as to how hyper logic works and
then to conclude the video we're going
to go through some of the few I pledge
of projects that have gone really famous
over time so without wasting much time
let's jump into today's video now before
I tell you what hyper ledger is let me
tell you what hyper ledger isn't because
it's really easy to get confused in
today's world with so many blockchain
platforms are so forcely hyper ledger is
not a cryptocurrency that so many people
seem to be interested in today's world
above that hyper ledger is not a
blockchain and neither is it a company
so what exactly is hyper lazio well to
begin with hyper ledger is a project
under the Linux Foundation so like other
projects under the Linux Foundation for
example nodejs are joined drone code and
many more hyper ledger is also an
open-source development project where
people from all over the planet can come
and help hype latch or get developed as
a software and as a platform now
according to the executive director of
hyper ledger brian behlendorf hyper
ledger is an open source community of
communities to benefit an ecosystem of
hyper ledger based solution providers
and users focused on blockchain related
use cases that will work across a
variety of industrial sectors so what
exactly does that mean
well in simpler terms in analogies hyper
ledger can be thought of as a software
that enables developers all across the
globe to develop blockchain based
solutions for their particular
businesses at this point some of you who
are slightly versed with the blockchain
technology might be thinking that hey we
have platforms like etherium why can't
they do what hyper laser does well the
ethos of hyper laser is that it believes
every business or industry is unique in
its own ways an application standing for
that service must be personalized
unlike the etherium blockchain which
runs on a very generalized protocol for
everything that runs on its network
you will see what I mean in a short
while now let me give you a brief
history about hyper ledger before
darling deeper into its mechanics so
first of all hyper ledger began as a
small project by limited number of
developers who came from various sectors
like finance supply and data management
all these people had one common goal in
mind and that is to make the blockchain
as a technology were accessible to the
world so with these things in mind
developers started testing the
interactions between applications and
secure blockchain networks while
rigorous testing between the two
developers involved realized that public
block chains that require each beer to
execute each and every transaction and
run consensus at the same time - takes a
huge blow when it comes to scalability
as the network takes a really exhaustive
measure to ensure security above that
any transaction that has a measure of
confidentiality and privacy attached to
it cannot be executed on the blockchain
due to its public nature as every ledger
on the network will get updated and
confidentiality is lost to understand
the concept of a private and
confidential contract let's look at a
simplistic example let's say Bob in
India wants to buy chocolate from his
friend Alice who lives in Switzerland as
they were old friends Alice decides to
sell Bob her chocolates at a pretty
generous discount but the catch here is
that Alice also supplies to a number of
different markets which still need to
buy chocolates from her and the standard
rate above that to actually get her
chocolates from Switzerland to India
there are a number of procedures to
fulfill for example firstly she sends
the chocolates to the mailing service
which in turn validates the supply after
product is packed and sealed the
district verification takes place after
that during shipping distribution logic
is verified and validated and the end
payment verification is done before the
package finally reaches Bob but the
point here is that even though there are
so many third parties involved in the
transaction they do not need to know
about Alice and Bob special deals now
when this whole transaction is run on a
public blockchain network where every
pure has to go through every transaction
confidentiality of the deal becomes void
and every single letter on the network
gets updated about Alice's and Bob
special deal
this is where hyper ledger comes and
wins the game on a hyper ledger based
network the parties were directly
affiliated with the deal are connected
the ledges that get updated about the
special deal an only Alice and Bob thus
maintaining the private and confidential
aspect of the contract let's see how
high pillager actually pulls this off it
all starts with Alice looking up Bob
through an app which in return sends the
query to a membership service and sends
the transaction only to the peers
directly affiliated both the parties now
will generate a result in this two-party
agreement both results generated need to
be the same for it to get validated but
in other transactions whether there are
multiple different parties other rules
can also be applied as needed the
validated transactions are then sent to
a consensus cloud for ordering these
order transactions are sent back to the
affiliate appears and then committed to
their legends this same pattern of a
transaction is needed by multiple
industries where private and
confidential applications are need to be
met by multiple parties without
processing everything through a single
centralized Authority now that I've told
you what hype ledger is how it pulls off
the prohibition blockchain network let's
go through the architectural changes
that make this all possible the most
notable changes can be seen in the peers
which make up the whole network the
peers are separated into two different
runtimes
and three distinct roles namely
endorsers committers and consent us when
endorsers and commit appears are
executed on the same runtime the consent
appeals are run on a completely separate
runtime this allows - items modular
architecture to allow properties like
consensus to be a plug-and-play feature
which in return allows a high degree of
personalization to the network according
to the needs of the business now let us
go over the peer rules firstly the peer
rule we are going to discuss is that of
a comment on the most simplistic role is
that of a commenter node their only role
is to append validated and order
transactions to the specific ledger once
returned by the consent is normally a
committer can work as an endorser of the
same network but as more and more
restrictions are imposed on the network
the merging of endorses and committers
are completely avoided the second role
is that of an endorser these nodes
simulate the transactions pertaining to
the
book and also prevent the occurrences of
non-deterministic and unstable
transactions it is important to note
that while committers may or may not be
endorses depending on the network
restrictions all endorses act as
committers
on a hyper laser network lastly we have
the consent URLs which work on a
different runtime these nodes are
responsible for running the consensus
algorithm on a network and can be very
well thought of as the body card of the
network who validates every transaction
deciding whether or not it should be
added to a ledger now that we know what
hyper ledger is where it's necessary and
how it works
let's compare hyper ledger to the two
most renowned blockchain networks and
that is Bitcoin and etherium starting
with cryptocurrencies while Bitcoin and
etherium both have their respective
currencies
- ledger has no official form but if a
business deems necessary that they need
a coin for themselves they can always
implement one moving on to networks
Bitcoin and the theorem are both highly
public blockchain networks hyper ledger
on the other hand is a consortium
blockchain which is also known as a
commission network talking about
consensus algorithms Bitcoin uses char
256 which stands for secure hashing
algorithm 256 and aetherium uses another
hashing algorithm called a cache first
while hyper ledger uses a completely new
concept called practical for Byzantine
tolerance which basically checks how
much time a transaction has resided on a
machine Bitcoin has no support for smart
contracts or any sort of business logic
for that matter on the other hand a
theorem and hi Felicia both support
smart contracts the theorem smart
contracts are mostly written in solidity
while hyper ledger smart contracts are
written in chamber on the topic of the
language each network is written in
Bitcoin is written in C++
while the theorem and Haifa ledger use a
mix of Golan along the Python or Java
respectively talking about projects
under high fellatio there are a few
noteworthy ones like hypo logic fabric
and sawtooth typology of fabric has been
extensively used in the supply chains
and market networks and sawtooth has
seen success in the fishing industry
there's also hyper ledger Aroha which is
used for developing blockchain based
mobile applications another project
hyper ledger in d is used for
decentralized identified
and databases for business networks now
let's summarize the topics we've covered
in today's video we started off by
saying what hyper ledger is then we saw
the need of hyper ledger in today's IT
industry thirdly we saw how high palaca
pulls off a commission blockchain
network and the architectural changes
that make them all possible lastly we
compared hyper ledger to the two most
famous blockchain networks that is
Bitcoin and ethereal I hope you enjoyed
