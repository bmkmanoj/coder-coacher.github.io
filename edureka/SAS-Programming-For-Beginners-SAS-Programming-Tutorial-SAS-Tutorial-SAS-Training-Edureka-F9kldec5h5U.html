from the business intelligence analytics
backroad I had been working like for
more than two decades
and my first interaction with SAS was at
the 2004 let's get going with SAS
programming we're going to see what data
analytics is what SAS is different tools
in the data analytics industry that will
go into some of the programming
techniques its ass so without further
delay let's get into what data analytics
tools what are the data exactly what
data does it tools are wiseass
what is SAS as features programming
concepts Eric a study will be doing a
testing for red the best also will be
doing a testing for Association in that
what are the job creds it's not data
analytics now actually going forward
though businesses really survive without
data or say without digging into the
data data is already present and now we
need data analytics to get insights from
the data let me give you a small example
I recently did a project for one of the
ecommerce companies and the purpose was
to find out the propensity of buying by
customers the penciling of buying
likelihood a bike so what I did was I
collected the data from their website it
then further bifurcated it into
different variables or loss a features
be the behavior it behavior what they
they are coming I was trying they're
spending which page do they come from
there were certain others similarly they
were of the demographics and how they
are big acquired there are there are
certain ads from where they are coming
or certain websites where they're coming
from all those actually collated
together we came up with an inference
that 72% of that orders are coming from
50% of their customers so less than 50%
are just contributing to the 8% of the
audit
now when you get this insight you
is actually be marketing to the above
50% so your retarder investment would be
good
you can upsell cross-sell to these
people they'll buy easily dead the other
50% so this is what data analytics can
do for you data analytics paves the way
for the creation of Bexley products so
this is one of the case studies which I
just spoke about and on this you can
develop a product where you can put in
the parameters if it gives you a result
whether this person is going to buy or
not it will help you as he reese manage
resources are there Olympics marriage
resources so as to reduce costs now as I
mentioned with this example you can
reduced cost by actually upselling
cross-selling to the stock 50% there you
go to have to put more resources but
then you'd see they'll be bi and your
cost your return of respect is going to
be more analytics enables better
work-related decisions of course you're
boring formed with the historical
trimmed of data some patents are there
so you can take a better decision
meeting customer needs through better
services now this work it's one of the
examples which I gave right though there
are others like recommendation digits
recommendation engines for example if
you are going to sub D Commerce website
like a basin or flip cards there are
several others you see whenever you buy
something these are get rid a base or
the people who have bought something
there are some recommendations so we
take customer needs through better
services instead of searching that our
website they come up with these are the
things other people have bought so you
may be interested in that so so they are
trying to match your needs match the
needs of the people who are buying a
certain product so that is like meeting
customer needs through better services
there are several tools in the market
for analytics there are paid tools there
are open source tools in the paid tools
sapphic actually holds the leaders
quadrant of pattern there are other
visualization tool like tableau Excel is
a good old tool click View slug and open
source are exactly coming up as so is
facet
and I would say if the open-source tools
are is right now leading but better is
coming up because of more features
invited that what our has Apache spark
Apache strobe bigot hide these are the
last three are actually computed chopper
do so these are other tools which are
used for data analytics so why SAS there
are so many tools in the market Wise has
few of the aspects for SAS are ease of
learning data idling capability
graphical capabilities advancement in
tools a job scenario we look at this on
my work he's alerting SAS is easy to
learn it provides easy options proxy
cool for people who already know sequel
so you could write sequel we just have
to write proc sequel for SAS to know
that the big statements are actually
going to be sequel statement and a time
you write a quit out of the other hand
has a very steep learning curve as it is
a low-level programming language I have
actually worked on are as well but I
felt that it really is a pretty curve
compared to SAS so assassin easy to
learn and now you have sat at the price
guide which is like Begley driven it
even much is here that reading space as
they can he'll look at the buildings
assassins on par with all leading tools
including are at Python when it comes to
helping huge about the data and options
for parallel computation so wherever
actually you're creating a bottle you
would need historical data here a tool
which cannot handle the large amount of
data will not succeed because ball data
you have better is your prediction let's
say you have to develop a bottle and you
can just have a data for like last two
years compared to another tool which can
regular data for the last 10 years that
the one which is spreading the data for
10 years is going to give you better
prediction that leather tool which is
actually just Erlich data for two years
so data capacity handling a data
handling capabilities are good in size
and that's what makes a predictable
statistical tool
much more robust I would say much more
better in the predictions such as scores
there as well
graphical capabilities the SAS provides
the function of graphic graphical
capabilities with a little bit of
loading it is possible to customize of
these plots so of course you can
directly draw the plots or graphical
representation is there in SAS and the
graphical representation for example you
have a data set you want to see the
outliers it's better to see in a
graphical representation that in a
tabular representation so SAS also
scores here advanced method into boots
SAS releases updates in controlled
environment as they are well tested our
advisor on the other hand have open
contribution that there are chances of
errors in the latest development so the
difference between open source and
slicing software is that a licensed
software they'll actually be releasing
passes which are already tested you will
get a support whereas in contrast the
open source tools anyone can contribute
moving passes but are the tested or
they're not tested we don't know other
piece is you're getting stuck so there
is no way to get a support for that it's
just that you have to google it and see
if someone has ever got stuck with such
a incident and that's the major
difference between the open source and a
license to job scenario globally SAS is
the market leader in available corporate
jobs in India SAS controls about 70% of
the data analytics market share compared
to 15% up for R so the further to to add
to that
worldwide SAS has like 35% share which
is a market leader other than compared
to rest of the tools and I believe that
trend is going to go ahead because
SAS actually will be able ready see the
different aspects of SAS and beat the
market leader being the magic leaders
Magic Quadrant of got the 70% of the
jobs are being controlled by SAS it'll
take the best resource so all the trends
are pointing towards
is the leader and will will be staying
great forward
what it says we already saw the features
that aspect these are very graphical
usage data LED pasady job bright the
Tetra now let's dig into what is that
SAS is statistical analytics system is a
software suite of it web analytics
multivariate analysis well the business
intelligence data management and
predictive analytics half has done with
at least several of its products SAS is
for statistical analysis for sure it's
used for bi reporting it is used then
the component for data integration it
says it's like an EDL - like data state
informatic etc SAS is also used for
project management for quality shorts
and SAS as well come up with a dedicated
products for it destry's like clinical
trials so they are coming up with the
board board products and now actually
they have a robust set of products where
you can go vertical wife also SAS has
certification which actually gives you
something good on your CV that Europe
they sell certified or you are a SAS
position-less advice programming
certified it so on it is developed by
SAS Institute SAS provides graphical
point-and-click
user interface for non-technical users
and more advanced options through sales
language so you can do a SAS language
right a SAS language you can also do a
pointed like SAS language is like the
base SAS
even if you are doing a pointed click at
the back end it's the basis which is
being written so so there is a ease of
use now with the graphical user
interface termagant
has at the price guide is the example
presence and you can even learn such the
heading port what a requirements are so
SAS give flexible extensible
deteriorated and powerful so what all
that ties up to is it provides business
solutions is this aa nuisance for
example I gave you an example of this
ecommerce company where we are actually
trying to find out the propensity of my
so that's a business solution or a
recommendation through
sass holidays of course you can do a
reported decision reporting the
practical reporting compressional
reporting data accessed and management
you have the SAS data integrator for
that reporting a graphics of course
that's part of the analytics piece and
visualization and discovery so whatever
you are doing Eddie or say wherever you
get a data set you would like to
visualize it as to how the data is
scattered than the outliers so you can
discover some outliers and maybe there's
a treatment for that you want to do so
all that is possible with SAS let's look
at some of the features I've already
explained some of them but we can go
into that get data access so SAS can
connect to different databases it can
connect to a flat files it can connect
to the structured databases like Rocco
or sequel server or de Teja so it has
all those capabilities reporting of
course as I mentioned in the last slide
so base once you have the data aid it's
great there is a data set created it's
asked for the data set is created you
can merge the data sets or do some
vertical or horizontal array of the data
to come up with that report what is
required by the business of SAS is very
much capable of that transformations
once you have the data you can do a
transformation or when you're pulling
the data you can do a transformation
process data integrator that's the ETL
tool so it is very much capable of the
entire be a stack which is like the data
set or set a data base and then you have
the ETL again metaphorically so all
those SAS is capable of SAS framework so
SAS framework accessing the data barrage
analyze it present in any of the data
set asides project what we have is we
collect the data which is like accessing
the data that is the data which is
manipulating or data preparation
analyzing it creating the model and
pelleting it it fritz or the
storytelling so the SAS web framework
actually escaping
of all these data sites pieces are the
four phases of the data set
let's see access to accessing the data
it could be the flat file CSV Excel
specs file or some structure database
sequel or echo it has the capability to
get the data for you once you get the
data you can manage it
subset area creating variables validate
lis merging the data set pending the
data set so this is the data
manipulation piece what you're seeing
the marriage fell apart then you have
the analyze analyze is you creating the
model here may be a regression model
forecasting models or just a simple
descriptive statistics and then you have
presented it summary reports list
reports or the graphical representation
whatever suits it says is very much
capable of all the four components of
data sides all the four phases of the
data set some of the SAS components
include base SAS is both widely used
computed it has data management facility
and also lets you analyze data now any
code you're writing or say any graphical
who you're using it says the the SAS at
the price guy or there is a
transformation tools as they died
degraded behind the scene there is a
base SAS code which is be greeted by SAS
instead of uniting it stands right side
because that's at the step they said so
so SAS in the base SAS rating you learn
the basis which is actually the language
which is which has understood so base
SAS is all big most widely used computed
graph is representation baked under
static key here so graphical for us to
figure out the outliers or some trade
some patterns graphical representation
is there SAS that lets you perform
statistical paralysis with variance
analysis the various analysis be
descriptive or predictive success that
allows you that SAS PDS is there is
suited for time series analysis you can
do
these analysis of this look for the
moving averages it sought to forecast
something those things can be covered it
has EDS programming concepts it says
let's have a look at some programming
concepts it says let's write a program
to print the first 10 see body syllables
for a favor se series up here so what we
are doing is we are actually doing Terra
iterations I going from 1 to 10 we are
going to execute the loop this what we
are going do against be a create a
variable called fib and we are actually
having these numbers if the lag of
numbers submission of that it'd be our
if I is equal to 1 then Febby as one
that we are going till I goes to 10 so
I'm just going to wrap this code in this
code a data set called people they see
will be created and now I'm going to
break this data set
here we have I going from 1 to 3rd ed
the submission of Civilization series
number and the lag in the previous
supper this is how it is going to be one
plus one is so it was one year one year
one plus one is two two plus one is
three two plus three is five three plus
five is eight and so on so that's a
small data set being created here let's
have a look at our code and let me
explain you the code here we define a
variable fit to fight the dextra very
suitable favorable is equal to the sum
of the current safe number at the
previous step number the lab function is
used to retrieve the last function and
patches the value of the previous victim
work now this lad function which is
being used you could use a lag of to
hear it by default it's a lag of one so
the previous number lag of Q is like to
the birds back now the slag function can
be used in for example there is a
children's company and you have losses
or say the profit let's say take losses
of quarter one quarter two quarter three
quarter for buy policies or say it a
single policy you have the losses for
quarter one quarter two quarter three
quarter for and now you create another
variable where you lag it by one so
where you had quarter one there'll be a
black what a two will be a half fig next
so it would be a quarter what data so
that way what you can do is create
another variable where you have Q 2
minus Q 1 we can see what are what is
the difference
excu two better than Q 1 or not
similarly Q 3 versus Q 2 and so on
there are SAS class we can actually
represent this with at Bob or with it
example here I just wanted to let you
know about bit of the lad culture proc
step
print the data set to data set table AC
so whenever the SAS runs this a data
step it will create a data step for you
but it's not going to break data set for
you for that you have to explicitly give
a print command we
three columns either output data set
observations observations is a collar
which comes by default and if you don't
want that we have to write no ops I
citations what we got here and females
the variable which we created so ABS if
I go from one to ten whereas then
contains the first sensible AC double so
it's summation of symbolic number plus
the lag of it data is the central to
every data set it's as data is available
in tabular form variables occupy the
column space and observations occupy the
row space now a SAS data set is very
much like a spreadsheet data excel sheet
so here the columns are called variables
and the rows are called observations
that's the terminology being used it
it's asked so people from data warehouse
or ETL backgrounds or even the reporting
background cargoes or SSRIs or obiee so
here the the terminology as I mentioned
they might be using columns and rows so
we used variables and observations here
SAS treats numbers as we barek data and
everything else falls on the character
data at SAS has two types of data so
instead of string where care it just has
the American character that's the two
types of data what that deals with SAS
get dot this is something important
because house a streets the date SAS has
a different way of treating the date
let's say
here is a double line it
this is zero this is
plus one and so on this side is all
negative let's say this is minus one
zero here corresponds to first jeogori
dai did sexy zero cars falsifies every
1960 anything on the right of it or
after it is a plus hearing second every
1960 SAS will read it has what 31st
December 1959 fashion read it as by this
one sews a street date at the barrack
now in the base as exempt digitally ask
this question so this is very important
whenever you break the dated SAS there
that said you will see at number two
thousand five hundred or whatever
depending upon the date and that's the
reason why you see that rate because
once every 1960 is created as zero
anything after that is all positive
numbers anything before that is called
negative doubles as part of apart from
these dates NASA be diligent in a
special way at SAS date is a dimeric
value equal to the number of days since
first everyday I did sixty as I
mentioned position buried I did sixties
they can zero anything before that is
negative anything after that is all
positive apart from date values there
are many tools to work on date such as
informants for reading dates functions
for manipulating date its format for
printing the date so how the data is
coming in you use in forward for that
how you want the date to be written
because as is going to just write a
double as you're seeing on the right
side how do you want to write it there
are different formats to write the dates
okay
in format as I mentioned register that
informant is house asses to read the
data for a character data you write a
dollar sign with the width of the or the
length of the data read character data
length of W the verdict is with the odd
decimals reach the very data of length W
with the decimal points a date is 7 d dy
y of it that's the format there are
different ways of writing the date how
it is coming in its format actually
tells us how to read this data format is
something which tells us how to write
the data will be reading the data from
the input file a reward a to be rated it
asserted other format to use a format
for that so it's all it is to read and
forward is to write the data from SAS
SAS data a former example for example
here we have the birthday and they
create a new data set we are reading
from the sample dataset and we are
creating a data set called formatted
students formatted and avoid the
birthday it mmddyy dead dot so that
format this is going to change in this
form it's like mmm / DD / y Wi-Fi right
so that that's how it gets changed so
this is the format when you might have
read this file you'll say inputting how
the that is coming it loops loops in SAS
out of three dates a do statement that's
the simplest of loops do statement is
like you execute certain statement did
that do loop if this is this if losses
are greater than say 200 do this okay
keep on doing it till as long as the
losses are coded about grades are
divided do until it do while so they
also do the same stuff that but what
they do is do a deal will check the
condition after executing the first
isolation
whereas do-while will execute it before
so if the condition is met do-while will
not give you anything at all whereas do
what then will execute at least once a
dead check for the condition so do my
checks is is at the top do what they
check at the bottom that's the
difference it do it delayed do-while
statement if that that makes basis with
your question as well let's see what
attending in budget week they are both
actually covering the data sets but
appending there's a vertical
concatenation whereas buzick does a
horizontal concatenation let's uh
disturb this with our example we have
let's say variable a variable V oops
if there is a
data set where we have variable a
variable C so C 0 1 C 0 2 C 0 0 3 let's
say there are 4 observations here this
variable may be like expenses
and here we have another data set let's
say data set one data set two
and here we have C 0 0 8 C 0 0 2 C 0 0 1
it seems it a little fight let's say
this could be that for this person has a
what make of car let's say they have
Maruti Toyota or does it you die
now when you do a vertical concatenation
or say appending of two datasets what
will happen is
you
a new data set is created which is like
this this is a pending or a vertical
concatenation now for merging what will
happen is
you have c001
you have c00 to
these two will go off
this is called the horizontal cat cat
evasion or budget now see the difference
with merging if you have a magic key
that records are tagged horizontal or
this is called the horizontal could
carry this vertical concatenation the
condition for merging is your variable
on which you are actually combining the
data set that should be sorted although
it's not sorted here the purpose was
just to show you example so this is the
difference between bird seed head
appending SAS procedures so SAS actually
has just two components the data step is
the proc step
there are several procedures in SAS
import data sets to manipulate the data
set content is like for getting the
better data grid just to get the data
set predict frequency this can be used
for different with the frequency it
could be a cross tabulation it could be
for just one variable or there are other
like chi-square test etc you can do with
frequently sought prog start actually
words it's sorting the data set on
whatever variable be difficulty setting
forward is if you want some forward to
be defied or a data set you can defy the
format and apply it in two different
data sets proc survey select Prague
survey selectors if you want to randomly
select some data or samples data from a
data set proc server select can be used
there are different ways of selecting or
different methods you could use Purvis
proc survey select as well transpose and
is like here where you could word owes
it to columns you could use proc
transpose proc B's for descriptive
statistics summary is if you want it's
more the same as proc needs
it's just that frog meet by default has
gives the data set printed before
summary you have to explicitly write
appropriate covered proc reg is you go
to rack database or thread variable
options is if you want to see what are
the options available for example we
have Bob's first herbs
drop keep these are on options which
comes with sass by default so you can
actually see that with the Rockets well
proc export is what if you want to
export the file that's where you could
use prog export brought beads is one of
the most powerful and flexible
procedures it's as it gets for
descriptive analytics what's your other
products pretty good by default they can
give you a number of observations tax or
Betty Boop some extended deviation but
if you want others you can always write
what are the things you want to have for
example here we are grouping it by sex
so class sex it variables are eight high
dead weight for females that are died
observations variable age box of age the
sub the beam median standard deviation
at the range so this frog bees can give
you a good set of good statistics
descriptive statistics let's see the
testing of randomness so here what we
are going to do is we go to play with
this file where we have like 10 billion
records and we are I'm just going to
read the code or this to check for end
of this now it read the best we are
going to use frog frac with chi-square
and here this is the small code let me
actually in this case our null
hypothesis is that the number selected
are random and alternate hypothesis is
they are dot random so once I run this
code let me explain you this code first
of all we're actually creating a data
set called test we are calling a file by
10 billion dot txt we are inputting the
respond one digit and whether it's
bigger randomly selected order is
capturing the iterations this is a
automatic variable being captured props
rec we are writing the proc Furyk or
checking for randomness
for the variable digit and with a
chi-square setting the width of each
number
width is like one dot because it's
written in the same
we use a double at the rate that it
holds the number if that it goes to the
next number goes to the best
observations or next row that's the
really have the devil at the rate it
what is the length of the digit as I
mentioned as it's an automatic variable
being captured in the variable order and
here we are reading the chi-square test
it's set up to I'll be reading for one
of them and I'll do another test see we
already have the repairer the prop track
of this
we'll get a simple statistics here then
we get that chi-square test frequency
percent cumulative frequency absorb it
here we get the chi-square test you get
the chi-square value of two point seven
eight
but the p-value here is point nine seven
two point nine eight seven two which
leads we will fail to reject the null
hypothesis and we will conclude that the
number selected are added up the numbers
elected are tagged up so the p-value is
telling us that we fail to reject the
hypothesis and the numbers are random
which was our null hypothesis now
another example we can go with a test of
association with the chi-square or prop
rec now test of Association what this
does is here the done hypotheses Donna
posture is variables are dependent and
are alternate hypotheses is they are
associated so it's a test of Association
what we are doing with chi-square test
let's see here is here's the data set
for auto industry or sale from auto
dealer you have the make of the cars the
price miles per gallon representative
who sold it whether it's a foreign big
or a domestic big I will just create
this data set it Britain for us
here is the data set so the other way is
of the raises I we just do a price
versus miles per gallon price versus
miles per gallon price is a digit at
miles per gallon is also a digit so
there'll be a contingency table or a
cross tabulation which will not bake but
said it said what we will be doing is we
will use another procedure called frog
format we are saying that creating a
format called PR and we are actually
defining no price bid price at high
price similarly for miles per gallon
whether it's a low average or high we
create this format two formats FDA PR it
then we apply this format to our data
set this is the usage of frog for bed we
apply this for bed to price it miles per
gallon I'll just show you what the new
data set looks like if then we do a test
of Association of it we go up rock bread
here let's say a price it miles per
gallon looks like this so now if I do a
cross tabulation of this to find out if
there is an association between price
and miles per gallon this will give me a
much better picture we will get the
cross tabulation we will also get the
chi-square because we asked for it see
here the prices are low and the average
is high or the miles per gallon is high
we have eleven point five four percent
population it this did accept who have
low-priced
and highway miles per gallon that is
actually something which is desirable
you can also go for the luxury segment
where the prices are high if miles per
gallon is going to be this low so price
is high and miles per gallon highway
don't have anything in this data set so
going forward the other thing what the
test what we wanted to do is let me
write a chi-square tests for Association
we get several other tests or statistics
what we are concerned with is a
chi-square here and I see a point to one
point to one percent the probability is
zero point two words in this case
we will accept the dull hypothesis that
they are indicated that they are debated
price and miles per gallon RTD that
they're not associated since our p-value
is for it to work generally in the
industry or the academics point point
zero five is the p-value what is going
to get edited below that you reject the
hypothesis else you accept it on a
hypothesis or in this case we'll accept
that the hypothesis I'd say they are a
dependent right so that was a test for
Association another piece we what we can
actually look at is the job trade so the
job trades the following the job hood
obsess you know if you look at the job
grids SAS and SAS modeling job grids
so the third SAS SAS modeling we are
seen in 2015 February 2017 the jobs the
data analytic jobs 47% listed SAS SAS
modeling was listed by 11% so that it
could be that both of them there but
percentage-wise if you see 27 percent of
all the data analytics jobs which are
listed so that make flick like a huge
impact that 47 percent of the data
analytic jobs are actually showing 47
the tread or the word size of it so SAS
has been a market leader but it comes to
data analytics tools of course this is
visible oh and the trade had been going
up and down but still like it captures
47 percent as of this year February 15
right so just a quick recap we talked
about the data and analytics tools the
paid tools the open source tools where
SAS heads as far as data little circuit
said why SAS because of ease of learning
the data allocate abilities graphical
capabilities advanced that includes job
Siderius what else ask the SAS features
just look at some of the programming
concepts in SAS it has four it did this
test the Association test again what the
job trade it says
today on so with that I come to the end
of this presentation I hope you enjoyed
it and you'll be considered rating size
as the analytics tool going forward and
as I ventured it has a great potential
ease of learning and it can do all the
data sides you can take you through all
the data sides phases which you will be
requiring actually going forward because
data science is something which is like
a hot market child right though and with
that I come to the end of the
presentation thank you I hope you
