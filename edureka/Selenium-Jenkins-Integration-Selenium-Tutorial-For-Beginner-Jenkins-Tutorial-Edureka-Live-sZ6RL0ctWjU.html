name is Burton and I'm super excited be
here on in real life with you guys
so in great session I will show you how
selenium and Jenkins can be used
together what she kind of is testing in
the DevOps lifecycle and the best part
for today's session is that it's gonna
be demonstration right so I'm going to
show you a demonstration of how a
selenium and Jenkins can be used
together to achieve continuous testing
in the doorstep cycle so by the end of
the session you'll also know why Jenkins
is one of the best their works tools and
are you will understand what role it
plays in continuous testing so my guess
is that everybody are turning this
session are aware of for these key
terminologies like car selenium divorce
James and condiments testing okay and
yeah but before that let me tell you
that if you guys have any doubts during
the session you can now drop your
queries in the comment box and either me
or my team will watch them immediately
so this sit back relax and enjoy it Rick
alight for the next 30 minutes so that I
can learn something really exciting and
these would be the topics that I will be
covering in procession and first of all
give you an introduction to what a
selenium what is divorce and where's the
goal that selenium placed in the divorce
lifecycle and after that I will get the
main topic of frame that is how selenium
and Jenkins can be used together to
achieve countries testing in the door
file cycle and I would finish off
recession by giving you a demonstration
on the same I would be creating a desk a
dueling or selenium and build jobs using
Jenkins to achieve continuous testing so
let me just to go to the next slide and
get started today and first of all let
me ask you this question how many of you
know how what is selenium and how it
works and most of you know that it's
open source and it's for what meaning
web browser test but what how many
people have actually used selenium okay
anyways properly Haram message but
anyways I'll have to cover the stopping
zone Salem is basically an open-source
tool which automates we have browser
tests all right and it's probably the
best and it's the most popular tool and
it's widely adopted for automating
desktops and because of that reason it
has found its place in the DevOps
lifecycle and on there are three
important reasons why selenium is the
best among other automation testing
tools and those three reasons are its
programming language support its web
browser support and its operating system
support so when it comes to programming
language support you can write stadium
scripts in all of these popular
languages like Java Python Perl Ruby
c-sharp or even PHP and when it comes to
web browser support you can perform
cross browser testing now cross-browser
testing is the act of performing tests
in different web browsers right so in
from tests on Chrome Firefox Internet
Explorer and Safari you have bar comes
code in that way and most of all cerium
can also be you know used on all of
these operating system platforms like
Windows or Mac or Linux so yeah that's
the biggest benefit right so you have
but three important advantages you know
you can it has programming language
support across all these languages you
have a web browser support and also
operating system support across all
these platforms so these are the three
main reasons why it stands out as an
automation testing tool and why it's the
best among all the other automation
classic loads now having said so much
about selenium let's see what is the
DevOps and I see you have what is the
need for the dogs methodology so DevOps
is software development approach which
involves continuous development
continuous testing continuous
integration continuous deployment and
continuous monitoring of the software
throughout its development lifecycle
so what and in today's market is going
divorce is the most effective means
develop software applications because it
overcomes the limitations of agile
development and is there people other
people here who don't know what is agile
development
anyways or quickly can be replied visit
that's keys I'll give you a brief
volatile development and then I'll talk
about the benefits that you observe
result or not okay but anyways a child
development no health so develop
software quickly but the problem is
there's no mobility in operations
meaning the act of deploying to
production and monitoring those
operations is still not fast and that's
where dog scores over agile development
right interrupt this ability boot in
development and in operations and you
can ask power and there are two battles
even after the application is actually
your developer in deployed its
continuously monitored and the bug fixes
and the updates are continuously
integrated and there's a hatchery
between the depth and the office so
that's the advantage of DevOps edge when
you compare it with a child development
and if you can see the image over here
you can see that on the left hand side
you have all the year operations and
activities perform with the development
team right let's call the development
activities and then on the right side
you have all the operation activities we
have the actor is like a deployment
operation and monitoring order right so
any application that needs to be
developed it will first be developed in
small sprints right the entire software
will be developed and you know release
little smaller sprints and smaller
cycles where the planning coding
building and testing would be would be
done and then that would be deployed
right
it'll be deployed to production and then
that would be operated and then it would
be monitored for performance now when
this is done ideally what would happen
is develops engineers they would get to
know one of the bugs and they would get
to know what are the flaws in the
software before the clients or the
customers because the DevOps tools would
immediately notify that yeah that about
is Reyes would know immediately what the
bugs and the flaws are and they can now
get started with fixing those bugs right
as in when there's the next release
where they'll be you know deploying
the new features at that time they can
also fix all these bugs and release them
all together
that's what is the antic over here right
so you can see an arrow that goes across
here to the next cycle so once one cycle
of the Ox is done we start the next
cycle where the next set of features and
the ER the bugfixes of the first set of
features those are done the planning is
done coding is done building is done
it's tested properly and then it's
deployed to production and once it's
deployed production it's operated on and
again it's performance is monitored and
again the cycle continues so it goes
back to planning and yeah the cycle is
basically never-ending and what helps
the cycle stay there is the integration
aspect so once it's tested its
integrated with the existing framework
right before deploying to production
because integration is the most
important aspect and yeah that's the
that's the whole benefit of DevOps and
that's the strength of DevOps I'm pretty
sure that you understood the ops by now
and if you have any doubts let me know
because what I'm going to show next is
I'm going to talk about the DevOps two
that we are going to use to achieve
continuous testing right and that's
where selenium fits so today's session
is about continuous testing and say
Liam's role in diopside-- cycle is right
here testing so this is a no-brainer
everyone would know that selenium fits
in the continuous testing phase but what
do you people might not know is that we
have to use tools like test and read and
Jenkins along with selenium to achieve
contains testing now other people who
wouldn't know this can you guys let me
know please I will know what's my
oriental
all right anyways let me continue okay
so we cut the continents testing phase
it involves these three tools right so
we use selenium for creating our test
cases and to get detailed reports of
those test cases whether they pass or
fail and how long it took to execute
that test all those details would be
would be obtained with the help of tests
and read so definitely the framework
which can be used along with the
selenium to perform to perform automated
testing and to perform continuous
testing we use Jenkins
so Jenkins is basically going to
automatically schedule your tests and
it's going to run those tests and if any
of those test cases fail then it's going
to send you email notifications so
that's the role of Jenkins right so
automation testing is achieved with the
help of selenium and definitely but the
very act of country is testing can be
here achieved only when Jenkins is
involved and that's the power of junkets
and that's why it's one of the best also
one of my favorite DevOps tools yeah
that's about on this slide now
moving on we have one now reached the
main topic for today that is how
selenium tests and we and Jenkins work
in harmony to work to get continuous
testing up and running in your DevOps
web cycle right so you achieve
continuous testing we have five
different steps and the first step would
be to create a test case with selenium
on your IDE okay now what I've done is
I've used Eclipse IDE because that's
again my favorite and it's one of the
best tools there but yeah you can now
create the same on either R or NetBeans
IDE or IntelliJ or we have number of
them like Microsoft Visual Studio you
can create a test case on any of them
and once you've created test cases you
have to create you have to convert them
into a test lead or XML file okay the
reason you're converting them into a
test and the XML file is so that you can
now execute that you can execute
multiple test cases at the same time and
also so that you can execute those XML
files to Jenkins the cases are you
cannot ask Jenkins to instantiate an
instance of Eclipse and then run your
programs wet lips right so Jenkins does
not work that it so Jenkins what are you
going to do when you have the files it's
not an excuse
with the help of command wrong right so
that's what dodging cans doesn't that's
why you have to create an XML file which
is executable and if you want to create
an XML file that that is executable we
have to create a pin to is patch file
now what I'm pretty sure that you guys
all know windows a batch file but if
there's anyone that doesn't know windows
batch file it's a simple executable file
which which can have a set of commands
that you know which you usually feed to
your command prompt suppose there are a
set of commands that you type to you
that you type in your command prompt to
achieve certain operations then those
set of commands can be specified as a
list in your windows batch file and when
you just execute the windows bad fellow
you double-click on the methyls batch
file those set of commands will be
automatically executed in the command
prompt so that's the role of a Windows
batch right and when we have this XML
file which would have all the test cases
and when it has all the details of which
test cases needs to be executed you can
you can necessarily be achieved for
tomato test automation and that test
automation can be achieved with the help
of Jenkins so that's where we are going
to step number four okay now this is
where Jenkins comes in the picture and
you can build Jenkins jobs by executing
those batch files and the best part
about Jenkins and the very act of
continuous testing is step number five
very casual jobs to be you're built at
certain times during the day and also
you cannot configure those email
notifications whenever any test case
passes or or any test case fails well
actually you get email notifications
only when your test case fails right but
if once your test case fails and the
first time when your test case is back
you know running that time will get a
notification saying your test case
without your build is again not
successful so mainly it's basically your
the email notification is used to let
you know that your desk is a scale and
there's a major bug or a major flaw in
your rod in your code so these are the
five important steps that are involved
in achieving Canaries testing well if
you doubt please put that in the chat
box because the next is going to be a
very interesting part of the session
go and show you a live demonstration of
how the entire life cycle works right
I'm gonna sugar demonstration of how to
create a test case on selenium right on
Eclipse IDE and then converted
invitations XML file are created and
build your and Jenkins job and share you
in those
yeah I'm just like that whatever
commands are that those would be
executed right so in our case the
commands would be that of executing the
XML file
so those XML files would be executed and
when you put those XML files in directly
your test case would be here would be
active write your text your test case
would be you would start executing okay
selenium is used for creating your test
cases right you'll be creating your test
cases there but the problem is you will
not get detailed test reports and the
different test cases cannot be managed
easily so these are the two limitations
and if you want to overcome these two
limitations you can use s changing so
peasantry gives you a very nice nice way
and good it has very good display right
to show you the reports I will show you
that when I go to the demo I'll show you
how the reports will be generated you
know it will show what our test case is
passed in which suit those test cases
where present which test they were
present and how long it took to execute
each of them you will get all those
again lacking and not selenium and
that's why we do a demonstration and let
me just get started with that all right
so hands-on I'll be creating my test
cases with sedimentation tree and
building those with Jenkins so yeah this
is my Eclipse IDE right this is the code
that I am going to execute okay so this
is a very simple code and what i'm doing
here is i'm first of all performing
dynamic tests on two websites that is am
John Bowden and in facebook.com right
to Facebook an ominous search something
on Amazon Cotton's webpage so the entire
code block is divided the entire code is
divided into these blocks and the first
block I'm extending my chromedriver
right and the command to do that is
webdriver got chrome got driver this
basically is to indicate my webdriver to
run my tests on my Chrome browser driver
now in case I want to execute the same
tests on either Mozilla Firefox then I
can use or webdriver dot gecko driver
because gecko drivers the driver used
for running the tests on Mozilla Firefox
and that is only up till that's only
from selenium version 3 right from our
you know a part in Saline selenium
version 2 we were using you know Firefox
OS default you didn't have to work use
any browser driver you only have to use
it for Chrome driver but from version 3
onwards you have to use gecko driver so
that's the thing
and you also specify the path where that
browser driver of yours is present so -
then this path specified that and um the
next line I'm creating or I'm doing an
object for my chrome driver
alright and then the next line is a
simple line println statement which is
asking me to print this hi welcome to
Enriquez youtube live session on my
selenium webdriver so the next block of
my code is all about navigating to am
John Gordon right so this is where my
actual test starts I'm now getting to am
John torrent and I am implementing an
implicit wait over here I am
implementing an implicit weight of 5
seconds and when I say implicit wait
there's a difference between implicit
wait and explicit wait so a lot of
people have that doubt so the difference
is implicit wait
when you say implicit wait you're asking
your web driver to wait for 5 seconds
after you have fetched that particular
of that page or website
right and an explicit wait is nothing
but a wait where you are asking your web
driver to wait until a specific web
element has loaded on the web page so
and oh yeah when you've done these two
things I have the next code block in
bear in which I am specifying my
webdriver to find the element of first
search box on Amazon's pH right so
just like every e-commerce site Amazon
has one so it works where we can search
the list of products that they have so
you can search for those elements by
using the private find element command
okay when I find when I have located
that the I mean I have located that
search box I can send some text so in my
case I'm using the send keys command to
send Nike shoes because I wanna search
their repository for Nike shoes right
and I'm locating the search box with the
help of four PI dot ID located technique
okay we have eight different locator
techniques and I've used some of them in
my code so for my so it works I've used
by ID allocate this is the ID of the
search box I've located it like this and
out percent the keys of Nike shoes then
in my next line I've said driver door to
find element by XPath okay so expose one
of the best ways to find your elements
that are there in the back wheels
because XPath is the most stable most
the time you will not have the ID and
the name that we have here all these
locator techniques would not be there
all the time
right only sometimes you have them but
expert is something that is the standard
that is there for every single element
compass really by default on every
webpage so I have used the XPath to find
the search option and then I'm
performing an operation of click so Nike
shoes would then be searched on Amazon
button then I would go to the results
page and then add navigate to the Amazon
Gordon right and how am i doing that by
this command try border to navigate so
this would ask my driver to navigate
back to Amazon taught on page then get
your page title and that is done by this
command driver dot getwriter
so this would fetch the page title of
ramzan Gordon and store it in a variable
called title which is of type string and
that would be printed in this println
statement okay and we have and the final
core the block of code in my your code
is that of navigating to facebook.com
right I now go to facebook.com and then
I find the element first of all that is
the email ID or field right and then I'm
sending keys ABCD at the rate gmail.com
now this is a very this is a bogus email
address and finding that I'm putting
that email box and I'm assigning this
key this email address and then I'm
finding the element of
correct I'm doing both by using by dot
name locator technique and I'm assigning
the keys one two three four four the
password field and I'm going to the next
line that is the driver or find element
here I would locate the login button and
I'm looking it with the help of by ID
element of greater technique and the
operation I am doing here is click I
would write so here the operation is
assigned keys and here it's click so
when I click of course this is gonna
feel the login is going to feel and
write and when my login fails I've asked
my driver my web driver to quit so that
is a feed by driver or quit okay and the
thing to notice a basel implicit weight
of 60 seconds that's because facebook
takes quite some time to login and
especially if it's wrong credentials it
would take a little longer and you would
actually see my driver
rock you know drive with that my login
has field and then my driver driver
quits after that all right so let me
just quickly say if this an execute this
will show you how the test works
okay now the test case works here this
trip is all working then begins a build
you know create a test in the XML file
and build that job on Jenkins
so yeah Chrome's instantiated I'm John
Warren or Nike shoes into the text box
and then the search option should be
clicked on next yeah that happens there
and then these are the shoes that they
have Nike shoes and then I should now
get back to Amazon Gordon now there you
go now we need to facebook.com
Phoenicians are fed login is clicked and
yeah it should close once it shows that
my facebook gone loading right
successful deterrent yep there you go oh
yeah that's how your test case gets
completed so now let me just talk
quickly to be the result of this test is
right so first of all this is the result
okay it says the default test that was
run as one there is zero failures and
zero scripts my code is run successfully
and these were the two println
statements at
I had specified I'd said hi welcome to
Enriquez YouTube live session I'd said
that and then I had asked for the P
started to be printed and this is the
page title off for Amazon water this is
printed and it says paused Jenkins -
tech show the Jenkins test that you see
here this is the name of the method of
my yar in my code
okay now as you can see here I have a
method that is the Jenkins test and I
noted this method with at the rate test
now whenever you annotate your method
with this method or any method with a
dread test it would indirectly convert
it into a test in G your test okay so
that's the indication you can now you
would automatically suggest you to
import the test in G packages when you
import those packages you can just you
know execute this test test and retest
and anyways getting back to the code
here since I've since I have my code
ready what happened next should have to
create a test in seed or XML file right
so that I can execute this so that can
no it's good this from the command line
but before that let me show you how to
create a test in your XML file because
some people might get their be worried
and they would say that they don't know
to create it but let me tell you that
it's very simple so this is the project
of mine this is my project where the
code is present this is the package name
and this is the class name alright this
is my method name so if you want to
create a test sheet or XML file of this
particular code just click on the class
of yours right click you will have an
option of the test ng click on that and
say convert or test engine when you do
that it would automatically create the
default structure here you can control
which classes you want to execute now
first of all it would ask you for the
name of your suit right the suit I'm
gonna execute the name of that is the
suit itself by default and my test name
is again test I'm dueling the defaulter
names here and in my case I'm only
getting one class so that's why you see
just one class in under
now here here is where the benefit of
Destiny comes in okay if you want to
execute multiple test cases then you can
specify your you can now you can put you
can hit enter and add another tag and
say class name and you can enter the
name of the class which you want execute
and say which package that class is
present okay and if you can see here it
says selenium YouTube demo dot selenium
YouTube demo that's because the
structure this is in is the package name
dot last name okay the XML file would
execute this class which is present
inside this package so if you want to
execute any other class you would have
to first specify the package name where
it's present something like this where
the symbol is and after that you would
have to know have a dot and say in the
class name which you want to execute
okay so that's if you want to do it but
since I don't have any I'm just going to
remove that and let me just click on
finish and when I hit finish it's okay
it's asking me it already exits
you won't override it I would say okay
and yeah this is that XML file which we
have to which we just created
all right so the same XML file is
present over here this is my this is my
path inside this project directory of
mine and if I execute if I will run this
XML file I would get the same output
that I got when I executed that time
right from this code so it's gonna be
the same outputs what I wanna be is time
showing you this but what I want to
actually show you is how to execute this
XML file from the command prompt because
it works from the command prompt then
it's going to work to Jenkins right so
for that let me first of all open the
directory where my coal is present okay
now this is the code it's present in my
workspace and under this project folder
of mine okay
now to execute this through command
prompt after first fold open a command
prompt and let me navigate through this
path so let me say CD space slash
rhenium um oh yeah that's the folder now
I'm say this folder and this is the XML
file that got created right this was the
one that I created just now and if I
want to execute this test ng file then I
have to give the command Java or G dot
deston G dot text and we paste the file
name that is in my case at this destiny
dot XML right now this is I need to
execute your XML file but this will not
work because in my Eclipse I have
specified the path of my class my
Eclipse knows where my class path is and
my Eclipse also knows where my
dependencies and where my jars are
however synthamax doing this through the
command prompt my command prompt does
not know where my class passes and it
does not know where my y are associated
libraries and dependencies or so after
specified that also as parameters or to
my command wrong have to specify that in
this line so to do that let me just go
back and add it in the parameter let me
save flag class path and add the path of
these folders right it's there on this
path so I'm gonna copy this and I'm
gonna be secure okay and I'm gonna place
it your stay slash and put then put a
semicolon I'm gonna paste the same path
again I'm gonna say it then I'm gonna
say :
and the same I'm gonna say aspect now
can any of you tell me why I am doing so
why I have the specified bin and why a
specified lib and especially why there's
an asterisk here after lip reading it in
eyes from the audience
okay anyways moving on one thing that
you got to notice the in the command you
can see that this is the XML file that
needs to be executed and this is the
syntax to execute that command hodgiedot
necessary dot s entry do note that in
the syntax the test entry over here as T
in capital and even ng in capitals all
right so note the syntax and along with
the code along with my Java command I
have specified the class path of where
mine where my your class path is right
my class is present inside the bin
folder correct so always your class path
will be present inside the bin folder by
t4 so if you go to bin this is the
package name and my class is present
over here so I'm despite that in my my
command and I was just prescribed the
path to live now in my lip I have all
the associated jars and dependencies all
these are present over here so our bar
specified the list of for these jars and
I said that they are in the Lib folder
okay now there's a there's an asteroid
that Astrakhan you're right yeah yeah so
the reason I've given a specter is
because after liberal it the reason I've
given a spec is because there are
multiple jar files in this folder
correct it's not just one jar file now
since there are multiple we have given
aspect and yeah that's yeah so anyways
let me hit enter and show you that two
others out in your XML file will be
executed from your command prompt you
can see that the same set of executions
steps are being executed and the same
web browser is opening right we have
Amazon taught in Mackay shoes and yeah
the same thing is going to happen but I
don't wanna waste time of it waste your
precious time by showing you this
instead what I can do is I can now
straight away to show you the result
later and I can in fact show you to show
you how it works through Jenkins right I
can show this build Jenkins because at
the energy that's the price right that's
what we want to achieve continues
testing right so
you just wanna enemies end now from want
to minimize this browser driver yeah
and you can also see that the same
parameters are here right the same
results the println statements that
happen now they're not specified the
urban executed they are visible here and
the Torah says the total number of tests
run in web-one
zero fill yours the same output that we
got in Eclipse so we've got the same
thing over here
so that's good news now now that our
command is executing successfully
through the command prompt what we need
to do is we need to ask me to create a
windows batch file right and once we
create a Windows batch file we can
straight away get it to be executed
through generate so go back to the
directory here and I'm gonna create the
windows batch below we go now what the
command is again present away or
Rothbard not all right just to save just
to save some time and you can see that
it's the same commands are executed on
the command prompt okay but there's a
small difference you know the only
difference is that I have not specified
the path right the path that was
supposed to be here I have not specified
that that because the batch file is
going to be present in this directory
itself and yeah my command prompt does
not need to look anywhere else and in
this way we execute the batch file from
this window
so yeah
same thing with even library right the
lib folder I have not specified anything
else about this display the path right
the the folder where all my dependencies
will be project so if you want to first
of all save it as a batch file then you
have to click on file save as and push
by the name that you want it to be does
so let's say I want to give the name
file command and to save it as a bad
file we need to give it inside of double
quotes right and say dot pad inside
double quotes now this would create a
new file new windows batch file so and
as you can see a new file is come up
here and now if I execute this file
command you know this file am
we're gonna run the same steps that was
run from this command product let me
show you that that's a right so
automatically command prompt was opened
and then the test is being executed so
the same thing is gonna happen so what
we have to do now is we have to get
Jenkins to execute this this file
command write this file so for that we
have to first of all launch our Junkins
server and in launch our server from our
router can any of you here tell me which
port or thinkit's is hosted on the
people who do what
yeah guys who under star waiting for
your order black now because a number of
people said yeah there's one of the most
basic questions so it would be nice if
you could give me an answer you know let
me know that tell me that you know how
good or how smart an audience maybe it's
really yes so I'm just going to say
localhost:8080 and when I hit end up I
want to Jenkins login and this is my
Jenkins dashboard okay and yeah these
are the list of projects that I have on
my Oracle's dashboard and if you want to
create a new project or you want to
build a new job you have to first of all
click on new item over here and enter
the name of your project so and when I
say YouTube demo and Jenkins alright
that's the name I wanna give I'm gonna
say it but say it's gonna be a finish
our project and click on OK and it's
asking for description well this is not
really needed so it is ignore this you
can give it if you want it's optional
though so but what you have to actually
set is in the advanced option under
general settings you have to click on
advanced and set be a path of barrier
workspaces to check on this check box
here use custom workspace and feed the
path where you're wrong where do you
think has to look for the executable
file so mind you are it's good able to
file this is which is five miners in
this directory so I'm gonna pop in to
this path go back to Jenny then paste it
right here and I'm going to apply all
right I'm gonna save that and the next
thing that we got to do is we have to
come to previous but the bill triggers
your is so for scheduling your draw
jobs and this is something a little
complicated so I will come to thee I
will talk good the other sets and then
come back to this okay so after setting
your path over there quickly go to build
and click on add build step ok and now
you should specify what if you want to
exclude a batch command you got to say
execute batch command if you want to
exclude a shell you should take your
shell well if you're using Linux then
you might be probably excluding a shell
file or run on fire or something like
that but for raw Windows it's windows
batch c'mon but you wanna okay so I'm
gonna just stop click on execute windows
batch command and you have to specify
the file that needs to be executed so
now what Jenkins would do is it would
navigate to this path using my command
prompt and the file that needs to be
executed that needs to be fed your the
filename is the file command right so
I'm gonna say bye come on dot but so
what you wanna execute this statement
inside this directory through my command
wrong
that's what Jenkins go to and let me go
down and add this post build actions ok
what should happen when a build you know
when a job is built okay so what happens
there that's what is controlled over
here and in our case if you want to
achieve continuous testing actually that
you need to get email notifications and
be informed if any of your test case
fees or there's some faulty hardware or
sorry 40 software so if you want to be
notified then you have to click on this
add post built action and enable email
notification you are right this is the
option you're right so click on email
notification and specify the recipients
that you want so to see supposing I'm
just going to put my email over here if
there's anyone in the audience that you
want to receive an email tell me you can
just put it in the comment box and I
will add the email over here
you know you can also see how you get an
email but anyways till then I'm just
going to go ahead with my session okay
so I'm gonna say apply and I'm gonna
save these settings now that you've
configured email notifications there's
one more question I want to ask to those
people who already know John
can be your straightaway get start with
Jenkins can we be rest assured that your
rod emails will that you will receive
your emails can you give me an answer of
that question
and you
oh yeah absolutely Alan says xmpp
contribution yes exactly that's what
we're gonna do all right we have to
first make sure we have to enable all
wrong you means notification we have to
configure SMTP to gmail.com so that
would be done through your Jenkins diet
which way to go you're dodging Kim's
dashboard go to manage Jenkins right so
click on manage Jenkins go to the first
option of configure systems click on
that and when you're wrong inside this
you just scroll down right to the bottom
all right
so for me I've already set these
settings so I don't have to set anything
again but for those of you who are gonna
use Jenkins for the first time
do note these changes okay so sorry this
enemy notification you have to actually
come down here to email notification
right you have to come down here and set
your SMTP server you're okay so SMT
basically stands for Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol and if you want to
enable the mail transfer protocol from
Jenkins you have to specify the server
here in this format from if you want to
use Gmail then you got to say
smtp.gmail.com and similarly for any
other email service you gotta specify
that in this form I'll okay and when you
specified that you have to click on
advanced and you have to check this
checkbox off use SMTP authentication so
by default it would not be checked and
these would not come up initially so the
moment you check on this the username
and password would come up and you have
to enter the credentials of this user
right of this instance whatever the
email ID and password was you have to
enter that order and now click on use
SSL and finally you have to enter the SM
to be port number that it was known so
by default it's 465 well that's what
I've given but you can also Google and
there's actually another port on which
is in DB wrong so there are two ports
this is 465 if you want to run 465 where
I'm good if you don't want to then you
can just look up on Google and find
which is the other code they are you
wanna run it on and by that yeah and
then you have to specify the reply to
address okay now if you don't want the
people to reply to the email
notification that that we receive from
general then you can just say no deploy
address gmail.com otherwise you can not
just put on the email address you want
be your
like should reply to go to from the
email notification specified that your
and the character set your it's you know
it's predefined as utf-8 so you don't
need to worry about it so if you want to
test the email then you can just click
on this test configuration and you can
check the mail that you know you could
just add the email address you want the
testing in the world so I'm gonna say
I'm gonna add my own email address over
here and I'm gonna click on test
configuration now let's see what it says
okay it says even was sent successfully
so I'm gonna quickly go to my email
address
yeah so this is the email that is sent
to me right this is the test email
number three from Jenkins store this
shows that my decimal is successful and
this is also indication that my email
notification would run successfully okay
now this is the confirmation so it's a
highly important that you will test once
before you are wrong
rest assured that you will get even
Orphic a control once your brand is
listening to see if there are changes
okay and then go back to your project so
this is my project right and what's the
next thing that you want to do guys if
you want to
okay I get a reply here finally because
it has clicked pretty now
okay I will definitely click Billy now
but there's one more step that is there
that we need to do to achieve our
continuous testing you know incomplete
so without that one step bar we cannot
do justice to that tag of the country's
testing right okay but anyways I will
talk about that but before I tell you
what is that step I'm gonna anyways
click on build now as per your wishes
because the number of people are saying
build now so anyways it's the audience
base right so I'm gonna when you click
on build now obviously the build is
scheduled your and it's running so you
can just click on this build number one
to see what's the status right this is
the building design you can check the
console output to see what's happening
whether it's getting it successfully or
not as you can see it says you know what
the first println statement has been
printed and it also says page title and
it has shown am john space shuttle but
there's one thing strange over here can
you tell me one thing that is strange
over here that did not happen previously
when I am is good at the same through
the test in the XML file through command
round and when I excluded this direct
clips that will happen to know something
we don't have
absolutely so then it says the new Plaza
popped up and what Kajaani he says it's
headless that's exactly what the
terminus right the official it's had
this well that because all you are wrong
siege engine is basically your webserver
right so it's our where multiple jobs
would be your billet and now it could
all be running there you know you know
you know working late typically there
would be 100 jobs that will be built and
urban there are so many jobs are being
paid you cannot have work you cannot
afford to have any overhead and I love
any server crash so to avoid all these
things we we just use a headless our
correct we use a headless server we have
something called as HTML you didn't
drive up for that so that's so one thing
if you want to achieve
headless server by i or eclipse or by i
or command prompt you can use HTML unit
driver but otherwise you can just use
one on the chrome drivers or firefox
drivers and similarly if you want to
exclude through junkets by default you
don't get the GUI Fred that's because of
this very reason that it's headless and
to avoid any over overhead on the ER
that server ops for Jenkins because he
could cross Annie knew it would cause
server crashes right yeah that's the
thing and you know told me exactly what
I wanted to go right he told me that the
step that was needed to achieve
countries testing was that of thought
you know scheduling these jobs at
specified time intervals and he was the
only one that said that yeah
now that we've seen our output here and
now that we've seen that we this how we
get our raw you know this is how we get
the results let's see how we can share
your test case of using Gentle okay now
for that we have to again go to our
project and go to configure okay so on a
conjugal we need to come down where we
need to you know I told earlier that we
need to come to build priggish right so
on a bill triggers we've got to check on
this text box or wait video editing so
when you check on this you can specify
the your time format in cron in Kron 4
Matic a hundred specify the rule in cron
format as to when you want it to be
executed now for those of you who don't
know what a cron format is then if it is
static on the help box on the right side
you click on that you can know you can
learn delia format it comes in write the
rule the rule is basically in this way
so you have five different parameters
one the first one is fine the minute the
second respect the are of the Ray the
third one specifying the day of the
month the fourth specifying the month
and the final one specifying the day of
the week ok so let me show you a simple
Khurana rule over here so the grande
rule that I'm gonna use is something of
the power something like star star star
star
now for those of you who know what
changes can you tell me quickly what
star does in Jenkins well as causing the
Kron format right what star refers to
you can take help here so it's more like
an open book quiz that I'm asking you
right so you have all the your
statements here so based on what's
written you know you can tell me what
this would do is specify right tell me
what is going to happen if I specify
this kind of a rule over your a treasure
okay so now let's saying every minute
absolutely same thing with he says every
man so seems like I have a lot of people
who have lost knowledge about these
tools right so great man that's really
good but yeah getting back star aspect
basically means every minute basically
means every order anything or everything
so that's what it means or all so that's
what is the actual definition and in our
case it would it basically indicates to
execute the to build the job at every
minute of every hour of every particular
of every day in the month and every
month and every single day of the week
so we have all the we have our complete
flexibility over here so we can choose
when we want to wash our you this fall
so you can do it this way you can give
this kind of you know rule or if you
want to you know see typically how it
happens in organizations especially in -
that once once before the Working Day
once before our working hours start we
have one job builder right and we get
the reports we shouldn't get any reports
if we get a report then it means that
you know we're in trouble
so we get one set of we basically build
one job in the opening of the day and
one job towards the end at the end of
the working on right so once at 9:30 in
the morning and once at 7:30 in the
evening so we do something like that and
you can set some rule exact so in that
case if you want to set something for
say right now it's so right now with
6:15 right so if you want to set
something for say six 1706 18 then we
can do that by specifying the are and
minute period so the minute is going to
be 17 and now if I want to run it for
6:00 p.m. then I should probably enter
18 now that is because there are this is
going to be in a swarm and you cannot
specify a.m. or p.m. so that's why you
specify you know as what do you wanna
exclude this app so let me just quickly
save this and verify and let and show
you that at 6:17 there's gonna be a new
build that would be your new job
that would be build ok so you've got a
good 10 seconds left
okay so around five seconds after the
after six am being we've got our raw
windshield and I just click on this you
can see that the build is happening and
if I put it on to the output you can see
that the same sort of operations are
happening in the same test case is being
executed but the GUI crap so with in a
headless format that's what this is and
yeah you'll get a similar output but
yeah this is how you build and how this
how you schedule jobs to junkies and
this how you make things easier so what
Jenkins does is it's block complete
automation to execution of test cases
and our it it has removed the manual
effort of a person do I know
manually sit till the entire test case
gets over or to manually click the test
case to begin to run and do it at
different times during the day and yeah
so it's it's it's a really good tool
right so it's one of my favorite DevOps
tunes
Jenkins is really good and there's so
much more about Jenkins but
unfortunately today's already it's
already saw a short session today so we
can accurately talk about the economy is
testing aspect of Jenkins and there we
are but there's one more thing I want to
show you before we finish pretty session
and that is of email notification right
I did not show you that you don't get an
email notification so far because none
of my billions of failed right all my
jobs were built successfully so if I
want to email notification have to
manually fail one of my scripts so I'm
just gonna go back to my eclipse when I
forward and let me comment one of the
lines so I'm just gonna hide this line
okay I'm gonna performance this I'm
gonna save this and again go back to
Jenkins and execute this this job right
build this job again I want to see a
build now and when you see build now
this job has started right and
yeah it's already filled so we can see
the color right it's red in color and it
says failed so if you were to consider
output you can see that the total tests
that were run we're one and there was
one failure zero skips and the error was
execution of the windows batch command
was marked as a failure and the email
was sent my your email address so let me
just quickly go to my email address and
I'll show you that yes it's filled in
Jenkins YouTube demo of Jenkins and op
selenium and generate Samba 3 and if you
go here you'll also get an ideas of
where you can see what the errors are so
if you click on this link you will again
go back to Jenkins or so you'll see that
this is the pin number three and you can
now go here and see what was the command
that field right where the problem was
all these things so yeah that's how we
achieve automation that's how we will be
notified immediately when something's
like previously wrong in your in your
code right so yeah so that also brings
and then to mine session here so let me
just quickly go back my slides and
summarize what every cover whatever I
covered today
yeah
so the flood topic I spoke about was
what is selenium and what is stadium's
relevance in the automation or testing
tools ok among automation testing tools
how relevant is selenium how popular is
that and then I spoke about its role in
the develops a how would works along
with testing Lee and Jenkins to perform
continuous testing and I spoke about the
different steps that are needed to
achieve continuous testing and finally I
spoke about I I give you a demonstration
of the same right I showed you how to
build your own Jenkins job and share
your tests so yeah that's it that's your
end of my session and yeah I kind of
thought only enjoyed this session right
so many questions right so when people
don't ask you question you get really
bored but thanks to you people
I was able to keep I am really good and
know I'm looking for the next edge
because I'm hoping I would get the same
kind of response and the same kind of
activity in my next lab session also and
yeah if you get a looking for raw any
structured training you can probably go
to people ask for details right so you
can check out in record or oh and you
can check out our raw the ops course and
or selenium course right so we have the
patches starting this weekend for DevOps
and we have for one batch ortho starting
on Monday for selenium so let me just
quickly good my just quickly go to my
browser I go and and let me show you the
DevOps and I will show you the DevOps
course right so this is the URL that
we're at which you can find out of of
course at www.elegantinnerguidance.com
oops sorry guys sorry for that so let me
just go back again yeah so this is all
wrong of course right
these are divorce codes and you can see
that we have a batch starting on the 8th
of July we have a bachelor degree in 30
M as per Indian Standard Time and this
is the price of the course you can also
change the timing if you're from us then
you can probably see the US time correct
and yeah and similarly we have another
batch starting on the 9th of July you
know as per US Senate time of course
it's 9th of July and as per Indian
Center time it's the 10th of July which
would be your wing day batch and you can
see the price your and similarly if you
want to check what are the features are
you getting when you go for an
interrogatory
you can see that you know we have
lifetime access to you know all your
learning content so whatever you have
your platinum access to that you get
24/7 support right so you can know
that's for a lifetime of course and then
you will of course be certified as an
expert in this particular as as an
expert in this particular industry in
this domain so we will get a
certification that's not the benefit and
yeah and the other thing you can check
out on our website is you can see what's
the course curriculum you can see what's
the course catalog over here you can see
what we'll be covering so that you know
you can not so you know you'll know what
you can target your courses so based on
this based on what you want to learn and
what way you want to grow your career
into so you do that you can achieve that
waiter and yeah so this is my devops
course and over here you can see the
selenium course of course
okay so there's one bad starting on the
9th of July this is this is a this is
yeah this is a weekday batch for the US
people it's going to start on the 9th of
July for the Indian folks and it's going
to start on the 8th of July correct yeah
so for Indian set bonus on the 8th of
July it's going to be a two-hour session
so that's different between the weekday
batch in the weekend batch okay
the week in bathroom selenium is going
to start on the 22nd of July and the
weekend batch would be for five weeks
right for five weekends ten classes but
the will be Abbas would be for you know
two weeks for fifteen days and yeah five
days a week but a shorter duration it's
gonna be for two hours and this sucker
this however is gonna be for three hours
so same thing with devoxx also so that's
how the timing works all right so we can
not check out our course over here and
yeah you can also check out the
earlybird offers that we have on these
courses if you want to probably go for
of course that's in August or during the
next month then you get an extra
discount so you can probably check check
out even that Frank you can see all
these things you can see our course
curriculum for selenium also and you can
also see the course features that we
have to offer and all these things so
yeah that pretty much is that brings us
to the end of the session and yeah thank
you guys for being a part of the session
we will short come up with more live
sessions and do subscribe to our channel
and like and comment and share our video
so that you'll be notified of the same
and it's a pleasure to have you on board
with us and thank you so much for your
time for staying so long till the very
end and thank you guys see you soon
