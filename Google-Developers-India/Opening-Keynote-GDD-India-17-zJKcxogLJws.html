in Google's office right here in
Bangalore I lead our engineering teams
in India and Singapore for a very
important initiative called next billion
users I'm really excited to be here with
you today at Google developer days
because I'm myself a developer I have
used many Google API s over the years
this is the first GDD ever in india and
this is the largest developer event that
Google has held in India ever but first
I want to talk to you about why and what
Google is doing in India and in emerging
markets all around the world today
Google has seven products with more than
a billion users each around the world
but we know that our next billion users
will come from different parts of the
world than our first billion our next
billion users will not come from US or
Canada or Germany they will come from
India Indonesia Brazil Nigeria and
similar countries all around the world
that's why in India alone we expect six
hundred and fifty million Indians to
come online by 2020 that's why a couple
of years back we started the next
billion users initiative at Google as we
notice that the featured users of
Google's products are going to be
different than our current users perhaps
the most important difference is that
they're going to be mobile first and in
fact largely mobile only the smartphone
is their first computer it is the best
camera they'd probably ever owned and
also probably their first video device
that they ever carried around let's take
a look at users in India Indonesia and
Brazil and compare them
to the US the users in these countries
are incredibly young I mean just look
around the attendees here they're
urbanizing fast and their aspirational
with disposable incomes growing rapidly
they're savvy a large fraction of them
have prepaid plans and multiple sims to
get the best voice and data plans they
are unique they have a strong sense of
their own identity and culture that is
different from the rest of the world and
yet we at Google believe that they have
the same fundamental needs when they get
online they want to talk to friends they
want to be entertained they want to
understand the world around them they
want information to make their lives
better if you saw search queries from
Mumbai they're not that different from
search queries from New York City if you
look at search queries from Mumbai you
might find queries like what time does
this train leave where is the nearest
doctor when's the new movie with Deepika
Padukone coming out but right now they
face serious challenges to getting the
information they need and having a good
experience with the internet they have
low SPECT phones which are running
usually a very old version of Android
and their storage is running out
constantly they have serious
connectivity issues data can be slow and
intermittent it can sometimes take
minutes to load a map even more to
buffer a video and when they do manage
to connect to the internet they find
that there is not much localized content
let me give you an example Wikipedia in
Hindi which by the way is now the fourth
most spoken language in the world has
just 2% 2% of the content of Wikipedia
in English so Google's approach to this
is pretty simple first we want to ensure
that everyone has access to Internet the
rest is meaningless without a working
internet connection second we want to
build platform
that enable developers like yourselves
to build meaningful experiences for
everyone
third we want to build products that are
directly relevant to our next billion
users let me start with access which
really is the foundation in India we
have partnered with Tata trusts and
railTel to provide Google Station which
is high speed Wi-Fi in hundreds of train
stations across India
it's the largest public Wi-Fi project in
India with millions of people now using
this service in addition to access we
also need to create awareness and
educate people on how to use the
Internet our internet sati initiative is
now in a hundred thousand villages in 12
states across India we have over 25,000
internet satis these are women who have
been trained to help other women in the
village learn about the internet and how
it can be used to better their lives
these satis have trained over 12 million
women over the past two years and the
impact that the internet is having on
these women and their communities is
truly incredible of course Google cannot
solve all the needs of everyone
everywhere by itself so we want to make
sure that we make strong platforms that
allow everyone to contribute and grow
with the internet because that ability
to participate and contribute to the
Internet is key it's what in turn makes
the experience better for everyone while
we have lots more work to do one thing
we are proud of is our support of many
languages in our key platforms at the
end of the day Google is a products
company so we are working hard to try to
make our products fast relevant and
accessible in our users own languages
last year we launched offline maps which
lets people save a map over Wi-Fi and
then use the map just as they would if
they were online
in 2013 we started letting people take
videos offline on YouTube
launching first in India as well as in
Indonesia and Philippines now this
feature is in more than 80 countries
worldwide so so this is the cool thing
we have learned that when we tap into a
users inside weather on how people
connect or how they overcome constraints
in any market these insights tend to
hold true globally which allows us to
make products better for everyone in
this case I myself use maps offline and
YouTube offline all the time and when
the market needs it we will build
products that are made for India first
that's exactly what we did a little over
two months ago when we launched stays a
consumer payments and Commerce mobile
app that leverages UPEI to build a brand
new and refreshing payments experience
to users all over India this is made for
India first it is made to be as simple
to use as cash and provides Google scale
security to our users it's been out a
little bit over two months and we have
seen more than 10 million users creating
more than 74 million transactions if you
haven't checked it out please do so
today just yesterday we launched another
brand new product made for our next
billion users first called data Li data
Li is a mobile data savings app that
helps people get the most out of their
mobile data data Li has three core
features understand your data control
your data and save data by finding free
Wi-Fi near you now we are proud of what
we have achieved so far but we are also
aware that there is a lot more work to
do and we are just getting started so
I've just given you a glimpse into what
we are working on for the next billion
users markets I might be biased but I
truly believe that India is an amazing
place for technology fortune 500
companies startup hubs entrepreneurs dev
centers they're all blooming across
India and we have some of the best
talent in the world I'm lucky enough to
work with many on a daily basis that's
why we believe it's very important for
us to meet and work with all of you
through events such as these we want to
hear your feedback on our products and
programs so that we can give you what
you need to turn your ideas into reality
whether you're building for the next
billion like me and my team or you're
building apps for use all across the
globe we want to enable you to focus on
the problems that you're trying to solve
and minimize the pain points of building
a product the Google developers team is
on the ground in over 130 countries and
within India thousands of you are
participating as developer experts and
as part of gdgs
and we are continuing to grow the Indian
developer ecosystem through programs
such as women techmakers the Google
developers agency program and Launchpad
we are also working on providing
trainings to deepen your technical
capabilities year round
in fact you might recall the goal that
we have committed to to Train 2 million
Indian developers 2 million Indian
developers by 2020 today we have engaged
over 500,000 developers through our
various training programs along with
more than 1,000 faculty members from 400
colleges
additionally 11 state technical
universities have adopted our Android
developer fundamentals curriculum we
also recently launched
developer student clubs in 23 States and
they have trained over 6,000 students in
just three months
finally we have recently announced a
partnership with Pluralsight to offer
free developer an IT content to helps
kill 100,000 Indian developers through
the plural side platform we are really
inspired by the talent in India and we
want to continue to help cultivate the
developer ecosystem here let me give you
an example meet Jim it Jim its father is
a street mechanic growing up Jim it
always assumed he'd follow in his
father's footsteps but he always loved
to code after completing his six-month
training to becoming a mechanic he asked
his father hey can I take some time to
pursue my real interest my real dreams
of becoming a developer his father
agreed and from then each day he went to
a part of town where he could access
public Wi-Fi he sat on this footpath you
see here where the signal was the
strongest and began taking Android
courses through Udacity after he
completed this training he began to
applying he began applying for jobs as a
professional developer and today Jim it
supports his family with the salary he's
earning as a developer Jim its story is
just one of many inspiring stories that
motivate us to continue pushing towards
our goals to train as many developers as
possible and build the products and
platforms that are most useful to all of
you now I'd like to bring up some
colleagues to share updates on the
products across our developer platforms
let's get started with how we are
continuing to improve the Android
development process please welcome Dan
and thank you
my gosh namaste and good morning it is
the best time ever to be an Android
developer and I can say that because
I've been developing Android for over
nine years it have been in Google for
over seven of those years but have never
seen anything like what we have now this
incredible confluence of meaningful
developer changes we're seeing ever more
powerful tooling a clear path forward
for app design a new programming
language support for on device machine
intelligence and fundamental
improvements to the distribution model
and much of this change derives from
listening to all of you in our developer
community all of this is happening
amidst the incredible momentum that
Android continues to have we're seeing
two billion active devices on Android
and 82 billion apps installed from play
and what's even more amazing is how this
momentum is making so many developers
successful the number of developers with
over a million installs grew 35% in the
last year and to leverage this
distribution to build great businesses
we expanded direct carrier billing to
reach 900 million devices with over 140
operators all together with a number of
people buying on play grew over 30
percent last year but that's not enough
we know we can make distribution even
better by removing the friction from app
installs and making the entire
experience more dynamic in synapse is
one of our big bets in bringing more
users to your apps and our early
partners are seeing great results I mean
one football saw that the number of
users who read news and shared content
increased 55% in their intern app all
Vimeo increased their session durations
by 130 percent nomicon found that the
conversion rate in their real estate app
increased by 2.8 X compared to a mobile
web and there are many more stories like
these now at i/o we opened up Android in
synapse to all Android developers which
means anyone can now build and publish
an android inson app and since then
we've made instant apps available to
more than 500 million Android devices
across countries where Google Play
operates now your instant app is
downloaded as needed feature by feature
you
Abell this by organizing your project
into future modules and then you can use
the exact same code in both your instant
app and your installable app we're
easing the process of refactoring your
app into these few modules using the new
modularized refactoring action in
Android studio modulized helps you move
code and resources between modules we've
also included optimization tools for
more efficient asset delivery with
support for on the wire compression when
you're ready you just upload your intern
app they be cave's together with your
installable apk in the Play console and
the get started building it into nap
today visit gqo in synapse now at Google
i/o back in May this year we announced
that Kotlin is a fully supported Android
programming language and the developer
community support for Kotlin was a huge
driver of our decision to embrace the
language but since that announcement
we've seen a massive increase in Kotlin
activity the number of apps in the Play
Store that used Kotlin has grown by 3
times and we observed that 17% of
Android studio projects are now using
Kotlin of course Android studio 3.0 is
released now and bundled with full
support for Kotlin including Kotlin
templates for project and activities in
IDE Kotlin Linde support while the 3.1
canary adds line' support for collin on
the command line but we didn't stop
there
we've built Docs and samples around
Kotlin and we're continuing to develop
more in this area we published the
Android Kotlin guides on github to
provide guidance for Android Kotlin
style and Interop we support library 27
we have started adding knowability
annotations to make the API friendlier
it's used in Kotlin and we're doing all
of this while increasing our commitment
to the java programming language with
Oreo support for many version 8 api's
and support for language features such
as lambdas and Method references back to
any SDK version with the sugar for me
Cottman makes programming Android more
fun and productive seamlessly operating
with the android standard libraries
while combining a dense syntax along
with modern features such as functional
programming and the ability to write DSL
now minimizing install friction with
instant apps and the common programming
language are just two of the ways in
which we've listened to your feedback
we've made substantial improvements to
Android studio focusing on speed smarts
and Android platform support then you
can see all the speed and smarts updates
we've made to Android studio behind me
but I want to call out one thing in
particular your feedback has made
driving saint
build time down our number one priority
benchmarking with a real-life 100 module
project since 2.2 buildconfig time
dropped from three minutes to two
seconds and we're continuing to work on
build performance in Android studio 3.1
now in canary you can try out d8 our new
Dex compiler which compiles faster and
outputs smaller Dex files while having
the same runtime performance on the
emulators we've added the Play Store for
end-to-end testing you'll find awesome
features for Android Oreo in Android
studio like and dannan snap supports O's
system images improved profilers and
tons of oh helper tools like a tool to
make building adaptive icons easy and a
download Android build dependencies
we're now distributing of course to our
own maven repository now you've asked us
to make Android frameworks easier like
providing an opinionated guide to best
practices a better solution for
lifecycles architecture components are
libraries for common tasks of course is
that stable release with libraries for
the view model pattern data storage and
managing activity and fragment life
cycles we also have preview support for
paging which makes it efficient and easy
to support huge data sets with
recyclerview
app quality is an essential piece to
growing a successful business we took a
sample of apps to analyze the
correlation between app quality and
business success what we learned is when
apps moved from average to good quality
we see a six-fold increase in spend and
a sevenfold increase in retention so
quality is Queen so to help you ensure
you're targeting the devices that work
best for your app you can now targets
two specific devices in the Play console
you can browse the detailed device
catalog and NTP need a certain amount of
RAM or we have issues with a specific
system on system chip you can set
targeting rules to address this as well
and prior to excluding devices you can
even see your installs rating and run
new details per device we've also got
Android vitals dashboards in the Play
console so you can now see a great data
about your app to help you pinpoint
common issues excessive crash rate and
our rate frozen frame slow rendering
excessive wake-ups and more these are
enhanced by improved profilers and new
instrumentation in the platform and
speaking of platform Android au adds so
much for developers we're in Developer
Preview for Oreo 8.1 which has Android
go optimizations of targeting as well as
a new neural networks API which lays the
foundation for a developer community to
build accelerated on device applications
of machine learning
including image recognition and
prediction of course Oh has vastly
improved font support and auto sizing
text view notification controls at a new
native Pro Audio API we've made massive
improvements in the runtime including
the concurrent copy and collector in a
series of optimizations to make your
apps run smoother we've introduced
adaptive icons to improve the launcher
experience and continue to harden
Android security with Google Play
protect now enabled on every Google Play
device we've improved accessibility at
it's 44 autofill and smart text
selection added support for wide gamut
color and extra long screens and
improved multi display support I'll be
diving into all of this and much more in
more detail later today now let's talk
about some of the ways we're extending
Android AR core uses motion tracking
environmental understanding and light
estimation to blend virtual content with
the real world as seen through your
phone's camera it's being offered as a
preview so you can start experimenting
with building new AR experiences and
give us feedback this preview is the
first step in a journey to enabling AR
capabilities across the whole Android
ecosystem Android things makes
developing connected mass-market
products easy by providing the same
Android development tools best-in-class
android framework and google api s that
make developers successful in mobile on
a trusted platform and I'm excited to
announce that just today androids things
developer preview 6 was released Android
fix hardware is based on system on
module architecture the som contains of
CPU the memory the networking and other
core components in a very small package
that can produce cheaply since their
generic parts made in large quantities
for each som Google provides the kernel
drivers and other software as part of a
board support package so during
prototyping and development you taps
into a breakout board to connect IO for
production you can build your own custom
board for the som reducing costs and
simplifying hardware developments on the
software side of things you've built a
standard apk and uploaded to your fleet
of devices by our developer console
Google provides an over there update
mechanism so you can roll it updates to
your devices and you can get security
updates from the same people who
maintain Android so you can focus on
your core business instead of having to
worry about patching kernels and
libraries and since Android things is
Android you can not only use familiar
tools like Android studio Kotlin and
firebase combined with cloud IOT core
you can also leverage the power of
tensorflow and the Google assistant in
your products now it's still early days
but we're seeing incredible growth in
Android auto we continue to expand the
number of Android auto compatible cars
to great partnerships with over 50 car
brands
there are over 300 Android auto
compatible car models in aftermarket
available today we just tripled the
number for one year ago and it's well on
its way to becoming a standard feature
in every new car we've also made Android
auto available to all Android users with
the launch of the standalone phone app
while putting up the platform and
ecosystem to many millions of drivers no
matter what kind of car they drive now
during the holiday season last year
Android wear so I seventy two percent
growth and that was the forward to when
I launched the number of ran supporting
Android wear doubled from twelve last
year to twenty four and the choice of
Android wear watch has doubled from
twenty three last year to forty six apps
are taking advantage of Android wear a
2.0 at its standalone functionality
which allows apps to work no matter what
platform the watch is connected to
finally our strong partnerships with pay
TV operators and hardware manufacturers
allowed us to double the number of
activated Android TV devices last year
and we expect that trend to continue and
further increase we're seeing this both
across partners in the set-top box and
the Smart TV form factors we've expanded
our international footprints of 70
countries and there are now more than
3000 Android TV apps in the Play Store
an Android TV supports the Google
assistant for smarter content search to
be the center of the connected home with
so many ways for people to interact with
Android the strong communities that are
supporting Android development the
improvements we played in the platform
tooling language in the distribution of
Google Play it really is the best time
ever to be an Android developer please
check out the training sessions and code
labs to learn how we're helping to end
developers make Android great now all of
the Android form factors are tapping
into the power of the Google assistant
so it's my pleasure to welcome my
colleague stitch it to the stage to talk
about what the Google assistant means to
developers thank you alright
nice tan hi everyone as you just heard
the Google assistant is now available
across many devices from your phone to
your TV it's also available on
voice-activated speakers like Google
home you as a developer have the ability
to leverage actions on Google to build
conversational experiences through the
Google assistant so today I'm gonna tell
you about all the new features we've
added to the actions on Google platform
to make your apps for the assistant even
more capable you can build apps for all
sorts of assistive use cases for voice
and visual interfaces like shopping for
clothes or ordering food from a lengthy
menu with UI elements like image
carousels lists and suggestion ships
users can see more they can also
seamlessly transition between voice
typing or taps in a single conversation
in order to easily get things done with
your app we've also opened up powerful
transactions experiences in the US and
UK helping developers grow their
business by making it easy to complete
purchases of physical goods and services
through the Google assistant on phones
this can be done with Google facilitated
payments or their own stored payment
methods for users who've signed into
their app speaking of sign-in there's a
seamless one tap step for linking the
rewards account to the assistant orders
can be tracked modified or even repeated
using the transaction history view
accessible in the Google assistant but
none of this matters if users can't
discover your app we've rolled out an
app directory within the assistant
experience on your phone with what's new
and what's trending sections which will
constantly change and evolve creating
more opportunities for your app to be
discovered by users we're using your
apps description and sample invitations
to map users natural search queries to
new tasks based subcategories of Acts
we're even launching a new for families
badge designed to help users find apps
that are appropriate for all ages and to
make fine your app easier
the assistant anoles is also learning
from the directory and other information
provided by you the developer thanks to
these signals the assistant can often
two general requests like play a game
with a few different options from third
parties improving discovery is very
important for us so you can expect
ongoing investment and improvements in
this area once users have found your app
they want frictionless assistive
experiences we are committed to enabling
you to build for innovative new use
cases so just in the last couple months
we've exposed expose specific assistant
capabilities to developers for instance
developers can now transfer their apps
conversation from a voice-activated
speaker to a mobile phone mid dialog we
have improved the voice UI development
capabilities by giving developers more
control over conversational mishaps like
unrecognized input or cancellation
we have even introduced a proactive
updates feature in Developer Preview
which allows you to request users to
regularly to register for regularly
scheduled updates or even push
notifications this opens new doors for a
pre-engagement and usage imagine being
able to connect to your user each day to
remind them about an upcoming event or
provide them with an urgent alert
directly through the assistant in order
to leverage all these features it's also
important to us that the development
process is smooth the actions console is
your central hub for development it
helps you work as a team choose the
right tool for development and collect
data on your apps usage performance and
user discovery patterns it's integrated
with the firebase and Google Cloud
console so that it's easy to incorporate
into your existing Google to Google
development projects in addition to the
console we're also providing you with
access to developer tools they'll let
you quickly and easily build apps for
the assistant since the launch of our
platform we've worked with an expanding
number of developer tools companies to
make their solutions compatible with
actions on Google we've also expanded
the capabilities of the newly renamed
dialogue flow our own conversation
building tool launching new features
such as an inline code editor
multi-language support and in dialogue
analytics one tool that I'm extremely
proud to promote is templates these
allow you to build a fully functional
high quality app for the assistant with
no code at all just pick a template type
such as a trivia game or flashcards fill
in a spreadsheet with your content and
within minutes you're ready to publish
in fact I want every single one of you
to try this as soon as you can
I promise it's that easy while we are
still in the early days of the platform
we are focused on making it more robust
and expanding its reach and capabilities
one way we're doing that is by
supporting the Google assistant SDK used
to embed the assistant into your own
custom hardware devices such as those
powered by Android things or with our
smart home integration it's possible for
device makers to build IOT devices that
can be controlled from the Google
assistant another way we're expanding is
by constantly working to open up to new
languages for actions on Google we
recently launched in UK Australian and
Indian English as well as French Korean
Japanese Spanish and other languages
we're excited for the road ahead and we
want more of you to join us by
developing for the platform with an
addressable audience of more than a
hundred million devices new capabilities
like proactive updates and an improved
developer experience we think this is an
incredible opportunity for all of us the
magic of the assistant is enabled by
Google's deep investment in AI and the
cloud so to tell you more about that
please welcome cause
hello everyone I'm card Sato
I'm developer advocate for Google Chrome
it's like a evangelist for developers
I'd like to introduce machine learning
solutions and services from Google and
what are they I machine learning a
neural network there's no scientific
definition what is AI but you can say
it's the science to make things smart
like a building and auto bus driving car
or letting computer drawing a beautiful
pictures and there has been many
approaches to realize division of AI and
one of them is the machine learning or
ml with ml you can port you can program
your computer with data now miss the
program called written by human
programmers so computers can find a
certain patterns from data to solve
various problems in ml there are many
different algorithms and one of them is
deep learning or deep neural network and
since 2012 we have been seeing a big
breakthrough in the area of neural
network so Google has been making a
significant investment in developing a
neural network technology Google has
been deploying deep learning
technologies in over 100 production
projects such as Google search or
Android or Maps and Gmail and so on for
example Google water's registering
voters with keywords deep learning
algorithms recognizes the objects in
waters and so you don't have to add
labels or tags by yourself
inbox mobile app has this smart reply
feature that uses natural language
processing technology to generate the
price for each email thread so you can
just choose one of them to reply on this
read over 20% of responses on the app
are already generated generated by the
abilities feature
Google Translate has introduced the new
neural machine translation model
generate the to generate unique natural
and fluent to instructs read the text
and now Google is focusing on
externalizing the power of machine
learning to customers and developers one
of those ml products is crowd ml API a
free
machine learning models such as vision
API for image recognition or speech API
for voice recognition and a neural API
for natural language processing another
mao transfer a solution is tensorflow
tensor flower is an open source software
for machine running development
that lets you train your own customized
machine learning model it is a standard
ml to using inside Google for developing
any new machine learning or a arrived
based services and Google has open
sourced it in November 2015 teaser Pro
is scalable and portable you can start
trying tinsel roll vis your laptop then
learning it with GPU or tens or hundreds
of GPS on the crowd because tensorflow
is scaleable you don't have to change
your channel focal match to bring bring
it to the large-scale distributed
training also once you have finished
your training with extensive role model
you can run it on various devices such
as smartphones or Raspberry Pi and
everything with those benefits Taser Pro
got the the most popular up big
popularity from the open source world
the most popular deep running framework
in the industry now tinsel fro is used
by many large enterprises and project
for their PLC's or production cases
lastly I'd like to show a demonstration
called find your candy it's a
demonstration that integrates the
machine learning API and tensorflow
are the total email solutions let's take
a look at the video and give it to you
awesome ok alright so click on that and
speak into the mic
may I have some gum so it understood
what you said may I have some gum now
it's going through natural language
processing it's identifying the noun the
noun there and gum so now he's trying to
it will then match based upon the model
that's been modified come on come on
come on and it is picking
chewy gum oh and there the camera
identified
extra long lasting watermelon gum now
the cameras the
yeah and over and there's your drama
that's correct it's in an app so I'm I
gotta keep this right yeah actually I've
got like seven boxes back there ml API
intensive role provides a real raw
diamond solution that allows you to
bring the latest e planning technology
to solve your own business problems
today so with that I'd like to invite to
Anita onstage to tell you a bit more
about tensorflow light
Thank You Cass my name is Anita and I'm
the technical project manager with
tensorflow on the Google brain team
Bangalore is my hometown and I'm really
excited to be here with all of you go
Bangalore I will be introducing you to
tensorflow light and why we need an on
device machine learning library on one
side machine learning traditionally has
been run on powerful machines with
tremendous amount of compute power on
the other side mobile devices are
ubiquitous and are getting more and more
powerful some of these devices have more
compute power than what NASA had when
they first sent a man on the moon think
about it for a minute we essentially
walk with supercomputers in our pockets
these days these trends enable us to
shift some of the machine learning
workloads from the cloud back to the
device specifically enabling machine
learning inference on mobile and
embedded devices thus pushing the
boundaries a little further there are
several reasons why on device machine
learning is useful first application
developers might want to maintain
functionality and do inference while
offline second applications may have low
latency requirements of the order of
milliseconds and really cannot afford a
round-trip back to the cloud third
specific sensitive applications might
have requirements for the data to not
leave the device thus ensuring user
privacy there is also a need for the
applications to work on the low
bandwidth where you don't have the
luxury of downloading a huge model at
the time of inference forth processing
powers needs to be done without turning
on power-hungry radios these are some of
the motivations to do on device ml even
though on device ml sounds like a great
idea
mobile devices come with many challenges
and have to operate under constrained
environments compared to their
workstation counterparts there's limited
network bandwidth limited memory
sometimes even limited computation at
the same time these mobile devices have
very aggressive release and engineering
psyche
which means there's Hardware
heterogeneity which leads to supporting
machine learning on specialized hardware
like GPUs and DSPs we decided that
making a product whose sole focus with
mobile devices is essential tensorflow
is primarily for large devices and
tensorflow light for smaller devices but
it's simply tensorflow light is a
machine learning library to do inference
on mobile and embedded devices that's
easier faster and smaller the primary
goals of tensorflow light are low
latency small binary footprint and
optimized throughput tensorflow Lite has
support for Android neural network API
that enables hardware acceleration
leveraging custom accelerators on the
phone we release the first developer
preview of tensorflow Lite a couple of
weeks back and we have support for
popular image classification models as
well as text-based smart reply models we
can't wait to see what you all come up
with using this on device inference
library now please welcome tile on stage
from the chrome team to tell you more
about Chrome
thanks Anita hi everyone my name is tall
I'm from the chrome team and I'm excited
to talk about some of the improvements
that we've made on the web over the past
year the web is big with over two
billion instances of chrome we know that
the web has tremendous reach but one of
the true strengths of the web is that
it's bigger than any single browser so
regardless of whether the device is a
smartphone or a laptop or a desktop or a
tablet they all have a browser so any
web-based experience is available on
these billions of devices today and
we've seen those have a real impact on
how many users web apps are reaching
we've all seen how quickly mobile has
been growing and native apps have been
growing at an incredible pace with it
but what's really remarkable is that
even with the web's large initial reach
we've seen the average monthly web
audience growing even faster and because
of this growth we're seeing the web
expand into new areas with experiences
like web VR being built on the web
platform so with the web pretty much
everywhere we're constantly trying to
push the boundaries on what it can do
over the past year we've shipped
hundreds of additional api's that cover
a range of capabilities for making it
easier to integrate payments to building
fully capable offline media experiences
directly on the web but beyond just
these core capabilities we're also
ensuring that the mobile web works well
with the India stack for example with
our payment request API it's really easy
to tie into popular payment methods for
every region so in India we've ensured
that it integrates with Google's new
payments app ted's so it integrates with
local businesses banks and India's
unified payments interface and with all
of these capabilities the modern mobile
web also allows developers to build deep
rich mobile experiences with something
that we call progressive web apps or
pwace pwace are about helping web
developers leverage the web's new
capabilities to build high class
experiences that really feel immersive
they can load quickly they work offline
and you can even send notifications to
users and we've seen a number of amazing
experiences taking advantage of these
new capabilities as just one example
there's ola a popular ride-sharing app
based right here in india who recently
built a progressive web app to help
reach users in tier 2 and tier 3 cities
here they have a polished fast immersive
experience that works on any connection
it can send users notifications and it's
built completely on the mobile web so
it's already accessible on billions of
devices and we're excited to announce
that the reach of this PWA technology is
huge
as the core technology powering this is
now supported across top browsers
including UC browser in India and with
the ability to create such immersive
experiences like this we also want to
make sure that you can get back to it
really easily Add to Home screen has
always allowed users to add an
experience to their Android home screen
but with our improved add to home screen
flow when you add a PWA to your home
screen it's fully integrated into the
platform so two users it feels like any
other app experience on their device
it'll appear in the Android launcher
alongside your Android apps and it'll
even appear in Android storage settings
but since it's a PWA it's inherently
small so users are able to get an
immersive experience without requiring
extensive storage space and this fast
integrated improved add to home screen
flow is available now so with all of
these new capabilities we've also been
working to make sure it's easy for web
developers to build these experiences
we'll be going into a lot more detail on
how develop pwace throughout the mobile
web track but no matter how you're
building your web app lighthouse is a
tool that can show you how to improve
your web experience lighthouse is a
Chrome extension and command line tool
that quickly audits your site to
identify how you can improve your apps
performance accessibility and
progressive web app enos and we're
excited to announce that as of m60
lighthouse is now directly integrated
into dev tools so now you can
quickly see how your website is doing
and what to do next directly in Chrome
and with all of these tools we've seen
just how easy it can be for companies to
take advantage of these new capabilities
for their web experience to give another
example there's boot a popular videos
video streaming site also based here in
India and it's an experience built on
the web so users can get to it directly
and with our new Add to Home screen flow
it can also be easily accessed from the
app launcher or the Android home screen
and when you open it you get a
high-class immersive experience it
automatically rotates to allow for full
screen experiences and with some of the
newest api's they can even support
downloading of videos and offline
playback and since its built on the web
users can get this entire experience
immediately on their devices and this is
just one example of many leveraging the
modern mobile web is now the norm around
the world whether they're building a PWA
from scratch or leveraging the latest
capabilities on their existing web
experience companies everywhere are
seeing a tangible impact on their key
metrics with the modern mobile web it's
possible to easily build immersive fully
capable experiences that can reach
billions of people around the world
today and now let's turn our focus to
what we're doing to make it easier to
develop apps and grow your business
please welcome Francis
hi I'm Francis and I lead the firebase
product team our mission is to help
developers like you build a better app
and grow a more successful business at
i/o 2016 we've expanded firebase from a
set of back-end services to a broad
mobile platform to help you solve many
of the common problems you face across
the lifecycle of your app from helping
you build faster and easier with
products like remote cloud storage and
real time database to helping you better
understand and grow your users which
shows like analytics and cloud messaging
whether you're starting something new or
looking to extend an existing app we're
here to help you so that you can channel
more of your time and energy towards
creating value for your users and we
make this available all through a single
easy-to-use SDK available across
platforms to date there are over 1
million developers that have used
firebase and we're humbled that so many
of you have trusted us with your apps
and we're committed to helping you
succeed over the last year our team has
made many updates to firebase and I like
to highlight a few of these first let's
start with back-end services where we
provide you the core building blocks to
help you build your apps faster and
easier one of these is cloud fire store
a no sequel document database that
scales automatically cloud fire store
features a new document collections data
model and makes it a lot more intuitive
for you to structure your data it's also
fully auto managed and it's built on
Google's global infrastructure so that
it will automatically scale with you and
you don't have to worry about managing
your machine sizes RAM allocation or
networks now fire store like other
firebase products also works with cloud
functions cloud functions gives you a
way to deploy your JavaScript code to
the cloud and execute it based on HTTP
requests or through other events
happening across firebase so for example
you can write a function to extend cloud
fire store to do some server-side
processing like data
whenever a document is uploaded with
firestore functions and other firebase
back-end services our infrastructure
will scale with your workload
automatically from prototype to
planet-scale
freeing you from managing your own
servers so let's switch gears to talk
about some other updates that can help
you better understand and improve your
app stability since welcoming the fabric
team to Google earlier this year
we've integrated crashlytics into
firebase firebase crashlytics is our
flagship crash reporting product that
helps you monitor and fix crashes and
app errors and in addition to monitoring
app crashes it's also really important
to understand how your app performs out
in the field because users often abandon
slow running apps and that's where
firebase performance monitoring can help
you better understand how your app
performs across the diversity of devices
and network conditions now with just one
line of code you can get insights into
your app start of time and network
latency as well you can add custom
metrics to really understand how you
have performs through those critical
user flows that you really care about
and this is a great way to find those
bottlenecks in your app that could be
impacting your user engagement or even
your business bottom line so in addition
to helping you build a better app
firebase also helps you grow and engage
more users first let's talk about cloud
messaging or SCM which gives you an easy
way to send notifications to engage your
users fcm is integrated with analytics
so it gives you many options to send
targeted notifications to different user
groups or app versions another great way
to drive user engagements is by creating
a personalized experience and remote
config helps you do that more easily by
enabling you to change your apps
configuration remotely and at runtime
it's also integrated with analytics so
you can fine-tune and customize your app
experience to different user segments or
app versions now many developers use FCM
and remote config to create a more a to
create a more targeted experience but
we've also heard from many of you that
you want an easier and more powerful way
to test different variants and for that
we've recently released first class a/b
testing support for firebase with a be
testing you can test different variants
of notification messages or
configuration values to different groups
of users and it will help you figure out
which of these variants perform best for
the goals that you specified so for
example you can figure out whether the
orange button or the blue button help
drive more user purchases I'm also very
excited to share that we've recently
taken our first step of bringing
Google's machine learning to firebase
with the release of firebase predictions
predictions applies ml to your analytics
data and helps you predict users
behavior like churn spend or other
events that you've specified that are
important to your app now it's also
integrated with other fire-based
products so you can take targeted
actions like triggering and in-app
promotion using remote config to users
who are most likely to spend or say send
the push notifications to target users
who are likely to churn or run a be
tests across these different groups I'm
very excited to be here sharing these
updates on behalf of the firebase team
and meeting many of you here I look
forward to hearing your feedback and
continue to work hard to help you build
a better app and grow a more successful
business thank you
thanks everyone for joining us this
morning
I hope you are all as excited as I am
about the progress we have been making
with our developer product and platforms
thank you to your speakers
