LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Hi, friends.
We have with us Sreeraman,
who is our Google Developers
Expert for marketing.
So Sreeraman,
you've been somebody
associated with the community
for quite some time now.
Tell us about your journey
through various communities.
SREERAMAN THIAGARAJAN:
Sure, Lakshya.
I started GBG, Google Business
Group Mumbai, back in March
of 2013.
It's a community of nearly 5,000
people today in Bombay alone.
And we have been doing lot of
outreach programs to really
help [INAUDIBLE] and startups
at the grassroots level,
and it's been
fantastic experience.
The saying goes, &quot;To
teach is to learn twice.&quot;
So every time I interact with
them, I learn something back.
And we are a team of
10 members, volunteers.
So everyone really comes
with a different capacity.
Somebody's good in business.
Somebody's good with finance.
Somebody's good with pure tech.
Somebody's good with
all the Google products.
So that's how we are able to
add value to the community,
and that's one of the reasons
we have built a really
nice community in Bombay.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
That's really nice.
And how do you think
tech can add value
to a field like marketing?
SREERAMAN THIAGARAJAN:
Marketing has always
been about people, and
culture, and understanding
those in depth.
And tech has made it
really, really easy.
Something as simple
as observing a Google
Trends to leveraging
big data, and you
have control over everything.
So what gets measured
gets managed better.
More and more tech we
deploy in everything,
whether it is a
digital business,
or a standalone
product business,
or it's a traditional
marketing, when you put data
and when you put
tech on top of it,
measurably, it becomes better.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Being a startup entrepreneur
yourself, what is
the message that you
would like to give to all
the budding entrepreneurs?
SREERAMAN THIAGARAJAN: Sure.
So I've been an entrepreneur
once or twice in my life
before.
I've been an entrepreneur.
I've been on the corporate side.
But any other
entrepreneur trying
to build a product
or a digital solution
needs to understand if people
will be able to use it,
if they find anything
incrementally beneficial.
That's the only reason any
entrepreneur will succeed.
Has it solved a problem
or created delight?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Thank you, so much, Sreeraman,
for taking time off.
Friends, if you have any
questions for Sreeraman or us,
please leave them in the
comments section below,
and we'll try to
get them answered.
Do tweet to us @GoogleDevsIN.
Thank you.
