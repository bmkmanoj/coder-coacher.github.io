have Paul back out shopping Paul is a
developer advocate at Google and heads
the amp for developer relations hey Paul
how are you doing I'm good thank you
first question that I comes into my mind
is what is amp for amp stands for
accelerated mobile pages and it's sort
of a performance ecosystem so it comes
with M HTML width which is both a
superset and subset of HTML then we have
MJS which drives the experience and make
sure that you're always on a fast
loading web site and then we have the
amp caches that further accelerate the
delivery of pages so if you're building
an amp page and you're working with a
constrained set of what you can do but
you're always gonna stay on fast lane
and publishers can then know that and
actually further accelerate the delivery
so how do we get to know if the website
is amp enabled or amplified or not well
very easy in the HTML in the header of
the page you actually have a lightning
bolt yeah I think that the lightning
bolt actually sick actually signals that
is an amp page but of course you might
still not follow the rules later on so
what we do have we have a bunch of
validators even built into the amp
library but we have a web-based library
we have a chrome plug-in that can
validate amp pages so if you want to be
sure that something is valid amp there's
a lot of options out there which are the
browsers that support this and web sites
amp has actually supported by all
browsers and the last two versions as a
general guideline from all of the
browsers now we try to ensure that amp
doesn't break in almost all browsers
that get used so it should work in
almost every scenario now of course that
thought that means amp itself right
empty open-source technology now some
platforms like Google and Bing and
LinkedIn are building experiences that
use amp pages that show the lightning
bolt of pre-rendered reload the page now
those experience experiences might not
work everywhere for instance the top
stories carousel and Google is only
supported on mobile but not on desktop
so you need to check if those
experiences also work anywhere
great
and a lot of our developers are also
building pwace so there is a confusion
among them and few of them is our amp
and PWR the same thing good question and
no PWA stands for progressive web apps
and it's an umbrella term for quite a
lot of new web standards and that are
built together with the WCC and other
browser vendors for instance
serviceworker or the web app manifest or
the web payment api's so it's an
umbrella term for how to build a web
application in 2017 and the core of it
is this technology we call serviceworker
it allows you to make apps more reliable
more engaging now amp on the other side
is similar to a JavaScript library it's
fairly opinionated about what you can do
and you include it in your pages in fact
you can build an amp page that is both a
PWA and vice versa if you do it the
right way so are there any guidelines or
guides that developers can follow if
they want to combine both amp and pw as
you mentioned they can be iceberg yeah
absolutely I mean first thing you should
probably follow the amp channel on
YouTube where I have an episode about
the exact topic in my amplify show that
talks about amp and PWA in the
combination but also if you go to amp
protector org which is our home page
which coincidentally is also amp and PWM
on em Portugal org you'll find plenty of
examples and also a guide that dives
into this topic of how to combine two as
we all know that amp is an open source
project so how do you feel like working
on this open source project and what was
your experience in working other open
source project in your past roles and
how is it different I think the beauty
about open source is that everyone can
participate and usually the best idea
wins so it's really often a democratic
process as opposed to I'm gonna develop
something in-house and then later on
when it's completely finished I'm gonna
see if it works or not right with open
source you start early you iterate in
the open and then you can prevent
mistakes because you have a whole
community around you that engages with
your product and so we see the same
thing with amp right with amp we have
open design reviews that everyone can
participate in we
show a roadmap we are in the open on
slack so wherever you go you'll see us
discuss things in the open and everyone
can contribute you met in India last
year and you spoke at two of the
developer conferences in Bangalore so
what are your key learnings about the
Indian developers there what do you
think what is a trend they are following
and what are your advices for them for
our developers I think most of all there
is a sense of urgency in India about
implementing pwace that I haven't seen
in other countries because you know data
is very expensive often and fairly slow
so using technologies that make
applications offline capable and more
reliable and also circumventing the idea
that I have to download 100 megabytes
before I can use it application all of
these concepts I think are much more
urgent much more powerful with Indian
markets and developers so I think
there's this there's definitely a sense
that they need to have progressive web
apps now as opposed to in the year and
do you have anything to add like if I am
getting started for a developing forum
or if I want to convert my website to
amp or other resources that I should
look for over the Internet yeah so I
mean again you should check out amp
project org if you like to learn by
video check the amp channel on YouTube
and also amp by example so I'm furnaces
I'm a learner who really wants to learn
by looking at the demo so yeah how did I
do that
and so Empire example.com is our
resource to see how you can build things
in complex scenarios and then of course
you can also get in touch with us if you
if you still can't find your solution
it's super easy to get in touch with us
via slack by a mailing list by a twitter
so you name it thanks for all your time
Paul for answering all the questions and
folks if you have an amplified your
website it's time to do it right now and
do follow the guides that Paul mentioned
and if you have any questions or
suggestions post it in the comment below
or directly tweeted to Paul and I
believe Paul will be more than glad to
answer them absolutely
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
