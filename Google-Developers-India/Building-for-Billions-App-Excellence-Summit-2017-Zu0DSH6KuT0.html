a business development
googleplay good morning everyone
hi are they run feeling good happy happy
to be here
wonderful I'm really excited to be here
this morning to talk to you a little bit
about some some unique insight some
tools and some best practices that you
should think about as you think about
building apps that will work effectively
and meaningfully not just for the
millions the hundreds of millions of
smartphone users today but also about
the next million next billion smartphone
users as they get connected in India
earlier today you heard
Poornima and Rajan spool speak about the
immense momentum and immense traction
we're seeing in the Android ecosystem in
the country today what makes me most
excited is that despite all the growth
we've seen there is immense
opportunities from waiting to be
untapped smartphone penetration in India
today is still less than 30 percent of
the total population as more and more
users get access to affordable devices
and get connected for the first time
they will increasingly rely on their
phones to look for information to
transact the goods and services to
communicate or to simply entertain
themselves and that means incredibly
exciting new opportunities for everybody
here today the winning will require some
focused actions and and strategic
thinking on your part as well as you
think about winning with these users and
making apps relevant for these users
it's very important that as a group we
understand the unique challenges that
they face in their daily lives in terms
of connectivity devices etc let's talk
so let's take a quick look at some of
these firstly now while we are very very
excited about the progress in India
today in terms of the rollout of fast
network technologies 4G LTE etc the fact
is that at the end of the first half of
this year more than 70% of the
population was still using 2g that's
about 800 million
and that's a sizable audience sizable
user base for you to think about and
solve for related to that the quality
and adoption of broadband continues to
be low while it's growing it C continues
to be low at this point this 19% of
rhodol mobile garden bird broadband
connections operate at speeds higher
than 10 Mbps and finally let's talk
about devices now again it's great that
consumers in India have now access to a
lot of affordable devices and that
lowers the barrier for users to come
online the fact is that a lot of these
devices come with lower hardware specs
so storage memory processing power
battery life etc and therefore can
impact the user experience that that
users have on these devices so when you
look at all these challenges together
connectivity devices broadband data
access it's important to understand that
these these challenges can place
constraints on the kind of experience
that users will have on their phones so
while you may do your best to create the
most amazing app or game for these users
if it's not optimized well enough to
perform effectively in these conditions
it will be a sub optimal outcome and
that's what we need to solve and that's
exactly what the focus of this
discussion is going to be today I want
to start by giving like giving you a
quick preview on what we are trying to
do at Google to solve this problem
before we talk about some specific
initiatives that you can think about we
believe that access should never be at
the cost of quality and therefore
earlier this year we announced the
launch of Android go a new initiative
which we're trying to build out as part
of our commitment and investments to the
next wave of smartphone users so what is
Android go James spoke about it briefly
Android go essentially is a new
experience that we're trying to build
out for new smartphone users with access
to affordable devices foundationally
it's built on three important things
first of all optimizing the operating
system or and
to make sure that the latest version
runs smoothly and seamlessly on
affordable devices or in clear entry
level devices secondly having a rebuilt
or optimized set of Google Apps that use
less memory less data less storage and
finally a revitalized Play Store
experience which enables users to not
only consume the entire catalog which is
done play but also helps them discover
apps that you are building out for next
million users in mind we are very very
excited about Android going and the
potential that it has to unlock the
power of computing for the next few
hundred million users in markets like
India I'm going to take a deeper look at
what we are trying to do and hopefully
this will give you some inspiration as
you think about your own content and
your own apps and games so as I said on
the store itself we are trying to create
a new discovery experience a new
discovery experience to make sure that
users are able to discover the app that
are being custom-built with these
challenges in mind around connectivity
devices etc secondly we are building an
additional capacity for users to be able
to share these apps so P to be sharing
is something that we are building out as
part of Play Store on Android go and
finally there will also be an additional
functionality functionality for users to
be able to delay downloads till they
actually have Wi-Fi access for example
this will help them optimize the data
cost and have a more useful offline
experience so these are some of the
things that we're trying to do to make
play more relevant as we think about the
next few hundred million users I'm also
excited to share with you some of the
work that the YouTube team is doing to
have a more seamless YouTube experience
for four unaffordable devices so there
are four things here that I want to call
out firstly the team has done an amazing
job in building out a new preview
feature which means that users can
actually have a sneak peek at what the
video is all about before watching the
full video and once they decide to watch
the video they can choose the streaming
quality and the speed at which they want
to watch it and along with that they owe
get to know what constantly come out so
they know exactly how much data sauce
every in curve by choosing to watch at
that quality so it gives users a lot
more control about the kind of content
they're watching as well as the cost
associated with that
and finally what you're trying to do is
also making sure that it has a useful
offline experience by letting users
download videos and watch them later
when they have limited or no
connectivity so with these kinds of
interventions we believe that our own
Google Apps will become a lot more
relevant to users as you think about
access on low-end devices stuff networks
etcetera so now while we're doing what
we can I think the real magic really
happens when all of you jumping and all
of you start solving these problems that
exist with with your creativity your
imagination your innovation and your
love for technology so let's switch
gears and talk about what you can do now
in order to support your efforts in this
area in other support your your
initiatives to solve the problems that
these are spoke about we've identified a
set of tools best practices and
guidelines that we believe can help this
is what we call the building pavilions
framework and it's designed to help you
solve user challenges in six important
areas a making sure that your app works
well in limited or poor connectivity be
making sure that it's compatible with
the plethora of devices out there in
terms of different screen sizes storage
capacity etcetera etcetera see making
sure that your apps are sensitive to
users data cost and data consumption
help users save their battery making
sure that the content is promoted and
showcased in an intuitive and seamless
manner and finally making sure that you
understand user insights about pricing
local pricing etc to make sure that
you're able to price your content your
apps and games etc at the right price
which connects meaningfully with users
now while we can't cover all of this
today it's all there on developer
Android comm for you to consume having
said that I do want to call out a few
important features which I think you
could start implementing right away that
will help you think most rigidly about
these problems let's talk about
connectivity now one of the fundamental
principles of making sure that your apps
work well on port networks is making
sure that you're able to prioritize
bandwidth requests one simple way of
doing that is making sure that text is
prioritized over data over images and
rich media so making sure that just the
text loads
seamlessly before rich media is a good
useful way of connecting with users
without having to wait endlessly for
content to come up secondly we often get
confused between connectivity and
connection type let me explain how while
there may be users who are on 3G or 4G
depending upon the network type they've
chosen the fact is that the connection
quality itself gets impacted by lots of
other issues such as network density
population location etc so for example
the same 3G or 4G connection which works
really well for you at home or in the
comfort of your office could could
behave very differently if you're saying
the fact Chinnaswamy Stadium watching a
cricket match with thousands of people
right it's a very very different
experience and therefore it's important
that your users that your app detects
that change in connection and is able to
tailor the experience accordingly now
there are tools like for example the
telephony manager the connectivity
manager these are api's which are
available which can help you solve this
problem effectively and in case you
haven't done so please start thinking
about this and thinking about how you
can solve it images images get a lot of
attention and they do they should get a
lot of attention because they can impact
the overall behavior of the app on
onboard networks as the best practice we
recommend that you use WebP II which is
of which is a which is a image format
that we fully supported for a number of
Android versions now typically what it
does it helps you improve load times
reduce network bandwidth
and often results in images which are
smaller in size compared to formats like
jpg and PNG while maintaining the same
quality so it will also help you create
a better lowered lighter app as well in
addition to performing better on poor
data networks how many people here think
deeply about offline experience so let
me ask a different question how many of
you have apps that work well in an
offline mode so it's about 50 40 to 50
percent of the audience which is great I
think this is something this is really
really important making sure that the
user is able to engage with content even
though even in cases of poor or middle
connectivity is really really important
any ideas about how you can quickly test
how your app works in an offline mode
simple right everybody has access to
this put your app to the test sits on a
line mode on your phone and see how it
performs and that should be the starting
point of how you think about optimizing
it great let's talk about apk size now
this is something which is which users
care about clearly you all care about as
well and I'd get a lot of attention so
let's spend some time on this now we've
done a ton of research and I know apk
size is the right there is no right
answer ok I'll be honest it varies a lot
by category etcetera by country but what
we find is that apps higher than 10
megabytes typically have a higher risk
of getting uninstalled if you don't have
to choose so try and think about driving
optimizations that you can keep you well
within that 10 megabyte number to be
relevant for the next wave of users now
images are often the biggest offenders
as far as apk size is concerned right so
good starting point is to look at your
graphical assets use things like
scalable vector graphics to ensure that
you keep your graphical assets within
within limit they are tools like
ProGuard I don't know if you guys use it
with ProGuard is it's a very good tool
to look at removing unused code from
your app
and a multi-apk
so you can actually have different
configurable apk sizes based on the kind
of device of the user health that that's
something which which you can drive
through a tool called multi apk so in
case you haven't do good do look it up
on developer.android.com
we spoke on a lot about energy level
devices today I think there are two or
three things which stand out as far as
optimization for them is concern first
of all how do you build for devices or
the range of devices that you have in a
market like India with different screen
sizes different densities etc so again a
good useful starting point is to look at
density independent pixels to make sure
that your out performs seamlessly and
consistently across different screen
sizes different devices make sure that
you are rigorously testing your layouts
your text and your graphics on low and
medium density screens and make sure
that the app is compatible with earlier
versions of Android just to make sure
that you covered right the large the a
large enough base of users in the market
who haven't upgraded to the more recent
version so as the best practice your app
should always be targeted to the latest
version of Android but the minimum
target version should be for example say
14 API 14 which is Ice Cream Sandwich
right just to make sure that you're
covering the entire range of users who
have not upgraded yet memory and battery
I think that's another area which users
care deeply about and something which
requires a lot of attention so again a
useful best practice is to make sure
that your app keeps minimal activity
within the background so making sure
that you're using things like for
example way clocks figuring out and I
think for which you spoke about way
clocks and making sure that there are no
unnecessary way clocks within the app
which keep the device on and consume
memory as well as power avoid long
processes right make sure that you're
using firebase job dispatcher to group
to batch network requests we've already
built in a ton of functionality around
optimizing for memory
battery in in Android Oh so making sure
that you're just targeting API level 26
would be a great best practices level
there are tools available within the
Android studio to make sure that you're
benchmarking your performance on memory
so for example as an interesting
screenshot of the same app and how its
performing differently on two different
devices right so you can use the memory
monitor to figure out to figure out how
how much memory is being consumed on
different devices the first one that you
see there is a 1gb RAM device and the
other one is the 2gb RAM device and how
the same app is performing differently
in terms of consuming less memory on the
first one and more on the other one so
these are some tools which are already
available to you within within the
Android ecosystem that you can try and
look at using to improve the quality of
your apps alright so we've spoken a lot
about what kind of that ton tons more
out there I think like I said make sure
that you look at developer at Android
comes slash billions which has the
entire list of things you can do the
good news is developers are already
embracing a lot of these best practices
there are a few examples of people who
have been able to integrate these tools
to drive successful outcomes in terms of
either reducing apk size or improving
user growth by becoming more compatible
with energy level devices these are
things which are out there for you to to
look at as well right so we've spoken a
lot about the tools of this practices
which are available to you I think it's
the right time think about how you can
take on these problems head-on
connectivity devices etc and see whether
you want to look at embracing some of
the tools that we spoke about or you may
have your own unique solutions which can
help you solve them the point is we want
to make sure that these recognize and we
identify all of you who are doing a
phenomenal job in solving these problems
and make sure that your content is
discoverable to the next billion users
and Android so with that I'm very very
excited to announce the launch of a very
special initiative starting today
only for Indian developers made for
India there what is maple India if you
think that you're doing a phenomenal job
in solving some of the problem then if
you've been able to integrate some of
the best practices and tools that I
spoke about we would love to hear about
that starting today you can apply for a
chance to be selected in some of the
initiatives that we will be rolling out
in terms of promotions on the store as
part of our made for India initiative so
this is what you need to do and I'll
share the link again but essentially
there is a link out there it's the self
nomination form if you think that you
have you have been able to integrate on
these best practices or are currently in
the process of solving them whether it's
data consumption whether it's battery
consumption making your app perform in
poor internet networks having a useful
offline State if you've been able to
successfully reduce the apk size of your
apps we would love to hear about that
right you can use this form to nominate
yourself and then somebody will review
and essentially give you feedback on
what what needs to be improved so that's
the link
shirako slash place - made for india
make a note of it and I hope that after
all of this you're feeling a lot more
inspired to go back and think deeply
about the way your apps and games
currently work and how you can optimize
them better to meet the needs and
challenges that users in India face I
really look forward to receiving tons of
nominations from this group I hope
several of you make it and get selected
to be part of made for India thank you
for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
