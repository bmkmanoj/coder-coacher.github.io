one of product managers with Android
studio a hi Catherine week week some of
us have been developing on the studio
for a long time a couple of years to see
what are the new features that came out
of this i/o so there's a bunch of cool
features coming out in studio this i/o
on the first one is that the emulator is
now ship with full play support so if
you have an app to interact with the
Play Store in any way and you want to
really easily test it on your desktop
you can do that just grab a emulated
image and everything should be ready to
go the next feature is the performance
profilers so if you're trying to make
sure that your app works great on a
variety of devices and doesn't use too
much network or anything there is
updated performance profilers that make
it really easy to identify where you
just coming from and to track it said
specific actions that you just may be
taking in the app and then the final and
coolest feature I think is support for
the call to language so in studio 3 we
have added fully bundled support for
call ins which is a totally Java
compatible language you can adopt it a
little bit at a time and many developers
find that it makes it super easy to
write concise powerful code and it's got
some great features like null safety
which make it much easier to avoid the
dreaded null pointer exception out there
in the wild so they can let's go ahead
and get these pieces oh it's really easy
just go to developer.android.com go to
the studio section and download the
latest 3.0 preview so all of these
features are out there and you should
totally give them a shot thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
