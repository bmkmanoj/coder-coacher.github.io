here to talk to you guys well first I
should say namaskara welcome to our
session this is we're getting close to
the end of the day how are you guys
doing so far you guys learning a lot
awesome alright I have to take a picture
because I have to prove to my boss
actually came here and talked to you
guys
otherwise they're not gonna pay me smile
everybody look like you're happy awesome
alright so the first thing I want to
tell you guys is this is just a big
bait-and-switch quick show of hands how
many of you guys have ever heard of
Google Apps Script hey that's actually
pretty good
normally it's like 1 out of 10 3 out of
10 but this was almost 4 out of 10
alright so that's great well too bad for
the rest of you because that's what
today's talk is all about however one
side effect is that you'll also learn
how to extend Google Docs sheets slides
forms in Gmail with add-ons alright by
the way we have 30 minutes and I have 48
slides so let's go alright and by the
way if you guys look at that if you have
any extra questions feel free to drop
them in the doc and otherwise we talk to
you afterwards all right so cool let's
go so my main goal is to help you become
successful using our developer tools and
api's ok some of you guys may know that
I'm the host of the G suite dev show on
YouTube so I have videos from time to
time and a lot of the code samples and
I'm going to show you today there
actually will be video so you can
actually watch individual video on a
specific example that is interesting to
you
ok and I'm also a contributor to the
blog and also the Twitter handle so
anyway so I look forward to like keeping
in touch with you guys online even if
I'm not physically here ok so my
background is I'm a software engineer I
was one of the original engineers that
built yahoo mail if you guys ever heard
of that but many many years ago I'm a
teacher as well too and I'm very happy
to be talking to you guys today about
Apps Script as well as add-ons ok so
this is the story we're gonna talk a
little bit about app script and I'll
show you what kind of things you can do
to automate and extend G suite and then
I'll go more specifically into looking
at add-ons and then I'll talk about
various use cases and apps that people
have already done alright so what is
Google Apps Script and what is it not
okay
is it another Google secret we have lots
of secrets right well you know it's not
really our best-kept secret
nor is it really a secret at all but I
think it still has relatively low
mindshare that's why I asked you guys a
show of hands to see who of you have
heard of it before okay so what is
Google Apps Script by the way here are
our original and our new logos and the
new design hints that Apps Script is
like a Swiss Army knife it's very
utilitarian it's a tool based on
JavaScript but it's less like using
api's and more like using services or
built-in API access and because of that
you don't have to worry about more
mundane things like writing OAuth code
okay so to help with this understanding
let's talk a little bit now about what
Apps Script is not okay it's not
something completely different it's just
JavaScript so there isn't that much new
to learn even the Python guy like me
knows some JavaScript okay but it's also
not your daddy's JavaScript meaning it's
not client-side and it doesn't run in
the browser necessarily you're not going
to use it for Dom manipulation nor form
validation okay there are some
exceptions of course but what are you
gonna do with the browser well the only
thing you're gonna do with the browser
is edit your source code in it okay so
that's generally the case with Apps
Script now if you're familiar with node
it's like node because it is server-side
however you're not running asynchronous
event-driven code that executes on node
servers instead your applications are
going to run in the same Google Data
Centers that powers search and YouTube
and Gmail and all the other Google
services that you guys are used to using
okay so your apps will be running on the
same
jeans in fact that will give you access
to resources that you can't get with a
regular node server right being able to
talk to your Google Apps access the data
and things like that so that's really
where the power comes in okay so if
someone was to ask you or ask me in one
sentence how can you describe what Apps
Script is well Apps Script is a server
list JavaScript runtime 4G suite
automation extension and integration
okay and then we'll look at examples of
each of these so you can see what I mean
by that okay what kind of things can you
do with Apps Script it could be
something very simple like a function in
a spreadsheet or it could be a complete
web app that does lots of different
things many many lines of code and of
course everything in between all right
now let's look at automating and
extending G suite so we'll give you some
examples and then we'll talk about
add-ons all right so for the Google
services that you guys see on the screen
here you'll see yes there are some
Google Apps in G suite ones but then
there's also ones that are not part of
Apps or G suite right like Google Maps
and YouTube
they are Google services but they're not
part of G suite so this gives you a hint
as to the fact that Apps Script can do a
lot more than just deal with Apps ng
suite ok I just pull anymore it can do
so for every Google service that you see
each one is a single JavaScript class
all right so you see I've highlighted a
couple of them here one is for Google
Calendar one is for Google Docs but in
general whenever you see something with
app after it that generally indicates
this is a service notice again it's not
like using an API as much instead it's
kind of like an object that's already
there
so the example from the page and the
docs is for Google slides all right
where you can open a presentation or you
can create a new presentation so it uses
slides app alright so that's how you
access Google services you have sort of
like one JavaScript class and then from
that class you have a whole bunch of
methods that you can call to access
those particular document types or those
services all right everybody good so far
all right good so what is the list of
all the things that you can do with Apps
well all the G sweet and AB stuff that
you know on the left-hand side including
ones you probably don't know all right
but then you can also talk to these
other Google services in the middle
column and then finally we don't want to
constrain you right maybe you need to
leave Google right you need to access
services that are available online
somewhere else
somewhere in your data center something
belongs to your company or maybe it's a
public service right so that's why we
have URL fetch so you can send HTTP GET
requests as well as post requests and
talk to other apps that are online
you're not restricted to just doing
everything from within a G suite
environment or Google environment and
then similarly if you want to talk to an
external database you can use a JDBC
service all right so there's plenty more
that you can do all right
now what kinds of app scripts are there
well if there's three general types we
have standalone scripts which are
exactly what they sound like they're
just regular code that sits out there
and runs and does stuff for you then we
also have add-ons and document bound
scripts okay where you get access to
those is generally if you're in an
editor you pull down the Tools menu bar
and then there's a selection called
script editor and then from there you'll
be able to pull up the code editor for
that particular for Apps scripts that
you write for that particular document
okay and then add-ons you can get in
manage add-ons also from that pulldown
and then finally the last type of Apps
Script are the simple web apps and
gadgets that run under Google Sites
okay so there's these are the three main
types of course in this talk because you
guys are here we're really focused on
add-ons in document bound scripts so I'm
not gonna talk about the other two
anymore and just focus on the topic at
hand
okay so document bound scripts like I
said you open up Google Docs or sheets
and then you just pull down tools and
then script editor
okay so document bound scripts are those
that are tied to specific documents like
a dog sheet
slide or a form and of course you're
going to have you know method calls that
are unique to those document types you
could only call get active cell for a
spreadsheet because it doesn't make
sense to do that for Docs or things
that right same thing goes for create
presentation it only works for slides
you can't create a slide a presentation
in spreadsheet and things like that okay
so those are document bound now add-ons
are a specific type of document bound
script and then Gmail is a little bit
special because Gmail add-ons are not
tied to documents but instead they're
tied to individual email threats okay so
what are add-ons again they allow you to
extend the existing functionality of G
suite applications or allows you to
embed the functionality in your app
inside hours all right giving your users
that access where oh gosh I don't have
to exit my editor to go access this app
I don't have to switch browser tabs I
can actually get you know the
functionality from your app directly
inside one of the Google's editors or
Gmail okay so the add-ons that we have
launched in 2014 for Google Docs sheets
and forms and then just nine weeks ago
we released Google slides add-ons and
then just five weeks ago we released
Gmail add-on so this is pretty new stuff
so I'm gonna have like more examples for
the last two just because of the latest
hotness all right but I'm also going to
show you some examples of the other
types too just so you can see the
variety of things that you can do okay
all right so let's say you're new to
Apps Script I'm happy that many of you
guys raise your hands but let's get
everybody else up to speed okay so when
you create a brand new Apps Script
project you get this little panel that
you see here that gives you some you
know predefined code some boilerplate
code in case you're writing those
specific types of add-ons if not just
choose blank project that's what I
usually pick because I just want a blank
slate and I just want to start something
from scratch okay so that's the first
experience that you have and then once
you get past this then you get dropped
into the editor and so your first
HelloWorld application will look
something like this okay so I'm in a
spreadsheet I pull down tools script
editor blank project and then I'm gonna
type in this one line JavaScript
function okay which I you know split up
into four lines so you could actually
see each piece one at a time
all right but I have a generic function
it connects to the spreadsheet and what
are the commands I wanted to do I wanted
to get the current active sheet that I'm
on as if I was sitting in front of the
user interface and looking at that
spreadsheet in my computer I want to
access what is in cell a1 in the upper
left hand corner and what do I want to
do with that cell I want to set the
value of that cell to hello world okay
so once you save this and run it notice
there's no authorization code however
when you run the script guess what your
users still have to give permission to
your apps to be able to access their
spreadsheet because it's their personal
data right so they still have to go
through the authorization process but
you didn't have to write any off code
because that part is built-in already
okay so that's one of the useful things
about using Apps Script is that it's
more user friendly or developer friendly
if you were to use our REST API you
would actually have to write ooofff code
to manage you know getting of an access
token in order to be able to access user
data okay so this is definitely one of
the benefits for developers is that they
don't have to worry about the OAuth and
then once the user clicks allow giving
permission for your code to access their
spreadsheet then you're gonna expect
that that text is going to show up in a
spreadsheet okay it's almost like magic
when it happens the very first time
it'll make you smile alright and that's
the best part about it is that you feel
that you've gotten something done and
now your mind is going to wonder as to
well if I can do this
think of all the other things that I
could build with it right it's really
really exciting alright so if you want
to you know review this simple hello
world of course I have a video that's
what I do for a living I don't have a
private life anymore okay so I'm here to
make you guys successful so that's my
job all right now let's look at this one
what can we do with this that's address
all right
happens to be the address of the Google
New York office but you know maybe you
want to invite your friend here for
lunch what can you do with it
well we know we can talk to a
spreadsheet but remember the universe is
pretty big from within Google I can talk
to other Google's
services - right so for example I could
say hey you know what I'm gonna talk to
that spreadsheet again the current
active sheet that I'm on and this time I
want to look at cell a2 which we can see
is the actual address right so what do
we want to do with a - well we're gonna
get its value save that address and then
I could say hey Google Maps can you
create me a brand new map and put a pin
on that address cool right and then
furthermore maybe you want your friend
to come to lunch here you know at the
Google office right so I can then say
hey Gmail
can you send a link to this map to my
friend so that they know where to come
for lunch okay and that's it you've got
a four line JavaScript application four
lines but it touches three different
Google products spread cheese Google
sheets Google Maps and Gmail right I
mean it's not exactly a mission-critical
app right but it does show you that you
can use multiple Google services
simultaneously to write tools that are
somewhat useful or could be very useful
okay and of course there's a video in
case you want to review this too but
once you can do something like this
where can you take this well guess what
maybe you're a salesperson maybe you
have to visit all of your customers in
the New York area
all right well guess what I don't have
to have just one address I could have
four addresses for all my customers then
I can kind of plan out where you know
which way I want to go and then guess
what I have access to Google Maps
driving directions - so if I have if I
have to you know Drive or if I have to
bike or walk I can get that stuff
programmatically as well - and maybe you
have a monthly book club maybe it meets
at a different location every month you
know maybe you want to tell everybody
hey this month we're meeting at this
location okay or maybe I have a user
group that meets once a month in a
different location right so you can kind
of like imagine what kind of things you
can build with you know just a little
bit more code than the example that that
I showed you guys okay in fact one of
the other things that you can do is
maybe you can ask your membership so
who's coming right maybe you have a
Google Form and then as soon as they
submit the form maybe then you know
they're coming and then you can email
them the link to the map of the location
because why bother mailing all 400
people when you'd only know that 200 are
coming right you don't want to spam
everybody so that's like another use
case another way to extend this
particular type of application okay all
right let's say I have a bunch of images
for brevity's sake let's just pretend
they're all online but they could also
be somewhere else you can have a zip
file of images you could have a Google
Drive folder full of images okay but for
this example let's just pretend I've got
these four images that are online and I
want to build a slide deck with these
images okay so you can do that using the
slide service that we just launched nine
weeks ago all right so taking each one
of these images and then building an
individual slide for each one so you can
actually see that in the presentation
that it's been created based on the
images that you see on the left hand
side so how do we do something like this
how complicated is this code okay it's
not that complicated in fact I would say
this is only about you know about six
seven lines of code you know if you
don't count the data because I have a
whole list of the images and a URLs but
if you don't if you don't consider those
lines of code well we really only have
you know our main body has four lines of
code here all right and I'm just gonna
like walk you through each line really
quickly right now so you can get an idea
of what it does but everybody knows that
when you guys create a new Google slide
deck you get the title page right it's
got a title and a subtitle so the whole
purpose of the first three lines of code
is to fill in the name of the
presentation which comes in the name
variable and then this subtitle down
here which is Google Apps Script slide
service demo so all the first three
lines do is fill in the title and the
subtitle on the title slide okay it's
the same thing as you see here there's
the title there's a subtitle all the
other ones are
okay so once we have that then we have a
for loop all right that loops through
all of the images in the array all right
and for every image it calls the add
image slide function and all that does
is adds a blank slide and inserts that
image into that slide and that's it now
you have a slideshow okay not too many
lines of code and of course there's a
video okay so that's one example now let
so what we've seen so far our document
bound scripts we had the hello world we
had the maps and a gmail example right
those are tied to a Google sheet they
are document bound to a Google sheet and
then we just looked at the creating of a
slideshow that's tied to a Google slides
presentation now how do we convert those
document bound scripts into add-ons
right because that's really the whole
purpose of this talk right so and why
would you convert something to an add-on
one of the main reasons is it's really
hard to share that code all right you
can't you'd have to cut and paste it or
somehow copy the document that's really
not distributable right if you turn
things into an add-on and put it into
the g suite marketplace or the Chrome
Web Store then other users can find your
app and install it perhaps for their
entire companies okay so you can
actually make a living writing software
to help companies be more efficient all
right and so one of the things that you
have to do to convert a bound script to
an add-on are a couple of things one is
what happens when the when this document
is opened all right so you have to add
an on open what happens when this add-on
is installed you need an uninstall
generally it just calls on open all
right and then if you want to further
modify the user interface okay you can
do that you can add a sidebar so that
your users can see your app on the
right-hand side it within the same
document or the same spreadsheet or the
same form okay so those are the key
things that you would need to implement
on top of the existing code so
everything else on the bottom there
is whatever we had before so all the
code I showed you before the hello world
the the Gmail and the Google Maps
example and then creating of slides
those things are part of the document
bound script all you would do is add
these things ok and then the other thing
that you need to really be careful about
is you need to really understand the
authorization lifecycle and the reason
for this is because companies may be
installing your code right so it would
make people nervous if all of a sudden
when they opened their document there's
this weird add-on that was added to
their you know to their document right
so there's a slightly more complex
authorization lifecycle that you need to
understand because what happens is when
that out on first runs it doesn't have
full permission to do everything ok you
have to wait for the user to sort of
like opt-in to be using this particular
add-on ok just because it's installed
does it mean that it's been enabled for
usage so if you are going to be creating
lots of add-ons just just learn the life
cycle well so you understand what things
your script can and cannot do and at
which times all right so that's that's
pretty important to know but once you
get past that then you'll have an add-on
and you can upload it to the G suite
marketplace or the Chrome Web Store and
people can find it you know you make a
logo you make a description you know
entice your users why should people
install your add-on why is it useful you
have to keep those things in mind so
even though your developers part of your
brain has to sometimes think you know
what do I do marketing wise how do I get
people interested in my add-on and to
encourage them to install and how can I
make their lives easier ok and so that's
really the main thing now let's talk
about Gmail add-ons now because Gmail
add-ons are a little bit different so
let's say that your company sent you
here for work ok maybe you booked an
airline reservation maybe you have a
hotel reservation and then maybe you're
catching Ola taxis
every day or uber or whatnot ok so we
all know that these email receipts are
coming into our Gmail because we see
them as they happen right and if we're
going to have to create an expense
report
and you know get reimbursed by our
companies it's kind of a burden to have
to look through all my receipts copy
down the information go to my separate
expense reporting app fill in all that
information and then submit it to get
reimbursed right can't we just do the
same thing without leaving Gmail can't I
just process my expenses at the same
time I'm looking at the receipt and
can't I do it on the web and mobile
without having to write two separate
apps for this right so those are the key
questions that you know drove the
product team to creating Gmail add-ons
for everyone okay so I'm happy to say
that we can actually do this now so you
can actually make this little form show
up right in your Gmail in fact I just
hid it so that you didn't see it before
but this is exactly what it would look
like if you were on your computer and
you actually brought up this particular
add-on that my summer intern wrote this
summer or this past summer where it
could read the contents out of your
email message it's specifically the
receipt right it can pull out the date
of the transaction the amount of the
transaction and a description all you
really need to provide is a spreadsheet
URL and when you click Submit okay oh by
the way it would be great if I could do
it on mobile too so I'll have to wait to
get back to the office I can actually do
it while I'm sitting in the cab all
right so that's the one cool thing about
Gmail add-ons is that once you write it
it will work on the web and it'll work
in mobile and you don't have to write
any other version right just one piece
of source code so this is the exact same
receipt but on an Android device okay so
anyway so once we have this and we click
Submit we get the you know my form has
been successfully submitted and then
when you go to that spreadsheet well now
you have one place that you can just
leave it up and just do your expense
reports straight out from here okay so
that's really the main reason behind
this so the code is it's gonna be a
little bit larger because Gmail provides
you the ability to add your own user
interface so for us we had that little
form
right so it takes a little bit to create
the user interface and then build the
code that runs behind it ok so here's
just one kind of quick view of building
the expenses form alright you can see
all the source code of course in the
video and we've also made this example
available on github so you can download
the entire app and study it and
implement it and change it and all that
kind of stuff so everything's available
for you it's also available as the code
lab alright so if you really want to
learn how to do gmail add-ons you can
actually use you can build this example
line by line
well maybe not line by line but chunk by
chunk okay so you can actually build
this app for yourself and then you can
take this as motivation to building your
own Gmail add-ons okay so that's called
expensive alright now let's talk about
in general now that I've shown you guys
the technology what have other companies
done before you what are some of the
other use cases for Apps Script as well
as for add-ons
okay so categories something like these
six you know having business workflows
controlling resources automating things
that normally take a lot of effort to do
as a human building dashboards and other
reporting for managers integrating with
other third-party tools you know because
you know 4G suite we can't provide
everything for you you know we have to
we have you know a document editor we
have a spreadsheet we have presentations
but we don't have a CRM we don't have
you know payroll and HR apps we don't
have that kind of functionality so these
are the kind of things that you can
bring in to your G suite environment by
using these you know third-party
integrations and then you can also you
know if you are a G suite or a Google
Apps domain administrator you can
actually use this tool to automate a lot
of stuff like for example next week you
have 100 new employees you really don't
want to be creating each of their Gmail
accounts one at a time that'll drive you
crazy I mean it's good job security but
you're probably going to be burned out
pretty soon ok so those are the kind of
things that you can do with Apps Script
right teachers really believe it or not
they like to write teacher tools that
help automate you know instructing
students so for example there's a well
known app called flubaroo and what that
is is if a teacher creates an exam you
know using Google Forms and all the
students submit the answers into a
spreadsheet well guess what the teacher
can submit their own answer which is the
answer key right and then the flubaroo
tool can actually grade everybody else
all the students results based on the
teachers answer key all right
so tools like that are very very useful
okay and then automation like mail merge
right who there's so many different
types of mail merges like form letters
and Google Docs you have your email
addresses and Google sheets and then you
want to send these through Gmail all
three of these are possible right there
are three different Google products but
they're all supported by Apps Script so
automation is a big one enterprise
workflow so for my team everybody's
going on vacation a different time right
and so what happens is everybody has
their own out of office in their
calendars but then we have an Apps
Script code that builds a team vacation
calendar so that if you want to see
who's in the office you can actually
take a look at this one calendar and it
tells you when everybody is out of town
so that's a very useful thing too all
right all right and then of course you
can just go to the G suite marketplace
and look at all the different apps that
are available for you and you can see
how many users they have right I mean
your app can actually go viral if
companies install it so that's one
another motivation as to why you guys
should consider writing add-ons and then
you know a big company like lucidchart
they have a very famous web app but you
know what they integrated that app as an
add-on for slides because maybe I want
to have these diagrams incorporated into
my slide decks so they built it out on
specifically for this purpose it's
pretty awesome okay all right now what
else do you need to know you may have
heard about app maker so if you don't
code at all all right app maker is a
tool that you can drag and drop web
components or UI components like a text
box a dialog window
and it automatically generates app
script code underneath the covers and so
if you know app script you can modify
and customize your app maker apps so
that's pretty powerful okay
so anyway so keep that in mind you know
it's a little bit outside the scope of
this talk but overall I hope to impress
on you this last half-hour is that app
script and add-ons are just JavaScript
it gives you access to existing Google
services and other online resources it's
not like an API so you don't have to
worry about like authentication and
things like that it's more like built-in
services
it's serverless you don't have to set up
VMs or anything like that it runs in
Google data centers for you there's lots
of different use cases you can extend G
suite with add-ons or you can integrate
your apps functionality and then you can
further customize app make your
applications and hopefully after today
it's no longer our secret all right
because you guys all know about it now
okay if you want support we have stack
overflow we have a Google+ community we
have an issue tracker other things that
you can do we have a code lab so come
join me tomorrow I'll show you the slide
in a moment we can do a code lab
together tomorrow there's a whole bunch
of videos some Doc's and if you want you
can also use our REST API s and then
like I said come join me tomorrow I'm
doing eight hands-on training one is
Apps Script the others actually using
our REST API s I'm also going to be
talking about the sheets API later on in
the afternoon and if you're a Python
person I'm speaking at the Bangalore
Python users group on Sunday so hope to
see you guys more later this week thank
you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
