My name is Rishabh and I live in Noida
and I study 
in Bal Bharati Public School, Noida.
I've heard about Code to Learn 
from a teacher because,
fortunately enough, I was being a part 
of various inter-school competitions
and they have informed me
that there is a competition
and if I'm interested, I can take part.
For Google Code to Learn contest
I've made a game called &lt;i&gt;Make in India&lt;/i&gt;
which is a classic fighting game.
During the period of this contest,
I've faced a difficulty
that was, on the day of submission 
my system crashed.
Fortunately enough, I had a backup
and I've edited from a cyber cafe
and uploaded my game from there.
I've found coding very interesting
and I definitely want to be a programmer
and make games
because I love to play games
and I love to make my &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; games.
I would encourage others to participate 
in the Code to Learn contest
because they provide you a platform
wherein you just need to drag-and-drop,
you don't require any coding skills
to make applications.
It opened up the boundaries of coding
to those who don't have 
the knowledge of coding
by letting them use applications
like MIT App Inventor and Scratch.
&amp;gt;From Code to Learn, 
I've learned to make algorithms
which will definitely help me
in making applications in the future.
I would like to help my parents
in making an application
that would teach them
how to use electronic items
like PCs, smartphones, mobile phones,
because they didn't have 
such things in their generation,
it was not accessible to them.
I love coding, for me it's fun,
it's fun to code,
to make something responsive,
to make something of your own.
So that's why I love coding.
