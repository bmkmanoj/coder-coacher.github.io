AMRIT SANJEEV: Hi, everyone.
Today we have Yigit
with us, who is
the technical lead for the
Architecture Components.
So Yigit, we know that
Room was released as part
of the Architecture Components.
Tell us a little
more about that.
YIGIT BOYAR: So Room is a
new object mapping library
that we are shipping inside
Architecture Components.
It takes out all of
the boiler-plate code
you write to access
your database
and allows you to
write SQLite queries.
Moreover, it also verifies
that compile time.
So very similar
to your Java code,
if you make a mistake
in your query,
it's going to give a
compile time error.
So this is what Room is.
AMRIT SANJEEV: And what
are the other advantages
that you have with using Room?
YIGIT BOYAR: So Room is
already [? observable ?]
out of the box.
So it's very easy to
write data-driven UIs.
You have your queries
that observe the database.
Room will figure out when
the result will change.
You don't need to
say anything else.
You can just ask Room
to return on an RxJava
Flowable or a live data.
And it will do it.
AMRIT SANJEEV: So it
also works with RxJava.
YIGIT BOYAR: Correct.
It also works with RxJava.
AMRIT SANJEEV: Great.
So where can people
find Room now?
YIGIT BOYAR: So Room is
available as of yesterday at--
if you just need to add
[? maven.google.com ?]
to your gradle file.
And then you can
access Room today.
AMRIT SANJEEV: And is
it production-ready?
Can people use it in production
applications as of today?
YIGIT BOYAR: Today, the
Room is in alpha 1 version.
We believe you can
start using it,
but we want to see
how people use it.
We want to see how the
API usage patterns are.
We might change the API.
But besides that, I
think you can start
using Room in production today.
AMRIT SANJEEV: Great.
Thank you for your time, Yigit.
YIGIT BOYAR: Thank you.
