learning products from Google I'd like
to discuss what are the differences
between AI and machine learning and
neural network those buzzwords AI it's a
there's no scientific definition what is
AI butter you can say it's an technology
or science to make things smart or us
make this smarter computer right
the autonomous driving horror or writing
computer during a beautiful picture yeah
and there has been many approaches to
realize the vision of AI and one of them
is machine learning this is a kind of
the paradigm shift of programming so
usually if you want to build a new IT
system you have to hire a programmers to
write the program code that instruct
computers how to solve the problem but
instead now you can just use data
instead of human programmers chip
program in your computer so you can just
put more and more data to the computer
so that computer somehow tries to find
best way to solve the problem and there
has been so many different algorithms
for machine learning and one of them is
the neural network and if you have more
and more deeper layers of neural
networks that is called deep neural
network water planning and at around
2012 we have been seeing a breakthrough
has been happening in the area of neural
networks so that's why Google has been
spending so much amount of resources and
investment in the area of a new neural
neural network so let's take a look at
how neural network can solve a problem
by by using this route problem if you
have a customer and imagine that you are
you are a programmer or the customer and
your customer asked you to classify
these fruits as an apple or an orange
what kind of program code with Java or C
or Python anything to classify these
fruits maybe it's just way to look at
the color or pixels if it's a red it
must be an apple if it's an orange must
be orange but your customer
comes up you come comes to you again and
ask you sorry in the production system
the performance of a camera is not great
so the image you would be like this
monochrome what kind of program code you
would write to classify this as an apple
an orange in this case you have to look
at the shape or patterns or texture of
those images and then your customer
comes to you again and ask if you can do
that do the classification we state the
apples and oranges maybe you can do
classify on these images do can you do
that with writing Java code or she code
anything
these looks like mops or blue motion pin
but if you are carefully looking at some
of these images there are some sheepdogs
you know the image is at the top left or
image that he write bottom they are not
mobs they're dogs
how do you graduate these images
actually by using cloud vision API you
can get a very high accuracy on crash
buying these images in any machine
learning algorithms it's almost
impossible to get to 100% accuracy so
the accuracy would be something like the
70 80 90 95 or 98 but it cannot be a 100
passes in most cases but still the cloud
vision API does a great a decent job on
classifying these images as a dog or
horrible mob and how does it do that how
neural network works to classify these
images or any kind of data actually
neural network is not dedicated for
image classification it's a just a
function function in programming
language or mathematics so you can put
any kind of data to neural network to do
to to neural network work to solve your
problem for example if you put images of
cats and dogs you can train the function
to classify these images as a cat or dog
and you can replace these cat images the
dog images with any other data as you
want wakes up if you have a database or
whole database or my sequel database
with the customer transaction data from
the e-commerce way
side you can try you can try the combat
sauce the customer transactions into a
bunch of numbers called a vector or
matrix and use neural networks to brush
by what customers will be the premium
customers or what customers would be
here spamming or cheating customers or
the yes farmers so that is what that
could be in one example of news cases of
a new network let's see how your network
or new neural network can solve your
problem with the demonstration video so
let's take a quick look at the video
this is a demonstration called
tensorflow playground where you can
build the real neural networks inside
your browser so anyone can google google
such this is the keyword new on our what
is that tensorflow playground so anyone
can play with it so you're seeing
gradually neural network can try to wait
to transfer the data points on the 2d
space as an orange spiral or the blue
spiral so in this case you don't have to
write any program code by yourself rack
of Python or C or Java code instead what
you have to do is put more and more data
to the neural network so neural networks
tries to find what is the best way to
classify these data as an the orange
spiral or the bruise power so if you
spend like a few minutes or the one or
two minutes the neural network could be
fully trained so that it can classify
the data points into and one of those
these spirals just like we do by using
human instinct see and you can extend
this technology to solve many other kind
of the problems such as the image
recognition for example if you have a
handwritten
images hundred written text images with
28 by 28 pixel images you can whiten
those pixel data into a single vector
with 784 pixels all data and you can put
those data into the neural network
directory actually this is not a network
this is a single layer neural network so
the most simple neural network is
but still you can get a decent
recognition accuracy such as the 80% or
90% so if you trained in you're ready to
talk with this pixel this pixel data the
neural network can be trying to
determine which pixels you have to look
up to determine whether the images
should be on digit eight or digit six
which is zero and if you have more and
more layers between input data and a
player that is so-called deep neural
networks or deep learning and by doing
so you can get much much higher activity
and sometimes you can get the higher
accuracy than humans so for example in
this case you have the tens of or dozens
of the hidden layers between input data
and updater so that each neurons inside
hidden layers can be trained to
recognize simplest patterns such as ye
as you can see the patterns on the
website or the complex textures or
colors or a part of objects record nose
of a dog or the wheel in the automobile
or finally you can have the neurons that
can recognize a whole object but an
automobile or flower or wedding party
that is so-called deep neural network
and google has been using these
technologies for implementing over 100
production services and projects
including Google search and Android Maps
Gmail if we were using Google search
every day that means you are using deep
learning from Google every day because
in 2015 we have introduced introduced
rankbrain which is an algorithms based
on deep learning to determine iran king
of the search results which one should
be the first which one should be the
second now we are trying to externalise
the power of the machine learning
running on Google cloud from the Google
machine learning services from the crowd
you first a part of the product is so
good machine learning api's that doesn't
require any machine learning expertise
or the nourish you can just upload your
own images audio data or text to the API
so you will be getting the result within
a few seconds so let's take a look at a
few
example of those are the APS first we'd
like to show a video of division API
demonstration so in this demonstration
you can go to the product page e to the
- of the vision API so anyone can drop
your own images without spending any
money it's a variable free so if you
drop the shipped of images to the API
you can get the result right dog poor
dog black mama mama so let's go to the
next video
yeah we have another video this is an
example of the demonstration of the
speech API and naturally the API so if
you press button and speak to the
microphone then it can start recognizing
your voice in real time at high accuracy
just like the voice recognition you have
in the Android devices and once you got
the result you can copy and paste result
into the another API which is natural
language natural language API an API
that allows you to do many different
analysis on the text such as the entity
an arctic centimeter analytics and
syntactic analysis so by pressing the
button you can get the result of the
entity analysis but so they can extract
the announced or product names or the
company name from the your result or
centimeter narratives whether the same
statement is saying anything positive or
negative or syntactic analysis which are
the part of the text of each was now
both G active so you don't have to hire
expensive that you're wrong is
processing researchers or data scientist
you can just use the API so diversity
machine running API that requires no
machine learning expertise you can just
start using aps from today but sometimes
you want to customize the machine
learning or neural network models by
yourself by using your own data
specially designed for your for solving
Europe the business model so that is to
solve the problem we provide tense
across which is the open source software
or machine learning Development Center
pro is the open source machine learning
development to
I used inside Google for developing any
new machine learning or API based
services and we have open source in
November to 15 that is created by the
Google brain team the benefit you could
get with tensor flow is scalability and
portability so you can start trying the
product tensorflow by using your own Mac
or Windows and the tensile Pro has the
sample course like the classifying the
handwritten text as digit that could be
run on macro or your windows because it
doesn't require any much computing
resource but you will find that the
training the neural network model or
deep running model can take so much
computing power or so a long time if you
really want to bring this solution into
production quality so that's where you
want to use GPU from any video or maybe
dozens of GB or hundreds of GPUs to do
get distributed training with
productions data but still you don't
have to change your code with cancel all
because tensorflow is designed to be
scalable so you can just copy your
tensorflow code and your training later
copied on to the cloud where we can
provide the tens or hundreds of GPUs so
so it's scalable and once you have
finished training your model you can
copy the model it's just some and tens
of megabytes of data or maybe hundreds
of megabytes potater you can copy that
data the model to the smaller devices
such as mobile phones or embedded
systems or Raspberry Pi
where you can learn tensive role is
which principle of light to run your
training model to solve your problem
with smart phones or the MVD systems in
your factories or any environment where
you cannot get any internet connection
so with those benefits control getting
the popularity in the open-source
industry that is the most popular flame
up for deep learnings in the world and
the many largest companies
enterprises and startups and even
individuals are starting to use
tensorflow to build PLC's or production
systems such as airbus arm Dropbox Intel
Ivy
the Twitter sauce company is a really
deep origins of role in the earth
systems and even the cucumber farmer in
Japan has has been using cancer for all
I have taken these pictures by myself
about one a half years ago and there are
three farmers in the picture the one guy
in the middle he has parents who has
been doing a cucumber farming for a long
time and he started helping his parents
cucumber farming 3 years ago and he
found that the most tedious task
time-consuming task for cucumber farmers
is classifying the cucumber's into nine
different classes at high accuracy his
mother spent eight hours a day for just
four crash bang cucumbers thousands of
cucumbers and she didn't wanted to help
that so instead he downloaded 10 people
and built his own tenth of all basic
cucumber water so you can put the
cucumber to play so the Raspberry Pi
that learns the tensorflow can crush
five cucumber into nine different
classes and he builds this robotics by
himself and it costed only $1,500 so you
don't have to you know pay like a
millions of dollars to the systems
integrator to build this kind of in high
quality high accuracy imagery cleansing
system you can just have a just an
individual you know the farmer who are
enthusiastic about the blanket running -
for solving their problems okay so that
is the blooming of the tensorflow
community and ecosystem right now we are
having but if you want to bring the
technology and tensorflow into
production to solve your own enterprise
problem there are some problems you will
be seeing there are three problems you
have to have the large data set large
training data set to train a neural
network model that is actually one of
the downside of using deep learning keep
running requires many the training
dataset and you have to build a good
model on a floor maybe sometimes you
have to hire data scientists do that but
the largest problem is the lots of
computing
you need to buy more GPUs to do the
DeRita schedules to be training to bring
the technology into production so that
that is the reason why we provide the
Google cloud as a solution for the data
scientists and machine learning uses we
call our data center at the data center
as a computer that means it's not just a
bunch of machines in a building it's a
massively parallel computers so you can
with the yeah the networks and meter
reads so any software engineers at
Google can learn his or her a program
called applications on hundreds of
machines is you know executing just one
line of the container called continuum
command so that is the reason why the
Google Cloud has selected differentiated
from the other cloud so what will be the
result when you learn the attention flow
on the large scale distributed training
environment on Google cloud the result
is much much shorter training time like
a 40 times fatter or sometimes 300 times
faster than the other developers right
now if you are trying to use the deep
learnings you have to spend like a few
days or some some people spending few
weeks to finish their training with
production training data but for Google
engineers you have to only spend a tens
of minutes like a lunch time if you go
to the lunch and going back to the
office the new training has finished
first the most important factor or the
biggest reason why Google has been so
successful on deploy on deploying
technology into production we even
design our own customized LSI or ASIC
called tensor processing unit or TPU
this is not a CPU or GPU we design our
own processor just for running sensible
or massive amount massive amount of the
matrix operations between the matrices
and vectors and now we externalizing all
the power of the cloud that last
integral as a product called ml engine
or machine learning engine so you don't
have to take care
of all the GPU instances or GPU
instances by yourself all you have to do
is try a tenth of roll and they applaud
your chance of record to the ml ranging
with your training data and data and
Google take care takes care of the
audiogram an intimate or failure
management everything and also we
provide the hyper parameter tuning so
that allows you to shorten the training
time much much shorter so let's take a
look at the some real-world example huh
of the customers who are already using
control + ml ranging sorry the company
rec Airbus AXA SME Fiji isn't the mega
Banff in Japan Coca Cola's it has been
using tensorflow for solving the real
problem this is a project called global
fishing watch that is a project for
preventing overfishing and the project
is collecting over 200 thousands of the
vessels and the GPS they're tracking the
GPS position of the two hundred thousand
vessels in real-time they have they are
collecting all the GPS positions stored
on the Google Cloud storage and using
uses the cloud dataflow to do a batch
processing and then uses the tensor
probe 2 ml engine to extract certain
patterns from the movement of those
vessels or ships in the audience so what
you get you can understand easily count
how many ships are actually to the
fishing in each ocean by looking at the
movement of the GPS positions is it
doing in trawl fishing or a longline
fishing or pass same fishing this is
another customer word using control and
the Amero engine for solving their
problem that is QP the one of the
largest food manufacturer in Japan they
were trying to find a bad potato piece
the potato block with the black color or
the bad shape but because they are using
the very high quality ingredients it's
really hard for the ER it has been
really hard for the existing imagery
Commission systems to find out the bad
potato chip so they have has been using
human workers to watch out the
the all the politically was coming on
the Barrett convinced all the day but
when they tried tensorflow
then they were able to get much much
higher accuracy than insisting services
he can kick the sound
we hug this out
it sounds like Super Mario Brothers but
it's not super mario brothers that ring
sound tells you the position of the
butter potato cubes coming on the belt
conveyers so now the human workers don't
have to watch out all the day you have
to you know to listen to the sound
pick up the butter potatoes whenever you
hear the sound so it's much much like
weight task and so that they were able
to reduce the cost of the human
operators significantly lastly I'd like
to show the augment case Auckland is the
largest a Ustica real-time auction
provider in Japan there are handling
over five million cars every year but
the largest challenges order the users
Bagheera's are used to adidas is
classifying those images for each car
for every each car you want to enter
into the auction you have to take 20
different images from front or side or
back or the part of car rack of wheels
steering wheels tires and put the tags
or labels on each images and for that
takes over 15 minutes or 20 minutes by
human operators so that they tried using
control and ma ranging to build zero the
customized image classifier for the new
stickers so they have used the inception
version 3 model with the transfer
learning techniques so that they were
able to reduce the number of the
photographs or images to train the model
pose for each car model you only have to
have 200 images for each car model to
classify those cars at high accuracy and
also they were able to use the machine
learning engine or m/l ranging to speed
up the training time significantly they
were able to get the 86 times faster
training time so and the result for the
business is much much shorter operating
attack so they were able to shorten the
operation time or enter the car into the
auction from 15 minutes to 3 minutes so
let's take a look at the video so this
is the actual systems so you are you can
upload 20 different images or a car
from front or aside or tires or part
with cars and then these systems that
crash find these images but important
point of this project is that the object
didn't have any expertise on machine
learning or the planning well then when
they started this project so they were
able to find the best partner from the
community of tensorflow in Japan so they
spend three or four weeks with the
expert in the community so they were
able to learn how to build the
production quality system with deep
learning intensive roll and now this
system is deployed in the production
environment from last December by only
by the idea engineers in the Auklet the
subsidiary so a summary we provide two
different solutions the first solution
is the MRAPs
you can start using those ABS from now
so because it doesn't require any
machine Vanek's but is you can just
upload your images audio another
solution is tensorflow
and the various clouds the products that
provides the one-stop ma resolutions or
to build your customized machine
learning solutions so Tesla works with
the other cloud products such as the
crud dataflow ml ranging bigquery crowd
switch to build a whole solutions and of
course you can instill continued use the
year is industry standard - such as
numpy or sake dryer or bad prop B so
that's it thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
