LALIT SINGH: Hello, everyone.
I'm at GGD India 2017.
And with me I have
Sarah Clark, who's
a program manager at Google.
Hi, Sarah.
How are you doing?
SARAH CLARK: I'm doing great.
I'm having a lot of fun.
LALIT SINGH: Great.
Can you tell us your
experience so far at GDD India?
SARAH CLARK: So
because a lot of people
saw me teaching PWA
on YouTube, they've
all been coming up
and asking for selfies
and talking about the class.
And it's been really cool.
And it's been just a great
time teaching here, and being
on the stage, and getting
to help people out,
and getting to know people.
LALIT SINGH: That's great.
So I heard that
you and your team
did a few of the code labs.
Can you talk about those?
SARAH CLARK: Yeah, we
taught three code labs.
We taught how to work
with data offline.
We taught how to use PWA
and Workbox and PWA and Amp.
These are all on
codelabs.developers.google.com.
And they've also been recorded.
They're going up on YouTube.
So if you weren't
here, don't worry.
It's all there.
LALIT SINGH: Sounds great.
So can you tell us
why PWA for India?
SARAH CLARK: So PWA
uses very little data
and works offline,
which is perfect
if your only Wi-Fi is a cab
or the office or the train
station.
You can start doing
something there.
It uses very little time
to get onto your device.
And then you can keep
working anywhere.
LALIT SINGH: Wow.
That sounds really great.
So I have heard about this
new certification coming up.
That is MWS.
SARAH CLARK: So that's
the Mobile Web Specialist
certification, and
it's designed to help
people find really good jobs.
This is basically a degree
that a lot of hiring managers
are starting to recognize
as meaning something.
LALIT SINGH: Do
you have anything
to say for our
Indian developers?
SARAH CLARK: So there's a
lot of really good news.
We just announced
130,000 scholarships--
LALIT SINGH: Wow.
SARAH CLARK: --here in India
for Udacity and Pluralsight.
Yeah, it's a lot.
LALIT SINGH: Yeah.
SARAH CLARK: It's the most
we've done in any one place.
LALIT SINGH: That's great.
SARAH CLARK: And all the
details are on developers.googl
e.com/training/programs/India.
LALIT SINGH: Thank you, Sarah.
SARAH CLARK: You're welcome.
LALIT SINGH: So that was
Sarah Clark at GDD India 2017.
