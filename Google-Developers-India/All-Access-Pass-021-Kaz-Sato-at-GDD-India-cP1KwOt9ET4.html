VAIBHAVI DESAI: Hi, friends.
We are here at Google
Developer Days India.
And we have with us Kaz
from Google Cloud team
to share his experience.
So, Kaz, how has been
your experience so far
with GDD India?
KAZ SATO: I'm so
excited to be here
as a speaker of the sessions.
And I get the heat from
the Indian developers,
and so exciting.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: Super nice.
Tell us more about
the next sessions
coming up in GDD India.
KAZ SATO: I and Anitha, we have
a session called Android Meets
TensorFlow, which
is all about how
we can bring the power of
machine learning into smaller
devices, such as
smartphones, iOS, or Android,
and as well as the embedded
systems like Raspberry Pi.
So we have announced
a new product
called TensorFlow Lite, which
is a lightweight, smaller
version of the TensorFlow.
That brings you the power
of [INAUDIBLE] [? running ?]
right into your smartphone.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: Super nice.
Android with TensorFlow.
One more question, Kaz.
For the people who want to take
a start in machine learning,
which are the right
resources that you
would suggest to refer?
KAZ SATO: Yeah.
Maybe a first step is to
access TensorFlow.org,
where we have lots of video
tutorials and materials,
where you can learn the
basics about machine learning.
And also, we have
many codelabs on the
codelab.developers.google.com.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: Super nice.
Thanks a lot, Kaz,
for joining us today.
Thank you, folks.
KAZ SATO: Thank you.
