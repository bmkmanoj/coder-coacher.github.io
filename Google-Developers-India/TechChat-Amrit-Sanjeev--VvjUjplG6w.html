Google my primary job is to kind of work
with a flash partner and work on
technical integration and work with the
product team to improve our products
which a developer facing I regularly
writes often we I'm part of the
engineering ladder so yes we are
expected to be hands-on with code right
so do you luck worry oh yes yes I'm very
much in love with tooling I still do it
regularly but I thought up very early I
was about 12 or 13 when I started coding
and it was always fun for me my wrote
more code and I played games I guess at
that eight oh it was little always fun
for me a cage of trap yeah I started off
pretty early a good mentor so that's the
way I would put it or with which
programming language you really might a
cc that's the mother of planning ERISA
she was where I start of it well I went
on to do my engineering and after that I
started working in a start-up and then
moved to IBM so I guess it was a logical
progression for me after engineering to
kind of take up a job which paid for it
I wanted to software engineering job
itself and which was particularly in
coding where I I found I felt more
comfortable so I just went ahead to do
that if somebody is to design a social
app in which a leas participant needs to
search and opening so the first step
would be to identify a problem that you
want to solve in the community which
that community would accept as a value
add to them and then use an app as a
medium through which the solution can be
delivered to them so I define a problem
would be the first step for me but
gathering that data will give you
insights which will help you define that
pain point really really well because
you are not that audience if you are not
part of that community it's very
difficult for you to kind of understand
the pain point of the community and be
in that shoe so it is best that you
interview people who are in that
situation and then get the data to
decide on the problem jacket so that was
it sorry for you thank you for Emily for
your time we were honored to have you
here it was fun there was one too
thanks doc oh sorry that wasn't allowed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
