Aldo he is distinguished software
engineer at Google Roberto works on
computational advertising he has been
actively involved as program chair for
various conferences such as WS TMI ctmc
IDT tab data and many more Roberto has
been at Google for over 12 years before
which he was at IBM Almaden Research
Center he got his PhD from University of
Texas at Austin and graduated from MIT
before that please welcome Robert thanks
for being here thanks for the intro oh I
guess I need to update my bio because I
actually work on G suite search and
intelligence these days after a very
long stint in a search advertising and
so that's what I'm here to tell you
about today but this is good okay so
that's what I'm here to talk to you a
little bit more about today about what
we do in sort of why the problems I
think are really interesting to ml and
AI practitioners by the way I'm another
one of these research scientist PhDs
that's kind of gone over to the dark
side and I'm now on the engineering
ladder at Google but you know that's
that's kind of for me it's a nice
balance of getting to do deep science
and apply it in a way that can impact
many many users so I'm sure all of you
are familiar with at least some of the
components of G suite that we have up
here on the screen what we're not only
trying to make best debrief consumer
services we're really in the market of
trying to build a comprehensive
productivity productivity suite for
organizations large small and even up to
the biggest enterprises so this involves
not only collaboration communication but
special collaboration tools such as I
don't know if you've seen our jam board
product it's actually really cool it's a
meeting room kind of kind of tool but
also all the way down to you know the
nitty gritty CIO and IT department
functionalities around compliance
identity mobility access and so on but
we're not going to talk about all that
I'm going to talk about one thing that I
really think is important for tying all
these surfaces together and that's
search and that's the half of what my
org is up to in building search across G
suite that's intuitive and engaging
some people think searches are solve
problem we've been working on
information retrieval web information
retrieval and so on for for many many
years now but if you look at kind of you
know these are just stats we just pulled
off the public web these are not Google
that Google members by the way but you
know I think it's common across many of
your organizations and educational
institutions as well in looking around
for information on an awful lot even
worse you might be recreating
information because you weren't unable
to find it so we can make people much
more effective I think by addressing
search at a more deep level this is a
Google presentation we have to talk
about scale I think this number was
published a little over a year ago we
surpassed two trillion documents within
drive thank you to be exact stat on
emails but it's roughly an order of
magnitude more a number of emails and we
have Docs and drive so this is this is
pretty much web scale data right this is
not a trivial amount of stuff we need to
process query volumes are not quite web
scale but still quite large the point I
really want to make on this slide though
is the following that roughly half of
the searches we're saying coming into
our G suite search bars are from what we
call enterprise use non-consumer uses
non gmail.com accounts even though
they're dwarfed by the number of
consumer users consumer users are over 1
billion our enterprise users that we
have healthy user base but it's nowhere
near in that lead yet they're searching
an awful lot so that kind of reinforces
that slide I had earlier that we have a
lot of work to do I think and being able
to save time and people that are
searching in these Enterprise Zones um
so we recognize that when you're
searching you're not always looking just
for content in G suite organizations
have data and multiple repositories from
other software as a service to other
public clouds even on Prem data sources
and so we recognize that we're sort of
we're taking a stab at solving this
problem with our cloud search product
and basically what we're trying to do is
we're transitioning from simply an app
search tool to one that provides com
pensive an enterprise search as well as
intelligence which I started getting
into later on in this presentation one
thing I did want to talk about many of
you are probably aware of these
differences but surprisingly many people
are not and it goes back to my point
that search is not a solved problem just
because we're really good at it on the
web there are some distinct aspects that
require different solutions the most
important of which is this private
corpus issue right webs all public
everyone can look at it everyone can see
the same set of documents it simplifies
the problem great wait also if you look
at metrics they differ considerably
I mean maybe subtly is a better way of
putting that on the web we're really all
about climbing of that right piece of
information in the enterprise space what
we find is people you search as
bookmarking right you know we release
the sophisticated label functionality in
Gmail a lot of people just dump their
stuff in their inbox and they use search
to find their documents right this means
recall is a much more important metric
than it is possibly in web search if I'm
looking for that one email that one
document that I need to present to my
manager I'd better be able to find it so
you can't have things such as incomplete
indices or even poor quality search
which won't let me get it when I really
really need it signals are very very
different as well and Webster do rely on
clicks things like anchor text link
information we have deep page quality
signals we can get human reader feedback
in the enterprise search domain we look
more at things like freshness recent
access affinities and so on and I'm
gonna get a little more into that here
and this is where the challenges come
from an enterprise search the web you
know Google kind of revolutionized
Webster's by looking at this rich link
information that the global population
had built up over these web pages and
then we moved into looking at anchor
text to annotate these documents with
additional metadata and provided this
really great ecosystem for delivering
amazing results we have little if any of
that kind of information within the
enterprise yes there's a little bit of
it in your intranet your public internet
but you know when you're typing up a
document you might have a few links in
it that's gonna
at the top of your mind and certainly
not on top of your mind when you're
writing emails limited clicking query
stream data from which to learn I
already notice the volume of queries
though it's still quite large is much
smaller than we have on the web but one
little thing which I'll get to later is
even though it's still quite large we
can't always use it in aggregate we
can't really use a Google comms click
stream to help say you know some
software semiconductor industries
performance because of these contractual
obligations and similarly we can't even
look at the data our search ax search
quality engineers and experts are kind
of operating blind whereas it the web
you can do side by sides right and
things like that so this is incredibly
challenging but there's ways around it
and I'll be getting that too later in my
talk another critical difference is
unique terminologies um maybe our you
know Google's terminology is no longer
so on unique any of these terms are
actually known quite well outside Google
now um but at one time these were
internal project names which you know
something like Dremel which is our our
data analytics platform within Google if
you search for in the public web you
know you're probably looking for the
rotary tool of the same brand man not
the analytics system which you'd be much
more inclined to find within the Google
Enterprise um so again it's not all doom
and gloom there's actually some really
interesting unique opportunities
particularly as AI and ML practitioners
one thing I think that I found really
nice about working on Enterprise Search
is there's this lack of adversarial
actors we don't have to hire a huge team
the fight click spam blackhat search
engine optimization query spam and so on
the click data we get is really quite
pristine if we do have a click spam or
clickbait problem you know you can solve
that by getting rid of the people that
are involved in that this means click
based metrics substitutes meaning
reciprocal rank and click-through rate
are far more indicative of quality and
we've done studies like this right the
data we can look at namely google.com
public documents we'll look at things
such as these metrics and how they
correlate with the human eval ratings
it's actually quite good so even though
we can't look at the data we can make
some
good progress for this kind of thing and
as machine learning people that's great
we don't need to rely on humans we can
provide pure lead and clicks we can
apply things like learning your rank we
have some papers on this one recently
and wisdom 2017 and and stuff works
pretty well um but we can do even better
I think this is really the ace in the
hole here is that at least for Google's
productivity suite it's a hundred
percent in the cloud we have a rich
understanding of how users interact with
G suite and all the objects within it so
we don't have explicit link data but we
have implicit relationships between data
that getting be inferred simply by
observing the way Google employees
interact with them so given that one
important point is why do we even have
to search most the time we know what
users needs can we deliver that
information before they even have to go
and open up a new pane and start
browsing results um the answer is yes in
some cases of course and we've launched
some projects to that end those of you
who use Google Drive are probably
familiar with the top bar of results
where we try to anticipate the file
you're looking for it that given moment
we've also recently expanded quick
access into Docs and you can see this as
a general feature deliver me that's
information I'm looking for where I am
in my flow don't make me go somewhere
else to go look for it um so how does
this work well it's a machine learning
model of course um but there's actually
a really good baseline and that's most
recently used in fact before quick
access was launched my pattern of using
drive as I'd go straight to that home
page I click on the recent folder and
then usually what I was looking for was
somewhere in there I might have to
scroll a little bit or I might have to
search within it but then I find it um
so that's our baseline is it's actually
not bad the results I'm presenting here
are kind of version one of our system
it's described in this paper and ktd
2017 it's actually a fairly simple model
just a handful of features it's looking
primarily at your drive activity not
your activity elsewhere on the G suite
nevertheless we see pretty impressive
gains over this mru strategy which again
is a reasonable baseline most
interestingly to note the more activity
a user has the better we can do not
fairly surprising but you know you can
sense it this is a singing them in my
talk why is this important to deliver
well you know we've measured the time
savings of each hit it's around fifty
percent and so we really are making a
difference at streamlining folks
workflow within the enterprise and again
this is version one we're bringing more
signals into the system more
sophisticated modeling it's just gonna
get better so just wanted to remind
folks that there is a paper that covers
all not only the modeling aspects but
these other challenges I think that
prabhakar already touched upon in being
able to get a production system out that
actually does satisfy user needs not
gonna dive into that Center how many
time but it's out there if you want to
take a look
I created this slide completely
independently Abubakar it's kind of the
same point that he was making if you
take a little step back and what we're
trying to do with search and some of
this finding is we're trying to how to
make much of this mundane tasks that
occupy a lot of your time so yeah we're
we're far on this side of the spectrum
trying to push into this direction
enabling folks to not only become more
productive and save time but it make
your team more efficient and ultimately
we'd like to allow you to create things
that you hadn't been able to create the
floor and a long way to go but that's
kind of the mission of my organization
so how are we attacking this problem
we've decided to focus on three primary
areas we worked with them you know our
product managers and our user experience
researchers to identify where people are
spending their time beyond searching
which we already know and not
surprisingly people in larger or even
small organizations spend a lot of time
reading and writing emails Docs forms
etc and of course the dreaded spending
lots of time not only in meetings but
preparing for meetings and doing
follow-ups for meetings so these are
sort of the cat 3 cat very high level
categories we're looking at obviously I
can't provide too many details of what
we're doing even though I think maybe
you are all under and yeah but just to
give you a little idea of the types of
things that we want to look at is in the
area of reading we can simplify text
right lots of people are very verbose or
are telling me things I
already want to know now if G sweet
knows what I know and what I don't know
it should be being able to do a very
good job distilling the important
information and we can since we already
do that in snippets right when you do
search we try to pull out the relevant
piece of information often you don't
even need to click on the result if
we're doing a good job okay so now that
we can help you understand text perhaps
we can actually just go all the way to
giving you an answer instead of
requiring you to read it so that's kind
of a next step ultimately once I've been
reading something I often have to take
action after I read that and so perhaps
we can anticipate those actions such as
scheduled meetings for you capture
action items tasks and so on in the
writing space some assistive reply
sorry smart reply which pravakar talked
about at length is just about one
example right sir so the tip of the
iceberg if we can write a small email
for you
I can't be write longer the emails right
technology is getting better we're
getting smarter in general there's
probably lots of other ways we can speed
data entry I think Rebecca mentioned you
can think of smart replies kind of
bigger buttons that let you type faster
sounds lots of things you can do there
we've innovated a lot on Android with
autocomplete and so on I think we're
just getting and voice entry is another
area right lots of things if you do and
we want to help you write better as well
by correcting mistakes we already do
this with things like spelling
correction there's lots of other writing
errors that are very common and probably
very trivial to to automate and and
furthermore you know when you're writing
again a lot of times you have to go
search up look up relevant information
to prove you know what you're talking
about why can't my head indoor do that
for me
complete names for me bring up facts
relevant bits and so on finally and you
know this slide deck is a case study in
the final bullet itself help me make my
documents and slides look better this
deck was a wreck about twelve hours ago
and you know violent and meha gave me
some great feedback and I don't know if
he talks here but they all kind of
jumped in you know bail me out there
have been a lot easier you know the tool
would have done that for me meetings I
don't need to say a whole lot about this
I think everyone knows
you know scheduling preparing and
executing meetings is a pain but we've
done some interesting things already for
one we just launched this at meet bot in
our new enterprise chat tool hangouts
chat one of our many chat tools
this one's intended for enterprise users
you can interact with the apni baat sa
schedule a meeting between me and my
back and my manager sometime within the
next week preferably in the morning I
mean things like that you can have a
psyche negotiation it's not just sort of
a one fire off and hope it works it
really is kind of an MLP oriented bot
where we're sort of starting to test the
waters and what can be delivered through
chat based assistance preparing for
meetings this is a cloud search snapshot
we actually do deliver a card that kind
of highlights the documents you might
want to be aware of the people that are
going to be in the meeting in case you
don't know some of them so you can look
through details and so on again little
stab the problems of automating the
mundane but we can clearly I think you
know use your imagination there's with
some pretty other interesting ways you
can take this and then we have an
interesting opportunity for expanding on
our meeting hardware we've got some
fairly low cost B hardware that makes it
super easy to start presentations with
people both within your immediate room
as well as is remotely lots of things we
can do there is wrong okay so how do we
make all this work I touched on some of
the challenges specifically you know
data compartmentalization lack of click
streams and so on the way we addressed
this is through you know what I call
layered modeling it's not necessarily
purely implemented in the way of
explicit layering a models sometimes we
do that sometimes this is more
figurative but the bottom line is we
usually start with some base model for
example that we've got from web search
since there's so much data on the web
you really want to see if you can
leverage it through some of these others
spell correction is a great example
right we've done a lot of work on spell
correction in the web you would think
you should be able to leverage that
within gee speed surface as well and
indeed you can but if you just ply it as
is it doesn't work that well but you
really have to do is start them looking
at the individual surfaces and start
tailoring that model for those surfaces
again you can either do invite
listen layering anyone on top of it or
by adapting it in some way
things like transfer learning there's
kind of a variety of techniques you can
use to do this
I mentioned that enterprise and consumer
needs are really different but the data
volumes are such that on consumer it's
much bigger so if you train a model
independent of consumer and enterprise
delineations you'll typically get a
model that works far better for
consumers than you do for the enterprise
users so this is another important
distinction we get again add another
layer to the modeling problem results
get better especially for these
high-value users even within the
enterprise already mentioned entities
very different across different
organizations particularly in different
industries if we can model those on a
per vendor price basis we can deliver
better search results that are into
intelligence features and so on and
again coming back to user
personalization if you can do a user
specific model then you can really start
doing some interesting things but you
don't need again you don't need to
actually create explicit models for that
another way to do personalization is
just to have a representation of the
user what the users been doing not only
in the short-term and by the way we want
this day to be incredibly fresh is the
more recently user activity the far more
powerful it tends to do but
understanding more long term interests
as well turns out to be very very very
powerful too so we have this
infrastructure in place where we were
building sort of cross sweet profiles
that we can then feed into these search
and intelligence features and I am
already out of time do you think we have
time for questions or wonderful um but
this is my wrap-up slide you know
there's anything I want you to take home
it's that Enterprise Search is a is a is
a unique problem area from web search
with lots of interesting problems that
remain unsolved and open and
opportunities abound for delivering
intelligence across all of G suite not
only for searching and finding but for
some of these other deep use cases going
beyond data my name a bit mundane and to
achieving really creative processes with
your with these workers and of course ml
NL Pai other technologies you know this
is absolutely required to get this stuff
to work yes there's a lot of important
work to be done
the engineering side as well but as the
Bhakra noted if you don't have the right
metrics and you're not optimizing the
right metrics I mean that's you know
those are table stakes right there so
that's it thank you I am sorry but
acharya for my i wanted to ask you build
these models for different these apps
right so gmail scholar blah blah blah so
so I guess you your models borrow in you
know information from each other right
so there's a correlation right so do you
do that automatically or are there any
thoughts on doing that automatically are
do you it would be nice if we were at
the point where we did do that
automatically we're not there yet
and I think you for instance if you read
the quick access paper you know version
one was pretty much just drive activity
data we're in this phase of building out
to do much more integrated understanding
across the suite and that's kind of the
purpose of my org actually is to think
about it at a higher level and make
stuff work together better so you're
absolutely right it would be great if
this could be automated is the types of
things that we're working towards but we
stopped some work to do there to be
completely honest you mentioned that
every organization has its own
terminology have you ever considered
helping an organization build its own
ontology some kind of structure on the
concepts and also possibly rules to
support such yes that is absolutely how
we're working to bootstrap some of these
efforts to see whether we can have
engaged you know administrators or
deployment services to perhaps provide
glossaries point us to where the facts
are and you know epic hues are and so on
and we do find that to be quite useful
once you've got something to bootstrap
um then you can start getting some
feedback from the click data and so on
and improve from there I can't say we've
got it completely solved yet but we are
kind of exploring in those directions
yep see me yeah so for the ranking
models do you do
this layered modeling so you mentioned
so starting to yeah I think the ranking
model I don't remember if it's in that
paper I think the one in that paper is
fairly generic but we are doing trying
to see if we can apply transfer learning
types of technologies to infer things
across some you know consumer to Gmail
to web and so on so that's one of the
approaches we're taking but I think we
also do very explicit in the enterprise
side sometimes we'll do it I said a
completely separate model sometimes it's
better alone or sometimes you can
ensemble it with the global model that's
another way we kind of layered things so
yeah we have stuff like that that's
going on you know I think Don Metzler
and the Pointer team that he works with
they like to write papers so you know
I'm sure you'll be seeing some of those
details
Don Metzler is probably the lead search
quality guy on my team but we also work
with a bunch of folks in research
mark mark Nagy Orcs team Mike bender ski
those are the folks they usually drive
to they're in research so you know they
they want to publish they're usually the
ones that are driving but Don that's
there's a researcher at heart and as I
am that's right so yeah we obviously we
have to be a little careful in what we
disclose but you know learning the rank
is a known technique right so I'm not
saying anything terribly surprising
rather than yes we use it just a
question up like years ago I did some
part of search like far search server on
SharePoint one of the things that we
learned was that in enterprises its
apart from what the user wants to search
it's not showing the user what they are
searching for but also what the
organization wants them to see so is
there some plan like that in Google
suite as well say maybe giving a higher
rank to a certain document so that
search is biased towards that and doing
stuff like that no we don't do anything
like that that's that's interesting we
really are just trying to provide the
right document
for the user at the right time perhaps
you know what organizations want their
users to see naturally bubbles up anyway
as it gets shared more widely and gets
interacted with more lively so perhaps
it happens kind of on its own but we're
certainly not explicitly trying to
provide anything that better that
accomplishes that that's interesting we
don't do anything like that in G suite
that maybe have them maybe for as we
move into cloud search 3p though that
really is an important requirement for
organizations we haven't received that
feedback yet but we're just and we're in
early Developer Preview with some of
this stuff right now well there are more
questions I have a question to you
Robert so enterprise as you mentioned
there are relationships between people
and I'm just wondering what's the
predictive value of those relationships
versus the content in general like how
much are those used as features in a
variety of things whether it's right I'd
say that's probably the second most
important relationships beyond what's
already in the document that you're
looking for definitely you know we use
it in Gmail for recommending you start
typing a name there's you know there are
a lot of roberto's but you know there's
probably more up jonn's and so on and
you know using those affinities to
recommend the proper ones is incredibly
important just but one example certainly
in my quick access it looks at the users
you the sharing lists and things like
that so yes absolutely folks you work
with the folks you share with you can
find some really interesting insights we
actually have a really cool feature in a
cloud search called forget what it's
called but what it tries to do is
identify documents that you should be
aware of it knows you haven't opened
them but it knows that people that you
have affinities to are really really
active with it and that feature I think
is really cool we haven't quite figure
out the exact right place
if your cloud search user you can see
ahead cloudsearch homepage occasionally
but yeah I think it's really cool I
don't know if it's really providing one
last question sorry yeah go ahead please
sorry let me give you the mic and if you
don't mind in all Q&amp;amp;A if you can say
where you're from yeah yeah I'm Priyanka
from IBM India lab and we're working a
lot on this have worked a lot on the
same Enterprise Search so what do you
know from your experience that since you
said the data is limited and there's not
like when you go to a new enterprises
lot of new terminology that comes in and
to me knowledge that comes in so did you
experience for that and how did work in
your experience yeah no we haven't
gotten there yet
okay that's certainly an interesting
area I can't say we've made too much
progress yeah a lot of this work is
quite early
okay thanks again Roberto thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
