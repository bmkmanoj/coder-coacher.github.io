human hm today who is the Google
developer expert for web technologies
how did you get into coding when I was
13 I I got my first computer and though
at those times we had dial-up so you
know the engineer came and pulled in a
line and he kept the modem there and
said in the installation would be done
tomorrow but I couldn't wait so I got a
like to open up the system and put in
the modem and here - that beautiful
music and then connect to the web and
slowly loaded the Google page right so
that was the most exciting moment of my
life
on on the browser till date Java was my
first language of love and then I did a
lot of Python and Perl and my first job
was on Ruby on Rails so that that has
been my journey so we've heard this word
many times open source what does it mean
let me give you a simple example like
say suppose you have an old recipe like
bisi bele bhath right or or the Samba
that goes with idli like who did it
first who who did take the patent for a
sambar or AB is available right they
didn't really they kind of made it make
animated if you make it free and open to
share the recipe with others and people
modified the recipe and they made better
missable a BOTS or they added some some
curd to it and made a different version
of miscibility path right that's how I
see code like me India India's has that
culture of free and openness from a very
long time and we need to adopt that in
our code and we do have licensing and
you could talk a lot about that but the
whole crux of this is to have free and
open court so things like this are my
core fundamental values you have been
contributing a lot in open-source so how
do you keep the pace with your full-time
work and your passion work you know half
of the time in my work I spend on
open-source but don't tell my manager
right I'm just joking
part is you just get used to it it's
more like your morning routine right you
wake up and you don't ask people like
how do you get time to take a shower or
brush lady right so it once it becomes
an habit it doesn't really feel that
you're like putting an extra effort to
contribute to open source so if I want
to become a Google developer expert how
should I get started yeah the fun part
with being a Google developer expert is
there is no hard and fast rule or an
agenda that hey these are the parameters
that you need to have to become a
Google developer expert my point of view
is like contribute more to this society
maybe communities or open sewers and
blocks and experiment a lot on bleeding
edge tech and talk about it tell to
people like maybe write an article or
tweet about it and make a joke and
things like that that's what I have been
doing Thank You Himmel for joining us
today
it was a wonderful discussion to all the
viewers out there if you have any
questions feel free to comment below and
we hope that Haman's would answer them
I'll try my best to all the viewers out
there if you have any questions feel
free to comment below and we would try
okay and we hope that humans would
answer them and we hope that humans
would answer them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
