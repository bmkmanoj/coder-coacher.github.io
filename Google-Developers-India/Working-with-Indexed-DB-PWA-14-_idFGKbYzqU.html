database sometimes for your application
something to store some dynamic data and
indexdb is what we get now with
progressive web apps there is an older
database called web SQL but for some
long reasons that if you really wanted
to oh come ask me over lunch was
deprecated in favor of indexdb so
sometimes you need is the database to
store some data and here's a quick
example this is from one of the Google
samples of the four beetles so name
nickname age and whether or not they're
alive and it's a table and I could sort
it based on the different attributes
yeah the different columns on the table
but indexdb is not what you might expect
from a database so how many of you or
you have used SQL database okay how many
of you have used a no sequel database
okay this is a no sequel database so
it's not relational it's not really even
tables it's a set of object stores which
an object store is just a collection of
JavaScript objects they don't all have
to be in the same format although it's
an awfully good idea to keep them pretty
similar to each other just researching
and sorting and you can stick any
javascript object files blobs whatever
you need to stick in there so we talked
about yesterday one idea was if you're
doing video you could actually download
the individual chunks of video and stick
them in the database and then use a
media source extensions to read the
database and stream that into your
destination you can write down by itself
to the database without using the object
store but normally you should contain
them in object stores
so the example that we show the start
musicians so each object does get an
internal ID number you don't normally
have access to it although you can ask
the database using a special key to get
at it normally though this is hidden
from you then you can declare it one of
the columns a key and give it a key path
so that means that I could search and
sort on this one I can have multiple
keys but normally it's one keeper so I
do actually sorry it's got multiple
indexes but it's one keeper data per
object store so my key is the name and
then I insert the value and the values
are just standard JavaScript objects
okay so index DB by itself is kind of a
pain to program when it was built it was
built we didn't have promises yet so it
was actually built using events and
callbacks because they're all
asynchronous operations and writing
index DB code with all of those could be
really challenging you write a lot of
event handlers you write a lot of
callbacks so this is the one time where
we completely recommend using a library
instead and it's called index DB
promised Jake Archibald who worked on
the serviceworker spec wrote this little
wrapper library so it wraps index DB and
promises it just makes it drastically
simpler to use there's one place where
you won't use promises and it's at the
very start but let me show that to you
so we're going to open the database
first give it a name and a version
number and that version number should
increment any time you change the schema
that's so that should be tied to a
schema and then you need to pass in a
function call
that's the upgrade callback so let's do
a datastore okay so we're going to call
ID be open we'll call this test database
version 1 give it the upgrade database
function which is the callback so the
database contains multiple object stores
this function when you open the database
it's job is to look at the structure of
the database and make any changes needed
to make it current
that might mean creating new object
stores now you could call create object
store directly but if an object store
already exists you'll get an exception
the whole thing is going to fail yeah
it's no fun so instead we do a quick
check make sure that object store names
does not contain that object store so
make sure we don't have it already and
if we don't good and create it so you
can create object store if you need a
primary key you can create it with a key
path if you can also create an object
store and tell it to auto increment
which gives you an automatic serial
number but you don't have to wrecked
access to that or you can give it a key
path and an auto increment now you have
a property added to every object that's
an incrementing unique number then to
add indexes because you want to be able
to search and sort on this on probably
more than just the key come on you call
create index you tell it the name of the
index the name of the field you want to
index so they don't have to be identical
and in this case is that a unique value
or not so unique will be used if you do
for example to replace if it's a unique
value we'll look at the email index and
replace if I do a put without email
it'll replace it if that wasn't unique I
would do a put and it would add a second
entry of that email so working with data
all the usual operations right add get
put delete get all which grabs a array
and cursor will you have a bunch of data
you could set a cursor and just start
walking through come on now indexeddb
does have one really nice thing about it
which is its transaction based so a
transaction is a wrapper around a group
of operations they either all execute
together or the databases roll back that
they don't either they all execute
together or they don't execute at all
it's not optional unfortunately
so what you have to do to do an
operation in here is get the database
object so open the database ask for a
transaction open the object store on the
transaction it's a little repent it's
gonna get a little repetitive here if
you need an index open that and then do
your operations the advantage of all of
this work though is consistency in the
database it's very hard to leave the
database in the inconsistent state so
open the database open the transaction
tell the transaction which object stores
it's going to operate on so that way it
can do appropriate locking across all of
them because remember it's non
relational database you don't have
automatic connections between tables or
stores so you have to do that yourself
and so you have to tell it all the
stores that you're going to use open the
object store you need do an action like
store dot add which will take some time
and now return transaction dot complete
in the ID be promised this returns a
promise that resolves when the
transaction is done if you are writing
native indexdb code you'd actually be
listening for an event at this point
actually be listening for to a success
or failed now to read the data open the
transaction tell it which objects store
opened the object store and call get
notice that I'm not waiting for the
transaction to complete here I'm doing
the single read operation it's either
going to succeed or fail and it happens
it triggers when the transaction does so
basically as soon as that returns you
know the transactions closed there's no
need to wait on the transaction now if I
had done store dot get made a decision
done another put you know done some
things that wrote back to the database
then I'd want to wait for the
transaction to complete for a single
gate like this you don't really need to
wait now when I look at this code right
here's an update right get something get
the transaction put it in great say
pattern you're getting the picture
people have written database code before
what seems to be missing here I'm
creating the transaction but what am I
not doing I'm not committing it right
because indexdb doesn't have a commit
call for the transaction essentially the
the mental model you should have it's
not exactly perfect but it's close
enough it's what the spec says is it the
transaction will be done by the end of
the next idle loop in the browser the
idle loop is when the browser is not
doing work and it normally starts
processing events so it'll process
transactions just like it's processing
events now depending on the browser it
may actually happen sooner than that
so in this case we might get to the end
of this block and in chrome chrome
schedules things not just with the event
loop but what are called micro tasks and
so in chrome when the micro tasks are
done then it'll go ahead and start
executing the transit the transactions
but that's even before you get to the
idle loop so what the spec promises is
by the time you get through the idle
loop your transactions will have
committed okay so if the browser crashes
the way this is written I mean if it
crashed right in the middle of the
commit if you get that unlucky maybe
you've got inconsistency in the database
but normally what's going to happen is
is that that commit is atomic and it's
designed to happen all at once
everything gets staged on the side
typically in a database now I don't know
the exact implementation here but
commits are designed to be atomic and
they're designed to be pretty resilient
to failures like that so there's no
separate way to check for
inconsistencies that I know of but
obviously you want to have your own way
of looking at your database just make
sure everything is consistent but those
kinds of sudden crashes right in the
middle of the database code you're going
to be very unlikely oh wait do I have
any sync ability between say two
databases not natively no you'd have to
add that yourself
so for deleting data looks like
everything else just call delete wait
for the transaction to be done to get
everything call get all again not
waiting for the transaction because once
we've got the data
we're good cursors are a little tricky
so this is the one place where it's
harder to do this with a promise by the
way all of these you know you can use
then and catch because it's a standard
promise we handle the errors whoops
Becca
so curses you're a little tricky mm-hmm
get the store call open cursor so now we
have a pointer to somewhere in the
database write a function in line and
this time don't make it anonymous
okay let's see if this doesn't advance
my screen give it a name all right I
need a long stick so I'm going to name
that function normally that's an
anonymous function here I need to name
it cuz I need to be able to call it I'll
call it show items it takes the cursor
if the cursor is null you're done bail
out
otherwise the data will be in cursor dot
value we can go ahead and log all those
fields and then call cursor dot continue
to advance it to the next item once it
hits the end it'll be null and then call
show items with the next cursor value so
it's a little strange but it does work
at the one place we're doing promises
makes this a little bit trickier now for
ranges I can specify a range so if I
don't want the whole database I can
specify a lower bound on the index I can
specify an upper bound or a range in
between so in this case I'm going to set
a range that calls store get all from
that range so everything from soda on up
pretty straightforward
there are polyfills and libraries we
really like indexeddb promised indexeddb
shim is interesting local forage is
really popular around Google at least in
developer relations because it lets you
work with index DB if it's there and if
it's not it has several fall backs for
local storage including local web
storage so
a nice abstraction on the top of things
but for this lab after the purposes of
this class we're using index TB with
index DB promised and of course as
you're used to we've got a lab so index
DB lab you'll experiment basically with
the whole thing create the object
storage indexes to database operations
create retrieve update the leads grab
all the data push things into the
database and then write any experiments
that you want to write typical timing
it's about half an hour go ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
