graduate what's next for you in this

more certifications like I think in July
Google is also initiating a new program

that maybe just to give us a little bit
of sense about your development career
where did you start and where are you at

I learned Android from Android developer
website and then I make many
applications on Android for customers
for different companies one enterprise
level now I'm mentoring of you few
people dream in my office
are there any apps that you're
specifically proud of there is an
application which I made for
particularly for India in multi
languages there is a survey application
for World Bank and it's I'm very proud
of because it's very easy because of the
language they used to speak at the
application is in in that language so
I'm very proud of that when you were
thinking about career in developer were
there any influences that you had my
mother always wanted me to be a teacher
because she she is a teacher but my
brother and my father supported me to go
as Android well as a career Shalini had
a passion for building things from
childhood when I was a kid my brother
was a fan of games he used to you know
go to show up see to play games or watch
games I just you know got inspired and I
decided to do my graduation in
computer science both of us really are
wearing fired how technology was
changing when we were kids and
everything around us was changing so
fast we always thought how can we be
part of that change where do you see
yourself going in a year or two years or
five years with your career as an
Android developer Android it's like a
very very wide space if anybody new
