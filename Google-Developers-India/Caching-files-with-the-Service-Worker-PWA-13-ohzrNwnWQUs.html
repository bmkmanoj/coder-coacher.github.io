serviceworker you've done promises
you've done fetch you built a
serviceworker we've talked about very
basic caching using a simple approach
with a list of static files you've done
things with sw-precache to write a
serviceworker but what if you need to do
more complicated things what if you need
to get into the cache API directly let's
go ahead and walk through that so what
is the cache interface it's basically a
map so it's actually technically called
the caching interface it doesn't really
even have a name we'll call it the cache
API or the cache interface so you'll
hear me use the word interchangeably but
there's no real name for it so it's a
map of assets with the URL it's a map of
requests to responses so you saw it
yesterday I called cat match cache
matches handed it a request and it came
back with here's the item it matches but
let's say you want to do wild carding
for example let's double you toolbox
does wild carding how does it do it it
does it by getting all the keys and then
matching directly about you doing its
own match so typical API you might
expect so you've seen at all takes a
list of items add adds one request or a
or URL either one you can do a put with
an actual request object in a response
you can also delete a request and
there's an optional options on there you
can ask for all the keys
I opted matching a request you can call
a match with a single request to get a
single result out or you can do a match
all which will take a request and give
you everything that matches usually what
match all does is you give it a request
and it gives you everything under that
path now there is more than one cache so
self dot caches will actually have a
collection of cache objects so the rule
yesterday that we said is uninstall and
the serviceworker build the cache and
load your initial stuff on activates
when you update the
Cass you had anything new you remove
anything and on fetch you can do the
retriever cache Network a database so
this is the easiest sort of minimal way
to do things but you do need to pay
attention to this rule on install don't
delete things only only add things on
install you can delete them on activate
I think I've almost no range today so
we'll just do this so uninstall the
example of caching the application shell
so the serviceworker fires an install
event
you grab everything in the network jam
it in the cache and then you get to
activate that's a review from yesterday
really here's how we wrote it yesterday
with a couple of extra changes so listen
for the install wait until remember that
to keep things alive open the cache at
all and then here's a new one self dot
skip waiting so remember that if I have
an existing service worker and I load a
new one the new one doesn't take over
until all of the existing ones have been
all those windows or tabs have been
closed but if I call skip waiting
this forces the new service worker to
take over for everyone so a lot of times
this is much nicer than asking the user
to do a reload just do self dot skip
waiting just be aware that if the
service worker functionality has changed
dramatically you might not want to do
that because you don't may not want the
app to change his behavior suddenly
without a reload uh this is like I test
i test font here so remove outdated
caches on activate get all of the keys
and then have the current cache name and
if the key doesn't match the current
cache name so if the cache has a
different name then just go ahead and
delete it pretty simple
and then self thought clients dot claim
basically says ok I want to update all
of my clients so everything everything
in the every service worker that you're
running all your children
catch up with a current the current
cache
now with Network fallback we talked
about this yesterday grab it from the
cache get it from the network if you
can't this is what the code typically
looks like so match get the response if
I have the response return it if not do
a fresh fetch easy let's say that we
want to do they get from the network and
put a copy in the cache then you have to
do something special so each response
when you get it can only be read once
they're basically designed to be read by
a single thread at a single time and
they have a little cursor inside of them
so you can't have multiple readers on it
so what you do is before you put it in
the cache you make a copy of the
response so you clone it clone is not
special on response this is the regular
object up clone function but it'll
duplicate the internal state of the
response so that you can put it in the
cache whenever the cache gives you back
a response it's actually giving you a
clone of the original and the response
generally points to shared data in
memory that's read-only so cloning off a
response does not bloat the memory out
so on user interaction user clicks maybe
I want to go get something from the
cache so there's some people that do
like dynamic loading based on when the
user performs actions so in this case
when they click on an article first off
I'm going to block the default action
for this event I'm going to get my
article ID and then go to the server
well first going to open a cache and
give it the name of the article so let's
say that somebody selects an article
from a list maybe they favorite it and
we want to grab all of the resources for
just that article so I'm going to put
all of those resources together in a
cache that's named after the article so
that if the user ever goes in unfavorite
or I need to manage memory I can delete
that cache and make sure that I've
removed just that bundle of items so
I'll aim it after the article and then
function cache I'm going to go to the
server and say give me a list of URLs
let's
that the server can generate a list in
JSON of all of the assets required for
this page so then you take that list of
assets you unpack the JSON and then do
an add all with all the URLs that's the
recommended technique if you do a
dynamic loading is to have basically the
server generate a manifest for you and
then you initiate a pull of everything
that you need now serving from the cache
we talked about these yesterday these
different techniques and these
techniques are actually in there
actually in toolbox but the code looks
like this so a cache falling back to the
network you've seen match it return the
response or go fetch it Network falling
back to the cache ah right fetch it and
if it fetch fails
this says fetch and then catch you
actually need an instrument layer
intermediate layer in here to check ok
and if that doesn't work then go ahead
and do a caches match on the event
request cache the network example sorry
right do a fetch if we get it
pull the JSON set of global flag for
network data received otherwise check
the cache if we have it use it if we
don't have the data go ahead and update
the page because we don't want to
overwrite the existing data and
otherwise go ahead and hit the network
and the generic fallback this case is
really interesting so the last one you
do in the lab so what happens if I go to
the Service Worker maybe I'm dynamically
loading content maybe I'm pulling pages
off the web or I'm pulling products out
of an e-commerce system and somebody
goes to a URL that doesn't think that
you can't reach because you're offline
what do you do well if it's an HTML
request maybe what you do is have logic
in the serviceworker
whoops have logic in the serviceworker
that says ok
I can't reach the cash I can't reach the
network so I'm going to go to the cash
and get an alternate page that says I'm
offline here's what you can do so return
a clean page and you could do this with
HTML you could do this with JavaScript
you could do it with CSS basically you
have logic in here that says okay if I
can't find something of that type here's
some fallback objects I can load from
the cache and so that's what this would
look like if I don't have it returned
caches topmatch offline and we've
already looked at dumping the outdated
caches so there's the list of resources
and here's the lab so we're basically
going to have you build manually a lot
of this stuff you were doing the toolbox
yesterday but the interesting one is
responding network errors with an
offline page that'll be a new technique
for you so go ahead and start the fetch
web and I'll be back with you in about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
