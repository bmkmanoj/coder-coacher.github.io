MANORANJAN PADHY: Hey, there.
We are at day two of
the Google I/O 2017.
And I have Colt with me.
Hey, Colt. How are you?
COLT MCANLIS: How are you?
Doing good.
MANORANJAN PADHY: I'm good.
How is the day so far?
COLT MCANLIS: Fantastic.
It's been fantastic, moving
from the shade, to the sun,
to the shade, and
learning fantastic things
about Google I/O. It's great.
It's absolutely great.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Yeah, yeah.
It's always fun.
I have three quick questions
related to the Google Cloud
platform.
There a lot of
developers in India
who are developing
really great apps.
The problem they face sometimes
is all of them necessarily
do not have high-end machines.
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.
MANORANJAN PADHY: So
thus, Google Cloud
is a solution for them.
COLT MCANLIS: That's
a fantastic question.
So the thing that we
really like to see
is developers taking
advantage of the fact
that, in Google Cloud, you
can leverage our cloud console
to basically just go grab a
64-core, 200-gigabyte machine
and just start developing
on it, like that.
And then go find the edges
of your algorithms, prototype
what you need to do,
install what you need to do.
And when you're done, just
hit the Delete button,
and then go about your day.
It's a fantastic resource
to help developers
find the edges of
their algorithm
and get computing capacity
that they might not normally
have on a day-to-day basis.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
And this can be
done with machine having
any configuration, right?
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, absolutely.
You can pick whatever operating
system install you want
and whatever machine comes down.
You have kind of root
privilege, so you can
do some dangerous stuff there.
Don't go crazy, though.
That's the important part.
MANORANJAN PADHY: OK.
Now, moving on to people who
are doing a lot in machine
learning.
So can you say a
bit about the TPUs,
or the tensor processing
units, that we have?
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So I've got to say, this is
a little bit of home for me.
So I come from a GPU
programming background.
So things like GP, GPU, and our
TPUs are absolutely fantastic.
Here's what I like about it.
If you're interested in
getting into machine learning,
I have to recommend that
playing with TensorFlow
and working with our
TPUs on Google Cloud
is going to get you
there faster and cheaper.
Any time you can
leverage thousands
of cores that do vector
operations at billions
of instructions a second, the
problem just changes entirely.
So if you're interested in
that, check out our TensorFlow
documentation and try to
take one of the TPU machines
for a ride.
It will change the
way you look at AI.
I promise you.
MANORANJAN PADHY: The last one.
Are there any code labs, or
documents, or any guide that's
available online where
they can go any time
and have a look at it?
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, absolutely.
So if you're a
developer, and you're
interested in Google
Cloud, check out
our cloud documentation.
Just type in Google
Cloud documentation.
The tutorials and website
information we have there
is absolutely cutting-edge.
I mean, if you're
a Python developer,
you can go from knowing
nothing about Google Cloud,
not having an account,
all the way to spinning up
thousands and thousands of
cores to do your computation
in about 20 minutes.
And for someone who has no
background in cloud computing
but has some understanding of
Python, that is just beautiful.
So I highly recommend--
go there any time you can,
get that information,
get started.
MANORANJAN PADHY: And
guys, you heard him.
The links that he said,
do go and check it out.
And if you have any questions
after seeing this video,
post them in the comments
below, and we will try our best
to get those answers.
