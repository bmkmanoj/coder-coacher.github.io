please welcome on stage Parul
Soi, program manager,
developer relations team.
[APPLAUSE]
PARUL SOI: Thank you guys.
I hope you've had
a great day today.
So you might have
noticed, so far
we've focused on some
very important topics that
will help you build great apps
and design amazing experiences.
This final session is kind
of meant to round things up
by focusing on growth.
Ultimately, every
product manager's goal
is to make
data-driven decisions.
So in this session,
I'll be talking to you
about pirate metrics and
how it provides a framework
to help you launch your
app, build an audience,
and sustain it in the long run.
So before I get
into pirate metrics,
let's go through a very
typical user life cycle.
Users are acquired in
many different ways
through social media
recommendations, organic, ads.
They all play a role.
But once you acquire a user,
you've only really gotten them
to your landing page.
This could be the
Play Store page,
or it could be the home
page of your website.
What you really want
to do is to make sure
that your user experiences
a USP of your product.
In other words, you
want to activate them.
For a social media
product, it would be
to follow interests or friends.
For a game, it could be to
simply complete one level.
You want to ensure that the
user experiences your product.
But even if you've
activated your users,
it's almost an uphill
battle to retain them
and to ensure that the user
comes back to your application.
The goal for any
healthy product is
to make sure that you
find a strategy that
will help users come back, and
becomes a habit for the users.
You also want your users to
be your biggest advocates.
No acquisition strategy
works as well as
a simple word of mouth campaign.
When you get a recommendation
from a friend or a family,
you're much more likely to try
a product through just a web
search or an advertisement.
And this is a positive referral.
And ultimately, you all
want to monetize your users.
No product speak success as the
one that earns a lot of money.
Each of your user is worth
a different amount of money,
and your goal is to identify who
is worth more than the other,
and then tailor these
products so that you
can serve this audience better.
To summarize this
user life cycle,
we have the following
five stages--
acquisition, activation,
retention, referral,
and revenue.
Now take the first
letter of each of them,
and you get AARRR.
And that's the reason why
it's called pirate metrics.
So I would be taking you
through each of these strategy,
and seldom I would use an
example of a translation app.
So it's called
[? Really Friendly Chat. ?]
The USP of this app is
that you can chat and have
a conversation with a
person on the other side
even if they don't
speak the same language.
So let's see how
we use it, how we
improve pirate metrics for
[? Really Friendly Chat. ?]
The first pillar is
acquisition, and here you
want to think about
how to acquire
the right kind of users.
So we decided to come up
with three strategies.
Marketing campaigns-- we
bought ad space in web search,
and devised strategies
to optimize expense here.
We also built a great
website that people
can use to discover our app
and learn more about it.
We also decided to work
through partners so that we
can amplify the network effect.
First is advertising campaign.
So for example, if a
user searches in Google
&quot;traveling to Japan,&quot;
they'll probably
see an advertisement
that will click.
It will take them to the
home page of the website.
And because they've
come to this website
through an advertisement
about Japan,
it could be a customized
experience telling them
how their trip
can be made better
by installing this application.
If they have the app installed,
it will immediately launch it.
If it does not, then
it would take them
to the Play Store
page of the website
from where they can
install the application.
This uses dynamic links,
which makes them so special.
In fact, they maintain context
throughout the installation
process.
So in our case,
because someone came
in through the
advertisement about Japan,
they had a customized
experience.
And even if they did
not have the app,
it took them to
the Play Store page
from where they installed,
and ended up directly
chatting with someone in Japan.
You can also tie your
Firebase Analytics account
with your AdWords account to
make your acquisition strategy
smarter.
If for
[? Really Friendly Chat ?]
I'm trying to acquire
users from Spain or people
who speak Spanish, I
can import the event
from my Firebase
account of people who've
chatted in Spanish, and then
track my campaign conversions
against it to get a sense
of whether I'm acquiring
the right users or not.
You can also create custom
audience and show ads to them.
This is a great way
to re-target users
such as those who've
probably not used
your application in a while.
Maybe they've just
forgotten about it,
or haven't experienced all
the new things that you've
done in your product.
So if, for example, in
[? Really Friendly Chat, ?]
we started supporting
a new language.
We can target the
audience of people
who tried to chat in
that language before,
but did not have
the best experience.
So now you've done all this
work acquiring the users
that they will find through
partners, through ads,
through searches.
But you need to make sure
that they install the app
and experience it.
And this is the
process of activation.
Most applications that we build
have a user-based experience.
So a person needs to sign in
to the app, sign up, log in,
and then they
experience a product.
You want to make this
as easy as possible.
And for that, we have
Firebase authentication.
One of the things we've
noticed, that a lot of users
really drop out if your app has
a hostile sign in experience.
If I'm experiencing a
product for the first time,
I might not be
comfortable sharing
my name, my email address,
my phone, all the details.
Firebase authentication
has been created
keeping all this in mind.
It allows federated identity
from different providers
like Facebook, Google,
[INAUDIBLE] GitHub.
Also, we have anonymous
sign in so you
can go to the security
rules in your app
without even providing
an email address.
Another part of activation
is that you delight users
the moment they get
into your application.
This could be done by
doing various things.
For instance, customizing
the onboarding experience.
One of our star
apps, CookBook, they
used remote configuration
to optimize the onboarding
experience, and saw a 207%
increase in their user base.
Similarly for our
app, if I have users
who are coming in
from US, they could
have a very different
experience considering
with some cultural
imagery in the background.
Similarly, if they're
coming from India,
it could have a
different experience.
This helps a user connect
really well with your product.
So now we've acquired users,
and we've delighted them
with their early experiences.
But it's still not
enough to keep them.
With the amount of
competition that is usually
there between apps
and sites, your app
can really get lost in the mix.
And so you really need a very
strong retention strategy.
Firebase Cloud Messaging
helps you do that.
But notifications are great
when used properly, but can
become a nuisance when misused.
So that's why, when
notifications are driven off
by analytics, you can
do things like choosing
the right audience, choosing
the right time to send
a notification.
So you might want
to send notification
to people who, for instance,
made purchases in the past,
but haven't for some time.
So you can define it as an
audience in your console,
and then send just a discount
code to all these people who
had made purchases in the past.
Because this will get them
back into your application,
and it serves as a re-target.
With these issues,
you can really
avoid the terrible issue
of notification spam.
In one of our earlier
FCM integrations,
[INAUDIBLE] used notification
of FCM to re-target users,
and they saw 200%
conversion rate increase
and 300% open rate increase.
It's a common problem for apps,
particularly in the early days,
is that it's not formed
as a habit for the user.
So even though your app
could perform the solution
for the problem that
the user is looking for,
but it's not become a
habit, so they still
default to Google search.
You can use app indexing to help
bring back this audience back
into your app.
This works in two ways.
The first is integrating
with Google search itself.
If you have a lot of
content on the web,
you can use app
indexing so your users
see your app in
search results itself.
So one of the really popular
TV show and movie streaming
services that I use.
So the other day I wanted
to search for this new show
that I was really
looking forward to watch.
I just searched
for it in Google,
and then this app showed
right on top of the results
because I had it installed.
And when I clicked
on it, I could
go straight away into the
app and play that show.
The second strategy is
where you can index content
from your app itself.
One of the food ordering apps
does it really amazingly well.
They index the restaurants
I order frequently from so
that when I go to Google search
and perform the search for it,
the app automatically gives
me the option to get into it
and place an order.
As you all know, friends help
friends discover great apps.
Like I mentioned earlier,
there's nothing that works
as well as a really great
word of mouth strategy.
For instance, if I
saw in a recipe app
and I want to share
it with my friend,
you want to ensure that
there is as low as friction
as possible that will help
users make it very easy to share
applications around.
So we have Firebase
Invites for this.
Firebase Invites is built
on top of dynamic links.
It does not give you
an option of which
apps to use to share
your application,
but instead shows you a
list of contacts that you
can share the application with.
There is a lot of
work that has actually
been done by Google here
using machine learning
and AI that provides you
the most relevant contacts
right on the top of
the list on the basis
of your past experiences.
For example, what
are the apps that I
have shared in the
past with my friend,
and the likelihood of that
friend installing those apps?
Also, what are the
asset that other person
has on their phone?
And that's why it gets you
the most relevant contact
right on top.
So when it comes testing
our app and handling issues,
there are two real strategies.
One is getting to know
the issues beforehand,
and the other after you've
shipped your application.
And I like to put it
under the referral
because bad testing
on your app could
lead to bad reviews,
which are, in a way,
referrals from stranger.
So you might have
noticed a lot of games
that you go to the Play Store
and you read a one star review,
and you decide not
to install the app.
Which, in a way, is a bad
referral from a stranger.
Similarly, when you read
the five star review
and you realize
that it's offering
a lot of good
services, you install
the app, which is, in a way, a
good referral from a stranger.
So Cloud Test Lab is
something that you
can use to ensure that you're
performing the right test,
and your application
is performing well.
It's a collection of watcher
devices of all common types,
particularly the obscure ones
which you cannot get your hands
easily on.
If you build your
application as an API
and update it to
this data center,
you will be able to get crash
report and stack traces.
You can also design
custom test depending
on your application
and use cases,
or you can use your Robo Test.
Also very important is
to be able to handle
crashes after you've
shipped the application.
And as you all know,
we recently acquired
Crashlytics, which does
not just give you insight
into the crashes, but also gives
you data, sometimes exactly
to the line of code, that led to
the crash on your application.
Another thing is that after
you ship an application,
you will need to use
performance monitoring
tool to ensure that your app is
behaving in the correct manner.
It should not be eating a lot
of bandwidth, data, or network
issues.
When you integrate the
performance monitoring SDK
into your iOS or Android
app, it will automatically
provide insights into two
most important aspects
of app performance.
One is start up time, and
second is network request.
And you can also
customize these.
Also, this can be actually
combined with Crashlytics
so that if your app is
leading to some crashes,
you can ensure that your
future versions of the SDK
are well-optimized.
And finally, making money.
Firebase makes it a
lot easier for you
to track all your revenue in
one place along with the rest
of your data.
AdMob is now included in
your Firebase SDK, which
makes adding banner ads, video
ad in situations really simple.
Since you'll be
taking a lot of time
off from your users' eyeballs
and showing them an ad,
the least you can
do is make sure
that it's relevant
to them, and it
has some contextual relevance.
So for example, if I'm using
an app for score updates,
it's very important that
the advertisement that I see
are related to the
sports for which I've
subscribed to the updates.
Another powerful element
is in app purchases.
No line of code is
required at all.
So if your app has a
lot of in app purchases,
it gets automatically tracked
in the Firebase console.
So if I have a app
which has sticker packs,
it will automatically be
tracked in the Firebase console,
giving me all that
data in one place.
So we've designed
Firebase to give you
a suite of technologies
for sustained growth.
The idea behind designing
Firebase Grow technologies
is, we saw a lot of
popular frameworks
that growth hackers, use that
product managers use to come up
with strategies to
help increase the user
base of their products.
Firebase has been keeping
all these things in mind,
and pirate metrics is just
one of these frameworks that
will help you grow your
user base of a product,
and get onto the right
and optimized strategy.
So you can go through the five
phase of launching your app
and growing it.
For acquisition, through the
acquisition technologies.
For activation, through the
activation technologies,
and so on and so forth.
And all of these are
bound by analytics, which
is ever evolving and improving.
So this would give you a great
strategy for your sustained
growth of the product.
And with that, I've wrapped
up my session in 18 minutes.
And thank you so much for taking
out the time for coming there.
I know it is a long queue.
