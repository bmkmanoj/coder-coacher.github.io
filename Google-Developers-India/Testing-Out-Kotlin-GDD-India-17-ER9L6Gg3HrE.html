advocate for Android at Google i/o we
announced the Kotlin is a supported
language for Android development and
today I'm gonna talk about how Kotlin
can help you write great code I'm going
to do that by diving into some typical
test code that you write everyday and
adding column we're gonna go pretty deep
and full warning most of this talk is
code I thought I'd start out by talking
a bit about what Kotlin is and why we've
decided to support it for Android colin
is a modern programming language it has
type inference first-class functions
lambdas co-routines and all the features
you expect from a modern language Kotlin
borrows the best features from other
languages to allow you to write less
boilerplate code and produce better
software but Colin isn't just expressive
it's a language built for industry what
do I mean by that Colin is expressive
without sacrificing performance it's
easy and natural to write Colin code
that has the same runtime performance as
code written in the Java programming
language Colin keeps just enough
boilerplate to scale your source code to
hundreds of thousands of lines of code
or more and it does this by never
sacrificing readability for abstractions
a core design goal of Kotlin is just
enough boilerplate when it adding
abstractions colin has chosen to keep
readability and it's always possible to
figure out what a line of code does just
by reading the source since Jeff ring
makes Colin you know it's gonna have
great tooling and Colin is fully
supported in both IntelliJ and Android
studio of course
hotland wouldn't be interesting if it
didn't work with our existing programs
or if it was hard to learn
Colin works with existing source code
libraries and frameworks so well that
it's really easy to extend your existing
programs with new abstractions I'm gonna
do that a lot later in this talk it's
also really easy to learn
qapla there's not many surprises most of
the things in Kotlin work exactly the
way you're used to from the Java
programming like
Kalen just reduces the boilerplate and
adds expressive new features I'd like to
introduce you to our testing ninja now
it's our mascot at Google for testing on
Android since I'm going to be talking
about testing today to motivate Kotlin I
thought it'd be a good idea to talk
about what kind of test code we should
be writing for our Android apps I'm
gonna revisit some of the content that
we covered at i/o 2017 about how to test
Android apps to start off we want to
write unit tests they're everyone's
favorite kind of test a unit test tests
an isolated unit like a class or a
method and it does this by isolating all
of the dependencies using mocks you can
get extremely quick feedback to the
exact line of code to caused a test
failure when a unit test fails and unit
tests execute an order of magnitude
faster than other kinds of tests
so executing thousands of unit tests
takes seconds not minutes this quick
feedback cycle lets you be confident as
a developer finding errors as soon as
you introduce them to the codebase not
minutes or hours later your modules that
don't have Android dependencies should
be tested using jua and areas of your
code that interact with the android
framework robolectric is a good solution
for isolating your code from Android we
recommend about 70% of your tests be
written as unit tests next in our
testing story we have integration test
an integration test differs from a unit
test because it combines multiple
components in our apps for example you
might test a fragment coupled with the
database in the network layer
integration tests are more precise than
end-to-end tests though they are less
precise than unit tests because they
test multiple features together for
these reasons we recommend running about
20% of your tests as integration tests
and then finally end-to-end test is
everyone here familiar with espresso
alright for those of you who aren't
expressed as a UI testing framework that
allows you to do things like click on a
button and then check your app state
just like a user was using the app
Express is the best way to ensure your
app works because it works at the full
integration level all the way at the UI
however that does mean it's much much
slower than
unit-tests more if you only write
espresso test for your app it's often
very difficult to find out what line of
code caused a test failure because the
test runs against the fully integrated
app with all of the components working
together at Google we recommend about
10% of an app's test be written using
end-to-end testing and use for example
you want to make sure your signup form
is exercised but then do exhaustive
testing with other four kinds of tests
all right let's get back to Colin that's
enough testing theory for today I'm
gonna dive into some very simple unit
tests they're probably similar to tests
that you write every day I'm going to
use Kotlin features to build
abstractions and improve readability
while cutting out boilerplate let's
start off talking about how to extend
existing API is in Kotlin I'm gonna be
writing a test for this activity which
has an options menu with a help item the
help menu item is removed in some code
paths so I want to make sure that it's
added in the default case if you're
familiar with robolectric these should
be really easy to follow and if not I'll
explain as we go along our first attempt
at implementing this in Kotlin might
look like this to get the menu we asked
for the shadow of the activity a shadow
is a wrapper class provided by
robolectric the adds extra functionality
for testing next we use the shadow to
get the options menu from our activity
yet options menu is provided by
robolectric
you could have instead called on create
options menu and unprepared options menu
on the activity but this simplifies the
API and shortens our tests this is the
first edit we're gonna make for Kotla
accessing getters and setters and colin
is done with the property syntax it's
still gonna call the getter but you
don't need to type it every single time
now let's go ahead and take a look at
that shadow of method just by looking at
it we can tell it's a static method that
takes a single parameter
in fact since robolectric is open-source
I jumped in and found out it is in fact
a static method that takes a single
parameter of an activity this
construction works extremely well and
we've all used static methods to extend
the behavior of classes that we can't
but wouldn't it be cool if we could
actually add this method to our activity
class but only when we're writing tests
Collin provides extension functions and
extension properties to do exactly this
and we're going to use them a lot today
an extension function is an extension of
an existing class adding another member
to the class that already exists
likewise an extension property adds a
getter or a setter to a class that
already exists let's look at how to do
that by using the extension sent X shown
here you can add an extension function
to the activity class this is extremely
powerful not just because it lets you
avoid littering your code with static
calls the IDE knows about the extension
function and will show it for code
completion you can also create extension
properties here you can see the syntax
for that and you'll see properties have
first-class syntax just like languages
like C sharp or Swift if you're like me
you're used to generating your getters
and setters using Android studio and you
haven't written one of these in years
well in Kotlin you don't have to write
getters and setters if you're using the
default implementation all properties
are accessed via a getter and setter
generated by caller if you need to write
custom getters for example here where we
have a synthetic getter the property is
completely synthetic so the syntax puts
the Declaration of the getter right next
to the field declaration never again
will you have to hunt through the class
trying to find a getter for a member
variable and this is a great example of
how Kotlin makes code more readable by
leaving just the required boilerplate
extension methods and properties are
really just static methods once they're
compiled you can call them from your
java classes by passing an object as an
argument and this is really the key to
understanding extensions in Kotlin
they're just static methods they have
the exact same resolution as a static
method in Java and there's no fancy call
semantics you're not even allowed to
call an extension method or property if
the class provides a real member with
the same signature
so our tests can now use the extension
property like it was defined on the
activity
this shows how pollen can improve the
api of an existing library by adding
abstractions doing this makes our code
easier to read as well as write and to
make it better if someone comes across
this and doesn't know what the extension
property does Android studio will help
them find the definition there's a bit
of magic here but it's clearly spelled
out and it's easy to figure out how it
works just by reading this file and
using the tools now it's time to add an
assertion to this test so I'm just gonna
use the third equals and check that the
menu item was added this is a pretty
standard test and in real code we
probably also checked that the item was
visible and enabled but let's keep it
short because we're in a talk so far
we've talked about extension functions
and properties
we'll keep building on extensions in
this talk and see how they can power
api's fractions to simplify our code now
I'd like to turn our attention to
defining new api's in Paula what we
really wanted for this test was a fluent
assertion a fluent assertion reads like
this the item should have a title help
by using extension functions you can add
fluent assertions directly to your
existing types in this case you want to
make an assertion on menu item this is a
really simple function to write and it
shows off the power of pot line
extensions if we try to implement this
in a language without extensions it
would require building a large system of
testing types to expose the fluent
assertion already Kotlin is cleaning up
our code here but I'd like to add
another feature colin supports in fixed
calls and inks fix fall just means put
the operator in the middle let's take a
look at should have title as an infix
method to make a method in fix just add
the in fix keyword in fix can be applied
to member methods or extension functions
that take a single argument here should
have title takes a string so when we
call it it looks like this we no longer
have to specify the dot or use
parentheses adding it all up we've
managed to create a fluent assertion
that makes our code extremely readable
the index assertion makes our last line
Express exactly what we're trying to say
in a very clean style I do want to say
Kotlin gives us a lot of power within
fix and operator overloading
here we're cleaning up a testing API and
it makes sense however you want to be
cautious while adding this to your code
because it can hurt readability when
overused next we're going to cover a
very powerful feature in college that we
can apply everywhere in our code bases
Collin provides reified types reified
just means real and we'll see why in
just a second we've been skipping over
the setup method for this test on all
the previous slides that's quite a bit
of boilerplate and really all we're
trying to say is setup activity there we
go let's go ahead and write that in
Collin setup activity is a one-line
function that hides all of that
boilerplate and you can see here how the
reified works since T is reified or real
you can access its class which you
couldn't do with an erase generic type
this is extremely powerful and all of
our code bases are littered with class
arguments that kind of Kotlin can help
us clean up the real power of set-up
activity is provided by type inference
since Collin can figure out the type of
T based entirely of the type of subject
we don't have to specify the type
repeatedly in this call so so far I've
talked about how extension functions
work in a few ways and I've also shown
how to use in fix influence assertions
and how to use reified types to cut lots
of boilerplate now I want to talk about
lambdas these are function literals and
due to some syntax support in Collin
they're very powerful as an abstraction
we'll combine them with extensions and
other features to really clean up our
code lambda syntax and Kotlin is
somewhat novel if you're coming from the
java programming language so let's take
a moment to cover the basics you create
a lambda by surrounding a code block
with curly brackets and using the arrow
syntax this code defines a variable
increment that has a function literal
the function literal is defined with the
curly brackets and the parameter is on
the left side it says a value of integer
and then the body is value plus 1 then
we call increment which is just a
variable with two and get the value
three you can specify the type of the
variable with the arrow syntax like
here we're saying increments is any
function that takes an integer and
returns an integer we then assign a
lambda to the variable increment and you
can know that value it doesn't need its
type specified again it's passed through
using type inference and we're gonna use
that feature of the language a lot to
clean up our code lambdas get even more
interesting when they're passed to
functions this is a function y that
takes one argument of any type and then
a function that takes any and removes to
unit unit is Collins way of saying boy
and if you look at the call syntax to
reply you'll see that you can pass a
lambda to apply outside of the
parentheses you can pass lambdas this
way whenever there is a function whose
last parameter is a function argument
this is really sweet syntax sugar you
can use this call syntax to build
expressive api's and cut tons of
boilerplate when combined with the
extension functions and type inference
it makes otherwise tedious code
beautiful for example you've all written
argument captors using mockito before
and it looks something like this you
call verify on a mock object and then
you pass a captcha argument t-to your
mark all this will allow your test to
access any parameter that's been passed
to the MA by capturing a network
callback here the tests can fake a
network reply and continue as if the
network had returned a result of course
you need to declare this after look at
all that boilerplate argument Kaptur is
repeated twice network listener is
repeated twice and even with all of that
repetition there's still an unchecked
cast at the generic type with the red
underline let's go ahead and see what we
can do in caller in Collin
here's an example of a cleaned-up api
it's keeping just enough code to be
readable but removing all of the extra
boilerplate reading it we can see that
we make a network after we use it to
capture a value and then we replay the
captured call let's go ahead and
implement this API in column to get
started we're going to create a type
alias for argument captor this is a
useful way to reduce repetition when a
generic type is long like you see here
the type alias can be used in place of
the expanded type but it does not
actually create a new type it's just an
alias now to define the network capture
function use the type alias to simplify
repetitive code type aliases are a great
way to simplify api's and Kotlin and
provide semantic meaning to complex
generic types without having to write
another class network capture takes a
function argument called verify verify
is any function that takes no arguments
and returns unit which is Collins way of
saying void you can see that this
function type is an extension function
on net captor now I'm gonna talk more
about what this means in a minute but
when we define a function this way it's
called an extension lambda network
captor takes a function argument called
sorry together to actually capture an
argument you need to make an argument
captor there's a bit of Kotlin magic
here but we've seen it before it's
calling a function to construct an
argument captor that has a complicated
generic type that we're not specifying
you might expect I'm gonna use reified
types to implement argument after and
you're right
it's another one-line function with a
reify type to produce a correct argument
captor by designing our code for type
inference like we've done here
you can greatly reduce the boilerplate
in your code this pattern applies in so
many places in android so make sure you
figure out how this works you specify
the type exactly once on the variable
captor
and type inference takes care of the
rest the type T is inferred for the
function call and since its reified its
able to construct a new argument after
extension lambdas are the last type of
extensions in column an extension lambda
is a floating extension function and
it's pretty powerful I've already shown
you how to declare them let's talk about
how to call them to call an extension
lambda we apply it to an object in this
example we're gonna call the variable
verify on the object captain since
verify is an extension lambda it will
pass captor as the implicit this
parameter to the function and this is
really powerful allowing us to build
api's that look like language extensions
and of course the kept color is going to
want to be able to use the captor
outside of our block so we pass it back
and come back to our test here we can
see how it looks to apply an extension
lambda the argument captor has the
implicit this or we can say it
explicitly extension lambdas are a
really powerful way to define api's they
help us clean up code whenever the
receiver of the lambda is obvious in
this example it is clear that the BLA is
operating on a network factor and the
capture method makes sense
when called with an implicit this of
course we don't want to make extension
lambdas for every single API and a lot
of cases naming the argument to a lambda
is preferable for the second lambda in
our replay call function it's not
obvious at runtime or at call time what
the argument is so we prefer to let the
caller name it just by looking at replay
call we can see that it's an extension
function on network captor it takes a
function with one argument and then
replays the captured call passing the
captured argument to the lambda in this
case the captured argument is a callback
so we name our variable appropriately
but in other cases it might be a string
or an integer or other kinds of object
now we've done all of these things
before so let's go ahead and write that
out in code we first define an extension
function on any argument capture it
takes a function argument with a single
argument of type T and since we only
want to replay a single call we can
assert that there's been exactly one
call to our argument after you can see
it's using the implicit fist from the
extension function replay call to call
get all values on the argument after and
finally it applies the function argument
to the captured value from the argument
after so all totaled that was 14 lines
of library code that's gonna simplify
all of our tests in column it used
lambdas and extensions and other
powerful features in Kotlin to turn this
code into this and we can write it like
this throughout our entire code base
going forward much simpler I want to
mention right here the API here was
inspired by a library called Colin
mockito and so I think you should check
that out instead of implementing it
yourself in your own code bases so
putting it all together we've seen that
extend extension functions are Aversa
tile and powerful featuring Colin Colin
provides us with a highly expressive API
building blocks like in line and reified
and when we go higher-order pollen is
with its last parameter called syntax
allowing us to cut boilerplate and
extend the language of lambdas that's
all the features of Colin that I'm going
to cover today there's many more and you
can check out the documentation to learn
them before we go to lunch I'd like to
take a look at what's new in Android and
Kotlin Dan covered all of this in the
keynote but in case you missed it here's
a recap we published the Android Colin
guides to github to provide a reference
for Android Kotlin style and
interoperability with Java with support
library 27 we started to add knowability
annotations to make the API friendlier
in Colin this will make it so that no
checks are valid in Kotlin when you call
in to the support library and we've
built Docs and samples around Kotlin and
we're continuing development in this
area and of course you there's more
Android developers every day using
Kotlin for work and for fun the Colin
open-source community is still getting
started so now is a perfect time to jump
in if you want to start a call improv
or work on an existing one thanks
catch me after this at office hours to
check out our Kotlin instructor-led
training tomorrow if you want to learn
more about Kotlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
