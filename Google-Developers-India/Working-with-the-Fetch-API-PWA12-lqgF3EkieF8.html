lesson was promises we went a little
deeper into them remember that when I
taught you the core technologies it was
fetching promises together and then we
dug a little deeper into promises and
now we're going to go a little deeper
into fetch and I need to get my clicker
off the table here otherwise I'm going
to walk back and forth a whole lot today
so fetch is a modern replacement for
xmlhttprequest which we all call xhr
because xhr was written way back in the
day it was basically written in 1993
roughly 95 for Microsoft to be able to
build Microsoft Outlook as a web client
and then everybody else found it and
started using it for interesting things
and so it's all based on callbacks and
events and there's just a lot of
historical cruft it hasn't quite kept up
with the times it's been revised a
couple of times but the revisions never
caught on widely which is what I really
mean by it saying it hadn't kept up so
instead it was replaced with windowed
fetch so fetch handles things like
redirect a lot of common redirections
sometimes you need to handle it but very
often fetch will handle it for you it
has built-in decoders for things like
JSON and text and blobs so that's
something you don't have to write it's
promise based which makes your code
really clean so you're not dealing with
a bunch of callbacks it's used by the
service workers the cache API all of
that so it's actually a standard in the
system it has standard request and
response objects it's kind of like we
breathe back to the network stack
basically and it handles cross-origin
resource sharing how many people have
worked with cores before oh sweet
okay so a lot of the back row oh all I'd
explain it for the rest of you it's
pretty straightforward so let's let's
just do a quick JSON fetch you saw an
example of this yesterday this should be
pretty familiar
so we'll do a fetch of examples
son will unpack the response we'll pass
it down to the next thing here's the
catch that says the fetch failed great
that's our standard example now how do
you handle errors the suggested pattern
for doing it is when you call fetch
you're gonna get a value back even if
you get a 404 it's not an error you'll
still get a result in fetch you only get
an error if there was an actual problem
with the network if there's an actual
exception so what you need to do is look
at the response object and if response
okay is true then you're fine you're in
the 200 range and you've got the data if
response okay is not true
then you've got an error in this case
we're just gonna throw response status
text probably should wrap that in error
so this is the standard pattern as as
soon as you get the response check for
it and fail early by throwing the
exception and that would then fall down
to the catch at the end so let's grab
some data we're going to be on food
comps we're on one website and we do a
fetch across the network to a different
website bar.com what happens how many
people think that it works how many
people think that it fails how many
people are not sure lot there was
actually a lot of no hands up on either
one so it in fact does fail because
remember the rules of the single origin
rules in the browser which say that a
page going and making a network request
can only fetch data from the same origin
there's there are some exceptions to
that rule but JSON is not one of the
exceptions so if I'm on food comm and I
want to go to bar comm that's two
different origins that's a cross origin
request and the browser actually will
deny that by default now what are the
exceptions the exceptions are if I'm
fetching an image or a script those have
those are exemptions on those and so
people often use that as a loophole to
get
JSON data by doing JSON p which is to
say you wrap the JSON in a function and
return it as a script and because
scripts are exempt from single origin
you can do that but that's really kind
of a bad idea you know you're asking for
a script from somewhere else and just
expected to take it and run it that's
kind of like walking in somewhere
blindfolded and saying okay feed me
anything right it's not the most secure
way to go and it's really I mean and
it's a hack so there's now a
standardized way to work cross-origin
called cross-origin resource sharing
cores this has been in place for a
little while so the browser still
enforces the single origin model the
browser's still you know basically says
okay same origin origin by the way
together it's the scheme so HTTP versus
HTTP or two origins because they're
different schemes the host name and the
port so if any of those change it's a
new origin as it says the exceptions who
are images scripts media content like
video audio and embedded objects so if I
go cross origin for JSON it fails except
if I of course support now the browser
has to support it and the server has to
support it but it's a really easy
protocol and anybody writing a back-end
application can add course support to
their back-end with like less than five
lines of code so when the browser
detects that you're doing a cross origin
request the browser attaches an origin
header to the request listing the
original source origin the server on the
other end receives that notices the
origin header and responds with access
control allow origin and it either
copies the origin back as the value of
this or it returns an asterisk a star
star means I don't care everybody can
come yeah everybody commits cross origin
request to me the browser will see that
header on the response and actually
permit the request to go through so
that's how cross-origin resource sharing
works very simple so if you're writing a
back-end you could either do X
control allow origin for origins you
know or valid requesters for you but you
can only return one origin at a time so
you would basically have a whitelist
internally or if you really don't care
just put a star out there if you have
some data that you don't care if any
browser can see it just automatically
attach access control allow origin star
you could set the custom header in your
web server so if there's no course if I
ran fetch with a mode of no course then
and if I ask for data dot JSON I still
get a response I still even get response
okay but the response is opaque meaning
when I go to read the data then I get an
exception because let's say I have a
page with an iframe and the iframe is
from a different origin so my outside
application might make that cross origin
request get the opaque data and pass it
to the iframe and the iframe being of
the correct origin could decode it the
same is true of you a lot some libraries
that you get from third-party vendors
they might actually throw it in an
iframe so they can decode that
information so it but it keeps the data
safe in transit basically now if you
look at the spec if you look at the
documentation you could reasonably
assume that fetch is no cores by default
but the implementations these days are
trending to be cores by default and the
spec is catching up so you can say Mode
cores but these days that is actually
what you get automatically this is the
second option parameter and the one
option here is the mode so this is what
I just said about the opaque response
actually I guess no the statics to zero
and okay is false so it looks like it's
bad
as far as text is empty so I mean it
looks like there's nothing in here but
there really is you have to pass it
through and let the actual origin unpack
it these could be conceived indeed in
the cache API and then read by something
of the proper origin later so I could
have you tried some opaque response in
the brown
sir but you can play with this during
the lab now it's not just yet fetch will
do get by default but you can set method
to any HTTP verb any method so here
we'll do a head request where we just
want the headers off an object and in
the response response headers would be
filled in we could say it called get
grab the content length so you can do
head post put you know options anything
you actually need to do you can do so
here's a post and we're just gonna go
ahead and put things on you know just
add the data here I could get a form I
could actually have a form get the form
data from it and post it I could attach
custom headers so create a headers
object add what I need and set the
headers or I could read the headers back
which you saw earlier response headers
and then do a get so here's a pairs more
full example of using handling an image
will do a fetch for a cute kitten
picture whoops
pass that down the pipe to read
responses blob which will take the
response give you a binary object out
then we'll turn that into something you
can append to the Dom so read responses
blob takes the response in by our
pattern if it's bad throw the exception
otherwise unpack the blob so now that's
passed the next thing in the chain the
next thing in the chain takes the blob
creates an image element creates an
object URL sets the source to that URL
and returns this element remember that
when you do document create element it's
not yet attached to the dom it's
floating freely but I now have an image
node that I can go attach somewhere in
the dom so nice easy lab to get your
morning started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
