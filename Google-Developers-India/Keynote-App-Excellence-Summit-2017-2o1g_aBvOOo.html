hi everyone great to have all of you
here thank you for coming it's always
great to be in Bangalore and see the
energy that we have in I think very soon
but it's going to be the most dynamic
tech city tech city in the world so I'm
going to actually talk a little bit
about build on what Purnima just shared
with you which is this incredible
momentum that we have have in India and
and what that really means for all of us
and all all of you as you're trying to
build amazing products and services both
for India and for the world but what
we're all hoping is that over the next
several years you'll build a lot more
and build for India I put in my shared
we had a very very interesting time in
the internet ecosystem in India when I
joined Google about six years ago we had
just crossed a hundred million Internet
users and as all of you know today total
Internet user base of over 400 million
300 million of them are connected to the
Internet on smartphones a large number
of them obviously on Android as all of
you know what's very interesting about
what's happening in India is what's
happened over the last one year right if
you go back to exactly a year ago India
had a very large user base that's spent
very little time on the Internet
because of the lack of broadband right
what's happened literally in a period of
about 10 months is truly incredible and
it's never been seen anywhere else in
the history of the internet we've
literally gone from having a large
number of users spending very little
time on the Internet largely on 2g
networks and 3G networks that didn't
really work all that well so a large
number of users spending extraordinary
amounts of time I don't know how many of
you saw Airtel's latest earnings release
average consumption for use on the
entire Airtel user base is now over 2 GB
per month that number was less than 500
MB seven months ago right so essentially
you've got 300 million connected
smartphone users who were really on slow
networks less than a year of
now on reasonably fast networks and
they've gone from consuming hundreds of
MB per month to actually consuming
several GB for data that's where we are
today but as Poonam I mentioned quite
frankly it's still very very early days
when it comes to the Internet in India
our estimates are that by the year 2020
we'll have over 650 million Internet
users and over 500 million of them will
connect to the internet on smartphones
so I want you to imagine in India where
500 million Indians access the internet
on their smartphones and almost without
doubt at this stage I can confidently
say that they will access the Internet
every single day so I want you to
imagine in India which is only three and
a half years away where you'll have 500
million daily active users on
smartphones
that's a user ecosystem that is the size
of China only two or three years ago
today China is about 750 or 800 million
Internet users so we've gone from
virtually having no smartphone users six
years ago to 300 million today to over
500 million just in three years from now
and that creates an incredible
opportunity but also it creates it has
its own set of challenges
this next 300 million that will come
online when we go from 300 million today
to 600 million will look very different
to the first hundred million users and
the next 100 million users they look
very different as all of it all of us
know in several very important ways
first and foremost
none of them are proficient in English
every single new user that will come on
to the Indian Internet is only
proficient in their local language
search queries in India in non-english
are growing 10 times faster than search
queries in English in India content
consumption on the Internet in India
non-english content is growing 5 times
faster than English content and the
stats go on and on
so that's very very different right the
first is local language internet second
is all of us know all of these users
will not have smartphones that look like
the smartphones that all of you have
they will have much more affordable
smartphones which by definition will
have processing power that's a lot less
will have memory that's a lot less and
therefore one thing you could assume is
that uninstall rates are going to go way
up
now you'd ask me how does uninstall
rates get higher than what they are 90%
uninstall rates in six weeks well I want
you to imagine a world where there's a
lot less memory on phones is a lot less
processing capacity and therefore
uninstall rates are likely to go up and
as a developer that then poses a very
interesting challenge right the days of
building apps that are heavy are way
gone as all of you know but they've got
to get lighter and lighter and you've
got to figure out a way to retain your
users the third big difference really is
going to be around what they're going to
want in many ways right all of us in
this room and all of you sitting in the
overflow room look you're very very
similar to users in the developed world
and so far almost everything that Indian
startups Indian developers have built
have really been built for what I call
India one which is the first hundred
million Indians and slowly we are
beginning to build for India two which
is the hundred to three hundred million
users we are all part of India one which
is the first 100 billion connected users
the needs of the next 300 million users
are going to be very very different to
the needs of the first hundred million
users right they're still trying to make
basic ends meet they worry about their
children's health education they worry
about their own health care they commute
not in cars and you know Ola and uber
but they're taking public transport 500
million Indians take the Indian railway
systems I can tell you for sure where
yaar three is going to have 50 hundred
million users very very quickly why
because most of those passengers that
are take the Indian Railways will
actually have
smartphones so they'll have very very
different needs and lastly affordability
will become even more acute I don't know
how many of you have thought of this but
mobile broadband rates in India have
gone from 250 rupees a GB with the
latest Reliance Geo plan that's
announced which is about 15 rupees a GB
they've gone from 250 rupees a GB to 15
rupees a GB there is no other country in
the world that has mobile data rates
that India has today so we've gone from
a relatively expensive market for mobile
broadband to actually a pretty
affordable market for broadband but even
at those levels consumers are still
going to be extraordinarily conscious
especially this next 300 million users
of how much data their apps are going to
consume so being continuing to be very
thoughtful about how much data your
products are going to consume your
services are going to consume is going
to be very very different so in many
ways this next 300 million users will be
entirely different from the first
hundred million and the next 200 million
users and we believe the time is now for
Indian developers for our ecosystem to
build for billions build for a billion
Indians and build to make billions in
revenue and I'm not talking about
billions of rupees we think the time is
now to start building for billions of
dollars and I'll talk about that in a
minute so what does that mean for all of
us sitting here in the room I think the
first is thinking local we have to think
beyond the first hundred million users
you know I'm been in the Indian
ecosystem for a long period of time I
see a large number of companies I see
very few companies today that are
thinking truly local the reality is in a
country of 1.3 billion people we have
billions of problems great businesses
great startups get apps great services
get built around real pain points and in
India we have them in spades and if you
look at the next 300 million users there
are such a large number of problems to
be solved so the first thing is really
thinking local healthcare education
Financial Inclusion transportation
energy pollution you are actually live
in Delhi it is the most polluted city in
the world by far you know how many
startups we have that are trying to
solve the pollution problem in Delhi
city of 25 million as much venture
capital as phone into NCR as it has to
Bangalore your how many startups we have
in Delhi trying to solve pollution one
pretty interesting right I'm going to
live 10 years less because I live in
Delhi there's only one company trying to
solve pollution why because everybody is
reading TechCrunch trying to build the
next TechCrunch company the problem is
you know most of India doesn't need most
of what TechCrunch write them up so
understanding local needs
thinking local and solving local
problems is by far the most important
thing the second is relentlessly
focusing on product quality or
continuing to focus on product quality
these new set of users actually want
even simpler experiences you know we
have this initiative called internet
saathi
where we are now in ninety thousand
villages it's a partnership that we have
with Tata trusts we go village by
village they recruit women to be
internet southies and they spend every
day getting women in their respective
villages to understand what the internet
and get onto the Internet we have almost
30,000 full-time internet shoppings and
they've trained nine million women in
rural India already the single biggest
finding we had when we launched this
initiative is what we all take for
granted which is we know what a
smartphone is we know what an app is we
know what the internet is guess what
most of India doesn't know what the
Internet is most of India there
experience the smartphone most of India
doesn't know what an app is so how do
you get that user to not just get on the
internet but really discover your
product and start using your product app
excellence needs to go to a whole new
level because the reality is building
for these set of users requires the
level of sophistication skill and
quality that we haven't really had when
we built for the first hundred million
or the first two hundred million Indians
and the great thing as you learn today
is Google aflateen
has a whole set of tools trainings
capabilities that we'd love to share
with all of you and help you upscale
your themes to be able to dramatically
improve your product quality and the
third thing really is monetization right
if there's one thing the Indian internet
ecosystem has been challenged with is
monetization but we believe the time has
come now where we are beginning to see a
step change in monetization in India who
you must share an interesting stack
right over 1 billion apps downloaded
from the Play Store in India 1 billion
growing at over 100 percent but actually
that's not the most interesting stat if
you're sitting in this room the most
interesting stat I thought maybe it's
not for you
is that consumers spend Indian consumers
spend on apps in India went up 300% 3x
right that's very very interesting so if
you look at the Indian ecosystem and
monetization across the different
aspects or elements of the Indian
ecosystem the digital ad market last
year was well north of a billion dollars
and it's growing at about 40% ecommerce
in India this year will be twenty
billion dollars over thirteen billion of
that will be mobile digital payments
really going through the roof across
every aspect of India so whether you
look at ads whether you look at Commerce
whether you look at consumer paid
subscriptions which is still very early
we are beginning to see the early signs
of s-curves
and we think as developers
especially in a country like India where
monetization has been difficult is
getting much better but will continue to
be quite challenging it's very very
important to start running experiments
trying to figure out how you're going to
monetize a lot of startups come to me
and say hey Rajan we're building for a
billion or we're going to monetize 10
years from now I said you know the
difference the challenge with that is
when you switch on monetization it's not
going to happen instantly so the sooner
you start experimenting with
monetization trying out new ways in
which you can monetize the better you're
going to be and I'm delighted that the
number one asks that I've had every
single year when I go to events like
this with our developers in the
ecosystem which is payments is finally
solved DCB which is direct carrier
billing which has been the ask for many
many years I'm delighted to say that the
team has been able to now get up and
running and we've got a whole set of
other payments mechanisms that you hear
about so those are really the three
things that I think are important if
you're sitting in this room to really
think about one build for India really
really think local second dramatically
improve product quality and app quality
so that your products because what you
don't want to do is be in the 98 percent
of the apps that are users gonna answer
uninstall write because it's a 90
percent uninstall rate now it's what we
going to go to 98 it has to write
because the next 300 million users are
going to have half maybe even less
memory processing capacity etc so
product quality becomes even more
important and the last and most
important thing is we really do believe
that the time is now to start generating
billions of dollars of revenue thanks
for coming and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
