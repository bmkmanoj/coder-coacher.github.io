management in Google cloud AI he leads
the Google cloud a I product line he
focuses on making google's AI technology
easy and useful for developers and
enterprise customers previously Rajan
led the development of Android and
Chrome for business and education
including the Android for work products
the Chromebooks for education product
line and Chromebooks and chromeboxes
also helped create an lead product
development for Google Apps for work and
education a full suite of communication
and collaboration products for
businesses which is now used by over 5
million businesses he brings more than
15 years of experience delivering
innovative products to businesses and
consumers I was in joined Google from
VMware
where he managed the award-winning line
of ESX server data center virtualization
software Rajan graduated from Stanford
University with a bachelor's degree in
electrical engineering and a master's
degree in computer science Google
acquired Kaggle relatively recently
Kaggle also reports up to Rajan so do we
okay laptop is having his laptop is
having issues so he's joining from
another laptop in the meantime anybody
has any questions for anyone else in the
room or for me or Anand if he's there
and there's plenty of Googlers here yes
let's get the mic so my question was to
Robert - actually yeah I'm Tom from
Craig you're still here yeah he was
speaking about you know understanding
bounced ring and then sizing actions and
I had spent an amount of time on
automatic planning and heuristic search
where
we were trying to do the other way if
someone gives goals and actions what are
those sequence of actions that will help
you accomplish goals so is there you
know you know a line of research on you
know going the opposite way as to okay
we are understanding you we are
answering you and then we are setting
actions probably next step is you know
we are trying to understand what your
goals are and then probably such as
plans of actions so question is anybody
from you sweet here who wants to take it
so I don't know I don't work on GC but
um do you want to take please take a mic
on the short answer is that we have
thought of sort of bubbling up this
thing where some leaders say these are
the key priorities of our projects and
then we see whether those teams are
actually working on those priorities
based on how much work they spent in GC
but we have not made much progress on
that it'll just be fine from that yeah
okay Rajan Rajan does it Mike hi can you
hear us
hi there yes okay Roger over to you okay
thank you okay sorry about the delay
there ken do you mind pinning the
presentation I I open the software go
present yep you never know okay perfect
well thank you all thank you all for for
joining and it's it's a pleasure to be
able to talk to you so as they're
mentioning my name is Rajan chef and I
lead our product team for AI in Google
cloud and effectively well what we're
trying to do is we're trying to take a
lot of the great technologies that
Google is building around AI and build
even more interesting things
specifically to bring this to developers
and to bring this to enterprises and
really our goal is to figure out
how do we actually democratize the
concept of AI and bring it to bring it
to many many more people we really
believe that AI is going to be a
fundamental architecture of computer
science over the next 20 to 30 years and
so this is something that we are that
that we that were investing of course
very very heavily in we also think that
that this is a key differentiator for
Google clouds one of the reasons that
people are coming to Google's cloud and
and as a result of that rebuild we're
putting a lot of emphasis on this in the
cloud side not to build out more and
more technology and so I want to take
you through kind of how we're thinking
about this and and then when I'm happy
to go into questions um so first of all
the head do any of you remember this
view in the room there we go many in the
room so this is of course theme that the
mosaic browser from 1993 in 1994 for me
this was dead wood when I saw this was
the first time I saw the I saw the
Internet and it's near and dear to my
heart especially having worked on worked
on Chrome but what's interesting about
it is it was the first time many people
saw the Internet the Internet at that
point had been around for almost 30
years but but this was the first time
that people were actually seeing the
benefits of it in yeah in in the public
so for me for example my biggest my
biggest aha moment is when I could check
sports scores online and be able to
track my favorite my favorite football
team online and and it was the first
time we were seeing things that were
useful and the reason I put this up is
that this is where I believe AI is right
now AI is not a new thing it's been
around for 50 plus years but then now
what we're starting to see is that the
public is now able to take advantage of
it and do interesting things with it and
similar to the engine that we think that
it's very tough to tell where this is
going to go over the next 10 to 20 - 30
years that there are many directions
that could potentially go and a very
powerful concept and so this is kind of
how we're thinking about this that you
know we're really just at the very
beginning and with Google we really
truly are an AI company and I know Jeff
Dean talked to you earlier today but
what's really interesting to me to see
is the explosion of the use of AI within
Google
if you roll back just a couple of years
ago only a few people were were using AI
and and what we're what we're finding is
that there was only kind of a small
portion of Google that was using it in
in products that you would imagine
things like self-driving cars and
alphago and things like that however now
almost every product at Google is using
machine learning into into one extent or
another everything from Chrome to
Android the Gmail everybody is using
this to really kind of improve their
applications and so we have developed a
lot or around AI but then in the digit
in addition to that we've learned a lot
about how do we train the rest of Google
to to work on AI and these are lessons
that we're drawing from as we now start
to bring AI to enterprises into a lot of
customers one of the biggest problems
we're running into though is is this
issue where as we talk to a lot of
customers many customers want to use
machine learning but very few actually
have a lot of the skill to be able to do
that and so they're probably on the
order of a few thousand or tens of
thousands of developers out there then
know how to do deep learning in in a
very solid way maybe on the order of
maybe a million or a million-and-a-half
data scientist so for example one of the
group's that's part of my my team is
Kegel and Kaggle is the largest
community of data scientists out there
with about one and a half million data
scientists and then there but there are
21 million developers out there and
really our goal is how do we actually
make AI accessible to those 21 million
even beyond that so for example there
are hundreds of millions of people that
know how to use a spreadsheet how can we
make AI available to them and so that's
the kind of thing that that that we're
really focusing on and so the goal of
our group then is to democratize AI by
making it easy fast and useful for our
customers and partners and what I mean
by that is first easy we want to make it
so that so that that entire spectrum of
users is able to able to use it and that
we work upwards such that those that are
that that are more skilled at this how
have have the tools that they need fast
we want to make Google the fastest place
to run AI both in terms of speed of
deployment but then also in terms of
speed of operation and we really don't
redesign our infrastructure to to be
able to do that and the last thing is
useful so this is a really critical
thing as we've talked a lot of
businesses there are many businesses
that are making solid use of machine
learning in particular areas financial
services for example we see this a
tremendous amount however there's a lot
more that could be done and we're really
kind of the top of the hype curve right
now with AI and what we really need to
be able to do is to show more and more
businesses that are gaming business
results usually using AI machine
learning some of the areas where we're
seeing this really take hold are are
these for one is around personalizing
customer interaction and that's
everything from things like
recommendations all the way through to
automating the first line of for example
a contact center and scaling a contact
center and these are things that we
think that that we can start to do with
machine learning with the XI learning
now we're seeing even more interesting
things around for example natural
language understanding so for example
one of our customers is Okada which is a
online grocer in the in the UK and
they're using a natural language
understanding API to be able to
understand customer emails that are
coming in to be able to categorize them
and then also be able to understand
sentiment so for example to understand
if a customer
is angry or not and so if there if it's
an angry email they'd rather through a
different route so those kinds of things
are what's possible the second one is
around efficiency and agility we've seen
this in our own data centers we've
started to use machine learning to
manage our own data centers and we saw
for example a 40% drop in our cooling
energy which was which amounted to a
massive drop in our overall energy
intake but we're also seeing this in
areas like manufacturing in oil and gas
there are many other areas where
efficiency is is very important and IOT
is starting to become a key part of that
is if you have linked devices how can
you adjust those linked devices based on
the machine learning to do interesting
things
a third areas around spotting patterns
and so a good example of this is
rolls-royce marine so what they were
doing is they were taking pictures of
the waterways that their that their
ships were going down and using that too
so using machine learning to spot
obstacles and then guide the ships down
the most optimum route and then the last
but not least is adding structure to
unstructured data we see this a lot with
in businesses probably most businesses
we encounter about 90 plus percent of
their data is unstructured their
documents or images or videos and things
like that adding structure that that and
actually gaining information out of that
is is crucial for many of them we
partnering with box for example such
that a user of box can insert all of
their images into our into our system
and be able to actually get information
out of those images and so these are
just a few examples and what we have
really focused on are these four areas
to make to make Google great at this the
first is our on scale of course which is
with Google cloud a customer has an
instant access to all these machines but
then the second one is around speed so
one of the things we recognized a few
years ago is that if we continue down
the path we were continuing down a I
would would quickly SAP all the
resources of all the data centers that
we that we
for example if more and more Android
users we're going I'm going to start to
use voice 2 as an input we were going to
see our data center capacity sapped up
very very quickly and so we redesigned
our data centers when our systems from
the ground up everything from the
silicon all the way through the
networking to be optimized for machine
learning and now what we're doing is
providing that as a service such that
people can take advantage of that
the third is quality then we've seen
probably the biggest change over the
last five years is that the quality of
models that are that are out there for
very complex tasks are much much better
and so we want to give people access to
those models that we've built and the
fourth thing is around customization so
another big problem we've encountered is
around mass customization almost every
time we we go into a business even they
have a similar problem as another
business the problems are so each
slightly different so how do we make
customization easy we've been doing a
lot of this through direct engagement
and for example really helping helping
our customers be able to learn about
machine learning but then there are
tools that were that we're building for
this and I'll go through one of the more
exciting ones called Auto ml in just a
moment one of the things that that we've
been talking about looking at is then
what kind of products can we build out
of this and so we have three kind of
areas of products that we've built as a
result one is what I'm calling building
blocks which are essentially taking a
lot of kind of fundamental AI concepts
and being able to being able to provide
api's and services around around those
based on the things that Google has been
good at and I'll talk about this in a
second a second one is around the
platform which is giving people access
to our computing giving people access to
to things like RTP use in our
infrastructure in the FUD the third
thing is solutions and so trying to
figure out are there problems that we or
our partners can solve such that people
can see immediate value out of this so
we have about six different building
blocks that we now now have a
part of our portfolio and we've
concentrated on a lot of the things that
Google has built up over the last
several years a translation for example
is something where Google is
tremendously good but but now we offer
this a service for anybody to be able to
use vision is another area and natural
language understanding speech we're
taking a lot of what we've done for
example for Google assistant and now
offering that as a service cloud video
intelligence we're taking a lot of
intelligence we've built for things like
YouTube and offering that and then last
but not least and our newest offering is
dialog flow and so this is essentially
conversational AI and something that
we've where we're leveraging a lot of
what we've built for for assistant to be
able to let people build their own
assistant technologies for everything
from chat BOTS to to for example
assistants in store so those are the
kinds of things that we're looking into
but we come back to that problem of
customization you know how do we make it
so that people can customize can
customize easily and so one of the
newest things that we've built is what
we call cloud auto at all and so this is
this is the concept of being able to
have machine learning that generates
machine learning models for a particular
problem and we want to make it so that
we can can make easy all of the things
that many of the things that are very
hard so everything from bringing it
bringing in a data set for offer
training and labeling that data set
through to creating the model and then
also through to kind of refining the
model and deploying the model and making
that making that bot model available and
so on all ml tries to make all of those
parts easy now the science behind the
hell behind this is that what we have is
we have a controller model that that we
put the data set into and it proposes a
model form for that data set we try it
with that we feed back the results into
that controller and then we repeat this
and iterate to in some cases tens of
thousands of times to find the best
model we're refining is that we're able
to get to accurate
see that that is that's well beyond in
some cases even what what would
developers have created and so this is
this has helped solve problems for many
many customers where they don't have the
skill to be able to go build the machine
learning model and this kind of this
doesn't form so one of the first place
is a really the first place where we've
been doing this is around around vision
and being able to bring in labeled
images and create custom models around
those labeled images and so I'm going to
show you a demo of what this of what
this looks like so what we've been able
to do here is that we can show you we've
tried to automate all parts of this so
it can import it by uploading a file or
actually just putting putting your data
into Google Cloud and then we can pull
from there once you have that you can
actually take a look at the image labels
and try to review the review the images
one what we've tried to do here is and
it's a little bit slow coming up but
what we've been able to do here is in
this case we have a bit of a
tongue-in-cheek example where we are
using the cloud to to recognize clouds
and so you'll see this this has a bunch
of pictures of clouds that are labeled
in various different different ways one
of the problems though that we see that
a lot of our customers have is around
labeling and they don't they don't
necessarily have a lot of labeled a lot
of labeled data so what we are what we
also have added to this is is the
concept of human labeling and so you can
actually take this and actually label
the or ask us to label the data and we
will we will bring this out to to a
group of labelers that will actually
label the data in this case we were able
to actually label the clouds themselves
but then the human labeling service
makes it so that you can do this you can
ask us to do this for you once you're
done with that all
you have to do is go and actually hit
this button that says train and that
will actually go and activate this auto
amount what we call learn to learn
algorithm and be able to go and create
go and create a model we have an easy
way to do this that is a quicker way
they using transfer learning but then
the more complex way with within the
role architecture search that that takes
a lot a little bit longer to be able to
do but then produces a better model the
sudden the last thing we do then is let
you evaluate it and so you can take a
look at for example the accuracy you can
take a look at the confidence thresholds
for for these and see for example
precision precision versus recall and
then we also provide the confusion
matrix and so with this you can see what
of your labels were or whatever images
were labeled the wrong way and so I can
see for example cirrostratus clouds were
often mislabeled as cirrus clouds and so
you can start to see where you need to
add more data into your data set to make
your model better and better and then
finally it then it's just available for
people to use you don't have to do
anything it's actually just already
available for an API call and so you can
easily just take this code code snippet
paste it into your application and
you're done and you're able to now start
to start to use the use the application
and so this makes a lot of the simple
things are really simple we're seeing
some really amazing examples with this
so for example Disney is now using this
to be able to do things like for example
on the Disney Store be able to show
people show people for example be every
product that is there for a particular
character a Disney character and so they
can now start to do those kinds of
things that they were never able to do
before in areas like retail we've had
over 13,000 organizations express
interest in this and what's interesting
to me with that is that we've started to
see a lot of the long tail smaller
companies that don't have machine learn
expertise now start to do things with
with machine learning and and and so we
really think that this this starts to
get us to that goal of democratizing AI
then though we want to make it so that
people that do know machine learning
have the best possible environment to do
that and of course
tensorflow is a key part of this that
we've that we've open-sourced this as
you as you all well know but then we've
now provide an AI platform in the cloud
for people to run tensorflow and other
types of models and have it such that
you can upload that model to us and then
we can scale it we provide access to
accelerators we provide scaling we
provide everything from for example
being able to being able to use
different types of different types of
models all the way through to to various
tools around around training and then we
we give you the ability to have a
visualization environment with it with a
jupiter-like notebook with with this and
so this is something we're gonna
continue to expand to make it really
easier and easier for different
audiences to be able to do that but also
for the power and user to be able to do
really interesting things um one of the
newest things we're working on is a
project called cute flow now which is
essentially machine learning running on
top of kubernetes and this makes it so
that somebody that is a power user that
that wants to do everything on their own
has a stack that they can run on
kubernetes and then can can adjust what
they need about the machine on their own
and so that it gives even more power and
then last but not least so we have we
have TP use and this is something that
we released about a month ago into beta
and this is really targeted at people
that have have dedicated machine
learning teams within their within their
organization we're starting with a few
key models like for example around the
image classification then we're looking
to then expand this to almost anything
else that is that that's running
tensorflow
now we're seeing all kinds of different
problems that were that customers are
trying to solve in all kinds of
different different industries and what
we're seeing is that as we bring in
different types of models and so for
example bring in things around
unstructured data for example there are
many more things that people are able to
do a few of the really promising areas
that that we've seen financial services
definitely is an area where people have
had a jump start on this and been using
machine learning for many many years
especially for areas around risk
assessment retail those an area where we
think that there's a there's a lot of
potential and then healthcare is another
big area where we see a lot of potential
but we really see every industry has a
variety of different use cases where
machine learning can apply either now or
or in the future and so like I said I
think we're just getting started with
this I think if we look 10 years out
we're gonna see a lot more where we're
more things can get automated more
things can get optimized and in various
industries through through machine
learning and I think similar to the web
think back to kind of how hard it was to
build a web a website in 1994 I think
we're gonna get to the point over the
next five or ten years where anybody
would be able to do it even though it's
even a small business in the middle of a
country would be able to actually go and
use a machine learning and that's what
we're really trying to get to so with
that I'd be happy to take questions I
don't know how much time we have here
but I'd be happy to take questions
thanks a lot Roger that was really
interesting some of the neural
architecture search work Jeff talked
about very early in the day here and
some of that and TPU is being available
to us - where - to anyone in the world
through the cloud is just incredible we
have we are running a bit late but we do
want questions all right I want you to
understand how much of model reuse
versus and transfer learning kind of
things you are able to do on the clouds
setting like because I mean there must
be a lot of constraints about whose
model you can used for use for what but
how much how much of it is there in your
consciousness and what's being done
about it
yeah great great question because that
is something we we have to make sure to
get right then a company's model is
their own private model and and they
only they should be able to they should
be able to use it and so when you go and
create a model so for example with Auto
ml or if you created our platform that
is your model and we have a separate
space on on Google Cloud where we're
able to we're able to run it that said
are our services around things like
vision for example or our speech and
things like that those are based on a
lot of the models that we've created for
example for Google's consumer properties
and so those are models that have gotten
done better over time with many with a
lots of data one of the things we're
looking into is is there a model by
which we can make it easy for people to
opt in to essentially training a larger
model along with others so that they get
a better model so for example you can
opt in to say okay I want a better
version of a speech model for example
that but but then in return having part
of your data ibi helped helped to train
that model but we want to do that only
in cases where there's benefit to the
customer and also where it's an opt in
things so that people can keep things
private when they need to
so are you planning to like if you have
something like a marketplace in your
roadmap seeing like say some years down
the line looking at a marketplace where
people can share data and as well as
models and work together yeah great
question um so I briefly mentioned
Kaggle but Kaggle is something that
we're really done starting to deeply
incorporate into this and it's something
we have a lot of high hopes for so with
cadigal Kaggle was originally a place to
do machine learning competitions but now
what we see it as is kind of the place
to go if you want to use machine
learning and what we're incorporating in
there is tools for example
like a goat kernels which is a Jupiter
notebook tool to be able to do a variety
of powerful things but it's also now one
of the largest resources for public
datasets out there where people can
share data sets and and then train based
on based on those those data sets and so
we have a lot of things that are
available that are available there
definitely there are more things that we
want to make available but because
ultimately I think you're right that you
know if I think about just coding in
general rarely do people start their
code from from scratch they want to they
want to you know start from something
that already exists and then build upon
it and we want to make that easy over
time and provide more and more samples
we'll probably make it as a last
question thank you for sharing all the
efforts that Google has for I mean
taking AI to everybody out there when
obviously with deploying AI to various
applications the elephant in the room is
data is the availability of data
availability of curated annotated data
so I mean so yeah it was nice to see
that plug-in where you had talked about
humans labeling data and things like
that is that some is that a feature that
you plan to make available for all kinds
of data or is it for a certain range of
expertise because certain kinds of data
needs some expertise for annotation so
and is that going to be like a business
model do you plan to charge a cost for
that service can you talk about that a
little bit more yeah yeah great great
questions so a couple of things with
that so in terms of data labeling there
are things we're now providing in the
product like what I showed you but in a
lot of cases we'll also rely on partners
and so we have a myriad of partners that
do data labeling that have expertise but
because you're right like so for example
if you're looking at a healthcare
example and you're doing imagery in
healthcare you need a doctor to be able
to label these these images and so in
those kinds of cases you need
specialization so we're making sure that
we provide partners that have the right
specialization to be able to label
different types of data but then also
providing kind of a sim
serves ourselves for for simpler needs
in addition to that though you're
talking you were you brought up a good
point about the volume of data and so
one of the things we really focused with
auto ml is trying to be able to build
something or get people to be able to
build models custom models that don't
require lots and lots of data and and
that's something that that that we are
finding so in this case with as little
as a hundred images per label and we
recommend around a thousand images per
label we're able to create a very
accurate model and so we want to make it
so that people with it don't have have
millions of data points in order to have
an accurate model great thanks a lot
thank you again Rajan I know it's almost
