marina I work in the search outreach
team at Google and I'm based out of
Hyderabad first of all thank you for
coming to this session on
internationalization and structured data
for search so before I begin I just want
to ask how many of you run websites with
structured data markup okay
fair few cool all right in this session
we'll be looking at the basics of
structured data
what structured data is how you can use
that how Google uses structured data and
also what features are powered by
structured data following that we'll
also be looking at schema.org and some
transport transport layers that Google
supports following that we'll also look
at some resources Google provides
websites website owners so that they can
debug any structured data issues they
may have and finally we'll also look at
some best practices for websites which
have multiple languages all right so I'm
sure many of you are aware that Google
search has been constantly evolving to
provide a great user experience for all
our users since 1998 we've moved from
blue links to now we have many different
features like knowledge panel live
scores election results but even today
without structured information from
webmasters and content providers we are
still limited by what we can do
many of our search features depend upon
website owners adding structured data
and providing that to Google so only
with structured information Google can
provide our users with accurate and
attractive information so in this
context structured data is nothing but
the standard format in which you provide
us you provide us or any other search
engines your information so as an
example on the Left screen shot without
structured data
the user or the webmaster is telling
Google that are writing about the movie
Godfather and relevant information about
that movie but by adding markup Google
understands that they are talking about
a movie and that the name of the movie
is the Godfather and that the director
of the movie is Francis Ford Coppola
similarly in the other example screen
shot we were able to tell that the
webmaster is talking about a recipe
because he's mocked up that this is a
recipe and is given relevant information
about that particular recipe ok so we
understand the mock-up but how does
Google use it well let's assume in an
ideal world everybody uses the same
standard markup and you mock up all of
your data and Google's magical algorithm
somehow figure out all that information
and provide like a great experience to
all our users but we're still not there
yet currently the best user experience
that Google can provide to all our users
is by the vertical by vertical usage of
structured data that you provide us so
we are currently able to provide very
rich and faceted experiences for only
particular verticals based on the user
based on structured data that you
provide us we use that structure data in
both visual and navigational manners so
I just explained with using some
examples so in here we have three
different search features on the Left
screenshot we have a rich card for
banana bread recipes so there because
the webmaster has mocked up using
structured data we are able to provide a
very good image of what the banana bread
will look like once he see once they've
made it and we're also able to tell our
users that it takes 1 or 20 minutes to
make it and also it you consume 229
calories if you eat one banana bread in
the middle screenshot it's about a new
feature that's been launched earlier
this year called Google for jobs so this
has been launched only in the US and we
are working hard to provide this feature
in other locations too but in this
feature we are able to provide a very
good navigational experience for
users this is purely because for each
job listing website owners are marking
up the type of job the where it's
located and even the pin code so we're
able to help users and search for the
exact jobs in their particular location
for example in this someone searching
for jobs near Boston Massachusetts and
he can further filter that search by
saying he wants to look for jobs just in
sales and retail and finally we also
have another example of search features
which you structure data which is the
Rich Snippets this is the first search
feature that we've launched using
structured data here we're able because
you've marked up that content we're able
to tell that this particular the movie
Godfather under Roger Rabbit com is it
has a full five by five rating okay so
we've seen what markup is we've also
seen how Google uses it but how do you
send this markup to Google well there
are three common transport layers that
Google currently supports there json-ld
microdata and XHTML plus rdfa currently
google recommends json-ld but if even if
you use microdata or rdfa it's still
fine these are just syntaxes that you
use to encode your data
so why json-ld well json-ld as you all
know is a JavaScript notation that you
can emit into your HTML using a script
or you can also send it directly as a
feed the thing is unlike unlike XHTML
and microdata which are interleaved with
the visible text on your page json-ld
can let you express your data far more
freely unlike your content on the layout
of your page it seems very simple but
it's far more complex than how it's on
the layout of your page for example if
you want to mark up your nested the
nested items you can tell that
you can give the movie name often of an
event in a particular location that's
very very easy to do with json-ld but
it's hard to do with microdata
and rdfa so apart from json-ld we also
have this vocabulary that standard
across all different search engines
which is the schema.org vocabulary
google and all other major search
engines support schema.org vocabulary
and you can use this if you you don't
need to worry about optimizing for all
different search engines if you use the
schema.org vocabulary so we recommend
using schema.org but just in case if you
use data vocabulary or microformats
that is also supported but right now
this is the most commonly used
vocabulary you can visit the schema.org
website to take a look at all the
different data types and the
relationship relationships between
different data items okay so apart from
schema Google also has its own
guidelines it's available under
developers.google.com so we have two
types of guidelines technical guidelines
and quality guidelines why we have these
guidelines is because even though you've
marked up your content using schema
sometimes Google still faces trouble
getting to your content for example some
of the common technical guidelines is to
make sure all your content is accessible
by Google everything that you're marked
up we can access it one common example
of why this guideline was made was
because we've seen cases where
webmasters use json-ld and script the
JavaScript and all of that other files
are in different folders which Google
cannot access but Google can access just
the visible content of a particular page
but the script itself is in a different
folder and Google's robots the robots
file blocks Google from accessing that
content so in that case we will not be
able to see your mock-up so let's say
you've made a great recipe site and
you've mocked up everything
when you've got a lot of good ratings
but if Google cannot see that markup
your search snippet will not show those
ratings so I'll similar to this
guideline there are a lot of other
technical guidelines that you can take a
look at in Google's developer page we
also have quality guidelines so quality
guidelines are generally there to
prevent abuse of search of our search
results for example there are many cases
where the user doesn't see the markup
but Google sees it you can have a recipe
website where you mark it has five by
five and only Google says it but user
doesn't see it so when they look at the
search result because Google sees your
markup will show that okay this
particular recipe has a five out of five
rating but when the user goes to your
page he doesn't see that rating and he
feels duped so which is why we have
quality guidelines to make sure the the
users are seeing the same content as
what Google is seeing we also have other
guidelines specifically to make sure
other data types like events are not
abused because we've seen many cases
where people use the event schema to
sell their coupons or something at 20%
off so one of the major ways we actually
made inroads into making structured data
easier for everybody to consume and
everybody to implement very easily is by
having a lot of middleware layers lot of
CMS's and CMS plugins and platforms
having them support structured data and
that made it very useful or very easy
for a lot of content providers to create
or add markup in fact many people who
write the content they have structured
data they have Rich Snippets all their
features are shown in search very
visually appealing in a very visually
appealing manner but they have never
touched a single line of code it's
purely possible because there's a lot of
plugins for different CMS's and many
platforms like LinkedIn provide markup
markup is embedded in the platform
so they don't need to touch a single
line of code so for from Google's
perspective we've also made a tool
called data highlighter this is a tool
where you don't need to if you are
unable to access your code you can
simply go to your page and you can use
you can use a tagging tool to highlight
certain parts of your data and you can
tell Google what it is you can even test
it out now you get this data highlighter
tool is available in in your search
console account you can simply one
caveat is your pages need to be indexed
before you try out this data highlighter
tool so just make sure your pages are
indexed and then you can try and
highlight certain parts of the page and
you can see if Google is recognizing it
okay so you've marked up your content
but now we want to test it out how do
you do bug if your structured data is
valid or not well the best tool right
now we have is the structured data
testing tool in this tool either the URL
for the webpage that you want to add or
the just specific code snippet which
contains the markup you can add any of
these in the tool and the tool will try
and validate your markup once you put
the URL or the code snippet in here
we're able to pull up all the item types
of different data that we find and we
can also show the different warnings and
errors that we see on your website this
is based on our own validation that we
do in search indexing so whenever we
index a page and we look for structured
data we also use the same validation for
that we show in this particular tool so
if your code is valid in here that means
at least on a technical level there's no
problem like your structured data is
good to go as for the different warnings
and errors there's generally two types
of errors that you'll notice one type of
error is when your code is not at all
compatible with schema.org or vocabulary
or there's a syntax issue the other type
of error is when your code is not
compatible with
Google search features for example
you've seen the jobs feature I've showed
you right so in the jobs feature it's a
requirement to add the address so let's
say you're listing a job for an
accountant in Bangalore but if you don't
provide the exact address where he is
going to work at we are not going to
validate that code and that will not be
shown in our search which in the Google
for jobs Rich Snippets apart from the
apart from the structured data testing
tool we also have a structured data
feature in search console so this
feature aggregates all of your
structured data information that we
found across a certain period of period
of time and we're able to show all the
different data types that we found on
your website and all the different
errors that we noticed on your website
okay I that's that's all I have a
structured data but before I move on to
internationalization I'd urge you to
visit the developers page for structured
data and go through the technical
guidelines specifically because even
though schema.org has a number of really
good data types Google only supports
certain amount of those so in a
developer's page we list give a list of
all the different search features we
have and what all data types we provide
so for example if you use a data type in
schema and it's not supported by Google
at least at this moment it's not very
useful in search for that particular
feature all right okay how many of you
run websites which have multiple
languages and do you have the same
content written in multiple languages or
just you have a website for English and
you have a website for Hindi okay I
understand but I'm assuming you have the
same content in different languages so I
think you already heard a billion times
by now avoid the next billion users and
how most of them at least from India are
looking for local language content so
many of the big websites and even
smaller websites are trying to
content alternatively in Hindi too and
other Indian local languages so we have
a lot of people creating their from
their old English pages they're
translating that content into Hindi and
they're making another website with the
same exact content but in different
languages so internationalisation in
this context is making sure you letting
Google know that all these different
versions of your website the English
version the Hindi version the Kannada
version all these are the same and
you're letting Google know that these
three are the same content but these are
from different languages so whenever
someone from Hindi state is searching
for my content show him the Hindi page
but if you if you're already doing it I
am sure you know how hard it is to
maintain websites with multiple
languages it's very very hard because
many people employed different methods
to show their content to their to their
users but because it's very hard we've
compiled a list of best practices so
that at least it gives us head start for
you guys to make these multilingual
websites alright let's assume you have a
website which has which you're writing
about Bangalore you know someplace in
Bangalore and you have it in English if
you have the same version in Hindi and
Kannada the best way you can let Google
know that the Hindi version and the
Kannada version are the same which are
the same content as the English version
but in a different language the best way
you can let Google know that is by using
the HRF lang tag in fact you can use the
href Lang tag in multiple different ways
so for HTML documents you can simply add
a link in the head section of your page
saying rel alternate hreflang and then
the language code for non HTML documents
like PDFs you can simply send a header
response with the href Lang tag and you
can also use your sitemap if you have a
website with thousands of pages you can
use a sitemap to make it easier for you
to add the H hreflang tag and let Google
know that you have ok these thousand
pages are English and that will exact or
versions of this page in Hindi these
versions here is an example code so for
the first one you're basically said it's
telling Google that I n dot example.com
slash page is the English Indian version
of that particular page so this page has
probably has content in maybe IANA so
you let's say you're selling a shoe and
this page has content in IANA and then
you have another page us dot example
comm which you might a get as hrf lang
en-us this page you probably have USD so
you're talking it targeting it towards
us customers and finally you have an
default page for everyone every other
person from you know all other parts of
the world so some common mistakes that
we notice when people implement s
hreflang is they add this code in only
one page but the so for example all
these three alternate tags are added
only in the I n dot example or con flash
page but you don't find these tags in
the u.s. page or the default page so if
we if Google doesn't see the bat tags it
will assume that we it will not be able
to consolidate all the signals and will
not be able to understand that all three
pages are the same same content in
different languages another mistake is
people sometimes misuse or incorrectly
add a wrong language code so you're
supposed to use ISO codes so please keep
that in mind and so this was the
recommendation that we did previously we
used to ask for people to add rel
canonical tags in these pages but right
now it's easier for us to for us to make
sure you don't add rel canonical tags
because many people are doing it in a
wrong manner so we stopped giving the
recommendation of adding rel canonical
tags alright so you've seen the previous
example where we had a different URL for
the English Indian customers you had a
different URL for US customers and you
had a different URL for the rest of the
world so that's the right way
do internationalisation so many cases
we've seen where people simply use
cookies to assume the language of
whoever is visiting your website and
they'll just directly show you that
version so I'm sure all of you have
probably visited a very big website and
if you are in like say Hindi speaking
state sometimes you directly get the
Hindi version of that website but you're
the default version that you always use
is English so that can be a bad
experience for users and even for search
engines if you do not if you do not have
separate URLs it's very hard for us to
figure out that okay this is the English
version this is the Hindi version this
is the Kannada version we'll just assume
there's only one version and whichever
that version is we'll index it so your
content in the other languages is not
indexed and that's bad for both you and
your users okay this sounds very obvious
but we've seen many cases where you have
the Bangalore page in English but what
happens in the Hindi page is only the
boilerplate template is translated but
the actual content within the page
that's not translated so Google doesn't
use code level attributes like Lang that
people add Google doesn't use that to
determine what language pages Google
actually looks at the content than the
text of a page to determine which
language that page has so if you have
like say the template is in one language
and the content is in another language
that makes it hard for Google to
understand which language that pages and
we'll just pick one based on some
signals and we'll probably show it to
the wrong audience which is very very
bad for you and for your users okay so
we've seen a case where we told you not
to redirect people from the English page
to the Hindi page or the Kannada page
based on cookies or other information
that you may have right well how do you
then how does people someone who lands
on your English page how does he visit
your Hindi page well you've got to make
sure there's a small option for him to
visit the other versions of your website
that way even if they if even if they
land on the wrong page or even if the
search engine makes a mistake and sends
him sends an English user to the Hindi
version he can simply click on the
language button and visit the English
version and finally don't worry about
duplicate content so many people who
because there are thousands of pages and
thousands of versions of your website
you end up worrying about duplicate
content and thinking whether it you'll
be penalized for this or your ranking
will go down that it's don't worry about
any duplicate content penalty the only
issue here is if we don't detect your
pages in other languages those pages
will not be ranked but the pages that
are detected are ranked so even if you
make a mistake it's not going to affect
you in a bad manner it's just not going
to show the pages that you're that we
are supposed to show that's pretty much
it for my session so if you have any
questions please we don't have a booth
but we'll just be at the hall 3 thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
