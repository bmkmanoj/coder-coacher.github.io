pretty guru Swami to share her journey
as a women in tech Preeti how did you
get started with programming I don't
come from a CS background I come from a
biotechnology background I wanted to be
in medicine unfortunately because the
financial situation I couldn't get into
medicines so a lot of people said why
not try IP started as a software tester
and something caught me after the year
like wanted to do programming and I
remember my mentor she asked me have you
programmed I said no will you do it she
asked me and I said yes anything you've
been involved in many communities what
is the one thing that keeps you
motivated to contribute back to the
society
I feel women need lot of empowerment and
even as a child right whenever there
used to be a male and their daughters I
used to always sit with them and teach
them so that okay do something as an
education because education is a very
important part of it and mostly you are
educated because you need to have a good
husband otherwise if you're less
educated you may not get a very I think
that's why mostly all of us are educated
he's my cousin clan where we are all
educated because we get a good husband
and I was not very keen about not
getting good husband because I never
thought education is for our husband
right education was for self what is the
message that you would like to give to
the women out there who want to start
mentoring other women I first think
whether you want to be a mentor or not
you need to believe in yourself and move
forward I think most of the time we
don't believe in ourselves right and
mentoring is a one of the beautiful
concept that has been in India we call
guru we hadn´t gurus before they were
all mentors unfortunately we have
forgotten that fact right and being a
mentor you will learn a lot so be
truthful be sincere and tell you
experience in a very sincere way
you know you don't know who will be
inspired by you who will learn from you
you don't know you they might learn or
they may not learn but at least you will
carve a part for somebody and definitely
you will be a good mentor thanks a lot
pretty and you have a great story to
share thank you so much it's a pleasure
to be here then thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
