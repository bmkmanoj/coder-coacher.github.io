mentioned lighthouse earlier it's too
progressive web it's a progressive web
app tester like webpagetest except that
it's designed for PWA so sometimes you
just want to sometimes you just want
guidance and what to do you know so some
a at this idea well it's kind of like a
lighthouse you know it tells a ship
where to turn and where not to turn same
idea here we wanted to build a tool that
could analyze your progressive web app
and tell you what you were doing
so lighthouse is a Chrome extension you
can also run it from the command line
although what it actually does is it
just talks to Chrome in the background
and it builds a report so in this case
it looks to say okay do I have a
serviceworker do I give an appropriate
response when I'm offline so if I load
index dot HTML and have a real
serviceworker I should get back at 200
because it came from the cache it
measures the it measures performance so
the first paint how fast it appears to
be and put latency and such now notice
there's some grayed out tests at the
bottom like content Scrolls at 60 frames
per second so lighthouse is open source
and it's still under development so more
tests are being added with each release
we are now at the 1.5 release which just
got out a couple of weeks ago so you go
to the Chrome Web Store and grab it and
then you go to a site and actually it'll
give you I can't see it here it'll give
you a lighthouse icon oh wait here we go
so hit the button to add it to Chrome
and it will give you a lighthouse icon
go to a site click the icon click
generate report it exercises the site
creates a report for you it does require
chrome even running headless because it
uses some internal debugging API is that
actually hook
into them and picks data off so you can
wrap the command line by installing with
NPM and then calling it on a site it
will dump the record out like this now
you can actually read this into a
lighthouse on the on the browser and
turn it into an HTTP HTML report you can
also tell White House to save your
report and it'll actually save it to
github as a gist in fact it's a private
one it's just for you and then you can
choose how to share that with others if
you want to make changes Google Google
Chrome slash lighthouse so what you're
going to do super short section like
what two minutes you're going to go
ahead and install the lighthouse
extension to Chrome test an app take
that app and turn it to a progressive
web app just like you did in the
previous lab and then run the test again
easy so this could be an interesting
tool for agencies if there's an existing
site for a client look at the site run
the report and use that as a guide for
giving them advice okay go ahead phone
with the lab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
