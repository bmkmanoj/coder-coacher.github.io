My name is Sriram Praveen.
I'm in Grade Ten Standard and I study
in Bangalore International Public School.
I really love football,
and I especially like
watching it with my dad.
I love gossiping with my mom
and helping her in the kitchen.
One day, in school,
a teacher of mine, Mrs. Satya
called me and introduced me
to this competition.
I was in Ninth grade at that time
and I really wanted to develop a game.
I participated in Ninth Grade
but I couldn't win.
The next year also
I participated in Code to Learn
and I won it.
One day I was doing my maths homework
and I didn't really have
much time to finish it
so then I thought if there was an app
that would help me
finish my homework faster
it would be really useful.
My app is a multipurpose app
but the main feature is a calculator.
It's a special function calculator.
Like quadratic equations,
[component disks] etc.
and there are many other features.
There's a Study Tips feature.
It helps you through your exams
and now it helps me
finish my homework faster.
Managing time was my main obstacle
because I had exams during the competition
so I had to create separate time slots
for studying and for making the app.
I want a career in research
in pure sciences
so I really want to know
how the universe works
or can I say, how the universe is coded.
WIth my coding skills
I want to develop
an app for children in the rural areas
so that they can learn about
the new technological advancements
in their regional languages
and they can use them
when they also grow up.
I want to create an app for them.
Code to Learn is a very good competition.
If you have a good idea
and you want to turn it
into an app or a game,
you can do it very easily
through App Inventor, or Scratch
where you don't really need
much programming knowledge.
You can learn it very easily.
I want everyone to participate in it
and build their ideas.
With coding, you can do anything.
Anything is possible.
The feeling you get
when you finish a program
and it runs efficiently,
without any errors or any bugs,
I love that feeling.
I love coding because of that.
