absolutely no this never forget this
Dana
that's your will
hello hurry hi I'm JP hello I'm well
nice to meet you as well so I'm a
program manager with Google and I work
in Mountain View okay so and I wanted to
let you know that you are our first
associate Android developer who's been
certified so first thing we wanted to
give you was here to recognize your
achievements oh yes this is across the
entire program so the variable program
and you know the number one what was
your journey like and what brought you
into coding did you you know self-study
did you do you follow-up study so
because I knew you know there were
professional courses were starting
professionally but you know having a
really close family and I have to learn
you know a lot and to pursue that I
preferred free education complete so I
had two choices either learn comfortably
or learn the hard way mm-hm
so I prefer that the hard way you know
what's the influence of your family or
what do they think about your career
yeah usefully you know for a typical
middle-class family in India they did
not accept if it's a startup and
initially it was tough convincing them
but you know as days goes by and you
normally see the achievements like pile
up so they were comfortable with it
where you be able to know about this
entire thing like from where you have
read in some articles actually I was a
part of the Iowa extended I watch the
Google events regularly on this one I
had a company right here in Bangalore it
screamed midnight so I watch the videos
in my one of the conference they were
telling about the certification program
and I hope with an event through it and
we are excited to present our first
Google certification associate Android
developer perforce baby tell us a little
bit about the certification itself of
what where do you see the value how will
help you or how has it already helped
you I'm the og of you know moving to the
next job opportunity so in a pile of
applications that they receive they vary
they were easily able to pick up whom
they wanted in this program has really
helped me and the flow of the test it
covers you know 360
of Android that I was you know pretty
much stay exciting part action so I want
to be an entrepreneur so that's why I'm
grabbing my design as well as developer
knowledge together and traveling
difficulty journey on go is there
anything you would tell to people that
would maybe be considering this as a
possible exam to take it's wondering if
it's valuable or not is there anything
you would tell them my greatest weakness
is like you know I I don't do aptitude
tests or something like that's my
absolute weakness you know but I show my
work on the projects and everything so
for that category of people you know
they don't prefer useful interview
routine something like this is really
helpful it helped me to look into the
360 degree of Android you know standing
in the center looking at all aspects
right from design to testing so you
mentioned i/o so you're familiar with
Google i/o yeah well actually we have an
all-expenses-paid trip to come and to
attend Google i/o awesome so we'd like
to give that to you yeah thanks a lot
thanks a lot I know this is this made my
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
