My name is Aarat Sahajpal.
I am in Seventh Class studying
at [inaudible] Public School.
I am 12 years old.
I love coding because I am able
to put my creativity 
and imagination into projects
so that someone else
can see the world the way I see it.
My hobby is gaming and I play games
at my home quite a lot
as I spend five to six hours
on the laptop.
I'm really much into comics,
Marvel and DC.
I used the software Scratch
to make my game Marvel Pixel Fight.
It's a two player fighting game
in which you can fight
as the versions of good and bad
of my three favorite superheroes,
Iron Man, Hulk, and Wolverine.
I have found a website online.
It's called TheSpidersResource.com.
It was able to give me
all the spreadsheets
and all that I needed
to put my characters in the game.
My parents didn't know
much about the contest.
but they helped me download the software
and also become familiar with it.
It was really easy to create
an application on Scratch
as Scratch provides coding
which is probably fit
for the children of my age or lower.
I told my class about the competition
as this is the place
where young coders,
young beginners like me
get a new opportunity for coding.
Code to Learn has given me
enough experience with coding
so that I can look forward
to making more, better games
and create an app
which can help the people
living in the rural areas of India.
