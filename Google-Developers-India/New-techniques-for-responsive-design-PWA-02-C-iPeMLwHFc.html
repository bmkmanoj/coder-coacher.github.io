abstract kind of a high-level kind of a
Google i/o style presentation that's a
little more polished than you want to do
all day long nice but you know we're
developers so let's take a look at some
more developer level work actual
responsive design so most of you said
that you're using bootstrap whoops the
camera people or say don't don't walk in
front of the screen so most of you are
using bootstrap but let's look at some
other ways to think about responsive
design the way that Google's developers
or designers think about it so
responsive design right now what you're
using are fixed with grids so your
screen is set to a fixed width like 640
you divide it into 12 grit 12 columns so
it's a fixed width grid so one of things
we want to talk about here is fluid
grids we have to be careful now I have
laser gun
so fluid grids
another thing is flexible images we'll
get into that next section right can you
pick the most appropriate image for the
resolution of your screen or for the
size of what you're building so that you
don't have to load an enormous image for
a small screen and it finally media
queries which you'll all be familiar
with why responsive design so we think a
lot about responsive design in terms of
different devices but you also want to
think about the different users if there
a difference between a user on a small
handheld phone and a tablet probably
anybody who can afford a tablet probably
has some different needs and different
requests that so a lot of times
developers think only about well how do
I fit to this screen size maybe what you
want to think about is are there
different feature sets for these
different sizes of device based on the
users that use them now of course the
inverse problem of that is how many
people have gone to a mobile site and
it's it completely not had the
functional
you need for something airline sites are
notorious for doing this so do your
research carefully to forget what users
really need they habit is often just cut
it down to what's going to fit on the
screen you actually have to do some user
research and then the last one is
different data needs again what if you
have users in the countryside versus
users here and in fact maybe there's a
switch and your preferences that says
you know I'm on Wi-Fi turn on extra
features on my data plan
you know enable advanced features with a
note that says this might cost you more
to run that's responsive design - it's
not just about the screen size so
progressive enhancement right I said
this earlier it's a common term we've
all heard it I said it in response to
the question of well can I polyfill
serviceworkers what do I do you still
have to think in terms of progressive
enhancement you still have to build the
simplest sight first that will work on
most browsers so I mean some both sites
that's just HTML now nobody nobody that
you really need as a customer is using a
terminal based browser for HTML right
that was that was old days you know
early 90s so now you at least get HTML
and CSS but I mean the way the browser
works is even if you only have HTML it
will still render something if you have
CSS support it will add CSS styling the
same thing this is progressive
progressively built progressively
rendered and then if javascript is
supported as the javascript one of the
problems we see with a lot of modern
single page applications if javascript
is turned off or can't fully be loaded
the screen is blank there's nothing
interesting there you should be
designing when possible that your
content is in HTML and the JavaScript
adds functionality or takes over and
we'll talk about more of this when we
talk about PWA architectures
so the first thing to know when I
apologize to the cost I have a little
bit of a cold
is that sizing things is the first thing
you think about in responsive design
sizing your elements matters the very
first rule of building a PWA
never make the users scroll horizontally
up and downs fine sideways don't make me
look don't make me look at you over my
glasses just don't do it
right don't make users scroll
horizontally now thankfully HTML renders
itself fluidly to fit the viewport
normally you don't have to but pictures
write pictures tables there are certain
things to get fixed widths on them those
are the things where you have to be
careful to not get the users go
horizontally so what can you do one
thing you can do is actually set the
viewport meta tag set the content the
width equals little device width so in
most browsers you may know this most
mobile browsers there's actually a
virtual viewport on iOS it's 960 I
forget what it is on Android varies
depending on the mount on the device and
the release of Android but basically if
you don't specify a viewport width the
browser makes up a virtual viewport that
something like 960 renders the page into
it and then shrinks it down well in many
cases that's too small to read it was a
great hack for making desktop sites work
on the browser but that's what nine
years ago ten years ago we can do better
with one line of code and always set
this initial scale to be one because of
the browser auto scaling you get funny
bugs especially in iOS if you rotate
from portrait to landscape your layouts
can go completely wonky if you set the
initial scale like this and set the
width of device width it will always
rescale to the size of the physical
screen
another trick in images is to set the
maximum width of an image in this case
max width 100% and so in my CSS if I say
this image block is 300 pixels wide the
image that gets rendered in there will
never be more than 300 pixels wide it
will never go larger than 100 percent of
the allocated space again don't make
users scroll horizontally pretty easy
and you know that works progressively if
a browser doesn't know what max width is
CSS to skip that line now one thing we
talked about doing I said well fixed
site you want to fluid grids but you
need to think also relative sizing is
not really the total solution if I build
something with 10 percent margins and an
80 percent body those margins are
enormous on a desktop and they're tiny
on mobile so you do need to adapt to
different device families but this is
something you're familiar with right
this is not new responsive design but we
start to say it we have to set this up
so you can use media queries to select
different layouts on a small screen
maybe you have no margins and everything
is a single column then I turn that
phone on its side I go to landscape and
I rearrange so that this light this big
element now takes up the whole screen
width and this second element moves down
underneath it and then my screen gets
larger maybe it's a tablet now they can
be side by side so media queries can be
used to select different layouts and of
course most of you have seen this kind
of example designing where you say okay
if this is 480 or smaller lay it out for
a phone if this is 720 or smaller lay it
out for a tablet but you really need to
think about a much wider range of
devices now than phones and tablets and
I would argue that device based
breakpoints are actually not the best
way to go this has been a long debate in
the community
but Google is actually coming down more
on the set of content-based break points
than device-based
let's think about mobile first design so
just start with just start with in
general queries by device but this is
not where you end think about one stream
of content as your core design so if I
had if I had no CSS if I had just a
small screen can i range my content on
the screen in a way that makes sense to
somebody because sometimes you don't
have a screen sometimes you don't have
CSS how many people have blind users
visually impaired users how many people
have seen a screen really screen reader
in use there's no CSS there it's just
text so I'm going to take back something
I said earlier nobody uses a browser for
reading but they may use a screen reader
so one stream of content that makes
sense by itself is the way to go and
then for each device viewport size and I
would say even for audiences think about
the best layout and then take blocks of
content out of that stream and move them
move onto the side move them to the top
pin them to the top of the bottom
stretch them maybe remove them or hide
them as needed for the needs of that
audience and device and what we
recommend is instead of fixed size
device breakpoints really match the
content so put your content on the
screen and start resizing it and look at
where it breaks naturally and ok
sometimes you'll need a device based
breakpoint if there's not a natural
break under 420 then you probably have
to put one in but otherwise try to add
your major breakpoints based on where
your content wraps nicely and then use
minor breakpoints for tuning and you're
really shooting for 70 to 80 characters
per line that's the optimal length for
reading and really what we're talking
about here is content based as opposed
to device based media queries
an example of mobile-first media queries
last time we were doing max based on
maximum width so we were basically
saying designed for a desktop and then
shrink it down to fit different devices
this is the other way around assume that
you have a small stream of content
narrow and then progressively enhance it
as you get to larger devices using a min
width check this is not new advice Luke
Wroblewski said this one many many years
ago but a lot of developers don't
remember it you can also use JavaScript
now this one is probably new how many
people have seen the windows match media
call anyway one same person is our
designer cool window dot match media
lets you eject a media query right there
and find out will it pass will it match
you can do media queries in JavaScript
kind of a neat trick
so match media pass it a query and look
at the matches property it's like a rig
X it returns an object you can then
evaluate repeatedly and just get calc
calc is another one how many people have
used calc and CSS how many people think
that calc is slow it was it used to be
horrible but the browser's have all
gotten really fast so in this case I
don't have to use something like sass
and calculate a fixed grid size when I
start I don't have to use JavaScript
together grid size I could say in my CSS
calculate the full width of this box
minus 10 pixels and divide that by 2 and
that's my width that's pretty cool
right I can actually now build half
screen columns with margins very very
easily now if I'm going to use this I
better put a fallback width right above
it that is a fixed width for browsers
that don't know calc but calc has been
around a long time so it's actually safe
to use it it's actually good to use so
context first I mentioned briefly the
the techniques for manipulating the
single stream of content you can reorder
things pick them out of the Dom in one
place and put them back in in another
using JavaScript you can reposition you
can use float left float right position
absolute position relative to pick it
out of the flow I put it where you want
it you could replace it you could swap
it out of the Dom and put a new thing in
or use something like display:none for
one block and replace it with another
one make that visible or remove it
that's really a last resort you're
trying not to remove content and again
thank you very carefully when you do
this about accessibility I know it's
it's something a lot of developers don't
like to think about because it can be
hard to do but it's important to there
is a really good course at Udacity on
web accessibility it's another free
it was done by Rob Dodson who did the
accessibility for polymer and Alice
Boxhall who wrote the accessibility
developer tools for Google so great
course if you have any interest in
accessibility do take a look there if
you don't have an interest take a look
there anyway ultimately though you're
trying to keep it as simple as possible
you're trying to help users get to
content remember they don't see their
content they want within ten seconds
that's the load time plus the time it
takes look through the page to find it
they're gone and for content as your
resolution changes as your device type
changes you might pick a cropped image
or a different image one of the best
tricks that I ever learned was to take
bigger images and crop them not just by
cutting the edges off but crop to the
most important part crop for relevance
without making it smaller and as you get
more screen real estate show more of the
image progressively or switch
resolutions
now layout the last thing this is the
last slide here and then I'm going to
have a little bit of lab practice for
you this class by the way we did a bunch
of lecture this morning that's not
normal the way this class is normally
written is about 15 minutes of lecture
and then if possible I give you a lab so
a lot of hands-on time so a lot of
people use the twelve column grid
bootstrap material design like six
breakpoints six device sizes easy and
well understood but it's not great for
data usage because think about how many
attributes you have to hang up on every
item and fixed widths the recommended
way let me look ahead here nope okay
what our designers recommend and I guess
the slide got deleted for this is
actually to design think about your
device families for a small screen build
a single column grid I mean come on
that's easy
for a tablet style device bill maybe a
two-column grid navigation and content
for a larger device like a desktop build
a three column grid but build these and
CSS use calc use that relative sizing
it's not that difficult to do or if you
need fixed width using fast that does
the calculations for you but don't use a
general-purpose 12 column grid build
just the grid you need for each device
family it's going to be much smaller CSS
and the markup is going to be much much
simpler in many cases your markup is
this is navigation this is content or
maybe for a three column device this is
content one and content two as opposed
to if you think about it bootstrap how
many attributes are you adding every
single thing to make it work that's a
lot of stuff to transfer if you build
your own custom grid you can fit it
better to the device you can build much
smaller pages and it's what our
designers recommend and it's not that
hard to do we use bootstrap because it's
easy right five minutes you don't have
to think about it this one might take
you a day to get all those grids right
but then you've got them and they're
much better so at the end of this
section there's a group of resources
this is also in your textbook which I
forgot to mention so this course we have
a slide deck we have lab instructions we
have some lab software on github we also
give you a textbook because how many
people leave the room and forget like
half of what they have what they learned
right on average a week from now you're
only going to remember 25% of what we
did now the things that you do you'll
remember better but you're not going to
remember everything I said now you can
go back to YouTube and look you can also
look in the textbook these same links
will be in here whoops hello
these same links will be in here and
explanations on how to do these things
so we wanted to make this course as
useful as possible
you'll have the video to study from the
slides the labs and a textbook all free
okay
lab overview just simple stuff but it's
a nice warmup oops so we'll give you a
page do some basic see I set the
viewport style page CSS set up
breakpoints set up a grid layout and
then if you have a little extra time
there's a section of lab on flexbox now
I didn't go into the Flex box and grid
layout details here because we're
condensing this class today but flex box
is a new much nicer way to layout your
pages and the lab will actually give you
practice using it okay so go ahead and
grab the responsive design lab from your
notes everybody should have had the link
to the to the main folder and there's a
Genda in there open the agenda there's a
link to the lab so and everybody brought
machines it looks like so go for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
