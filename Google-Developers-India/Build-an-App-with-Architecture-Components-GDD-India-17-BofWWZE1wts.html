here at the architecture components
trading so hopefully you're in the right
place as I said my name is Lila and I'm
an Android developer advocate and today
you are going to make possibly your
first full app with the Android
architecture components and you're going
to do that from scratch so let's get
started okay but in case you don't know
what architecture components are I'm
going to talk a little bit about that
just introduce that to you so
architecture components are a growing
set of libraries there will be more of
them coming out and they are meant for
creating Android apps and the whole
point of these libraries is to simplify
things that might have been a little bit
challenging with Android development the
Android team decided to create these
libraries by getting feedback from you
all the developers and asking sort of
you know what slowed down your
development so more specifically and
from that information they started with
two libraries a library for persistence
on Android and a library for life cycles
on Android and making lifecycle
management easier and both of these so
the first one is Roo which you've
hopefully heard over the second what is
the lifecycle library and both of these
libraries reached 1.0 stable in November
so they are production ready and you
could use them in your apps safely now
these libraries were built in a way
where they can be used alone or they can
work together just fine so if you're
only looking for a solution to make
sequel Lite databases you could easily
use room alone without having to use the
other libraries if you want but they're
also designed in a way to really work
well together which is what I'm going to
mostly be talking about today I should
also mention that there's a third
library which is an alpha called the
paging library you should definitely
check this out and give myself or any of
the other developer advocate advocates
feedback about it and its purpose is to
simplify lazily loading large data sets
for you so another big part of
architecture components is the new
documentation on developer.android.com
there's actually a guide now
describes one way which you can properly
architected Android app if you are
happily using a architecture pattern
please continue to do that but if this
might be new to you and you're
interested in learning more about one
scalable way to architect Android apps
there's a whole guide on it and that's
actually the architecture that we're
going to be following today okay so what
are you going to make today we are going
to make this very simple app that
displays a list of words but even though
this is a very simple app you're gonna
see a lot of the different architecture
components in practice and it's going to
do some powerful things for you so in
the next hour or so you're gonna be
building a sequel light database you're
gonna be displaying all of the content
in that sequel a database at a
recyclerview you're gonna be adding have
the ability to insert or add new words
to that database and finally you're
gonna create this in a way that it uses
a reactive UI which means in other words
the UI will be automatically kept in
sync with the database which is what are
the powerful things you could do about
that connection between room and the
lifecycle library okay so let's go ahead
and take a look at what the guide to app
architecture says about app architecture
and how we might architected Android app
so one of the big principles of the
guide is really encouraging you to have
a separation of responsibilities for
each of your classes so I'm going to go
through each of the classes and talk
about what their responsibility is it's
the first class about their the screen
is the UI controller and that's just a
fancy name for a activity or fragment
now the responsibility of the UI
controller is to display data so
basically it's telling views what to
draw to the screen another
responsibility responsibility that it
has is capturing things like user
interactions so obviously your activity
is the one that knows if a user clicks a
button so that is of course a
responsibility responsibility that it
has but as soon as it gets that button
click instead of processing itself it
will pass on that information
to a new class called the view model the
view model will also contain another new
class I'll be talking about called live
data and I'm gonna get into those much
more later they're part of the lifecycle
library
but for now what you should know is that
the responsibility of the view model
class is to hold all of the UI data that
is needed for your UI controller okay so
the view model will then be
communicating with a class known as the
repository now creating a repository
class is a convention and it's a
suggested best practice but it's not
actually part of the libraries it's not
a new architecture component it's just
it's a best practice and in simply put
the repository class contains the API
through which you will get access to all
of the apps data and in this case our
sort of data layer is pretty simple
we're just gonna have a sequel Lite
database which you're gonna build using
room and room manages all of the local
persistence of this in the sequel Lite
database now room is a little bit more
complicated than just one class it
contains a bunch of different classes
that work together including entities at
Dao and a database class and it's built
on top of sequel Lite as I've mentioned
a few times and we're gonna get into
those details very very shortly so
another core principle that I want to
point out so we have separation
responsibilities but we also have the
idea that the classes only reference the
class directly below them so what I mean
is for your UI controller or your
activity that class is only going to
have a reference to the view model the
view model though will not have a
reference back up to the activity and in
addition the activity won't reference
the repository or the database this sort
of strict rule of avoiding strong
references to from like the activity to
the database or in different parts of
your architecture makes sure that you
keep things modular and that your app
doesn't become a tangle of dependencies
and what this means is that if at a
later point you want to rewrite a
portion of your app say that you want to
replace the roof database with something
else you can easily do that and you
would only need to change references in
the repository and not your entire app
to be able to do that update it also
makes things more testable okay so in
some cases you're going to want to be
able to communicate information back
from a sort of lower level on this die
grab up back up for example if something
if some data changes at your database
you're gonna want to be able to
communicate that back up to the UI okay
but the database doesn't know about the
activity so how do we do that well you
will be using the observer pattern and
more specifically you will be using live
data which I'm also going to talk about
more later in the past you might have
used callbacks but live data and
observation will replace that okay so
now you think you have a general idea of
what the guide to app architectures
architecture is let me show you what
that's actually going to look like for
your word app okay so that that we've
transformed those names into the names
of the classes that you will actually be
creating in addition you're gonna create
a class called new word activity and the
whole point of that class is just have
text edit text where you enter it new
words also you're displaying these words
at a recyclerview so you're gonna need
to make an adapter for that recyclerview
but hopefully this stuff is pretty
familiar to your already okay so that's
our general structure and we're going to
go ahead and work for the bottom back up
with all the concepts along the way so
let's go ahead and start off with room
so room is a sequel light object mapping
library and it takes care of local data
persistence for an app and rube has a
lot of advantages over using the
framework classes and go absolutely
notice in our documentation we're
switching over to room instead of
talking about the framework sequel Lite
classes so for example instead of using
sequel Lite over helper use room and you
will have two it will make sure that you
write a lot less boilerplate and one of
the ways that it does this is that it
Maps database rows to objects and vice
versa so you don't have to use
intermediate values like cursors or
content valerie's content values you can
get rid of all of those from your app so
that's kind of cool room also does a
handy thing where it validates your
sequel Lite queries at compile time so
it actually won't let you compile
invalid sequel and it will also give you
a helpful error message so that if you
wrote your sequel incorrectly you'll
know how to fix it finally rube has
support to work well together with live
data and rx Java for that observability
and I'll be talking about that later
so um
fact that you don't have to write a lot
boilerplate is because rube generates a
lot of code for you and it does this
using annotations so by using
annotations to generate this code for
you it makes it easy for a room to
create a simple API for your database so
let's go ahead and look at those
annotations okay so the first annotation
is the entity annotation the entity
annotation defines the structure of a
table of your database
the next annotation is the DAO
annotation that which stands for
database access object and it's an
interface that defines all of the read
and write operations that your app will
need and finally we have an annotation
called the database annotation that is
placed on the database holder object
okay so let's go ahead and start by
taking a deep dive into the entity class
so our data for this app is very simple
the only piece of data that we're
storing is a word and it is a single
string so I tried to create a visual for
you here of what that table looks like
so it just has one column in it and it's
for a string word that column is the
primary key the word is the primary key
and that's about it okay so what does
that look like so here is a plain old
object for the word class that I just
described to you and now it's an entity
class that was pretty simple we just
added a couple items so the first
annotation that I want to point out is
the entity annotation all entities in
your app need this at entity annotation
to make it an entity and again that says
this is going to define the schema for a
table in my database now I've also added
an optional property here and that is to
name the the database table word table
now this is optional because if you
didn't use it it would just name the
database table of the name of the class
so it would have named it word but now
it's word table instead okay now when
you mark a class as an entity it goes to
all of your fields and it says hey these
fields are going to be the columns of my
of my database table so in this case we
only have one field which is that word
field so it's only going to have one
column and it takes the fact that the
type is string and it makes the database
have the appropriate type there too now
if you have a object or a
a value in your in your entity classic
you do not want to be a column in the
table let's say you have like a bitmap
image or something you can mark it with
the at ignore annotation and that will
not become a call to your database table
okay so then we wanted to showcase a
couple of other annotations off the
primary key annotation is important
because every single entity means
exactly one primary key okay because we
only have one field it's going to be the
primary key here are a couple of there's
two optional annotations the not null
annotation says hey this field is never
going to contain to know no value and
the column info is also basically
similar to the table name value that you
have up there it says that I want to
name this column word and if we did it
include this optional annotation it
would just name it
M word which is the name of the variable
there okay so another important thing to
make sure that your entities work
properly is that room needs to be able
to have read and write access to all of
them and you can accomplish this in
basically three different ways the first
way which I'm showing here is that my
field is private but I provide a
constructor to it which has the exact
field name as a parameter and that I
also provide a getter for it so that's
one way that you could do it you could
also make all of your fields public if
you wanted or some of your fields public
or you can provide getters and Senators
something you don't have to worry about
the constructor but you have to allow
room to have access to these otherwise
it can't do all the table creation that
it does for you
all right now once you have your
entities defined you could go on to
building the DAO object so again the dao
object defines all of the database
operations that you need for your app so
let's talk about what those are well
here we're showing a list of words so we
probably some need some way to be able
to get that list of words for the
database we're also inserting a single
word here so we probably need a way to
insert a single word and then finally
it's probably good to have a method to
sort of flush out our database to delete
all the words and put very simply that's
all the functionality right there okay
in our Dom importantly at the top of
your doubt you need to mark it with the
- annotation and the it the class or
interface that you have either needs to
be an abstract class or an interface so
that rube can go ahead and generate and
provide the full method implementations
for you
okay now there are three convenience
annotations that you could use insert
delete and update and these create the
commands to insert delete and update
objects like the one that I'm showing
you here for inserting a single word and
this actually shows off rooms powerful
object mapping capabilities so in this
case I'm simply passing it an object as
a parameter and then rubes taking care
of putting it that in my database for me
I don't need to do anything besides not
similarly up above you could see that
I'm saying hey this method is going to
return to me words and room is able to
do that conversion for me as well and I
could also return a list of words by
just saying hey I want a list instead of
a single word and we will take care of
all the appropriate conversions for that
object okay so finally if you need to
make any methods that are doing reading
from your database or you have a more
complicated query operation you could
use the at query annotation and this
basically lets you just write some
straight sequel commands in your town
okay so one more thing I wanted to point
about out about the DAO so actually
there's a little bit of extra
functionality so we want the following
to be true when I add a new word to the
list of words I want the database to
automatically tell the UI that it is
updated okay and to be able to do that
so because I do that it will mean that I
can always keep the UI UI state exactly
in sync with the databases state which
is great so to do that we're going to go
ahead and use the lifecycle library
class called live data and I'm going to
talk much more in depth about this but
the basic idea is so here's kind of what
I originally showed you when you call
this method
it gets you the current state of the
list okay now if I make this tiny little
change and just say hey I want you to
return to live data back instead it's
getting you this object that returns a
list of words that automatically updates
itself when the database changes and
again I promise I'll talk to
you more about this later when we hook
up the UI to the data layer okay so
here's the final part of our database
and it is the database holder class that
I talked to you about before it is
annotated with at database and very
importantly it also must be abstract and
extend the classroom database okay
so this is the class of kind of making
your it's generating your database
tables for you
so you need to tell it about all of the
entities that you have created as an
attribute as seen here and you also have
to provide a abstract getter method for
the Dao okay so the route database
builder will okay so this is the sorry
code that actually creates that database
for you
it's a builder class for a create a guru
database and this is this code will
either return to you a new database if
the device doesn't already have one a
link to a new database if the device
doesn't already have one or it will
return to you a connection to a
pre-existing database if what already
exists on the device and importantly I
want to point out this one line that we
chose to add in there so in this case
what I'm saying is if the database
schema is updated I just want you to
wipe out all of the data on the device
it's like the most simple way to do a
migration is to just be like hey forget
everything else and you know update my
schema and because this is a simple app
I'm not going to get into migrations but
do be aware that there is a migration
class and there are tons of options for
making more complicated migrations of
this very simple you know just flush of
delete everything ok so the next
question you might have is okay you
showed me the code to constructed
database or get a connection to did a
database where does this actually live
well creating a database is actually a
relatively expensive process and you
normally don't need multiple instances
of a database so the recommended
practice is to actually create a
singleton for your database the static
variable signal time and ensure that you
only instantiate it once so that's the
code to do that you'll be able to copy
and paste in the code lab so you don't
need to take notes on all this right now
and but one thing that I did want to
point out is that down here that's that
code that I showed you earlier which
actually creates a connection
okay so that's pretty much what you need
to know about room to complete the steps
of the codelab so you will complete the
steps now to make that database there
steps two to seven there is a short link
for you so that you could get to the
code lab and there are actually can all
of the TAS just raise their hands and
kind of like wave around a bit and if
you want to look around you kind of see
in the back of the room we have a bunch
of TAS you know you could do this code
lab at home so one of the useful things
about being here is like you actually
have knowledgeable people around to help
you so please if you have any questions
go ahead and raise your hand so we're
gonna give you about twenty minutes
right now go ahead and get through as
much as you can and then we'll start the
life cycle portion of the lecture in
code lab
okay so I want to talk about a few more
additional room features that weren't
covered necessarily at the code lab
itself okay so one is the ability to
auto generate auto generate IDs so if
you want room to auto generate IDs for
you that's pretty simple right next to
your primary key you can just use the
annotation attribute Auto generate set
it to true it'll start incrementing for
one and just go up for you as you create
new objects now room also supports down
methods with parameters for more complex
queries such as the one that you see
here with this where clause this query
returns words that start with a given
substring as you can see within the
actual query itself you just use the
column name as a word and then when
you're actually using the parameters you
can refer to it in the query string by
putting a colon in front of the exact
parameter name and that's how you would
use a query in your string so as you can
see we have a single parameter called
substring here and I'm referring to it
in my query string just by putting a
call in front of it and writing it as
plain text so finally I mentioned that
room has this cool feature of compile
type checking so here is our working
query but let's say that you know it's I
was jet-lagged a bit and I typed
something incorrectly like doored which
is not a column that exists if I do that
and I try to compile I'll actually get
it error that looks like this and maybe
some of you saw this if you type
something exactly but that tells you
exactly what the problem is so that you
could go and solve that before running
into a runtime error okay so that
finishes up the basics of room there's
plenty more to learn and I encourage you
to check out our documentation but I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
repository class next so we're moving up
in our diagram here the repository
functions as a clean API for handling
all data operations in our app because
our data back-end is pretty simple it's
just a database it's just going to be
communicating with the DAO and making
the database for you but in a more
complicated app the repository functions
as a mediator between different data
sort
it's like you might have so you might be
able to imagine an example where you're
getting both data from your network
server and you're also getting data from
a local data cache the logic about
whether to grab new data from the server
or use the local cache data and when to
do additional fetches all of that
complexity would be inside of the
repository and what this means is that
when your UI code needs some data it
just says hey you know get me the list
of words and it doesn't have to worry
about all the complexity of life should
I'd get this from the network or should
I get this with local data cache or
whatever else you might have there so it
hides that complexity of where the data
is actually coming from from the rest of
your app okay and that's actually all
for the that's it for the repository the
repository isn't part of the library's
again it's just a best practice but
we're going to have you do that in this
code lab because we're following the
architecture so let's go ahead and jump
into the lifecycle library so there's a
couple of core classes and concepts that
you're not going to use directly that
you should be generally aware of the
first of those is that in the lifecycle
library we now have an actual object
that represents a life cycle in Android
and it's just called the life cycle or
life cycle similarly we have the idea of
a life cycle owner a life cycle owner is
an object that has a life cycle for
example an activity or fragment and as a
support library 26.1 app compat activity
is a life cycle owner so you could
actually get its life cycle object from
it if you'd like finally is the concept
of lifecycle observation
so you can actually make a lifecycle
observer it's a interface for observing
life cycles so if you've ever had
listeners or services that require you
to write some like cleanup code and
onstop those listeners and services
could be using lifecycle observation to
be doing that clean up for you so you as
a dev that is using those libraries
don't have to do it yourself so that's
something if you were writing classes
like that and you'll also see an example
of how we kind of do this lifecycle
observation later when we talk about
live data
okay so let's go ahead and move up and
talk about view model so if you've
watched the material that I've written
put out into the world that you probably
know that view models provide UI data
for components while also surviving
configuration changes an example a
common example of a configuration change
is rotated your device or changing
languages as well so because view models
survive configuration changes they can
replace async task loader x' more
importantly though they encourage you to
have this separation of responsibilities
that I was talking about before so one
of the Commons that you know early
Android developers or potentially
mediate Android developers might find is
that they end up putting a bunch of code
in their activity class and they know
ends up with a very bloated activity
class so what this architecture suggests
for you is how you might be able to
divide out that code a little bit more
intelligently so in the view model class
we suggest that you have all of your UI
data and then leave the activity class
just to be responsible for actually
drawing that UI data so why is that
useful for us well let's go back to a
time before view models when you had
your activity instance and it contained
all of its you know variables of UI data
itself
the thing about activities is that they
don't live for a very long time if
configuration changes are happening so
let's say that the user rotates the
phone okay this means that the activity
instance is destroyed and then it's
recreated now the android framework is
smart so it will attempt to save some UI
data for you so for example the current
text in a textview is automatically
bundled up for you and on saved instance
state it's delivered to the recreated
activity but if you have some UI data
which is kind of specific to your app
and it's not necessarily immediately
shown in one of the UI components that
won't be automatically bundled up for
you so most of you have probably used
auto saved instance state to save this
data but it requires you to do that man
you'll you know bundling up serializing
and deserializing of that data which can
be annoying
if you forget to do it you will end up
at this state where you have not
actually passed your full UI state on to
the recreated activity and that'll
create bugs for your end user or
potentially even crash the app okay so a
simpler way to do this would be to use
the view model object where this is not
a problem
so as you can see here my activity data
is no longer in my activity I've moved
it over to the view model and my
activity gets the data that it needs to
be able to display itself by
communicating with the view model now as
I said before view models survive
rotation or what configure all
configuration changes so if a
configuration change happens are
typically still dies and is recreated
but importantly that activity UI data
did not go with it and all that my newly
recreated activity has to do is
reestablish connection with the same
view model which continued living
throughout so here's what the example of
what the view model code looks like
importantly to make something a view
model you either have to extend view
model or Android view model and the only
difference is that Android view model
gets a reference in its constructor to
the application class if you need it so
as we saw the diagram the view model
knows about the repository which is why
we have a variable for that there and
view models also contain all of the UI
data well what UI data do we need for
this app the list of words therefore
that list of words is in the view model
and because we're essentially creating a
one screen app we're kind of doing this
shortcut where we're creating the
repository in the view model but in
cases where you have more than one
screen per app which is probably the
case for all of the apps that you're
working on you probably also want to
make a singleton for the repository and
use dependency injection to get it
inside of the view model using
dependency injection means that you can
easily mock your view model and this
makes sorry easily mock the repository
which makes the view model incredibly
easy to test okay and I was hiding this
code from you before but you'll also
additionally have the getter there and
probably this insert method so your
activity needs to be able to actually
access the data so because my
a list of words up there is private I'm
creating together for it notice how it
is returning live data and it's not
returning just the list of words this is
important later because you're going to
be accessing the live data in the
activity similarly you will have methods
for dealing with any kind of user
interaction that the user might have
with your activity so the activity will
not be responsible for to make any of
the processing itself when you insert a
word it will immediately tell the
viewmodel hey a word has been inserted
and that'll be the review models
responsibility to decide what to do with
that ok and you'll notice that our main
activity knows about our view model so
let's see how it it does that so the
code to setup that association looks
like this and you'll notice that you're
not constructing a new bottle there so
this code happens in oncreate and yeah
you're not going to need a new view
model you're using a provider class and
that's getting you the correct view
model reference because remember when we
recreate the activity we need to
re-establish a connection to the correct
view model so view model providers
provide a view model for a given
lifecycle scope so basically a given
associated activity and to identify what
activity you want to associate get the
view model for you have to put it in
there as a parameter
and in this case we're saying hey I want
the view model for this main activity
and finally you just need to tell it
which of your model class you want so I
have a couple of additional notes about
the view model lifecycle so view models
survive configuration changes but they
don't survive the activity being
finished ok so they're not like a
permanent thing that stays around
forever they're linked to an activity
lifecycle but they're not linked to like
the app lifecycle or anything like that
so when the activity finishes such as if
the user presses a back button or if
they go to their overview screen it
actually swipe your activity off the
screen the view model will also be
destroyed as well so a view model does
not replace having a database or
persisting your data it's pretty
transitory an important thing to realize
too because I want you guys to avoid
having bugs in your app is that view
models are not a replacement for odd
safe instance
even though they seemed similar and that
is because unsaved it so if your device
is very stressed out because there's a
lot of like memory constraints going on
and your APIs at the background it's
possible that the OS will just kill your
app and unsafe dances state is actually
useful for surviving this total app
destruction view models do not survive
this they also get destroyed therefore
in those cases you still need to use on
safe and so say to get your UI data your
UI state back to what it was before so
this is fairly complicated so I've
written a blog post that talks about how
you use together persistence on state
into the state and a view model to be
able to restore that state and you could
go ahead and read that if you're
interested ok so the final step is to
see how we get this connection where the
view model is actually communicating its
UI data back up to the activity via
observation and it does this with live
data which I've mentioned about a
hundred times at this point so in your
Dao we have a little bit of
foreshadowing we we already saw that
we're using live data here so live data
is a object that is a data holder class
and it's also a lifecycle where it also
allows for data to be observed and what
do we mean right that well many of you
might already be familiar with the
observer pattern but I'm going to go
over quickly in case you are so with the
observer pattern you have a object
called a subject and that subject will
have a list of associated objects called
observers that basically register with
the subject and say hey I'm interested
in you please tell me when you change so
then when the subject state changes some
of that causes it to change it knows
about that list of observers so it'll
notify all of them and it will usually
do that by calling a method that is
inside of that observer object so live
data follows this pattern almost exactly
so in our case the live data is the
subject and you will be creating objects
called observers which aren't the
observers as far as where these things
are located observer objects will
usually be located in the main activity
if we're talking about UI updates and
live data or sorry observer objects will
be created at the main activity
and live data is obviously located the
view bottle in this case so in the main
activity you will call observe on live
data which will set up that connection
between the observer and the live data
and you will create a new observer
object then because we've set up our
live data to work with room when the
database state changes the live data
updates and then the live data will tell
all of the observers that it's updated
and the observers will call this on
changed method now because we have our
observers being Stan cheated or made
activity at least in this case those
observers could easily update the UI of
the main activity so what the end state
of this is is whatever the database
state changes that our main activities
of data gets you I automatically without
us having to call anything else at that
point okay so the observation code looks
like this remember how I said that get
that getter in our view model we're just
returning a live data well it's doing
that because we need the live data in
the activity so here we are getting the
live data we are calling that observer
method which sets up the observation
relationship we're making a new observer
object and when we make a new observe
your object we have to define the
unchanged method and in that unchanged
method we're doing a UI update and this
means that whatever database data
changes that method is gonna be called
and as you can see it's taking our
adapter and telling it to update the
list of words that it's showing and you
also notice how the type of live data
determines the parameter that on changed
method of the type of observer that you
have there and it matches now one more
thing that you might notice is that the
observer takes in your activity so why
is it taking in your activity also known
as a lifecycle owner well that's because
of this other property of live data
which I mentioned very sort of quickly
which is that it is life cycle aware and
this has to do with lifecycle
observation which I mentioned before
so live data actually uses lifecycle
observation it observes a lifecycle to
make sure that it only notifies
observers
when they are in a started or resumed
state okay
so what this means in practice is that
because you associated your activity
with that specific observer it will only
update your activity if it is in a
active State if it is actually on screen
so it will never notify your activity of
UI changes if it's off screen which is
probably what you want because you don't
want your off screen activity to be
updated its UI in addition the live data
knows how to cleanup observers when
they're no longer needed so if the
activity that's associated with the
observer is destroyed the observer will
clean itself up which means that you are
never in a case where your live data is
updating a destroyed activity and this
makes it so they could not gonna have
memory leaks so this observ'd method is
actually pretty powerful it's again
setting up that relationship so that
your observer and your activity are
linked together and your observer your
live data can be life cycle aware of it
okay so to reiterate live data actually
has a lot of benefits it is important
for creating reactive UIs which are you
is that automatically change when
underlying data changes it's also life
cycle aware so it only updates the UI
when the UI is actually on the screen
and it cleans itself up automatically
you'll notice how there was no on stop
method that's a life cycle stop
observing or anything like that that's
not life cycle observation and actually
if you are creating your own libraries
and you know people need to call some
method and onstop you could use the same
life cycle observations that live data
does to get that same sort of capability
and finally it allows for the database
to be able to communicate back up to any
sort of UI controllers without the
database they needed to know about those
who are controllers which is very
powerful when your UI controllers are
being potentially destroyed cool so this
again is our whole architecture there
and with that you're gonna go ahead and
continue on in the code lab and actually
implement live data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
