KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Good evening.

Are you all awake?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Are you really awake?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Are you tired?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
AUDIENCE: No.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Oh, thank
you very much for overcoming
the tiredness to come here.
How many of you are
from the GDG community?
Oh.
How many of you are there from
the Developer Student Clubs?
Awesome.
How many of you are
certified [? LMNE? ?] Nice.
Thank you very much, folks.
And this is a community
session, so we're
going to spend the next
30 minutes with a series
of Lightning Talks.
My name is Karthik Padmanabhan.
I'm part of the
Developer Relations Team,
representing the
team, and I'm trying
to moderate this
30-minute talk, which
is going to be very quick,
snazzy, four-minute format.
And we're going to try
to get through this
with a little swiftness
and a lot of speed.
So before we get
into these talks,
I just want to very
quickly set the context.
For every particular
lifecycle in a developer,
we have some Google Developer
programs available to you.
So if you are a
student in a college,
you can check out the
Developer Student Club.
You can become a
community leader.
You can get more
members into that,
and you can get going with that.
Or if you feel that
you want to be employed
and you want to get the
right kind of employment,
you can go looking for the
Certified [? LMNE ?] Program
out there.
And some of you have already
gone and checked that out.
And then you can
eventually get into a stage
where you're actually
a professional
and you want to work.
You can become a part of the
GDG Network, Google Developer
Groups, and become a
member, become a leader.
And we are going to have some
series of talks from that.
And eventually, if you feel--
especially all the womenfolks
out there, how many of you
are there?
Please raise your hands.
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
Ooh.
Give them a big round
of applause, guys.
Thank you.
And so you can all become a
woman tech leader, Techmaker,
and a leader--
a WTM Lead-- as part
of the WTM program.
And then we also, for people
who really spend a lot of time
and build a lot of expertise
and want to go ahead and share
that knowledge, we have a
platform called the Google
Developer Experts.
You can go out
and leverage that.
And then finally, we
have a startup program,
and you can become
a launchpad member
as a part of the program.
This is all these programs
across the entire life
cycle of a developer.
And you are able to connect
with any of these programs.
You can later connect
with me or the team
to get more details on this.
So with that, ladies
and gentlemen,
please give a big round of
applause for Christy Anoop
to come on stage.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

CHRISTY ANOOP: Good
evening, everyone.
My name is Christy
Anoop, and I'm
the Lead for
Developer Student Club
at CMR Institute of Technology.
Well, I'm a full-time
Information, Science,
and Engineering
student who spends
most of his time outside the
class than in the classroom.
Now let's not get into what
I do outside the classroom.
In fact, I help my friends
and I mentor my juniors.
This is what I do.
Today in this
presentation, I will
be going through what
we as DSC Leads do--
our roles and our
responsibilities.
The Developer
Student Club program
is a massive network of
190 Developer Student
Clubs all across the country.
From approximately 100 cities,
these Developer Student Leads
were handpicked by Google after
rigorous rounds of interview
from application pool of
1,000 plus applications.
We strongly believe that
these DSC Leads will have
a high impact in the society.
Now let me briefly go
through what we do.
We are students.
We learn, and we keep learning.
We learn from the
amazing material
provided to us from Google--
beautiful material-- and
we share this knowledge
through workshops.
These workshops are not only
open for novice developers,
but also open to
advanced developers
trying to further their skills.
These workshops are
custom-designed for the type
of audience that
enter the workshops.
And by the end of
every workshop,
we make sure to provide
them material directly
from Google from which they
can continue self-learning.
And trust me, we have received
amazing, tremendous feedback
for these workshops.
And we will be providing
more and more workshops
in the coming months.
Now students have become
technically strong.
They know how to
code, but they will
have to implement
it somewhere, right?
They're going to help
local businesses,
local entrepreneurs,
and local organizations
help run their businesses
more efficiently,
and help them make more
money at the end of the day.
This is one of the beauties
of the Developer Student Club
network.
All this takes place
through communication.
They go to the local
businesses, find out
what their problems are,
and develop mobile and web
solutions for them.
Now these are not big
organizations or businesses,
just small businesses.
And they come up with very
simple solutions to help them.
And in this entire journey,
the Developer Student Leads
and the students not only
become technically strong,
but they also learn business
analytical, business
communication, as
well as soft skills.
And most importantly, they
learn real-world problem-solving
skills.
How awesome is that?
Now students know everything.
They're technically strong.
They know the ins
and outs of business.
They also know how
to communicate well.
They're more open to
employability opportunities.
They're more open to full-time
internship, as well as
freelance project opportunities.
How awesome is that?
That's really amazing, isn't it?
This is one of the main aims
of the Developer Student Club
network--
to help students, to help
them make more employable.
And finally, we
would love for you
to be a part of the Developer
Student Club network.
Please contact the email
addy on the screen,
and you will be connected to
your nearest Developer Student
Club in your city where you can
provide mentorship, training,
and also help students
solve real-world problems.
We look forward to seeing you--
all of us on our campuses,
helping our students,
helping local organizations,
and helping evolve an
amazing place to live.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Wow.
Christy, I have a--
awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome.
Thanks.
Thanks, for this
passionate talk.
CHRISTY ANOOP: Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: I really
appreciate all the great work
you're doing for the Developer
Student Club program.
So what has been one of those
important moments for you,
managing this program at CMR IT?
By the way, he's
in the fourth year
Information Science at CMR IT.
CHRISTY ANOOP: Yeah.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
What has being
a memorable moment for you?
CHRISTY ANOOP: So this
program has completely
transformed me, Karthik.
I am not the person
I used to be.
So I used to be a bit
of a selfish person.
But after coming
to this program,
I completely changed
into to a new person.
I won multiple awards.
But when students who you
taught in your workshops
come back to you after a
few weeks, after a few days,
with their own application, you
feel a sense of accomplishment.
This is a type of reward
that I've never felt before.
So this is what I love of the
Developer Student Club network.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Thank you, thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give him
another round of applause.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you.
CHRISTY ANOOP: Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Thank you, Anoop.
CHRISTY ANOOP: Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thanks.
CHRISTY ANOOP:
Thank you, Karthik.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
So let's move
on to the next very
important program--
Google Certification, Google
Developer Certification.
Before I call on
JP, how many of you
have gone to the
Certification Lounge?
Wow.
That's awesome.
Thank you, very much.
So we have a Global Lead for
Certification, JP and Kamal.
Take it away, JP.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

JP SOUCHAK: Hello, everyone.
We're here to talk about
Developer Certification.
Who wants to hear about
Developer Certification?
[CHEERS]
All right.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Ooh.
JP SOUCHAK: Do we
need it louder?
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Yeah.
[LAUGHS] Ooh!
JP SOUCHAK: Woo!
Developer Certification.
Woo!
All right.
I'm JP.
I'm the Program Manager for
Developer Certification.
And we launched Developer
Certification at I/O in 2016
with the purpose being
to help close a gap
for employers that are looking
for talented developers
and developers that
are looking for jobs.
In this, our mission
has been to create
performance-based certifications
that are industry standard
and help developers gain
recognition and advance
their careers.

Since we launched
the program, we
have created Associate Android
Developer as a certification,
Mobile Web Specialist
as a certification,
and there's more to come.

We've certified approximately
1,700 developers
in over 90 countries.
300 of those developers
are Indian developers.
[APPLAUSE]

In addition to the
numbers, there's
also been some impact in terms
of promotions, jobs, career.
Alumni are reporting new jobs,
additional opportunities,
speaking opportunities.
It's making an impact.
Some of the testimonials
we've basically received
speak to this, and there's more.
So this is just a
brief overview to set
the stage for a certification.
What I'd like to do now
is introduce Kamal Vaid.
Kamal is one of our first
Certified Android Developers,
and he's going to speak
about his experience
with the certification
program and what
has happened since that time.
KAMAL VAID: Hello, everyone.
My name is Kamal Vaid.
I'm a Google Certified
Android Developer
with having experience of
five-plus years in Android.
Currently, I'm working with
Infosys Limited at Chandigarh
as Tech Analyst.
I first heard about
this program at I/O,
and I was super
excited because I
found a way to test my skills.
So I completed my
certification back in 2016,
and it has benefited
me personally,
as well as professionally.
By personally, I mean I was
looking for a job in 2016
in good organizations,
before my certification.
Once I completed my
certification, I got noticed,
visibility, and
got more job calls.
So it helped in a way.
If I talk about
professionally, I'm
a smart, professional engineer,
subject architect, and working
in different programs.
That includes reviews,
app management,
and different activities
in an organization.
I'm getting more visibility
in my current organization
due to my certification, as
I am the only certified guy
in Infosys [INAUDIBLE] region.
There are more benefits
associated with certification,
as well.
From organizational
point of view,
every organization want
to have good talent,
having good, technical,
sound knowledge
under the belt, right?
So they are using
certification as a filter
nowadays to conduct
quick interviews.
If you are a certified
dev right now,
you will definitely have
an edge over others.
There are some other benefits
related to certification
that I have got.
I want to share that.
Social-- if you are
a social person--
ever since I have
completed my certification,
I have been called
by many universities,
colleges, students, to
come over their place
and work as a trainer,
to guide them and tell
about the certification
program and how they
can go about the Android stuff.
So for example, I have been
called by GDG [INAUDIBLE]
for DevFest recently.

So here's the link.
If you are interested
in this program,
you can go over this
link and find the stuff,
and go step-by-step.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Please,
ladies and gentlemen, please
give JP and Kamal a
big round of applause.
[APPLAUSE]
And please keep the
certification momentum
going across.
And there will be a lot of
new certifications coming up,
so stay tuned and keep
track of what's happening
in the certification world.
So moving on to the next talk.
Are you guys having fun?
Is it interesting?
Is it breaking the monotony?
Yes?
No?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Huh?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Yes?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Yes?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
OK, so let's
call my next speaker, who's
from the favorite part
of the country called Jaipur.
Vikas Bajpai is going to
share his thoughts and views
about building the
Google Developer Groups.
So without much ado, please
welcome Vikas Bajpai, ladies
and gentlemen.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

VIKAS BAJPAI: Hello, Karthik.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
[INAUDIBLE] All yours.
VIKAS BAJPAI: Hello, everyone.
AUDIENCE: Vee!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
So one of the prime benefits
of being a GDG member
is you get a huge fan following.
[LAUGHTER]
So I am VIkas.
The entire country is in
search of Vikas these days.
Jokes apart, I am Vikas Bajpai.
I'm the organizer of GDG Jaipur.
It's in Rajasthan.
When we talk about GDG, just
wanted to get to know that--
how many of you are aware
about this term, GDG?
Right.
So many of you.
So basically, GDG gives you a
platform where you can talk,
you can share, you can interact.
And of course, you can
have some good food, right?
Looking at my
health, you can have
trust on whatever I'm saying.

So if you talk about Google
Developers Group in terms
of the presence all
across the globe,
we have 700-plus Community
Groups in 107 countries,
with 300,000 people
associated with these groups.
And it's huge.
It's huge.
And it's supported
by 2,000 organizers
all across the globe.
And if you talk about
Indian context--
so what we have here
is we have 21 chapters,
which is supported by
n number of developers.
Some of the developers are
sitting in this audience,
as well.
And we are able to reach
75,000-plus people.
If you want to know more about
this Google Developers Group,
or if you want to open a chapter
in your city or in your region,
you can visit
meetup.com/pro/gdg.
All the activities
which are performed
under this umbrella, or
the Google's umbrella,
are absolutely free.
And of course, I
would like to see you
in the future events, which will
be organized by these chapters.
If you want to get more insight
about the Google Developers
Group, you can
interact with some
of the awesome GDG
organizers who are sitting
in the community lounge.
Some of the people
are sitting here only.
And you can also reach
out to me, as well.
[CHEERS]
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Ooh.
VIKAS BAJPAI: Hope
to see you soon.
Thank you.
AUDIENCE: Vee!
[CHEERS]
[APPLAUSE]
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Hey.
So what you forgot to tell
is that 75,000, all of this,
or all 300,000 is from India.
So please give yourself a
big round of applause, guys.
This is a big chunk of community
out here in this great nation
[INAUDIBLE] here.
Thank you, very much.
Keep that going.
So because most
important thing is
that-- so you've been serving
the community for how long now?
VIKAS BAJPAI: Since
last five years.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Please
give another round of applause.
Five years.
[APPLAUSE]
VIKAS BAJPAI: Thank you.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Five
years doing a volunteer
work is a big, big deal.
Thank you, very much.
VIKAS BAJPAI: Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: So
what is that one thing
that comes across in those
last five years which you want
to share with the audience?
VIKAS BAJPAI: OK.
So after every event, we
collect the feedbacks.
And we get the inputs
from the audience--
that means the attendees.
And even a single attendee
says that the event was useful,
we get a satisfactory
smile on our face.
And that keeps us motivated.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Thank you, very much.
Ladies and gentlemen--
VIKAS BAJPAI: Thank you.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: --that's
Vikas Bajpai for you.
Please give him another
round of applause, guys.
Come on.
Give it.
Give it.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you.
OK.
So now I have the great
honor and privilege
of calling on
stage, Sukriti Paul.
Sukriti Paul is a fourth-year
Computer Science student
from Manipal Institute
of Technology.
She also happens to be
the Women Techmaker Lead.
And she's been
doing an awesome job
making sure that a lot of
women get into part of the WTM
community out there in Manipal.
Without much ado, let's invite
on stage Sukriti Paul, guys.
Please.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

SUKRITI PAUL:
Thank you, Karthik.

To begin with, the
WTM Program basically
provides an ecosystem which is
built on visibility, community,
and resources for women tech
enthusiasts around the globe.
Visibility means that it gives
us a platform to showcase role
models and also showcase
the achievements of women
technologists.
Community is the human component
which basically helps us
in building networks, sharing
our knowledge and motivation.
The Women Techmakers
program also
provides us with resources
which help in career development
and building one's technical
skill set so that the women can
become industry leaders.
The Women Techmakers chapters
across various cities
set out to build roadmaps
to accomplish our mission.
And our mission is to
proliferate the participation
of women in technology.
Back in 2012, Megan
Smith started this
as a part of Google
I/O. And today, it
is led by a global
team of Googlers
and headed by
Natalie Villalobos.
So with over 4,350
participants and members
and 27 active
chapters in India--
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Ooh!
SUKRITI PAUL: --Women Techmakers
assumes seamless functionality
and coordination.
And the numbers keep
growing by the day.
Now, let me talk a little
about the initiatives.
Our in-house activities include
meetups, speaker sessions,
hands-on sessions,
workshops, lightning talks,
and mentorship programs.
Some of the communities also
promote progressive learning
while on collaborative projects
to help our members step
into open source ventures.
The Women Techmakers program,
this year actually, we're
glad to announce
that this year there
is an overall 25% women
participation in the DevFest
season 2017.
[APPLAUSE]
When it comes to
the global programs,
the Women Techmakers group
promotes and encourages
women to participate
in signature events,
like IWD, the [INAUDIBLE]
India Conference, and the Women
Techmakers Lead Summit.
Propagating Anita Borg's
vision of 50-50 by 2020,
the WTM Scholars Program
selects and empowers
individuals who show an
excellent academic performance,
outreach contribution, and
have technical knowledge.
Women Techmakers has also
partnered with Udacity
to provide 100 scholarships
for fully certified courses
for the women in technology.
Now, I've spoken
about the WTM story,
and I request all the women--
and the men, of course,
everyone in the room--
to engage with us.
Our social media and Twitter
handle is WomenTechmakers.
You can join the movement
by registering as a member
at www.womentechmak
ers.com/membership.
The benefits of being a member
is that a global team actually
curates these resources, and
the content is emailed to you.
So for the experienced woman,
there is a separate program.
And they can actually
register as Influencers
where they mentor startups.
And they mentor individuals
based on their expertise.
So do join the movement
that is centered
around inclusion, diversity,
and equal opportunity.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thanks.
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give her
a big round of applause.
Thank you, Sukriti.
[APPLAUSE]
A quick question for you.
What's been one of the
biggest challenge for you
as being a WTM Lead at Manipal
Institute of Technology?
SUKRITI PAUL: So
thank you, Karthik.
One of the biggest
challenges for me is that I--
my chapter is a
college-centric chapter.
So designing events which cater
to the needs of all the four
years of college, starting from
the freshers to the final year
students, it has been the
biggest challenge for me,
because there's a huge
variation in technical skill set
over the four years of college.
Having said that,
another smaller challenge
was the scheduling
of events, because
of the college timetable clashes
and different study hours.
We come from a
residential college,
so I think these
other challenges.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thank you.
Please.
SUKRITI PAUL: Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: You
are doing a great job
in spite of these challenges.
Thank you very much.
SUKRITI PAUL:
Thank you, Karthik.
[APPLAUSE]
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
And another thing
is that thank you, for you and
all the WTM Leads out there,
for making it one of the
most diverse tech conference,
at least Google [INAUDIBLE].
SUKRITI PAUL: Do join us.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: --in
this part of the world.
Thank you, very much.
[APPLAUSE]
OK.
So before I get carried away--
I know I have a lot
of time pressure,
so Soham, my great friend who
has been my partner in crime
in a lot of these
Software India events,
which we did together for the
last six months in 15 cities,
over to Soham Mondal, who is
a Google Developer expert,
giving a lot of his knowledge,
sharing a lot of stuff
with community and developers.
Over to you, Soham.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

SOHAM MONDAL: Hi, everyone.
I'm Soham, and I'm
a Google Developer
Expert for User Experience.
And I'm here to talk to you
about the Google Developer
Experts program.
So Google Developer
Experts is basically
a global network of experts
in these three focus areas.
The first focus
area is technology,
which includes technologies like
Android, web, cloud, and so on.
The second focus area
is product design,
which includes the various
disciplines of product design,
design strategy, and so on.
The third focus area is
growth and monetization,
which includes marketing,
branding, distribution,
and so on.
So to be an Expert,
you have to be
an expert in some
of these areas,
and you have to undergo a
thorough evaluation process.

So currently, there are about
450 Experts in the world,
and just 13 of them
are from India.
I believe this is not truly
representative of the amount
of talent we have in
the country right now.
Right?
So I really look forward to
having more Experts from India
join the program very soon.
So what do Google
Developer Experts do?
The short answer
to that question
is, Google Developer Experts
contribute to the community
in a very positive way.
And this could be
in one of many ways.
For example, I have
friends who are Experts
who write great blog
posts, and their posts
have lots of views
and followers.
Other Experts contribute
to open source
in a very, very prolific way.
They have lots of followers
and stars on GitHub.
Other Experts mentor
startups and actually help
decide their future.
More recently, I've also seen
Experts doing live streams,
and that is a very,
very interesting trend.
In general, Experts are
all about helping people
and solving problems.
So in case you're interested in
learning more about the Experts
program, please visit this URL.
Feel free to also
reach out to me
or any of the other
Experts in the room
if you have any questions.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thank
you, very much, Soham.
SOHAM MONDAL: Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: So
what's been your learning
after mentoring so many startups
and sharing a lot of expertise
on UX and Android, building
apps, doing the [INAUDIBLE]
tools?
So what is that one thing
that sort of struck your mind?
SOHAM MONDAL: So before
joining the program
and before joining
Software India,
I was able to contribute to my
community here in Bangalore.
But after the initiative, I
was able to travel to various
cities in India, like
[INAUDIBLE],, [INAUDIBLE],,
and so on.
And then I think I've
been able to make
an impact in the lives of
designers and developers
across India, which is
something incredible.
I'm very thankful
for the opportunity.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thank
you, very much, Soham.
Ladies and gentleman,
once more, Soham Mondal.
[APPLAUSE]
So we're going to get to the
last part of the Lightning
Talk.
We have the last speaker.
So Shrinath has been involved
with the Launchpad Mentorship
Program for many years.
He's spent thousands of
hours mentoring startups
across the various
formats of Launchpad.
And I wouldn't want to steal
the thunder away from him,
do let's invite on stage,
Shrinath V. Shrinath,
come on up.
[MUSIC PLAYING]

SHRINATH V: Thanks, Karthik.
Good evening, everyone.
My name is Shrinath, and I am a
Product Management Consultant.
I used to head product
management for maps
for a range of Nokia phones
till about four years ago,
and then I quit.
And then I used to write a
lot in product management
on LinkedIn.
Someone at Google once
saw what I'd written.
And then they called
me and said they're
going to start this whole series
of programs called Launchpad.
And would I like to come
and be a mentor there?
And that's how my journey
with Launchpad started.
So what really is Launchpad?
Launchpad is a program
that Google put together
for startups to help them with
various queries that they have.
And realizing that startups have
very different challenges early
on and later, the program
is structured differently
for early-state startups,
as well as mature startups.
So for early-stage
startups, you have
the Launchpad Start and
the Launchpad Build,
which is a two-day or
a five-day program.
Largely, what it does
is it helps startups
come back and reflect
on a lot of things
around how they're
building their products,
how they're doing
their marketing,
and brainstorm with
a bunch of Googlers,
as well as industry experts
across product, UX, marketing,
or technology.
For later-stage startups
or more mature startups,
there is also
Launchpad Accelerator,
which is a six-month
program, which usually starts
with a two-week,
really intense sit-down
where you sit down with people
and do the same exercise over
and over again and walk away
with clear targets of what
you are going to do over
the next six months.
Now what's in it for startups?
Launchpad offers a
great way for startups
to really work with some of the
best mentors across the world
from Google and from elsewhere.
And much of this is
customized to the life
stage of the startups.
When you're very early on,
you're looking at saying,
how do I grow?
And how do I really
build a market share?
But later on, you end
up having queries of,
is this the right
team structure?
Do I want to move to
a different geography?
What do I do around that?
And Launchpad lets you
brainstorm not just
with experts, but
other startups as well.
The team of Launchpad mentors--
many of us have worked
across geographies,
so we're able to sit down
with startups in some country
and come back and say,
hey, you know what?
Maybe some other country--
some startups solved
it another way.
So why don't you learn?
So there's a great opportunity
for cross-pollination.
The impact of
Launchpad program--
the Start and Build-- there have
been over 500 mentorship hours,
and rated very
highly by startups.
It's rated about 4.6.
And the Launchpad Accelerator,
which is a six-month program,
startups there have raised
over $62 million of funding.
Personally, it's been a
great learning experience
as a mentor, because we get
to see very diverse startups.
And it's a great
connect-the-dot opportunities,
working with startups
across different domains,
as well as working with
the different communities.
So working with other
mentors and seeing,
what are the different
perspectives that they bring?
How does a UX mentor look
at it, versus how does
a marketing mentor look at it?
Or a product mentor?
Or a tech mentor?
And just synthesize all of this
and try and help the startups.
For me, it's also
been a great way
of giving back, helping others
see a little clearer by being
a third-party view to reflect
on the problem that they have.
So if any of you
have startups, I'd
strongly encourage you
to apply at this point.
The Twitter handle is
here-- @GoogledevsIN.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thank you.
Thank you, Shrinath.
Before you--
[APPLAUSE]
Yeah.
So before you go--
so you've been spending so
many hours mentoring startups
over, maybe, four years now?
SHRINATH V: Yeah.
About three or four years now.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
Three or four years.
So what's that one thing
which has struck you
in all those four years of
being associated at Launchpad
and mentoring startups?
SHRINATH V: So I've done
mentorship sessions in India,
in San Francisco, in
Istanbul, met startups
from across multiple countries.
I remember this one
time we were sitting
with this startup
which was working
for house help in Mexico.
So they were trying to build
a community of house help
and a market place for them.
And so we were sitting
and brainstorming
about this whole thing.
And they were looking
at elements of saying,
how do you make sure that we
get the first visit from house
help?
And then we started
brainstorming around this
and realizing the emotional
value of having someone
trusted at home is far
higher than something else.
So that brought an
entire shift to the way
they looked at the problem.
So for me, looking
at the startups
and then just helping them
reflect on the problem
and see differently,
that's been a big thing.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thank
you, very much, Shrinath.
Thanks, for all your
significant contribution.
Keep it going.
Thank you, very much.
SHRINATH VS: Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN:
So with that--
just before I thank
you all, I just
want to quickly
wrap up the session.
So we heard about
six Lightning Talks.
There are six gorgeous programs
from Google Developer Group.
What's the first one?
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

give back to the community,
you have the Launchpad program.
That's the six flagship programs
from the Google Developer

So now I'm shifting gears here.
So now, I'm going to do the role
on behalf of the GDG Call Team.
And the boss of

not only from Bangalore.
It's been a kind of
a global event, which
is a great surprise.
We have a lot of people
from outside of Bangalore.
Across India, we have a
very good representation.
And more importantly, we have
a lot of people from outside
of India.
There are many countries.
I don't know the exact numbers--
we'll publish it at some point
in time--
but there are a lot of
people from outside of India.
Please give them another
round of applause, guys.
We welcome you.
[APPLAUSE]
It's great.
We look forward to having you
again, and again, and again.
Thank you, very much.
So with that, so let's
enjoy a brief video of what
the exciting times we had
together over the last two
days.
Let's roll the video, please.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- This is the first
GDG ever in India.
And this is the
largest Developer event
that Google has
held in India, ever.
- We're living, breathing,
eating, sleeping, and writing.
And this is the
first time the event
is happening in Bangalore.
So many of the people we
have seen on online videos,
we've seen them in person here.
That's a different
kind of a feeling.
- Well, our purpose of being
here is to know what's next.
Firebase [INAUDIBLE],, we
know that is a future that
is going to change things.
So we want to make our
developers [INAUDIBLE]
with those technologies.
Programming is
like math, that you
need to practice a lot
to gain the expertise.
- There was a session that I
attended in the morning, which
was about design.
It was new for me, and that is
how I can improvise my work.
And also, [INAUDIBLE],,
which I didn't know.
So many things that you could
do which you didn't know.
