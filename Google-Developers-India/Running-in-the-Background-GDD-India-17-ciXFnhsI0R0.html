many of you are with professional
Android developers writing apps right
and I'm sure you must have heard about
Android oreos background restrictions so
this talk is about background in general
and I will actually start from basic
concepts and cover some use cases and
lot of best practices my goal is to
cover everything in Android background
and I hope that after this talk you'll
have a good understanding if you are
having some some questions or some
doubts about that area there's also a
very fast-moving talk so I'll move very
quickly if you have any questions you
feel free to get me after the talk let's
get started so what does people actually
mean when they say running in background
in Android there are different views to
it so there could be running off the
main thread on a background thread so
that's one very common use case when
people say running in background or it
could be running for a short time after
the user has left app so you still want
to do some processing when the user is
not actively interacting with the app or
this could also be a case where app is
not even visible not even there but you
are reacting to a fcm a firebase cloud
message or a broadcast or even an alarm
they could also be a requirement to do
some kind of periodic sync with the
server so you may want to run it when
your app is no more there but you may
want to periodically wake it up run
something get some data back or this
could be some other schedule job of some
other kind not necessarily network but
something else or it could even be
playing music or doing something like
that for which you may need a foreground
service even though technically not
background but essentially in that case
the user is not interacting with your
app so I almost categorize this as a
background use case but let's take a
step back and see how the system that is
the platform views the app in these
scenarios and that's the process state
I'm going to talk about for a little bit
here so there is a foreground state of a
process where if you're running an
activity and it's in the resumes
the platform sinks s of your process to
be in foreground this could also be the
case when when a service is actually a
on on start is called on the service for
a very brief time there could also be a
visible state of the process where where
the euro app is running it's visible to
the user but it is not actively doing
anything it could be like pause is
called unpause is called on your
activity or you're running a foreground
service it could also be a service
process where nothing is visible nothing
is running but your service is running
in the background and that's called the
service process and then also a cached
process which is not so commonly seen
but it is the most commonly seen process
state by the system so if you have in a
device you have dozens of hundreds of
apps running chances are that most of
the processes are actually in this cache
state but the first two states are
important for this discussion because
when I talk about background
restrictions these two states are the
states which are known as the foreground
state when the system sees the process
whether it can run a service or not so
I'll come back to it in a little bit and
then I already talked about the cache
state but most of the most of the
process is running on the device will be
in the cache state at any given time but
let's just move into no concept of
threads so of course in Android there
are various ways of doing threads and
generally speaking there are four main
types of threads in Android of course
Android developers will be familiar with
the UI thread or the main thread this is
the thread on which your app runs this
is the thread where all the callbacks of
the systems are called from the system
is called and this is where the UI
updates take it is the only thread that
can actually do a UI update on the app
there's also these minder thread which
are also system threads they are usually
seen only in the case when you have a
bound service and that bound service is
called by an external process some are
just some of the service some other app
calls into that bound service or you
have a content provider where some other
process calls into that content provider
all of these calls happen on system
provided binder threads so binder
threats are only useful or applicable
when you are having inter process
communication
not usually seen in most of the use
cases of the apps then there are
so-called platform managed worker
threads and I called them platform
managed even though there are regular
threads because there are some
constructs provide by the framework that
enable you to create those threads think
like async tasks or think like intent
service which you use the system API to
call to create them but there are just
regular threads but the number of
threads are somehow limited by those API
surface and then there are app control
worker threads in which you can create
your own thread pool you can even like
if you're using async tasks you can use
your own executor service right there so
you can basically create your own worker
threads anywhere you want at any given
time your app runs mostly on the worker
threads the UI thread or binder threads
are mostly for system callbacks so as
any Android developer would know you
want to quickly go over to your worker
thread and do anything you want to do
which is slightly long term on those
threads
alright with that they're different
concurrency and async constructs
provided by the framework of course
there is well-known async tasks which is
a convenience way of moving the content
from are moving the processing from main
thread to worker thread and back and
forth there are some issues with async
tasks I'm not going to too much detail
about them most of the issues are the
way people use it the leads into some
kind of either memory leaks or some
other issues but that aside there's also
a loop or handler mechanism in Android
this is one of my favorite ways of doing
threading in Android it's also very
central to Android I don't see that this
being used very often in apps but if I
were to give you like a 30 second update
on what this really is a looper is
nothing but a thread with a message
queue that's all there is to it so it
says a message queue and the looper is
just tight loop on that message queue
and handler is a piece of code which is
actually interacting with this looper so
you on them on the handler you have code
to send message to that message queue or
process message from that message queue
so that's all there is to it so with
these two we could pretty easily create
a worker thread creates its own message
queue and then run a loop on that our
Android app really is nothing but a
looper it's a looper which is getting
messages on it so called
why thread or main thread that's all
basically they're central to Android in
some ways you could also use your own
executive service if you're using Java
you create your own thread pool there
there are a lot of convenient libraries
that provide worker thread for you you
don't have to do anything there so like
retrofit provides some background
threading for networking if you're using
are it's chava of course there are
convenient ways to create worker threads
you can you can observe something on a
worker thread and then it emits message
back to the main thread
there are schedulers that you can use to
to switch between different thread pools
so they're various ways of doing
multi-threading and they're much more
I'm just covering some of them but what
do these constructs really have to do
with the states that I just talked about
and a little bit so there are of course
process states I talked about them and
there are also component States so your
activity goes through a straight
transition your fragments and your views
and so forth nothing you can essentially
create as many threats as you want but
the process States and the component
state is only governed by what the user
is doing with the app and how the system
is viewing your app so between these two
things you can have as many threads but
the app can easily go into the cache
State even if your thread is actively
doing anything so each of these
multi-threading issue multi-threading
approaches have very similar issues to
deal with no matter which approach you
take they run into similar some of them
provide abstractions to help with those
whereas some like async tasks make it
easy to make common mistakes but similar
there are very similar concerns so
activities fragments and views as you
know are routinely destroyed and
recreated so you rotate the phone the
activity goes away and anyone is created
so if you're doing multi-threading you
have to be aware of that you have to
make sure that you're not holding on to
the stale reference of an activity which
just got destroyed if you're running a
background task you may also want to
stop that task when it does not need it
so so your main activity goes away or
your main processing stops but you may
want to stop the background because you
don't want to continue to burn battery
for no reason at the same time which is
more likely if you started some
processing you may want to preserve that
work somehow you don't want to just
completely no stop that and throw away
the work that was done in last 5 seconds
or so so you want to do all of that
so the question is how do we actually
deal with that but before we do that
what are we really trying to do with
this so as I mentioned the most
important thing that Android developers
deal with is to get off the main thread
get up the UI thread and do something on
the on the worker thread that's easy but
then you also have to post a result back
to the worker to the main thread so that
you can actually show something to the
user on the UI that's the very most in a
repetitive pattern you will see and
that's the reason why you look into all
these multi-threading aspects so let's
take a simple example and walk you
through this a sample in which it's a
really simple sample you can sort of
apply it to any other example that you
have where you have a a p' in which it
is getting the latest value of a stock
from the network server and you want to
show it to the user whenever the stock
changes so in this case you would want
to start a background thread because you
want to fetch something from the network
you want to periodically get the stock
price you want to update the UI but only
update when the UI is visible so you
don't want to try to update when the
activity is no longer there or the
fragment is hidden or something like
that you also want to survive rotations
or configuration change in general so
you don't want to kind of crash or
destroy something or leak something so
you want to do that you also want to
preserve the work so assume that you
downloaded the latest value of this
stock and you're running some algorithm
to kind of do some calculations on that
you have done that on a background
thread and you want to you want to
preserve the work you want to throw it
away even when the and the app goes away
at least for a few seconds but you would
also want to stop cleanly when needed so
you don't want to run you know forever
you don't want to run unnecessarily so
you want to stop also so as you can see
even in this simple sample you have lot
of these requirements that almost
everyone has to contend with and there
are various ways of doing it and this is
where people make mistake so with this I
want to introduce a best practice to do
these things using Android architecture
components yesterday you may have
attended a talk where we talked about
architecture components in depth there
was also a ilt or training that was
there on architecture components here
I'm going to give you a brief like very
high-level overview of that and if you
miss the training yesterday or session
yesterday I would recommend you go back
and listen to it again
at a very high level I'm just talking
about to module or two components here
for for architecture components view
model and live data a view model here
I'm using almost as a holder for live
data objects and the live data is
essentially a lifecycle of air component
where it is tied to a widget or or a
view element on on the activity and it
knows when to update that so it
automatically updates because it's aware
of the lifecycle of that component
that's a very very high level and as you
can see the scope of the view model the
view model is associated with the
activity but not the instance that is a
critical difference here so even if the
activity instance is created and
recreated the view model will survive
that so it survives the entire lifecycle
until the activity finally goes away
they use a clear set up or finish as
call or system kills it but in any other
case the v-model preserves the the state
of the of the of the data alongside the
lifecycle of the of the activity and I
said live data is life cycle aware so it
knows when when is a good time to update
the UI so with that high-level
background let's just look at some code
here so yesterday if you had attended to
the talk we talked about different tiers
of architecture of best practices so to
speak and one of them was a repository
which is which is basically a set of
classes which deal with getting the data
either from the network or from the
database and making the data sane for
you in one place so this is really a
naive sort of implementation of that I'm
calling it stock manager and in this
what I am doing here is I am creating a
worker thread I'm using a handler thread
class in Java in Android sorry which
creates a worker thread for you and
essentially what I'm doing here in the
handle message is there is a listener
that is attached to it and I'm calling
that listener every time there is a
price change in this case I am only
incrementing it but but in the case of
price plus plus you can think of going
to the network
and getting that value because this is
running in a background thread there's
also this request update method which
somebody will call a client will call in
and they attached a listener to it
and there's also this remove of
where the client goes away and they
remove their listener and I'm actually
using handler dot post delayed here
which is resulting in sending the
message to myself where I am checking if
there are no more clients if there are
no more clients and I'm actually
stopping all the work so it's pretty
straightforward way of actually cleaning
yourself either giving some time or
looking at the state of your clients the
good thing about this class is that it
has nothing to do with Android this is
pretty standalone repository kind of
class which you can test in isolation so
with this I am able to start a
background thread and I am able to
periodically get the stock price update
a view model as I said is a is a class
that associated is associated with the
activity and all I am doing here with
view model is using it as a holder for
my live data live data is actually just
a piece of data that is holding on to
the stock price the live data class is
little more interesting so first of all
here I am creating my listener remember
the listener that I associated that I
attached to my stock manager I am
creating it here and whenever the
callback is called I'm doing a post
value a post value is his live data
method which is used from the background
thread to update the value with the
often of the live data object and then
we have these on active and on inactive
callbacks the on active callback is
called when there are active observers
to this live data and I'll show the
observers in a little bit but as long as
as soon as they're in an octave observer
and on active is called so I'm
requesting the updates to my stock
manager and on inactive is called when
there are no more active observers and
in this case I am removing the listener
from it if you remember in the in the
stock manager class I'm actually
removing I'm stopping the work there if
you look at the activity class there is
all I'm doing here is basically getting
hold of a view model and this view model
is the one that I said is associated
with activity in general and then we
have I'm creating an observer and this
observer with this observer I'm
observing the live data which is there
so this is where I begin to get the
updates whenever the library changes
so that's all there is to it eventually
so you can see there are three dear
model a repository a view model live
data and my main activity class alright
so as you can see with very little line
few lines of code I'm able to achieve
all of this pretty easily I'll share
this slide deck and some code after the
talk with you so West practice here is
to use any background thread mechanism
you want but be aware of the UI update
issues and also component and process
life cycle so that's the key here but
people say okay what about intent
service so there is intent services
should be which we have been using which
essentially is nothing but a hybrid of a
handler thread and the service component
which is a very nice way of actually
doing some background work however
intent service is just a started service
and started services don't run freely
anymore
with Android Oreo with Oreo the service
will stop very soon after your app is
not in the foreground and you cannot
start a service if you are not in
foreground so app can be in temporary
white listed there are some states
define whether you're handling a high
priority GCM message or or using
handling some kind of an SMS in those
cases you are in a temporary whitelist
and create a service but that's very
very rare and most of the cases you will
not be able to start a background
service from background so what is
foreground again so if I if you remember
I showed you the states here here is a
more comprehensive view of it I not run
through every line here but at a very
high level you can see that there are
only two states where the app is
considered to be in foreground so there
is an activity running in a started or a
resumed state or a service which is
running with a start fro ground other
than these two your app is mostly in the
background State so in other words
unless the user is actually seeing
something you are in background and in
background you cannot run a started
service including the intent service so
if you if you're wondering what how do I
know what my state isn't you can always
run dump says command shown here in this
example I was running a background
service with the foreground activity
when I ran with the rally for the first
time the first line I was my my my state
was foreground and the process state was
stop - activity and the second one was
when the
activity went into the background and
the service was still running and the
last one when the service was actually
stopped so but what are we really trying
to do with background services in
general so a good example for that is
that I was running and running in my app
and I was running something in the
background and the app goes to the
background but I still wanted to finish
what I was doing I want to continue what
I was doing I want to just stop it right
there
for a little bit more time so with that
I want to introduce a best practice for
using a job intent service if you're not
familiar with Jordan to intent service
this is a new construct added in support
library 26.1 the way it works is that if
you use job intent service in the prio
devices it runs as a normal intent
service so it behaves exactly the same
if you're familiar with intent service
if it is running on or later devices it
a job is dispatched via a job dispatch
just job scheduler @nq method and it
will start almost immediately because it
uses a new method which is called set
override deadlines with a zero there so
it will immediately start processing
almost as if it is a job as if it is an
intent service so here is a simple
refactor if you are if you're familiar
with intent service you can easily
convert into a job intent service by
just you know extending image or intent
service instead of car causing calling
start service use NQ work instead of
having on handle intent as your callback
use on handle work as you call back and
in both the cases you will be called on
a worker thread so the worker thread is
automatically created for you so it
basically does the same thing as intent
service except it is more robust on and
backward-compatible as well so for any
background work that you wanted want to
ensure finishes after your app is no
longer visible use job intent service so
but if you really want to use a
background service for something
different like for example syncing of
data so your your app is no longer there
it's no longer visible but you still
want to sync data periodically or you
want to sync data after some time that's
a valid use case but be aware of those
and those and app standby so this was a
new feature or a feature that was added
in marshmallow and it's been
progressively you know increasing
in complexity where the if the screen is
off or stationary and not plugged in you
will not get any network access and the
way clocks are ignored and so forth so
I'm sure you're aware of it are not
going to too much detail here but be
aware of that so even if even though you
want to run something in the background
chances are that you may not be able to
do what you want because of these
restrictions here amount introduced job
schedulers I'm sure people you are
already familiar with Java scheduler but
real quick it is for any background work
that you were using a started service
before I would strongly recommend to use
a Java scheduler now why because it
works well with the doze maintenance
windows you will get complete network
access and everything else you wanted it
to in a very nice and efficient way
using job scheduler you can also specify
conditions when you want your service to
run so you can say what network type
needs to be there or what should be the
retry policy in fact with ovn added some
new constraints in which you can
actually say that run only when there is
a certain battery available run only
when there is enough storage available
on the device so you can have additional
constraints to run your job that's
really really valuable so for most
longer running background work for which
you are using a started service before
use job scheduler for ground service can
also be used for a user noticeable
longer running task which does not need
user interaction so an example of this
could be a media app so you want to play
some music or something like that or a
navigation app where you want it to be
running basically even when the screen
is off user foreground service you may
also promote a background service to a
foreground service by calling start
foreground service or new method defined
in context new as a different context
sorry creates a foreground service while
you are in background so you can do that
in Oreo and above but the most important
takeaway from this is that do not
surprise the user so you should not be
using foreground service when the user
is not expecting it because foreground
service will need to be will need to
post a notification to the user so when
they see that they'll they should be
able to relate to it that's yes of
course I use this I I need this let it
run
I'll just quickly skip over a few things
here syncadapters is another Android
construct which you may already be aware
of but I'm just I'm talking about it
very high level because this is sort of
a legacy mechanism it is somewhere
somewhat cumbersome to set up and it's
only useful if you are already using
content providers and the content
providers essentially is again another
another Android component we should
really only be using when you want to
expose your content to another app on
the device if you don't have a use case
to actually exposing your content to
another application you really should
not be using content providers so you
know instead of that you should use a
combination of Java scheduler room or
something some similar library for your
database and you don't sync logic so
that that would what I would recommend
if you're not already using some
adapters another important construct for
background is alarms use them sparingly
as I said it is a system-level service
which you can use to send a pending
intent to your app and it can be
triggered within exact or exact times
but remember that your app may actually
be in background or when handling a
pending intent so if you are starting a
service before you will not be able to
do that anymore you can though send a
broadcast to your receiver and while you
do that you can post a notification to
the user so if the user interacts with
your notification at that time you can
definitely start a service or you can do
something something else like with the
notification you can take the user to
some activity like they were expecting
something in the feed the activity or
you can even start a foreground service
if that makes sense for your use case
you can even schedule a job with job
scheduler with alarm and you may even
use or set alarm clock functionality for
a user visible clock event but like I
said for all of these cases you have to
be very careful to use alarm manager for
only when you really want to be doing
something at a specific time but for all
other cases I would say use job
scheduler again this is a very useful
construct which system managers really
really efficiently and you will be able
to do most little things that you're
doing with either service or alarms
using job scheduler so really high level
are not again go into too much detail of
this chart but this tells you what is
actually happening when your device is
in
standby or light doors and doors mode
most important takeaway from this is you
can see here is that there is no network
in any of these states you do not get
any network even though you your alarms
may fire even though your your your app
is called back but you don't have any
network so there is really no useful use
when you actually are in let's say doors
light mode and your alarm fire so try to
stay away from those scenarios and make
use of Java skitter again I'll wrap this
talk up by talking about firebase cloud
messaging so every high level there are
two types of firebase Cloud messaging
messages a notification message and a
data message and both of them can be
sent with normal and high priority a
normal priority FCM messages are patched
for those maintenance whereas the high
priority FCM message can interrupt those
and have standby however you should only
use a high priority FCM message when it
is absolutely critical to notify the
user about something for example a new
email has arrived
or a new text message is arrived let's
talk about some best practices here real
quick do not use high priority FCM
unless it is the user critical I already
said that once you should use normal
priority FCM messages for any
notification message for any minor user
update for any data updates and this is
very important for any data update even
if it is like a sync message to your
device or your app try to use the
payload of the f3m message itself this
is very battery efficient and you you
will be able to do a lot with 4k so try
to send all the payload to your app and
then the app can update itself over time
if it is absolutely necessary to fetch
any additional data after an FCM message
then either use the job intent service
or scheduler job to get that data but
again always notify your user when you
are using a high priority message so
today it is possible to not do that but
as you know that Android is moving more
and more towards scenarios where we
don't want to surprise the user we want
to preserve the battery so expect that
these there will have more restrictions
on these lines so you know be prepared
to handle FCM message in a way where
you're actively notifying the user as
soon as you have a high priority message
so with that I will very quick talk I
actually covered a lot of ground on
various backgrounds and areas but with
all of these best practices
I would I would urge you to go back and
look at your app again and try to see if
you can fit in on in any of these best
practices if you still have any
questions or concerns or if your use
case doesn't fit into these things that
I'd mentioned today feel free to talk to
me after this session I'll be here and I
also be at the office hours thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
