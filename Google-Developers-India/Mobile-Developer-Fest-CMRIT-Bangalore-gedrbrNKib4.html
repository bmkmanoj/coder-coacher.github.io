WILLIAM FLORANCE: Approximately
65% of users in India
are using the internet only
through their mobile device.
But only 9% of professional
developers in India
are developing for
mobile, even though India
is a mobile-first country.
So what's happening?
We think it relates to skilling.
VANDANA JAISWAL: Let me take you
through some of the initiatives
that we are doing in India.
We have launched a course called
Android Developer Fundamentals
Our channel.
We have a channel,
Google Developers, India.
There is a lot of content
there on progressive web apps,
mobile development Android.
If you go to our
YouTube channel,
you'll hear some success stories
from our certification alumni.
Also, how it got them
jobs in the market
in the very first place.
[CHEERING]
KUNAL CHAUHAN: I got my
certification in November.
In January, recently,
like, eight months back,
I got a job at [INAUDIBLE].
PRIYANKA SRIVASTAVA: The
University Innovation Fellows
Program empowers the student to
come up as an agent of change.
CHRISTY ANOOP:
We've all been here.
This place.
Canteen.
By the time you buy your food,
the bell has already rung
and the classes
have already begin.
So can we solve this
using a mobile solution?
Yes, we can solve this
using a mobile app.
AMRIT SANJEEV: This is a
market that you cannot ignore.
And the advantage you folks have
is that you are in this market.
SPEAKER 1: How many of
you are excited to build
your first application?
LALIT SINGH: Hello, everyone!
Make some noise.
Are you guys excited?
[APPLAUSE]
Great.
Once you have the
basic app structure,
you will start building
up your first app.
In this core lab, you
will learn about a concept
called recycling.
Now we're going to
have swag questions.
Which [INAUDIBLE]
class object is
used to save data, and
cite your preference?
SPEAKER 2: A.
LALIT SINGH: Very good.
So can we have swag?
That's it from me.
I hope you enjoyed
the core labs.
Thank you, guys.
You have been great audience.
