having a lot of fun is a very exciting
event you all have a lot of energy and
it's really great to be here
my name is Silvano I'm a developer
programs engineer on the actions on
Google and Google assistant develop
relations team and what we are going to
see in the next 20 minutes or so are
some of the my favorite features like
things that we added to actions on
Google since we announced it almost a
year ago if you missed the overview of
the action zone group platform yesterday
my colleague Daniel umbria sutiya Nagi
gave developing conversational apps for
the Google assistant using actions on
Google Talk it's on YouTube I strongly
recommend you to watch it if you want to
see a more organic description of the
platform so let's start with a little
bit of history of the platform it's
almost one year old we announced it on
December 8 2016 which means that next
year next week we'll it would be our
first birthday and what we told you was
that you could start extending the
Google assistant by writing up using
actions on Google initially they would
work only on the Google own speakers at
i/o in May is when we did the second
batch of announcements where we are the
things like support on phones using the
assistant app and transactions and
payments preview and then if you see
like in this second Dolf of our first
year of life the platform is starting to
get momentum there's more announcement
and the scope of the announcement is
getting larger and larger and we added
more locales
so I think now we support 16 locales we
added the speakers to fund transfer we
added easier a personalization SS ml
and we will see in some more detail like
a lot of this feature so let's start by
looking at this highlight reel of my
personal favorites I divided them into
two groups the first group is three
things that we did to make your life
easier to make the life of anyone that's
trying to develop an app on actions on
Google easier starting with actually
making extremely easy for you to create
certain type of apps
perhaps there are trivia games where you
ask questions to user and you score them
based on the number of correct answers
that they get after there are
personality quizzes where you ask them
questions that get a score against trait
of their personality so that at the end
you can tell them oh you are very brave
and also you are very good or stuff like
that and flashcards which are apps where
basically you can ask yourself a series
of questions to reinforce the learning
of a certain topic that you are studying
you don't have to write a single line of
code you don't have to design a single
turn of a conversation of a voice user
interface we have implemented all of
that for you and the only thing that you
need to do is provide content in a
Google spreadsheet from by copying a
template that we will provide to you but
let me show it to you let's see how I
can create a trivia quiz here on stage
in two three minutes I'd say so
this is the actions on Google console
it's where you start when you want to
create an app on actions on Google if
you are already familiar with it you can
recognize the first three options of the
standard options dialog flow or converse
the AI if we want to delegate the
natural language processing to one of
these two services or action SDK if you
want to take care of the NLP on your own
the second row is the template and let's
try with the trivia associate so
let's start building one trivia the
first thing that we did for you is we
built different personas so different
ways that your agent can present itself
to the user and you can get a preview of
how these are different in the way they
have background music and in the way
they talk to the user so for example
let's write the regal Queen we have
audio formed me that this game has come
to an end
my advisor will now calculate your
results so this is how the regal Queen
sound and if you want to try the robot I
call that a right answer I guess that's
the end now let's see how well you did
and so on and basically you can see like
how your app will sound like to the user
let's for our app choose the regal Queen
go to the next day this is where we are
asked to upload our content using one of
the sheets and so if we just press we
get the link to the template that we
have all we need to do is make a copy of
this template and wait for Google Docs
to load and this is basically how
creating a quick look you just have a
series of question a series of correct
answer an incorrect answer
we're with suggestion chips we will
propose all of the treat to the user and
then on some question you can even have
a follow-up to get them maureen's on
what could be the correct answer if I
wanted to add one here let's say it
could be a true or false
silvano as a long beard and the correct
answer I guess is true and incorrect
answer is false
so once you change the content the only
other thing that you need to change is
the name the title of your app in the
configure
raishin because of course we cannot have
duplicate and especially you cannot use
the same title that the template itself
s and so we could call this GD d India
trivia game and now and then all I need
to do is copy the URL of this sheet go
back it next paste it and upload it now
the template is validating the content
our content was uploaded successfully we
can go on and create the app and once
the app is created we will be able to
test it
I almost there
there we are so now I can click test up
and this is I don't know if you've
already seen it or if you know it this
is our simulator that we have any
actions on Google console that allows
you to test your app all your apps at
this point if you have the assistant app
on your phone or if you have a speaker
and you're logged in with the same user
that you use to create the project you
could also test this app on the phone or
on the speaker the standard deviation
for an app and the test is talk to my
desktop and let's see what happens
sure let's get the test version of my
test app
it is my honor to introduce you to GDD
India trivia game it is time to run the
gauntlet let's begin your first question
is here the TV show American Idol aired
for how many seasons anyone wants to try
fifteen let's see
Wow dependents question number two let's
get me up are the official languages of
Canada okay I guess we can stop here but
the game is there and it's working and
the other thing that it's interesting at
this point is if you wanted to proceed
and publish this app all you need to do
is go back to the overview you need to
add some information for the app this is
things like what is the name of your app
what are some of the branding
information like the logo if you have a
website where you want to link the user
to a privacy policy if you need one but
for the templates we have a standard one
that you can just reuse and then you
would be done what would happen if you
actually proceeded is Europe will be
reviewed in a faster queue and then it
would be published and available to
everyone and so these were templates did
I say three minutes was it three minutes
was it like more five maybe but pretty
fast right so going back to the
presentation the next thing that I want
to talk to you about that we make easier
is personalizing your app and this is
very important because when you want to
use it is having a conversation they
want it to be personal and more
important because it's an assistant they
want to feel like that there's the app
knows what their preferences are and we
observe developers and there were most
of them storing the information that
they needed in external database one
very good candidate was firebase which
is still like a great solution to do
this but we really wanted to make the
life much easier when he came to store
in the user preferences and so we are
did an API to do that an example use
case is imagine your app is providing
weather report to the user one of the
first thing that you will ask probably
is where they live like either by
getting a zip code which wikipedia tells
me is a postal index number here is that
correct yeah and that's for example
something that you don't really want to
keep
King your views that all the time you
want to ask it the first time they start
the up and then you want to remember it
forever giving them a chance of changing
it if for any reason they move to
another country or simply another house
and so the way you would do this now
with this new art that we've added the
first time that you actually get at this
zip code you will ask permission to the
user can I remember this information
that you've just given me for the next
time and then if they confirm if they
reply yes you can save it into a JSON
object that can have like all the
structure that you can give to a JSON
object so you can add arrays you can add
other nested objects all the depth that
you want and then just save it and we
would just be sending it back to you all
the time so that all the time you can
access that information and so for
example like in the next time that the
user is using your app you can also
check if you already have that
information and skip all the code that
is asking them can I get that
information another thing that we added
is an SS ml simulator I don't know if
you are familiar with SS ml SSM L stands
for speech synthesis markup language
it's an xml-based language that
basically allows you to give us some
text and then our agent will read it to
the user what you can do with SS ml is
not as controlled the text what you want
us to say to the user but also how you
want us to say it to the user you can
add music you can add sounds and there's
many more cool things that you can do to
give Europe and much better and more
engaging experience it was hard to test
it because we didn't really give you an
easy way like you had to write some of
the XML that you wanted to try then put
it in your app run your app and listen
to it and what we did is we added an
audio tab in the simulator where you can
just put the XML that you
and test it and see how the agent would
be reading it so for example if we look
at this first example we have some speak
we have a sound at the beginning is a
sort of a cartoon sound and then we are
looking at changing the rate of the
speech we are looking at change in the
pitch of the speak and we are loading a
change in the volume and then there's
other cool things that we can do like we
can read the number as an ordinal so
instead of saying 1 it will say first
and then we can spell a word and this is
another thing that I just show you let's
hear it so this is the simulator that I
was talking about it's in the actions on
Google console simulator you have this
additional audio tab and now all you
need to do is copy and paste your XML in
here and then you will see how the agent
would render it so let's listen to this
one hi or you can make it low you can
make it loud you can make it quiet for
all three things at once but first you
can make me spell colors like blue B lue
adit this to try yourself so we missed a
little bit at the beginning but you got
the gist do you want me to replay it to
get it better
yeah hello with SSM Ellen you can make
speech fast or make it slow you can make
it high or you can make it love you can
make it loud you can make it quiet we're
all three things at once but first you
can make me spell colors like blue b lue
adit this to try yourself and basically
now you're free to experiment with all
the things that you want to do and then
when you're happy the XML that you have
you can actually incorporate it into
your app so let's moving back to the
presentation we now move to the second
group of things which is things that we
are
like new functionalities that improve
the quality of the art that you can
write allowing you to do very cool stuff
and the first one is still s SML and we
added some elements that will allow you
to do sound layer so basically you can
have different tracks that you can mix
at the same time so that for example you
can add a background music that goes in
the loop while you are telling you what
to do or while you are asking them some
questions and the other cool very cool
thing about this element is you can
define relations between the different
elements so that for example you can say
I want this block to start two seconds
after this other block or I want this
loop to be played until the end of the
speech and the next example that we have
is imagine like the quiz game where you
want to give like some background music
while you are asking some questions to
your user and what this example is doing
is exactly that we have a loop that is
playing the loop is playing until the
end of the speech and then we have a
question that is asked some ins that are
given to the user with some breaks to
pause waiting for an answer and then
finally will give the answer with a
minute additional emphasis and this is
another one that it's better enjoyed if
we actually listen to it
when was Wikipedia launched was it 2000
or 2001 or 2002 what is your answer it
was 2001 Wikipedia was launched on the
15th of January 2001 two days after the
domain was registered by Jimmy Wales and
Larry Sanger and so if you see like you
can give a pretty good atmosphere to
your app by using like changing the
inflection of the voice having more
control on how your agent present itself
to the user but also adding background
music that makes the experience in the
atmosphere much better can we go thank
you
the next thing I wanted to talk to you
about is a is a feature that I like a
lot and it's a feature that allows you
to transfer a conversation that started
on a speaker to a phone and you might
want to do this for two different
reasons one is in some cases maybe you
start on the speaker but then you want
to show an image to the user and now you
can do it by saying eh can I use your
phone to show an image that will better
convey my message or in some cases is to
give them like a better user experience
so for example like when you want to
complete a transaction or a payment and
it was a little bit like this in
practice when oh this is actually
showing one of my favorite use cases
where you're ordering food like imagine
you are in your living room you're
watching your favorite TV show or you're
watching some sports you want to eat you
don't really want to cook you want to
get some food delivered you can start
asking what you want to get on this
figure you can complete your order on
the speaker and then when we're moment
to pay comes the app can just transfer
your conversation to your phone and you
can finalize the transactions on your
phone and the code is quite easy like
there's two parts to it
the first part is requesting the surface
transfer to the user the way it works is
we have an API that allows you to check
whether the user has a device with the
capability that you are requesting so in
this example you want someone that has a
screen output if they have it you can
ask the user a can I transfer to the
phone giving a reason I want to do it in
this case for example because I want to
show you some sample images and then in
the next step all you have to do is
under the user response and so if
they've given consent to you to transfer
to the new surface just show the image
and if they didn't explain them I'm
sorry but I cannot proceed if you don't
allow me to do this the last thing I
wanted to talk about is a very recent
addition this was announced in November
15 and it's updates and push
notifications so feature that allows you
to ring gauge with your user it's in a
Developer Preview right now which means
you can test it you can use it in your
tests up you cannot yet use it in your
production app we have two models of
reengagement one is daily updates so you
can ask your user if they want to
subscribe to receive daily updates from
your app so for example let's say you
have an app that is selling jobs and you
want them to receive a job new job every
day you can use this feature and your
system will automatically pull an update
from your app every day the way it works
is you need to configure on the actions
on Google and intent that you want to be
called when they receive the
notification and then there's a utility
function asked to register daily update
for that specific intent and if the user
consent you basically are ready at some
point you will start receiving everyday
requests from Google one thing that is
important here is there is no guarantee
that even if you ask the user to
register they will see this request
Google will decide when to show it to
the user and basically we want to make
sure that a user is engaged with your
app before we present your request
because also this means that for you
there's a much higher chance of them
actually wanted to subscribe to receive
the updates the other model is a more
standard push notification model that
allows you to send a synchronously
updates to the user whenever you have
content that you want to push and so for
example imagine you have an app that is
tracking tasks that the user might have
to do one of these tasks would be they
have to pay a fine because they parked
in the wrong spot it's one in one week
the fine will expire they haven't paid
it yet you want to let them know that a
you have one week to pay this thing
anyways pretty much in the same way like
this is more or less exactly the same
code that you've seen there's two main
difference the way you ask for for the
permission is a different function in
this case is ask for update permission
you still need to specify an intent that
you want to use for this and then once
you get the consent you need to save the
ID of the user in a data base like
firebase or whatever is that you are
using to store data for your app because
that user ID is how you will be able to
target the user to receive the
notification when it comes to sending
the notification it's an HTTP API this
is an example of how you would send a
notification using some JavaScript code
but basically you just need an access
token that you generate from a service
account you just need to structure the
JSON payload of the notification which
is quite simple you just need a title
and then the user ID of the user that
you want the target and the intent that
you've enabled for push notification and
then it's just an HTTP request
when they received a notification the
notification appears as a system tray
notification and the Android app and
when the user clicks on it it deep links
into the conversation using the intent
that you specified for the notifications
so that was it those were like my six
highlights from the things that we've
added if you are interested these are
some resources that you can use to keep
an eye on what's happening on actions on
Google our developer community our
developer developer documentation and
the Twitter account thank you for being
here with me and not going to lunch I
guess and the last thing is if you have
any questions on these or more we will
be at the sandbox the assistant sandbox
for the afternoon so just come and ask
us question thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
