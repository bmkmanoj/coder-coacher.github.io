my name is Sarah Clark I'm the program
manager for web developer training at
Google in Mountain View California and
my background just really briefly is
I've been teaching developers since 1989
I was the first training engineer hired
at Google at Google no sorry Apple
uh-huh messed up already okay I was the
first one hired at Apple hopefully the
editors will fix that it was how did
Apple and I've worked at Hewlett Packard
and VeriFone and a few startups you've
never heard of and then I went up Acuto
about two years ago so my specialty has
always been training software developers
and my team and I wrote this course so
it's going to be a pretty busy two days
let me give you a look at what the
schedule looks like first off there's
the course materials but you have a
piece of paper on your desk so that same
information so you'll be able to pull it
up from there what we're doing today
we'll do an introduction both just
introduce myself introduce you
we've done that we're down there why
build progressive web applications so
we'll give a bit of reasoning for why
you want to build pwace new techniques
for responsive design so a lot of people
let me just ask this question how many
people in here when you think responsive
design use something like bootstrap
right almost every hand in the room so
it turns out that's one way of doing it
but there's some other ways of thinking
about it that might be better for mobile
so I'll tell you what our designers in
Google have said in terms of thinking
about responsive design that part of
responsive design is dealing with images
and until recently they were kind of
tough to deal with and they were often
the single largest thing in your page in
terms of weight so we'll work with
responsive images being able to
automatically select the best image for
your screen size so the smallest most
useful one
well then probably right around
lunchtime talk about a couple of core
technologies that you might have seen
might not have seen yet called such and
promises these are new technologies in
JavaScript that make it easier to get
files from the network and form the
basis for service workers so then after
that we'll do it quick introduction to
service workers and then a quick
discussion what's called the offline
QuickStart how do I take an existing
application and convert it into a PWA
and there's a lab there so you'll
actually take an existing website and
make it work offline and it's actually
pretty fast and easy we'll then use the
lighthouse tool to audit an existing
site so we'll take a look at yo use odd
white house we'll look at what the
site's doing and make it better and then
finally we'll talk about different PWA
architectures what are the trade-offs
that you need to make when you're
building a progressive web app now this
is what's scheduled today and if I look
at the actual schedule spreadsheet what
it says is is that this ends about 4
o'clock so depending on how you're
feeling and how time is going we may
pick up one or two things from tomorrow
morning because then that means that we
can pick up some advanced technologies
that don't normally get into the 2-day
course like push notifications so I may
add one or two things at the end of the
day but that's so that tomorrow I can
give you things you wouldn't normally
see I think we can pack everything in on
this course including the extras if at
any point you have questions you want to
know something just speak up you don't
have to wait for the end of a talk I
would much rather you ask me when you're
not sure about something because you're
just going to learn better and frankly
if you're wondering about it probably
everybody else in the room is too so
don't be shy
ok let's talk about why build
progressive web apps well we're going to
start with a little bit of deep history
just because it's entertaining around
1822 this is the difference engine you
could argue this was the
first computer Babbage built it
basically to compute differential values
the thing is that was it a computer with
one application and it took almost 200
years to build the next application I
don't think you want to take 200 years
to ship your app so things are getting
faster so let's move up so about 150
years
anybody remember these yep
few people a few people are saying what
is that are you young uns so the floppy
disk so this was you know back in the
early 80s 90s where to get an
application you would go to the store
and you would buy a box and some of the
bigger applications needed ten of these
disks you could buy a map on cd-rom good
luck getting it updated but you know you
could get a map you could do planning
you could put things out pan and scroll
pan and zoom great but you know terrible
if you had to get it on the go but we
didn't have Wi-Fi we didn't have you
know the wireless network we just had
phones that were the size of big bricks
so move forward a few more years and
Google Maps comes out works on the
desktop works on your phone pan and zoom
did you have to go to the store and buy
this nope it was just there on the web
and that in a nutshell is why we like to
progressive web apps so much because
somebody doesn't have to go to a store
and buy it now in some phones you can't
even go to an app store you buy the
phone your things are side loaded the
time you purchase it and that's it so
some of those phones have maybe three
apps for life but they still get to the
web and so as a developer as a developer
agency if you want to get your app in
front of people and get it installed
nowadays often your only Avenue left is
to install it off the web and the web
has gotten a lot faster right it used to
be kind of flow but the JavaScript
engines have gotten really good at
speeding things up we have native
capabilities nowadays we can build apps
that
scroll display at 60 frames per second
they look just like a native app and
they feel like one too so that is very
very short nutshell progressive web apps
are about but let's dive a little deeper
so we say the hardest problem with
software is distribution right getting
it your customers hands and that's why
we like the web so much but even then so
we're here we're in Bangalore we have
good connectivity what happens if you go
out in the countryside right maybe you
don't have connectivity or it's
intermittent so you want something that
works not just when the network works
right the web used to be you had to be
on the network all the time but you had
nothing so progressive web apps have a
built-in cache that you as a developer
control that lets you cast things
offline and there's a database in the
phone so you can even pull data and hold
it there
how many of you have actually played
with Flipkart Lite or even used it right
about half of the room so Flipkart took
all the features of a native app and
actually put them in a web application
and you can shop you can buy things you
can look at product and if you go
offline it remembers the things you've
looked at you can still look at old
orders you can still look at things you
browse before it still works when you're
offline a really good offline app you'd
even be able to compose the order and
then when you went online have it pop up
a notice saying hey I see you're back
online you want to send the order now so
we're working on solving the problem not
just a distribution but of an app that
works even when your network doesn't so
let's talk about usage for a long time
there is this huge debate web app versus
native app and the market tended to lean
towards native apps and I don't I don't
disagree because they were sexy they
were fun and I used to teach iOS
development so I used to stand on that
side of the aisle and if you look at it
people spend 87 percent of their time on
average in native apps
versus 13% of their time on the web so
you might think oh well why am I even
looking at a web thing well as I said
sometimes you get phones with only a
couple of things installed but 80% of
time is spent in the users top three
applications so if you're not one of
those top three native apps the chances
are you're not even going to get seen
but if we look at capabilities here the
web's kind of has been locality data
that's been pretty high capability but
the reach of a net so the reach of a
native apps have been fairly low once
it's installed three or four of them
maybe get used whereas the web has a big
reach and the same time that people use
three or four native apps they'll use
over a hundred different sites on their
phones so much easier to become one of
those sites and then if you can become a
site that installs like an application
with that kind of speed and ease you can
get people to come over and use you and
that's what progressive web apps are
about is really bridging the capability
of native apps with the reach of the web
this is one example I really I probably
should have replaced it you tell us a
little old talk to you about Bernie
Sanders so this was taken back before
the u.s. election this is the Washington
Post they built one of the first
progressive web apps so you could read
news you would actually open up that you
go to the page it installed as a
progressive web app and it would look
ahead it would store your future
articles in a certain section so that
you could go offline and actually flip
through and read those articles so it's
really quite nice now what's interesting
to notice here is this still has a
browser bar on top this is on a first
view so on my second view that browser
chrome actually goes away and it's a
full screen application the browser will
pop up a note asking if you want to add
it to the home screen and if you say yes
there it is on the home screen click on
that again to launch the splash screen
and now
have the full screen experience no
browser Chrome if I look at the apps
list it shows up as a regular app it
doesn't show up as Chrome and a window
in chrome it shows up as an app itself
so you really look like an app to your
users your product does so this is all
about removing friction this is all
about getting rid of the steps required
to install an app so interesting fact by
way about removing friction utley back
up for a moment the studies we've done
say that F for every step it takes to
get or install an application you lose
20% of your users so if an app requires
going to the App Store 20% won't do it
once you get to the App Store 20 you
have to go find the app 20% of people
will stop there and so on so to the
point where usually only about a quarter
of the people who go who you say hey
come install my native app if you're
lucky maybe 1/4 the people will do it
but on the web what friction is there
you're already on the page at most you
hit a button that says add to homescreen
or you dismiss it so what did we need to
be able to do that so we need reliable
performance we needed to be able to work
offline work from cache work from a
database we needed push notifications
these are really important to innate in
native applications and progressive web
apps can do push so it's not normally
scheduled as part of the two-day course
but I'm pretty sure we can fit this in
so I'll be adding a little bit at the
end of the day today so we can get to
push tomorrow and then the home screen
icon the ability to look like a regular
home screen application now why
performance well because faster matters
did you know that if somebody doesn't
see that half of the users that don't
find what they want in the first 10
seconds will leave your page actually
the number is now 65 to get
it's almost sixty percent more than half
of your users if they don't see what
they want ten seconds are gone
in fact even at three seconds twenty
percent of people are gone how many of
your apps how many of your webpages load
in less than three seconds
I'm not seeing a lot of hands I'm seeing
as it's well let's be honest that's not
the easiest thing to do right and I have
had two so how many people in here are
developers how many people here in our
designers oh good okay okay if you like
one designer hand so I have fought with
designers who say oh yeah ten seconds to
load page no problem people will stay my
thing looks so beautiful I have fought
with them a lot and then I go in and
cache and compress and do everything I
can to get it fast and tell them to keep
your hands off of those settings over
there but I love good designers so don't
get me wrong but there is this tension
between them and so getting your page
down to this three point three seconds
or even two point four seconds it's
difficult but what if it was sitting in
a cache on your phone so it loaded
instantly right that will probably be
the easiest perform attack you ever do
but then you start worrying about
runtime performance but you know we'll
talk about that one later but faster is
much better if you want to keep your
people and most sites look at this the
majority of the top thousand sites are
three point three seconds or or higher
really
so okay this number is a little
different than what we have they're
different studies as 40% of users bounce
out from sites that take longer than
three seconds to load that's not a good
number so service workers can help you
out what is the service worker this is
the short version so a service worker is
a proxy that sits inside the browser
it's actually written as part of
natively the browser so like in Chrome
it's C++ internally but it's controlled
by JavaScript so you tell the service
worker to run a JavaScript and what that
script does is it takes your files that
you need and puts them in a special
cache now this is not the browser cache
because the browser cache doesn't work
when you're offline this is a new cache
a new additional cash that you control
you control what files go in it you
control the lifetime you control the
size this is completely flexible and
under your control fact it's almost too
flexible sometimes and will give you a
set of tools to write a lot of the code
that manages it make your life simpler
sure go ahead question okay the question
is a serviceworker and the cache browser
independent so like most new features on
the web different browsers implement at
different rates at the moment Chrome and
Mozilla and edge and have all built in
Samsung internet has it other browsers
are have said that it's in their plans
sliced Apple assets it's in Safari plan
I don't remember I'm sorry to say what
you see is doing now this doesn't apply
to server rendered browsers such as
Opera Mini and that's the one thing
that's the most difficult I know for
most of the people in the room is Opera
Mini has its own unique way of doing
things and doing everything on the
server so this will not apply to server
rendered browsers so you control the
cache oh I'm sorry no go right ahead
so can I polyfill the serviceworker
so there was a proof-of-concept service
worker done as a polyfill but it's not
something you want to use in production
it's not really poly fillable because a
polyfill is normally something you could
write and run entirely in JavaScript but
the service worker actually lives inside
of the browser as a network proxy and so
it needs internal access to the
networking chain so instead what we
recommend is that you do progressive
enhancement so you build your app to
work without the service worker right
just like you would for any other site
you build it to work on a range of
browsers you build a baseline experience
you layer things on as you get
progressively better browsers and what
excuse me
one of those layers would be if the
serviceworker exists then load the
serviceworker script and suddenly now
you have the cache and you have the push
notifications and all of that but it is
a progressive enhancement it is not
something you'll be able to polyfill
across everything because it's just so
foundational into the browser and it's a
great question thank you then what
happens with the serviceworker is once
you have something in cache the
serviceworker actually intercept all of
your network events so when your app
when the browser goes to fetch a file or
your app does an XML HTTP request or
uses the fetch command that actually
gets routed through the service worker
and the service worker can actually
decide to handle the request usually by
going to the cache or going to a
database not shown here and pulling the
data and returning it which is how you
get offline operation now without a
serviceworker you still write the same
application here you just don't have the
enhancements that the serviceworker
brings
so the Guardian in the UK built a
progressive web app less than one second
median load time that's pretty amazing
the app overall became four times faster
now does that mean it took four seconds
before yeah sometimes took a little
longer but this four times faster also
includes the time it takes to pull
images off the network if I have if I
don't have a bunch of requests already
in flight I can get the images faster
because they're not competing with other
resources for the network and it uses
ten times less data you know how many
people have unlimited data plans not
very many right yeah laughter from the
room right you pay for the data you use
so the less data your application can
use big win for your users and as a
business big win for usage because you
actually get people to come and use the
site now there's another thing you can
do here how many people have heard of
accelerated mobile pages a MP right big
chunk of the room we've done a lot of
promotion on it a MP is just a wet it's
a web page it uses a subset of HTML tags
basically we looked at everything in an
HTML page it can be slow and took it out
so we have a subset of tags that are
easy to style by default we do have a
script tag but we limit what you could
put in there and a lot of the things you
would have run client-side like a lot of
the analytics we actually run on the
server side instead which means it's not
getting true it means that I don't have
to download a bunch of scripts to your
browser I don't have to use your
browser's JavaScript engine to run all
of these I can run that server-side save
a lot of time so a MP is a wonderfully
fast approach if you're building sites
based on a MP you get a client that
comes to you and says we're a publisher
we want to do this you can include
amp installed serviceworker as one of
the tags in your page and you'll get
serviceworker you get PWA support for
free just automatically you listen you
can do is this there are progressive web
apps that use a mp4 their pages you have
the core shell the navigation parts of
your app that you've written and then
believe pages the content at the edges
can be a MP if you choose and this is
all we're really going to say on
accelerated mobile pages it's well
documented online if you do the code
labs they're pretty quick and easy to do
so it's worth a look especially if you
work with people who do a lot of
publishing a lot of very content driven
publishing this is a way to go so in
fact the Washington Post example I told
you before uses a MP as their content
format so it loads fast everywhere not
just in a progressive web app now if
you're building progressive web apps the
chrome developer tools now have a lot of
things to help you out if you go into
chrome dev tools you go to the
application tab by the way there are
also things in the Mozilla developer
tool so if you're using Firefox
there's serviceworker support
specifically in the dev tools there too
but in chrome under application tab you
have a manifest editing page this is
where you specify things like the icon
the theme color which colors the top and
bottom of the screen to match your
applications theme it controls whether
or not you want the chrome on the top of
the bottom do you want full screen
experience or not and a few other
settings this is normally a JSON style
file that's a little bit of a hassle to
edit by hand but this built-in editing
panel makes that pretty easy to set up
there's also if you see up here there's
a special tab for managing service
workers there are now tabs added for
indexeddb and for the custom cast
storage
the other thing we'll get to a little
later today is lighthouse so how many
people have used hub page speed test
right most of the room cool right you
like to build performant applications so
page speed test looks at your page and
tells you where to change things to tune
it up lighthouse looks at your page and
tells you what can you do to make a
better progressive web app so it's like
page speed test except it's built with a
focus on pwace rather than raw page
speed now there's a lot of overlap
between the two and sometimes the advice
they give is a little different because
the focuses are slightly different but
they're both great tools you'll get to
use this later today this is also open
source it's on github google chrome
account lighthouse you'll find it a lot
of the tools I'm showing you today are
available open source we've been open
sourcing a bunch of things incidentally
this class is also open source it's all
like all the the textbook the labs all
that is all on github and get books so
feel free when you get back to your
offices share it you know if you need to
walk through a module of people whatever
it's there it's for you to use I'm not
open source so there's only one of me a
little hard to pass around that's true
if your phone gives away secrets on the
recording the editors might make it
louder let's talk about a couple of
interesting things I'm not going to
spend a bunch of time on these but two
new features of progressive web apps so
we talked about fast loading from the
cache I mentioned push notifications
right I mentioned add to homescreen but
there's also now a web payments API
because if you look at the cart
abandonment rate for e-commerce meaning
how many people put something in the
cart and then never finish the checkout
95 percent huge number of people give up
before they buy something because they
have to saw it this big form as autofill
helps accept and it's not done right and
things are but things are going into the
wrong fields right becomes frustrating
so web payments is meant to actually get
rid of that frustration the other big
place it's frustrating is logging in so
there's a credential management API that
is designed such that if your site
supports it it can log the user in if
they've already authenticated to their
phone they don't have to go looking for
name and password and it's tied to that
specific device and that specific user
so let's take a really fast look at
those so an example of web payments here
would be Shopify here's a cart checkout
button at the bottom I tap on the button
and the browser slides up this display
and says okay here's your cost here's
where it's shipping here's the payment
card you've been using if that's all
good you can't pay one click now if this
address isn't right for you or this
payment isn't right for you you can tap
on these and change them and the browser
will remember them we have a nice thing
about this is that the browser is
securely holding onto the information
users don't have to worry about do I
trust this merchant with my information
right because they typically tend to
trust their own phones so the phone is
what's hanging on to it so one tap pops
up visited done confirm shipping you're
finished it's in chrome on Android web
payments is also in Chrome on desktop
but it turns out that there's a bug
right now that it doesn't work quite
right
so we knew about it it showed up after
we shipped you know it should be fixed
in the next rig in the next release but
as of 56 it's just not quite right on
the desktop so the first time the user
inputs it know into the end of this
pop-up in the browser now normally what
happens is and you've probably seen this
is that if you fill in credit card
information autofill notices it and
actually retains the information to
offer it to you as an option next time
so it can pick it up that way as well so
if a site doesn't have payment API I
could have filled in my card there and
pay me the API would actually know about
the card now the nice thing about this
is it's a very secure it sense it
doesn't send the card information to the
merchants it sends a one-time used token
the same as if you use a chip card right
the chip cards that all generates a
one-time-use token so that even if
somebody stole it
they couldn't reuse that number for
payment same thing happens here it's
actually a highly secure system so
credential management API is the other
really interesting one it's one tap
sign-in so I go to tap I tap on the user
and up pops the thing you just saw that
says sign in with Google smart lock you
say yes and you're signed in a lot
easier than going in looking for your
name and password okay how many people
use a unique name and password for
almost every site add no hands because
it's hard right you have to remember it
I mean I use a password manager but I
always have to go and open it up and log
into it and copy the password and or you
know show it on the screen and type it
in and it's a pain but I do it my things
need to be really secure working for a
big company like Google you actually
need to be super super security
conscious because everybody wants to
know what we're doing we all want our
secrets
so you know unique passwords on
everything
and this so I can have your new password
on everything at Google smart lock which
is an internal password manager on the
phone so okay I know your passwords for
things here I can log you in because you
have your phone you've unlocked your
phone you've used a pattern or a
password or your fingerprint you know
whatever sensors are used to identify
you
so the fundos who you are now it can
sign you into these sites so these the
question is these are in chrome what
about other browsers so web payments API
is chrome and Netscape and I'd have to
look at the rest Safari
actually has a payments API it's
slightly different credential management
in Chrome I believe it's also in
Netscape these are all w3c standards so
one of the really important things is
you know we were very driven now by
standards now scanners take a lot more
work right we could just sit down build
a feature and be done you know
standards take a couple of years or more
but they're worth it because you can get
that feature across all the browsers and
you can get the community adoption so
they're worth the trouble to us
so progressive web apps are designed to
be reliable fast loading work offline
and on flaky networks so inconsistent
works you want to build them fast you
smooth animation 60 frame per second
rendering so it's not stuttering or
getting as we call Genki it's not
getting stuck and it should be
interesting right you should be engaging
it should want it should launch quickly
from the home screen it said push
notifications that draw the user back in
if you need them right these are kind of
the ground rules for a good progressive
web app so how do you do the fast
animation with a PWA that's a kind of a
long answer the short answer is this
that you get you get 60 frames a second
you want that's the best target you're
aiming for which means that's a 16
millisecond slice one six now out of
that there's some overhead for the
browser and all that so really you have
to fit within about 10 milliseconds and
so you budget that 10 milliseconds out
if you need to you cut the work up into
small enough pieces that fit in there or
you put work in something like a web
worker that runs off the main thread pre
calculates what you need and then makes
the changes a lot of times you use like
a virtual Dom so how many people here
use react so react uses a virtual Dom
it's a technique from the gaming
industry that can calculate the minimum
set of changes needed for the DOM and
make just those css3 can help you to
achieve this using things like
transitions there are tools in Chrome
for actually monitoring performance and
they'll tell you when you start
exceeding that budget because you're
you're connected with Google right you
can ask for a performance audit and will
for bigger properties will actually do
performance audits now don't know to
everybody in the room ask at once
there's only a few people that do those
audits but we do actually do them
there's also a course on Udacity called
browser rendering optimization it's one
of the it's
the courses that I produced and it will
work in extreme detail on ticking
applications and getting them down to
that beautiful smooth 60 frames per
second and it's a free app it's a free
course so the question was about
security and Service Worker and can I
keep certain requests out of the Service
Worker kind of make sure they're not
intercepted the answer is yes you can
tell the service worker to only watch
one path in your application so anything
that happens outside of that path is not
intercepted by that Service Worker you
can actually have in the current version
of Chrome but this is still being
standardized so the other browsers don't
have it yet because it's still the
standard still being locked down you can
actually run multiple service workers on
different paths of your app for
different caching and service workers
require they mandate HTTPS because the
last thing you want to have happen is
somebody else injects an insecure script
into your service worker and suddenly
they've taken over your network stack so
it has to be served up securely so why
is this important how do we get started
the importance is as I said earlier
reach getting the apps in people's hands
1 billion monthly mobile Chrome users
now ad people use UC as people use other
browsers that's a huge number terms of
unique visitors we said three typically
about three apps people are using on
their phones so he's like a hundred
pages at least you know very typically
they'll keep coming back to the same
nine or ten sites and using them
frequently so you could much easier to
get into this side the matte side
cost of acquisition
cecelio did a study on user acquisition
costs cost about 4 euros per andrea user
in about point 35 for mobile web users
so let's see can I do that in rupees I'm
not quite
so this would be about 20 rupees if I'm
doing my math correctly now conversion
aliexpress actually did a progressive
website doubled pageviews seventy five
percent almost increasing time spent on
the site that's actually pretty
important what's interesting is this you
asked earlier well is this on every
browser and it's not and so you might
think well does it help on safari
redesigning into a progressive web app
so the things you have to think about
you build a PW a basically make you a
better web app overall and so they
actually got 82 percent more conversions
on iOS than they had before so that's a
lot more business and basically what
they said is we can do it we can have
huge benefits on browsers with the
latest features but it also works across
other other browsers and it's just going
to keep getting better as the browser's
keep improving so as soon as Safari
brings serviceworker in suddenly it'll
work great there too so how do we get
started well two ways to do it
one is build from the ground up so konga
actually built a native app started from
a native application and built a PWA to
match it much smaller load much smaller
initial app load a lot less data
complete the first transaction because
on the web you have more control over
what's happening in the network stack
another option is to build a very simple
app just start with something simple
there Berlin's example for boarding
passes less than one second to load
Washington Post used a MP as the basis
and typical load time may be
milliseconds for an article it's great
by the way what's the what's the number
what's the cutoff if you want your page
look like it loads instantly what's the
minimum speed you want to shoot for
what's the load time anyone know 100
milliseconds tenth of a second sorry
actually it's 100 because it turns out
here's that here's your odd fact for the
day it takes about 80 to 100
milliseconds for a nerve impulse to
travel from like the end of your leg to
your brain but you have to be able to
walk and do things like now so how do
you deal with the fact that everything
is a little bit delayed coming up the
nervous system your brain actually will
delay inputs
up to a hundred milliseconds in your
brain to get everything to line up so
that the science experiment to try some
time is if you touch your nose and your
ankle at the same time if you do this
and you feel them at the same time the
nerve signals actually arrived 80
milliseconds apart your brain is lying
to you you're actually living about 110
to the second in the past and that's why
a page load under 100 milliseconds
person clicks on it brain says oh that
was instant because it took a hundred
milliseconds but the brain connected the
hand activity with what it saw and says
oh those must have been simultaneous
it's great when you can do it especially
if you show it to a client they click
the buttons like boom what I remember
shocking a client that way just doing it
that fast and they looking like what oh
my god what is this black magic I said I
can't tell you said I did tell them or
you could pick one feature at a time to
convert so the weather company just
added push and roll about 30 languages
globally with our web push notifications
and you know that's nice because you can
do things like weather alert
right tornado coming looking calm did
things one by one and and had a
fantastic time building out their app
just one feature at a time so you can go
turn the ground up you can build a very
simple app or you can do a single
feature it's up to you but look at all
the companies and this was as of Io
last year so this is almost a year old
and look at how many companies are doing
progressive web apps some of what you've
worked with and heard of so let's go do
it let's go build so where to start the
question is about the storage space and
how you manage it and the example is if
I have an e-commerce site and somebody
looks at a large number of products
maybe they look at a hundred products
right what's it going to do to the
storage my device because device storage
is not that big relative to a desktop so
there are storage limits and it depends
on the browser if memory serves your
storage limit for something like Safari
or Firefox by default is about 15
megabytes not gigabytes with megabytes
so you have to use have to be pretty
frugal with what you're doing on Chrome
the last thing that I heard is basically
half of the remaining disk space is what
you get so Chrome will give you more but
you still have to keep it pretty small
now what do you do in the case of the
e-commerce site where somebody's looking
at a lot of information so there is a
tool that we'll look at later called us
to be a tool box it's a bunch of code
that makes it very easy to set up
different caches so the cash from my
application code might be everything
goes in and stays in but then I might
have a cache for products and I say that
cache has a certain size limit or a
lifetime limit or a number of items
limit and toolbox will actually manage
that for you so in your case you would
probably set a storage budget and say ok
my storage but is this much and however
many products fit into that storage
budget that's what the user sees so
maybe they don't see everything they've
looked at maybe they see the most recent
20 but we'll manage it for you
right questions key segregated cash yes
you can actually have the cash API lets
you build set multiple caches at the
same time so I would have one cache
which is my my main files and that
lifetime is probably forever or as close
as forever as we want to get and then my
product cache maybe has a limited
lifetime or limited size and I could
have multiple caches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
