education system there's about half a
million students every year coming
through computer science our CEO said
you know what I think would be a good
idea would be to Train 2 million
developers in India
so when we have this 2 million target
that seems like pretty obvious place for
us to go spend some time if you look at
top thousand apps worldwide right now
the percentage of Indian apps is
anywhere between two to four percent a
lot of innovation that can really spur
that number to go much higher is
something with all these students here
can provide I think we have a bunch of
problem solving students in India but
the things I see as a challenge is they
don't know the problems or problems with
educational systems in every country and
one of the problems is that they don't
modernize rapidly enough think of how
can you bring about change inside your
university what can you do what can you
do on your campus what do you think need
to be done as a university innovation
fellow the best thing I learned a steam
book I've learned not think
traditionally and to know explore the
various ways in which I can probably
create change coming here just showed me
that I'm I am good enough to do anything
that I want to and that is something
I'll be taking back and keeping with me
I think each one of them have the
potential to be the next leader in the
industries we look forward to talking
some of them in fewers when they are
incredibly successful in what they are
doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
