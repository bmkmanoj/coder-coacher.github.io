I'm JP.
I came here to
congratulate you as being
one of our first Associate
Android Developers.
DEEPAK: OK.
Thank you.
I am so honored.
SPEAKER 1: How did you get
started in development?
DEEPAK: I am from
electronics background.
I was learning Java for
embedded technology.
My friend is a developer.
He told me about
Android development.
And I started learning
Android from [INAUDIBLE]
and from online courses.
And I started
learning developing.
SPEAKER 1: Did you feel
that the certification
was useful for you?
And how did it help you?
DEEPAK: I was from
different field.
And my company was not
going to recognize me
at that point of time.
But since I was doing
Android Fundamentals.
So I took the chance and I
give the certification exam.
I got the certification.
Then I started job.
And then I started learning
on a real time projects
in my current organization.
SPEAKER 1: So maybe we could
just talk about another app.
If think about, like,
helping your community,
or helping the world,
or helping India.
DEEPAK: In government
hospitals, patients
are not very highly
educated, and seem
to have many languages.
And every people don't
understand the same language.
So we can provide
a app for them so
that they can get a token number
for them in their own language.
SPEAKER 1: What does
your family mean to you?
DEEPAK: My family mean
everything for me.
I have a mother, and my father.
My grandmother live with me.
My sister live with me.
Three to four months, I
was not getting any job.
And they still
inspire me, it's OK,
and that you will
get a job, it's OK.
So I started learning.
I changed my field completely.
Friends told me that
you shouldn't do that.
But my family told me, OK, you
want to do it, you can do it.
So I did it.
And now I'm a professional.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
