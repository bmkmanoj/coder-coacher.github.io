four things right what they are what
they do and then how they work basically
so what is the Service Worker I said
this earlier it's a proxy client-side
proxy that's part of the browser that's
controlled by JavaScript if you don't
have it you go straight to the server if
you do have it you go through the
Service Worker to the web server
so a service workers your page could go
out make a request the service worker
intercepts it says ah let me look at the
network first okay picks it up from the
network and then put the copy in cache
and comes back to your page the next
time series of Service Worker could cut
get the request and go right to the
cache and cut out the network there is a
limit on service workers that I
mentioned earlier and answering your
question but I'll do it now again for
the official video is that service
workers must be served over HTTPS you
cannot serve them in securely except in
two conditions
one is you're running a localhost so
it's a D but it's a developer hack the
other one if there is in fact a chrome
flagged lets you disable it but that's
not something you tell your users how to
do that's that's for you if you need to
test like and you don't have HTTPS but
you need to test different domain you
can use the start flag for it
so one thing a service worker might do
is make a decision based on whether I'm
online or offline to go either to the
server or the cache now in many cases
that many cases what you do is you go to
the cache anyway but there's a navigator
that online flag you can look at
determine where you are so you could do
that the nice thing about having a
service worker make this decision is
it's transparent to the rest of your app
the rest of your app just makes requests
normally and the service worker takes
care of the redirection is there a size
limit for the offline caching very
probably the question is like we guessed
it all the time it depends on the
browser typical storage size is about 50
Meg's and most browsers
Chrome will give you less I heard half
of the remaining disk space available
there's a lot of people who experimented
and published now they basically keep
cashing things until the browser says no
more so you have to look online because
it's constantly changing it's not no
official value from anyone so service
workers can also receive push nest
messages so since a service worker
actually runs independently of your web
app it's a separate piece of code in the
background the browser could receive a
push message and wake up your service
worker your service worker could then go
out to the network grab a bunch of
things that it needs even put them in
the cache and then display the
notification on the screen all without
waking up your app in this case when you
use our answers the notification then
your app gets woken up serviceworker
life cycle okay so we talked about what
it is one thing I didn't show you but
I'll just mention it now it'll be on a
slide later if it for every HTTP request
that goes through the serviceworker gets
a fetch event and it can decide whether
to pass that to the network it could
decide whether to ignore it in which
case it passes to the network or it can
decide to do something with the cache
so serviceworker life cycle when you
first start you don't have a
serviceworker in your code you'll create
one that's in the installing state at
the end of this state the serviceworker
will actually fire and install the vent
into its own script and that script can
do it start doing work usually that's
when you build a cache now it's not yet
active it is not yet controlling your
network chain it won't become active
until you make a special call or until
the user reloads the app the first time
now it becomes activated it's in the
control chain there's an activated event
that the service worker gets internally
in the script but you can do things like
clean up the cache or pick up dynamic
data
the service worker at some point the
browser will say okay service workers
idle it's not doing any work it's not
getting fetch events so the browser
actually has the choice of letting it
sit idle and it'll get a fetch event
processing go back to the idle loop just
like the idle loop in the main thread or
the browser can actually choose to kill
the service worker can terminate it tick
it out the service worker might actually
die and restart several times
automatically during the life of your
app that's the save memory or save
processing power both of which translate
to battery on a mobile device so let's
build what's broken code this is in my
main J's files we're not yet in the
Service Worker first see if it exists so
if it exists you'll have navigator dot
Service Worker
but the better way to test for something
like that is always say if a property
exists for the nin so if I don't have it
log in bit just skip out normally you
all do a return term you just bail out
then if it exists call register and give
it the path to your script that returns
a promise because it's a async off it
has to go to the disk or the net so when
that's done you'll get a registration
object back now you can retrieve this
later right off the serviceworker or you
can hang on to it it's used to do things
like enable push notifications for what
we're doing today with the cache you
don't need the registration object
I also have an interesting choice here
so the question you ask is can I exempt
certain thing can I keep certain things
out of the service workers attention
every service worker has a scope of
control but it will only accept it will
only intercept events from a certain
path or lower so Amit by default the
path is taken from where the script
lives so you normally put your service
worker script at the root level of your
site even if you normally put your
scripts in a script folder this one
should be separate and because it's
going to run in a separate process
you're not going to combine a minify it
into your other scripts it is a separate
piece but I can specify this is the top
level but say I don't really want
everything under slash I only want
things under app to be controlled by
Service Worker so I can scope it down
now but the current spec says one
Service Worker per web app in Chrome
experimentally you can have multiple
service workers per app but since the
coordination details and it's all being
are being worked out it's being
finalized that's not technically
production-ready code that's something
that's still being hashed out in the
spec so inside the Service Worker now
notice the Service Worker j/s badge in
the corner will call self dot add event
listener so this adds an event listener
to the Service Worker self is a reserved
keyword is actually a keyword in
JavaScript that we're finally using if
it's called from the outside the Service
Worker outside of a worker it means
window and it's called from inside of a
worker it means the worker so on the so
self on the web worker out of that
listener install as I do thanks during
the installation process that's normally
where you would build a cache the
activate event happens when the service
worker actually takes control in which
case
do stuff during activate normally what
we'll do in activate is this so I built
my first service worker I bring it up it
runs now I revised it so I have version
2 version 2 builds its own cache if I
have two caches sitting on the disk
during activate version 2 knows that
it's the only service worker in control
now so it can actually remove its
version 1 cache
so cash maintenance normally happens
during activate do not do cache
maintenance during install because there
may be more than one service worker
depending on that cache also because
chrome doesn't like it if you take the
cash out during install some verses the
chromel crash they shouldn't but let's
beat you just stick to the rules and
we'll be fine so events that you get
install activate ok you've seen those
message if you call post message to send
a message to a web worker or a service
worker it gets the message event message
event is how you communicate between the
service worker and your main code using
a push message command or post message
say can you auto purge the cache that
the the answer is both yes and no so the
answer is officially no because service
worker is entirely controlled by code
that you supply but the answer is
partially yes because there's an open
source library called sw-toolbox that
Google published and one of the things
that it does is it has that management
code in it
so what most people will do is use
sw-toolbox and let us write the code for
you so we'll look at that later I
promise so functional events every time
a network request happens you get a
fetch event you can also get a sync
event if you've enabled background sync
that so sync events can happen even when
the rest of your app is shut down middle
of the night or whatever the web worker
could get a sync event from the browser
and it might go out and actually update
data load the database load the cache
all without waking up your
and then pushes obviously used if you
get a push message so with the sync
event the client initiates the
connection like all like all web
activities the clients all is the
initiator like any other code right
misuse of sync can drain the battery on
the other hand if your data rates vary
based on time of day it can be good for
doing like updates when the data is
cheaper so like any other thing you have
to be good about how you use it so
here's an example fetch handler so in
this case we're going to catch the fetch
event and call events out respond with
go to the caches and see if anything
matches my event requests and if it does
I'll get the result response and return
that so if I've got it in the cache now
what happens if something doesn't match
I get a null and a return that browser
says I don't have that file or oh I
don't have it here or what you could do
is you could say caches match event
request or and just do a fetch on the
network if you do a fetch from inside
the serviceworker it does not
recursively re-enter it goes out to the
network so here's an example of
background sync this is a one-off so I
register the serviceworker later on I
get the registration I wait for it to be
ready which gives me the registration
and then I call sync and register with
his tag food we'll do a one-time sync
request or you can schedule them and
then a sync event that comes in has an
event tag on so you can tell different
events apart and you can do something
with it
now just the new events out wait until
you haven't seen this yet remember that
I said that the serviceworker can be
shut down when it's idle you don't want
it to shut down right in the middle of
this function so event dot wait until
called a ragged block of asynchronous
code basically wait makes the service
workers stay awake until that promise is
resolved
so it keeps it from going to sleep on
you okay so listening to push you get a
push event you call show notification
which puts the notice on the screen you
do a wait until that's complete now
there's basic service workers samples at
google chrome about github bio at i/o
what i really wanted to show you is in
the application tab in chrome under
service workers you'll see all the
service workers that are running and you
may be surprised at how many things are
actually already using service worker
there's also a couple of really
important checkboxes here one is offline
if you need to simulate being offline
just check that and now you can test
offline behaviors there's update on
reload so remember that I said that the
service worker you reload it gets active
now if I reload again and the control
script hasn't changed the service worker
the old service work will be used well
maybe I want to force a new one to come
in so update on reload forces a new
service worker every time you reload the
page add bypass for network basically
says hey service worker don't intercept
my fetch events I'm going straight to
the network so if something seems broken
in your service worker you can hit that
switch and go test your code may bypass
your network it works and you uncheck it
and certainly it stops well you know
where the bug is serious workers by the
way can now be debug from the sources
tab just like anything else which is a
really cool thing the other thing to
notice here let's see not everything is
here so I can so if I service workers
stopped I can restart it right there I
can force an immediate update to a
service worker I can hand it push or a
sync event or I can force unregister it
you will also see if there's a service
worker loaded an old one that's got
controlled and the new ones waiting to
take control you'll actually see a
button here called link called stop
waiting and you can click that to force
the new one to take over right now okay
resources and we're actually not going
to wind up doing this particular lab
because there's another lab coming that
will do instead but actually first thing
we're going to do is watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
