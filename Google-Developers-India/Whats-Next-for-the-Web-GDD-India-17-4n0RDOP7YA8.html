really late or showing up really late
and the last talk and the title of my
talk is what's next for the web or an
alternative title could be exploring
about flags my name is Thomas tanner
I work as a mobile solutions consultant
they started to Google Hamburg office
I'm Tommy hawk on the Internet
so before they get started here's a
quick warning there's a lot of content
coming and I'm going to speak fast
probably even too fast so hold on to
your seat and watch out for all the
links so on all slides there's links so
take a photo right on the links whatever
and so you can catch up afterward if you
find something that is interesting with
that let's get started on the first
topic which is progressive web apps
pwace and something that is really and
truly immersive are obviously fullscreen
pwace because you're PWA deserves a lot
of screen real estate so some of you may
remember an app called paperplane store
world it should still be up so if you
want to join on your phones you can try
that it's a full screen PWA and the cool
thing about it is if you pay close
attention there's something missing
which is the top bar with the Wi-Fi
signal with the clock and so on it's a
true game so you get a true fully
immersive
fullscreen experience how do you get
that in your web app manifest you can
now set the display property to full
screen and your app will be rendered in
a full-screen view this is not always
useful but if you write a game if you
create a game it's definitely something
that you can try out something else in
the area of progressive web app is they
have to come real applications on
people's phones with a new improved add
to homescreen flow users will now be
able to add your application directly to
their home screens and find it in the
app drawer so when they search for the
app and it will just show up between all
the other native applications
and if you update the web app manifest
you can also change the icon and change
the name and it will just be reflected
directly on people's phones and with the
improved flow based on the manifest
scope and Android intent filters being
created and this filter defines when the
app should be opened so when you see
this little animation here I'm receiving
a chat message I'm clicking on the chat
message and then the application opens
the web share API is sharing caring
definitely sharing is caring so we
should make sharing easy in 2017
if you look at publisher sites they
commonly look like this so you have a
lot of screen real estate wasted for all
the sharing buttons and obviously if you
want to share it always the one social
network that you would actually want to
share this article is missing so that's
a problem really and also if you've seen
before sometimes if you have full screen
pwace there's not even a URL bar where
they could they could just quickly copy
the URL from so what can we do about
that the answer is the web share API the
voucher api opens the native sharing
dialog directly in the android phone and
it has a very simple API that is promise
based you call navigator dot share then
you give it a title a text and the URL
and then people can just share it so you
can see here the menu share dialog opens
you can select whatever
networks you want to have there it's all
customizable by the user and it will
always be the same for all web pages
it's not dependent on the web site it's
dependent on you as a user next topic is
web push notifications and luckily now
finally on iOS 9 iOS Mac OS they're no
longer an alien before they were kind of
artificially created and I had this not
really native looking feel and now
finally they're just integrated directly
in the control and know that
Notification Center which also means
their respect that do not disturb
settings so something that we really
found was a pain and people set up
do not disturb and then receiving all
these notifications now they just
respect the operating systems doing a
disturb settings navigation preload this
is one of the more interesting and more
complex things actually this is about
waiting for the service worker to boot
what does this mean so if you have a PW
a at at some point needs to boot and
start the service worker and I'm it
turns out this can take some time and
actually if you are a big site with a
lot of users and a lot of views and if
you are a side that is active on many
tabs like for example Facebook where you
have facebook.com obviously but then
also a ton of articles with like buttons
that also tend to connect to the service
worker this is something that can really
harm performance so with a service
worker navigation preload origin trial
we are trying to find an answer to that
and I'm essentially the idea is to
paralyze a before cereal talk at the
task so instead of having the service
worker boot and only then intercepting
navigation requests the core idea here
is to already start listening for
requests while the service workers to
booting and loading so speaking of code
how could this look like and in the
service worker during the activate event
um you have wait until the navigation
preload is enabled so you essentially
start the pre-loading
already and then in the fetch event when
you go through your is the response
summer available you can check if you
maybe have a pre-loaded response already
so as I said it's kind of complex really
but there's things on the slide so you
can follow up after the talk
very exciting feature something that is
always a pain is signing into pages and
signing up for pages and we have a
solution for that which is called the
one tab signup API so what problem does
this API solve essentially before you
always had this like mmm to a use
federated login do I use the Google
button do you
Facebook button if I use that will it
actually posted I'm using this app on
Facebook or is it so you never quite
know or if you use username and password
it's like mistyped go back correct of
course you have forgotten the password
and you have to click a link the forgot
password link so this can be really
painful there's a one tab sign up API
this has gone away and the best thing is
this works on all browsers this works on
iOS this works on desktop Firefox this
works everywhere essentially so it's a
new API that allows you to create
account on the mobile web with one tab
using a Google address and it's based on
an standard called open Yolo you only
live in bonds open euro it also supports
the automatic return user sign and so if
you have been on the page before and you
come back you will automatically be
signed in if you're a marketer that's
something that is very valuable because
like this we can stitch sessions
together if people are on mobile and on
desktop and they use different devices
but the same login you can then finally
stitch the sessions together so very
very useful information here it's
launched life you can see the URL down
here on the code side how does it work
well first you need to do some setup so
there's an contest with the options we
said the supported auth methods and the
supported ID token providers you can see
the values here then you need to set up
a handle result function that will deal
with the result when you get it back and
essentially there's two cases and
there's their auto sign in and there's
the auto sign up let's start with the
auto sign in so if you have to use it
and it's the users coming back um you
can use the go google yellow dot
retrieve function with the options that
you've configured a little bit further
up and then you handle the result so
essentially you very easily can sign in
people who have been on your page before
if you need to sign up users if they are
on a page for the first time and you
have to Google yellow dot hint function
again it takes the options object from
from before and will then be able to
handle the result as well so the result
is of course
but it's a user a valid user or not
ppwe always has this problem of if you
have an application and you want to
store content offline
is there enough memory left so it's
enough storage left this can be finally
answered because now we have the storage
estimation API this allows you to with
just one call to the note 2 the function
navigator dot storage that estimate find
out after the promise fulfilled how much
memory you have left and essentially you
can get usage information and you get
quota information so we can calculate
the Delta how much memory can you still
use this can be useful if you want to
decide should a really offline store
whatever big asset yes or no so I can
Dannette dynamically decide now if you
want to do that next big topic area is
media-related api's the first one is the
image capture api because it allows you
to zoom in on what really matters so you
can see me playing around with this api
in the office I'm zooming in on my big
nose and yeah so how do we work well
essentially it allows you get low level
access to the phone's hardware so if
your camera has zoom you can now access
the camera zoom directly from within
JavaScript let's have a look at the how
this works
so the code here is connected to this
simple animation as you can see so first
from a media stream we get the video
track and from this video track we get
the capabilities so what is this video
track capable of doing and once we have
the track they can get its settings then
we have the settings and then we get a
reference to the query selector hit to
the to the input and with a query
selector and then we come to kind of
initialize the input so we need to know
how far and how yeah minimum
is the zooming level so we look at the
capabilities at the zoom the min and the
max and set the min and the max of the
input accordingly and then we can set
the value of the slider to the setting
off to the zoom property of the settings
object and then essentially all we do is
when the slider is being moved so when
the input changes we apply the
constraint to the zoom so really
exciting the shape detection API allows
you to in real time detect faces read
barcodes and even run OCR optical
character recognition from camera input
you can see on this demo here I'm
holding my phone and I'm scanning the
website of the previous DDD in Krakov
and you can see I'm on this page there's
a barcode but there's also text
obviously and a face and the camera
detects is life on the the API detectors
life and you can see the bounding boxes
that I've drawn here directly on the
page again how does it work I'm very
quick the code you have three different
detectors that you need to initialize a
face detector a text detector in a
barcode detector and because everything
is promise based you can just use
promise that all call other detection
methods of all the different detectors
and then you get the with the resulting
faces text and barcodes back and you can
then I don't know draw bounding boxes or
whatnot and so here you can see I'm
simply logging them to the console very
powerful API directly built into the
browser
um the meaning session API so we stay in
the area of media for us to make your
media sessions a lot more meaningful so
something you encounter and when you use
the mini session idea is when you swipe
down on an Android device you can now
see and track information you can see
album information you can see album
artwork and like this you have to yeah
more meaningful way of controlling your
media directly from the widget that you
can see when you swipe down so you can
see you can pause you can fast-forward
and so on and then there's a lot of
information so if we zoom in on what if
what kind of information you can see you
have the title you have two artists you
have two album if the artwork and then
you can connect to all the different
action buttons that you have so you can
seek backward previous track seek
forward and next track and of course
play and pause so code wise how does it
work you pass a new
medium in today's a object with all the
different yeah things filled out it
looks a bit intimidating but if you look
it's just very straightforward title
artist album artwork and different sizes
and different resolutions and then you
can connect all the different action
handlers to the particular events so
play pause seek backward and so on so I
can really make a media player that is
super powerful and directly integrated
with the Android version the media
capabilities API is a very interesting
new API that allows you to determine not
only if a certain device can play a
given media file but also if it can do
so in a smooth way and in a power
efficient way so this is very important
recently because you know battery on
battery life and on mobile devices is
always a problem
so with this API you can directly find
out well is a particular file smoothly
playable and power efficiently playable
like this you can dynamically decide
well maybe the person is on 20 percent
battery only and in this case you may
want to ship a lower res version of a
media file rather than shipping the
super high res file and also you can
dynamically decide is this phone even by
able to play this file smoothly so have
a look at the code you have the
Navigator media capability stored query
um
method here and you pass in an object
where you essentially describe what is
your media file like so you have a file
it's a video it's using the video web em
codec and as heightened with framerate
bitrate blah blah blah so you can see
you simply list the properties of the
video file and then you get a result
back and then as result you can see not
only is this supported at all which is
yes or no but you can also see is the
playback going to be smooth so if you
have a device that was really low power
maybe you won't be able to playback
smoothly a high-res video and also the
most important question in some cases is
a power efficient so well the CPU is
maxed out when playing or
has to CPU some you know bandwidth
upwards for doing other things on top
quite exciting API going over to web we
are because sometimes the real reality
is not real enough what we are allows
you to create compelling VR experiences
in the browser you can see a demo here
created by Martin split where you can
just use your device and get a like
really realistic VR view of how for
example here for an interior designer a
certain piece of furniture would look
like in your room or in a simulated room
here web PR is an open standard that
makes it possible to experience we are
directly in the browser so you don't
need to download any plugins you don't
need any additional software you just
point people to a URL then they can take
out the viewer which can be Google
cardboard or whatever and then you can
see directly from their browser in their
phones how something would look like so
very exciting very yeah amazing and
really I think for some professions even
life-changing if you are an interior
designer definitely have a look at this
and topic that is very dear to my heart
is performance and performance related
api's so the first topic in there is the
network information API this API allows
it to know how fast you can go it
actually does already get meaningful
real-time network information today I
think we all have experienced we've been
on Wi-Fi so in theory super fast but in
practice well you all know how the Wi-Fi
was here sometimes it wasn't like really
the best so with the network information
API we now get not only static
information like the type and the
downlink back but we also get the
effective type so today sometimes the
Wi-Fi connection would be would have
been a Wi-Fi connection of type but
effective type would maybe have been
only 2 G so this is something that is of
course very helpful if you want to make
real-time decisions what to do with a
certain file for example or image F one
example where you can actually combine
media queries with the
network information API so here I'm
using javascript to find out if a given
device has a so-called Retina display so
I'm looking at the min device pixel
pixel ratio so I'm looking if the min
device pixel ratio is two and if the min
resolution is at least 192 dpi so if
this media query matches I know that the
device supports retinas or is a Retina
display but then I dynamically take the
network information into account and
only if the device supports retina and
only if the navigator dot connection
that effective type is 4G meaning a fast
connection only then I use retina
graphics else even if the media queries
say that's a great device it could
support media query it's a good support
high res graphics I'm not using them
because the network right now doesn't
commit so that's just a quick idea what
this kind of things would allow the next
thing is performance IDs because you
should care what is happening on your
page and when your content loads and
here we have the navigation timing API
that allows you to get general
performance data you can see here it's
all available in the window that
performance the timing object and this
variable we call it perf data then has
sub properties like perf dated or load
event and if you use the perfect either
or load event and you subtract the perf
data dot navigation start you get
something which is called page load time
you can see there's connect time there's
render time so again a lot of useful
information that you can then just
collect in a table and maybe report back
to your analytics system and like this
you get real-time user data of actual
users out there and you can see well in
the lab we're simulating this and that
but actually users in the wild are
experiencing something completely
different maybe so you can get very
easily real-time performance data from
your users and sometimes you also want
to see how fast your page is rendered
and for this you can get from the
performance API sorry from the pain time
timing API different events like for
example paint event if you initialize a
performance of server you can then check
for a certain paint events and see when
did they happen so you can in a server
then observe an observer observe empty
types of type paint and like this have a
look at when what paint event is
happening on the page you can see how
I'm doing that even after the fact on
this plate here
I'm just looking at performance that get
entries by type paint and then you can
see what information again I got first
paint and I get first content full paint
first paint is when is something at
first at the first moment that something
is been painted on the screen which
could be something as simple as the
background color changes from white to
whatever blue and the first meaningful
and first content full paint is when can
the user actually start reading the page
for example so when is an image loaded
Venice the text loaded so something
meaningful is on the screen so that the
person can actually start consuming the
page and something else that is quite
new our clients hints like this we can
find out how capable a user's device is
client ins are especially useful on low
memory devices so in the chrome team
they've done
yeah chrome telemetry so they have
essentially figured out by using crush
reports what kind of things happened and
what kind of things led to crush reports
and it turns out that out of memory
crashes happen on a lot of low-end
devices that have very limited ram so
only five or than twelve megabytes of
ram or even sorry or one gigabyte of ram
and i'm if you know that you have a low
powered device that has a little you
know less ram then I know mid tier
devices or high tier devices and then I
can decide dynamically to serve only a
light version of your page so service
can advertise support for client ins by
using the accept - CHCH for client hints
header and I can list all the different
device so the different client hints
that they support like for example
device memory and on the client then
the client can then report back to the
servants a my device memory is 0.5 for
example so 0.5 gigabytes and like this
dynamically you can decide on the server
but it's a light device maybe I should
be only serving a light version of my
page you can also access this
information from JavaScript so you here
navigated our device memory which prints
0.5 and you can also get an information
about the number of cores that the CPU
of the device has navigator dot hardware
concurrency you can see I'm having here
low powered device with only 0.5
gigabytes and only 2 cores instead of
maybe 4 or 8 new JavaScript features
because in the end everything we do is
powered by JavaScript something that is
really amazing is dynamic module imports
they allow you to really truly lazy load
JavaScript code so here for example in
the code um you have a button and it has
an event listener that unclick
dynamically loads the code for this
dialog box that the button triggers so
once the import is finished and we can
then open the dialog box for example or
if we can catch an error if in case of
something goes wrong so import allows
you for dynamically importing and
loading JavaScript very exciting we have
a synchronous generator functions
because we all know dealing with
asynchronous data it can be really
painful and they can be used for example
in for off loops and you can also create
custom asynchronous iterators through
asynchronous iterative factories so you
can see one example here and we have a
generator function so you can see the
little star you have a response that is
evaded from a promise so from the fetch
and then we have B which is the body of
the response and we have this
asynchronous for a weight Const chunk of
a nano magic function that just gives us
a chunk back of the file and we can then
yield the chunks length dynamically so
really exciting new functionality that
this provides
and then finally well no pun intended we
have to finally method in promises
because oftentimes you need to do
something in a promise nevertheless if
the promise has fulfilled or if the
promise has been rejected so you can see
here I'm fetching and display and my
function here I'm showing a loading
spinner then I'm trying to fetch a euro
then I get the response then I get the
responses text and I catch in case of
something happens and then finally so in
all cases no matter what happened if the
Democrat then case happened or the catch
case happened I'm getting the text which
can be the error message or the actual
response text and then I'm just
displaying it and I'm hiding my loading
spinner so pretty elegant way of dealing
with code without repeating yourself and
then over to hardware related ideas so a
lot of new hardware related api's are
available for example the Bluetooth API
web Bluetooth API that allows you to
communicate with nearby Bluetooth
devices what you can see here is a demo
from a colleague of mine Francois Botha
who is using his phone to control
Bluetooth candles so just from a website
and he's sending messages over to the
Bluetooth candles like this the web
Bluetooth API allows you to discover and
communicate with devices that are nearby
it's using the Bluetooth for a wireless
standard buy at the generic attribute
profile yet this is already implemented
in a number of browsers and you can
definitely play around with it on Chrome
Android Linux Mac OS and Chrome OS
relatively similar web USB where you
expose USP devices and make them
accessible from the web in this demo by
Kenneth Road Kristensen you can see how
he is playing with web USB and sending a
message to a dot matrix display from a
website so he's typing in on the website
some message web USP rocks he's sending
it to the to the device via Web USB and
then it's been displayed on the dot
matrix display this allows you to well
deal with specifically designed for web
USB devices
and obviously this is a very powerful
API so it has to be mm has to be HTTP
only and again it's implemented in a
number of roses Chrome Android Linux Mac
OS and in Chrome OS as well but
definitely this is not the end this is
just the beginning so if you want to
stay up to date definitely subscribe to
