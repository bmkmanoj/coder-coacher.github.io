MRIDULA MALLYA: Hi, everyone.
We are super excited
about Google I/O 2018,
and we're sure you are too.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
I/O brings developers
from around the globe
together for talks,
hands-on learning
with Google's experts,
and a first look at Google's
latest developer product.
We will be there on
the ground and want
to take your questions to the
developer advocates and program
managers.
Comment below using
hashtag IndiaAsks,
and let us know about
your developer challenges
and doubts so that we are
sure to cover technologies
and products that matters the
most to us Indian developers.
MRIDULA MALLYA: If you
don't have a ticket,
but still want to be a
part of the experience,
you could watch the
Livestream from home
or get involved with
your local community
by attending an
I/O extended event.
I/O extended events are
hosted by local developers,
for local developers
all around the world.
Last year, over 35 I/O extended
events were held in India.
They all had
Livestreaming sessions,
while some went a step
further and organized
local demos, hackathons,
code labs, and more.
Check out the link
in the description
below for all the details,
and join in on the fun.
MANORANJAN PADHY: That's
all for now, folks.
Stay tuned for more
I/O 2018 updates here.
See you soon.
MRIDULA MALLYA: Bye.
