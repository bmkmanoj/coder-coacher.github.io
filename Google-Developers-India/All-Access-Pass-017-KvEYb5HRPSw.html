LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Hello, friends.
We are here at Solve
for India Hyderabad,
and I have with me Sushrita,
who is an engineer.
Sushrita, what actually
brought you to this event?
SUSHRITA YERRA: I
am actually looking
to meet people who are
working in similar areas.
And since Google
is the one taking
the forefront of the run.
So I wanted to meet
people like you
who would give us more
inputs in how to proceed
and what are the
technologies that
are available in this area.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
What are the technologies
that you typically work with?
SUSHRITA YERRA: I've been
developing Android apps
for now.
But right now I
would want to start
learning about machine learning,
artificial intelligence.
So I started using
TensorFlow, but not yet.
But I'm still learning.
SUSHRITA YERRA: Did you
come across anything
that you did not
know here today?
SUSHRITA YERRA: Yes, actually.
All these APIs that you
talked about, I was like,
I completely didn't
know about them.
So after going home, the
first thing I'm going to is
look up all those APIs.
And also, the Google Assistant
API that Dushyant talked about,
I really like that.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Oh, that's nice.
Being a woman in
tech, what do you
feel is the scenario when you
were doing your engineering?
SUSHRITA YERRA: Actually,
before college, I'd
say the number of girls who
are coming into engineering
college is pretty low because
of the various social,
psychological, or
cultural aspects that
come into picture, which is,
again, another discussion
entirely.
But once into college, I
think it's a personal choice.
There are no specific reasons
why guys participate more
or girls don't.
So I think it's coming into
college and the problems there.
So once in the college,
I think everyone's
doing their thing personally.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN: OK.
And what do you think
would be a solution
for a problem like
this, which does not
have one right solution?
SUSHRITA YERRA: I think
technology, as a whole, is--
at least for our generation,
it started from 10th, 11th,
from that area.
And as an Indian culture
that I have observed,
the women are more
intimidated by technology,
because they're risk-averse.
They don't want to be humiliated
or put into that position.
So if we can incorporate
technology and make
it more prevalent in school,
maybe fifth standard,
second standard--
I don't know the
social aspects of it--
if that is possible,
then maybe I
think more women will
come into picture.
They won't be intimidated by it.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Thank you so much, Sushrita.
I hope you go and try all these
out, and give us feedback.
SUSHRITA YERRA: I'd love to.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Thank you so much for making it
to the event.
SUSHRITA YERRA: Thank you.
