achieve startup success through
in-person meditation if you look at
India today we have 400 million folks
online and by 2020 it's going to be six
hundred and fifty million that's a huge
number and therefore we feel that
working closely with developers
entrepreneurs startups is the way to go
forward and the core of leaders lab is
really around this question how do you
help smart and very motivated people
Google and I believe at Google is that
the best way to help them grow is simply
by giving them feedback this is built
upon Google's best practices and you
know in people operations and supported
by Harvard and Stanford research so we
really use the best of Google and the
best of the world the leaders lab was
beyond my expectations what are my
strengths what are my weaknesses what
are some of the gaps that I should be
focusing on to become even a more
effective leader how do you have those
tough conversations with people how do
you structure it in the right way the
value of honesty the way the feedback
was collected I think I really like that
from our colleagues from our partners
from our clients that was a great effort
by team Google to actually do that for
us because we wouldn't do that ourselves
launch that accelerator is a global
program we're looking to empower the
startup leaders across the world
especially in the next billion market
and we want to help them of course
achieve success but lift up the
potential of what's possible
