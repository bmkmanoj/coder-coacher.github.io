MRIDULA MALLYA: Hi, everyone.
I'm with Clare Bayley, who is
the global lead for Codelabs.
Hi, Clare.
CLARE BAYLEY: Hi, Mridula.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK, it's
great to have you here.
We just want to know,
what's your experience been
like at GDD India so far?
CLARE BAYLEY: The
experience has been amazing.
The energy level here
is higher than I've ever
seen at an event we've done.
And that just feels so
powerful, as someone
who is here to kind of
present educational materials.
MRIDULA MALLYA: That's awesome.
OK, and any specific
experience that stands out
for you from the Codelabs?
CLARE BAYLEY: I'd
have to say that this
is the first event where
people have come up
and they're already really
familiar with our content.
They already know
about Codelabs.
They're so thirsty
to learn, they
found it on their own,
which is just amazing to me
as product lead,
to see people so
excited about what we're doing.
MRIDULA MALLYA: Just
a very basic question,
but what are Codelabs?
CLARE BAYLEY: Codelabs
are hands-on, step-by-step
tutorials that teach
you how to do something
by having you actually do it.
It's the learn-by-doing
principal of Google Developers.
MRIDULA MALLYA: That's great.
For all the viewers
back home who
couldn't make it to
GDD India, how do they
experience the Codelabs?
CLARE BAYLEY: So
Codelabs are a great way
to get in on the GDD
action from home.
All of our content
is available online.
The Codelabs that are
here at the conference are
at g.co/codelabs/GDD17.
Everything people can do here
can be done online from home
even after the conference.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK.
Thank you so much, Clare.
It was great talking to you.
CLARE BAYLEY: You, too.
MRIDULA MALLYA: For all of you,
do check out the link below
and experience
Codelabs for yourself.
