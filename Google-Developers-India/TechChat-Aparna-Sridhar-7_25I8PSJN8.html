product manager at hacker and there's so
many people who really look up to you
what we only inspired you into
technology I started like writing my
first program when I was saying six and
you know just playing around with basic
back in the days when you know we had
dial-up connection and when I decided
what to do for you know undergraduate
studies that's when you know I had the
option to again pick computer science
and at that point in time I did it back
to this enjoyable experience I had as a
child and faculty I would give that a
try tell us about your experience as we
coach for the Udacity android nanodegree
something that I would like to highlight
about teaching is that it's been like
the most fulfilling and gratifying you
know experience can I help that one
student who almost wants to give up on
programming go almost feels like this
experience too hard if I can have that
one person at a time you know progress
I feel like later in their life
sometimes they would they would look
back to do this for somebody else who
are in your message to the women in tech
Houston mhm
we undergo a large periodic I cannot
tell you the number of times on the only
woman in the room and automatically the
question is are you sales are you in
marketing the more women can do to like
break that stereotype to like embrace
more of these roles you know the more we
can change this perspective that we do
have index thank you so much Aparna so
