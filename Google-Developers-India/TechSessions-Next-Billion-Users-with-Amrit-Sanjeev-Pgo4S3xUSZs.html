AMRIT SANJEEV: What I'm going to do today?
Three things.
Why should we focus
on emerging markets?
Why are we so focused
on some of these things?
The rationale for it?
What are some of the key
differences between markets, where
like an emerging market compared to
something of a place where,
people are so used to mobile devices?
And the things that you might
want to keep in mind,
if you want to kind of get engagement
from the &quot;Next Billion Users.&quot;
Who am I?
This is me in pictures.
I've shown this in
many talks before.
If you've attended any
of my previous talks,
then you might be
familiar with this.
But, I look like,
the guy in the center most days,
because I code a lot,
and that too,
in the middle of the night.
So I'm caffeinated, coding.
You can get a response from me
at 3 in the morning
faster than you would get
at 3 in the afternoon.
Because I'm like really focused in
on things at that time.
In fact, I had a small
stint as a manager.
That's why the Darth Vader.
&amp;amp; then I moved back
to engineering
After 2 years I said,
enough is enough,
I moved back to engineering.
So I went from the dark side
to the good side now.
And interestingly,
at Google, we get a badge.
If you've ever worked
as a manager,
we'll get that
Darth Vader badge.
So a fun fact about Google.
Things I worked on?
I worked on Linux kernel apps
earlier in my career.
And then moved on to Android.
Now being in Google
we can't get away from machine learning.
So there's a little bit of
machine--
I'm no expert in machine learning,
by the way.
But I do dabble in and out of that,
a little bit.
Enough about me, let's move on--
yeah thats my day job
by the way.
I talk a lot about it,
but that's my day job.
I work as a
Developer Advocate at Google.
I manage developer
advocacy for the country,
working with a lot of
the top partners,
partner apps in the country.
Coming to the session,
Why should we focus on
the next billion?
It's a huge market.
A huge market that
most people are
not really targeting
at this point of time.
This is where the growth is
two times larger
than any other market
that you have.
Because a lot more
of the users
if you put out
a solution right now,
you are going to see
a lot more users coming out
from this market
than maybe, the developed nations.
The adoption,
if you just say, the adoption
in both of these markets
for a very successful solution
this is where a lot of them
are getting traction now.
And there's a lot--
a huge increase in
the smartphone adoption
at these places.
But at the same time,
they experience solutions
slightly differently.
And those differences
are what I want
to call out in the next
set of slides out here.
Those are things
that you wanna consider
when you're building the solution.
So that your solutions
tune to these people.
A typical user's priorities
are different.
I want to call this
on the big slide,
basically because this is something
that is
very important to keep in mind.
A lot of the literature
that you see
is based on user research
that happens on the west,
in a developed nation.
So you really need
to start looking
at that user in these regions,
how their priorities are,
what they really
take into consideration, when
they are looking at an app.
And that is important for you.
It is completely different
in terms of, when you start
thinking their mindset.
One of them is that
a lot of people
perceive internet to be slow.
It is slow if you go to a
tier 2, tier 3 city,
a majority of user's experience
is slower than advertised.
I understand, Reliance Jio
did make a lot of difference
in the country,
that's past six months.
But the perception of people
hasn't changed that quickly.
If you should ask people
in tier 2 cities,
they still say internet is slow.
So we want to keep
that into mind.
Secondly, it is also expensive.
The expense has
come down drastically
in the last six months.
But people are still
turning off their data.
If you check that data right,
people still don't
keep their data on all the time
even though the internet speeds
have increased,
as well as the cost
has decreased considerably.
But this is more of habit,
than really
being worried about the costs.
They're still being
cautious about it.
So you just cannot say that
oh! Most people are on Jio
so they will be on all the time
and make assumptions like that.
The other critical factor is,
lot of them are prepaid users.
How many of you here
are prepaid users?
A much smaller percentage.
But you develop for people, who
are on that prepaid channel.
So the experience they have,
they are more aware of the balance.
They're more aware of
how much money is going out
of their accounts,
which means that they're
going to be more cautious
about allowing data,
or anything that consumes money,
on their devices
than post paid users.
So you need to think
of this factor a lot.
A lot of your users
are prepaid users.
In fact,
according to research
it's 95% of subscribers
in some of these regions.
So you have that difference
coming in there.
&amp;amp; what Ravish mentioned
a lot of these guys
are actually coming in first time
mobile users.
Their usage experience
is different.
The patterns they are used to
are different.
How they perceive
their applications
and how comfortable they are
with interacting with the UI
is different.
You need to take these things
into consideration.
In short, we just need to
rethink the parameters.
A lot of this is something
you know already
but we need to rethink
these parameters when
considering tuning these apps
for regions like ours.
So that more users, find it more easier
to onboard on them.
More users find it more convenient
to work with us.
Let me go through the details.
Talking about the users.
They might be
on a smartphone
which is maybe 6,000 rupees,
less than $150 if you think of it.
But they don't want to
experience the internet
differently.
They don't want to experience
your apps differently.
They want
the full-fledged experience.
A Flipboard app
that doesn't flip
is not something, that will give you
the same sort of happiness
work... play...
interacting with.
So it's not about making a
stripped down version of the app.
When somebody wants
a bike like that,
they're not going to be happy
with the one in the bottom.
So don't make your apps like
stripped down, less functionality.
The light word doesn't
mean that people
are going to be happy
with something that does not
provide them
the grand experience of working
with a full app.
This is an engineering problem.
OK, working with flaky networks,
less RAM,
working with slow process.
These are engineering problems,
users want
us engineers to solve.
They're not going to
give you the credit
saying that,
I have a device that does not
have a lot of bandwidth,
or does not have
a lot of computing power,
so the developer gave you
a substandard experience.
No, they are not
going to do it that way.
So, it is an engineering problem
they want us to solve.
So please,
look at it from the fact,
they have high expectations,
they demand apps to work,
behave better,
like no jerkiness.
Even if it's a small,
if it's a $200 device,
your app should perform well.
That is a minimum.
It is not like, that,
oh that is a good thing to have.
That's a minimum benchmark
that users
would want you guys to
provide your apps in
So engineering,
better solutions,
considering these things
is critical.
Battery usage.
How many of you want
one more hour of battery
in your devices?
If somebody is not
raising their hands,
I would really want to
talk to them after this.
But the reality is,
every one of us want it.
I want five more hours.
But the whole idea is,
a lot of times,
it's the apps
on our devices which
make this difference.
India by far,
if you look at the stats,
has one of the lowest
average battery life for devices.
And that's a lot due to
the kind of apps that are
running on the platform.
So it is up to you guys,
as developers,
to ensure that
users have a better
experience on their devices
when they install the your app.
If you were to drain that battery
in two hours,
that's the first thing
they're going to do
is uninstall the app
after the first day,
when they realize that
that app is
actually taking bandwidth--
or sorry, taking battery.
This is now becoming 1 of the
no. 1 reasons
why people uninstall apps.
It's slowly trumping the fact that
this space problem,
which all of us talk about,
ok, there's not enough space
on the disk,
then people uninstall my app,
this, is now becoming
one of the top reasons, from the region.
So be conscious about
how you actually
consume battery in your app.
If there are things
that you could use
in order to make things better
from a battery life perspective
do that.
The last thing you want to do,
when you have
5% left in your battery,
is an app to upload a large video
or a photo from your app.
So if apps could consider
those considerations
on what is there on the device,
how much battery there is,
can I defer it to a point where
it is connected to a charger,
these sort of things
will matter to the user.
This gives a much better
experience on the platform
as well as with your app.
So the chances
they will uninstall
because they feel
your app is actually misbehaving
or that your app
is too much drain on their device
will go away.
Mobile network.
Yes, we have 4G.
But a lot of places,
maybe at Hyderabad
and Bangalore and Delhi,
we have a good spread.
But a lot of the tier 2,
tier 3 cities
don't have the speeds
that they advertise.
They have flaky networks.
They do have to rely
a little more on the fact
that apps will consider this
and then work accordingly.
Simple things like text first,
image later.
These're principles
that you can
apply to make your apps
feel more responsive on
slower networks.
Maybe, if,
one other thing to consider is,
if the hardware
has a lot more capability
doesn't mean that the app will
perform better there.
The person is on
a 4G LTE device.
Connected to 2G.
Immediately the device
is a 2G device at this point
because that's all the pipeline
its going to get the data from.
So having an understanding of that,
understanding
that the user
is on a 2G network,
let me load
a slightly lower resolution image.
Instead of making him wait
for 10 more seconds,
let me give him the experience
of at least a lower network,
get the image out there faster.
The responsiveness of the
UI becomes better
things like that happen
which are a lot better
So, work with the mobile data,
test on airplane mode.
This is a test
most people don't do.
When you're doing test cases,
you
might do it on a
slow speed network
If you're not doing,
do that.
Also test on airplane mode,
because a lot of times, users
might have their internet
turned off, or
they might not have
network connectivity in the region
where they are opening your app.
You don't want your app
to crash at that point.
You want the app to
gracefully degrade--
or give a degraded experience,
if it can provide,
but never crash
on those conditions.
So if you're running test cases,
not, &quot;if&quot; you're running,
you &quot;should&quot; be running,
&amp;amp; when you're running
testcases
you need to go ahead
and ensure that you
test on any airplane mode.
Just load your app
on airplane mode,
see whether it conveys information,
that hey,
in this region,
I cannot work without the internet.
Or at another place,
if it can't show data
which is there in the cache,
it does that properly.
Conveying the message
to the user that, yes, I'm
showing you older data
but that's because
I don't have internet.
So that really matters--
gives a better experience
to the user.
What do you think
a cost to an app is?
A lot of times
people actually consider that.
A dollar value or a rupee value
on the app.
But if you're charging your app for free,
like you're saying,
that is a zero value.
Do you think
that's the cost of the app?
Not really.
Because, you should consider the fact
that the data cost
of downloading,
and also running your app,
if you're downloading a 20MB app,
and initializing with
5MB of data from the internet,
that's 25 MB of data,
that is the cost of your app.
So it's not dollar value
or a rupee value
that you add as the initial payment,
but also the cost,
people see it that way too.
They'll understand that your app
is consuming lot more data
it's taking a lot more of my bandwidth,
it becomes a point
for people deciding to uninstall your app.
So this is something
you've got to consider
Making your app's size small
is important for our region,
because somebody on a prepaid phone
on his last
25 rupees of
internet data available,
then thinks whether I should
download a large file or not,
that is a lost customer,
equal to lost business,
equal to lost revenue.
So making your app small
is important.
Data usage.
Adapt to the network speeds.
That's one thing that
I'll keep calling out,
adapting to the situations
on the phone.
If you've a
2G network connected
if you are on a 4G network,
pull out 100 articles,
if it's a news reader app,
because it'll come faster,
the user can actually use it.
If it's on a 2G,
make that data smaller,
the chunk smaller.
Because the experience
of downloading 100 on 4G
might take 4 seconds,
but on 2G might take 20 seconds.
So you don't want the user
to wait for 20 seconds,
you want to make that smaller,
so that
he still gets an experience
of having it run at 4--
having the UI populate
and everything
happen within 4 seconds
that you thought about.
Those SLA's that you're keeping.
Anticipate what users want.
One of the most common pieces
of information that most people miss
when they design the UX
is, you have a lot of data,
how people use your app,
the pattern in which
people use your app
Take for instance a news reader.
This is data
I have actually
found in using a news reader app
that I wrote myself.
80%, 80+ percent of my users
always start with the same
source all the time.
Everybody has a preference
of the source that they start
reading with,
80+ percent of my users.
On weeks, it's 90+ also,
but averages 80+ over two years.
Now what I do is,
I load that data first,
not other things.
I just load that data first.
So that when the user
clicks on that,
opens my app, clicks on that,
he always gets the latest news.
You might think, what happens
if the user clicks something else?
What about the 20 other percent?
So my question there was,
do you want
to get a degraded performance
for a 100% users.
or do you want
to delight 80% of them?
That's what you wanna answer
It's like a cache.
Sometimes it'll miss,
but that is 20% of the time,
people might
click on something else,
they will
have to wait for
a few more seconds for the
app to refresh data.
But still, for 80% of the time,
users instantly get that.
So funnel the information of
how people are using your app,
that analytics back into
how you design experiences.
So syncing data from the network,
loading data on the screen,
all these things can be
tuned or tweaked based on
how users are using your app.
That's one really useful
piece of information.
Use OS constructs like,
Firebase, JobDispatcher,
or JobScheduler, which is there for
newer Android versions,
to help your app
schedule jobs like,
network uploads or syncing,
where the system will consider
all the tasks
that is handed to it.
When you actually pass something
the JobDispatcher or JobScheduler,
what the OS does is,
it knows all the tasks
that are scheduled
through these libraries
Then it will decide,
oh I can batch these things together,
so you have something at 12:00,
something at 12:05,
and something a 12:10,
the OS will be smart enough to think,
maybe I should batch
all of this together,
&amp;amp; then run it in one shot
so that
the amount of time my network hardware
has to run at full strength
reduces.
So there are optimizations like that
that the OS can do
when you use constructs like this.
And please use them.
Wherever the OS can fine tune,
help the OS,
by providing the information.
A sync job should not be
a service that you write.
It should be handed over
to a JobDispatcher,
which is a library that is
backward compatible,
or a JobScheduler
which starts from them.
That's where you really need
to help the OS optimize things.
Other one.
Data Saver settings.
In your devices,
you have something called
Data Saver which allows
only the app in the foreground
to send data.
Respect that, because the user
would most probably turn it on
when they want to save data
where
they're on the last 100MB of their limit,
things like that.
So if you
respect that information,
like if the app
is on Data Saver mode,
your app comes to the foreground,
gets network access
you want to
just download lesser amount
of data to save the bandwidth.
You don't want
to just suck the last
100MB,
by syncing large data.
You want to call it out to a different-
maybe
go onto an unmetered network
before
you start uploading information
or you start pulling
more data down.
Give, maybe a lower threshold.
Like for instance,
in a news reader article,
maybe, instead of loading
the 1,000 new articles,
load just the first 25 of them.
So you don't really suck out
all bandwidth
when Data Saver mode
is running.
It's an indication of
what the user's intent is.
Think offline.
Offline is a state, where,
people think of it like,
an exception state.
It's not.
It's one of the normal states
through which the user goes
with using an app.
So think about
this offline architecture with
less reliance on the network
or something
that you should build in
if your app is
very popular in areas where
there could be a flaky network.
So you really need to see
that it works decently.
Like I mentioned earlier,
it works with a better
user experience.
Maybe load data
from a database.
So everytime
you're getting caching data
you're not pulling
everything from the server,
you're pulling it,
storing it locally,
and then updating your UI.
This way what happens is,
when the network data is not there
you can still populate data
from your cache.
Things like that
will really, really help.
Be resilient to network changes.
It can happen
that the user is traveling.
This is a mobile device,
which means people are on the move.
It's not portable,
It's just not like,
I will use it standing here.
So my network connections will be
what it is there.
I will take this around in a car,
take it in a bus,
work with it,
so network states keep changing.
It could get connected.
It could go into
a high-speed network.
Then network speed can drop.
Network speed can become zero.
You need to be aware
of these conditions.
You need to be aware of this.
You app should be aware of this
and adjust itself accordingly.
One common state
which we need to actually deal with is,
you're connected
to 4G network
where the data
download is zero bytes.
If you look at the network interface,
it says 4G.
But,
the user shouldn't wait infinitely,
because the data is not coming.
Stuck in a traffic block,
in a large traffic block,
you will experience this
a lot of times.
I come from Bangalore.
We have traffic blocks long enough,
where we experience this all the time,
where your phone says
that it's connected to 4G network
but the bandwidth that you get
is really really low.
These conditions should be like
half timeouts to network listeners.
Things like that will help you
mitigate these situations
or work around these situations,
giving a user a better experience.
Think about
partial loading states.
Because this is something
that happens
a lot of times in our loading.
Half of it is loaded,
sometimes the connection
goes away in that state.
So partial loading states
are something
that you need to take care of
when you're building for us
our networks.
It's not just connected loaded.
There are states in between
that happen.
So. you might test these on Wi-Fi.
You say, call the sync.
&amp;amp; the sync happens
instantly in 1 second,
so you don't put a UI state
which says
syncing, 10% done, 20% done.
But on a 2G network
or an edge network,
these states become really important
to keep users engaged.
User is not like,
oh, the screen is frozen?
He doesn't have to guess
what's happening
on that device
at that point of time
or on that app
at that point of time.
So partial loading states
become really important.
This is again a common pattern
that you see, no network connection.
We see it a lot of times,
apps saying this to you.
But this is, kind of, useless.
Because,
yeah, but what do I do about it?
For first time user, getting this is
just no actionable data there.
It would be best
if user figures out
whether the data setting
is turned off,
and then tell the user do this.
So having a call to action,
instead of telling a problem,
I won't work
because there's no data.
or instead
giving a call to action
will actually help you
have users continue on your app.
So, avoid these sort of common things,
because, if you go to
a developed nation
this will come very rarely.
So this is fine when you
actually show it as a problem,
you might want to
check it yourself.
But in our condition,
sometimes it comes in too often.
So you want to help users,
tell users
not like, you figure it out...
Let me help you,
these might be the probable reasons,
you could do these things.
So have a call to action to conditions
that are outside your control
So that user can actually check.
Is your data turned off?
Or can you check under Settings
at this place?
Because some of these users
are not used to this devices or OS'
as much as, you might be.
So you want to help them
get that far.
Device storage.
One third of users,
get this message
daily.
It's a lot more than you think.
We have a lot of devices
with low storage.
We have devices in our region
lot of devices
with lower storage.
People install a lot of apps
everything consumes
a little bit of information.
But when this comes up,
that message comes on the screen,
and the user clicks on it.
He gets a list of apps
which are using a lot of the data.
That's a point they'll say,
Oh!
This app, I'm not using all the time,
it's consuming a lot of data,
let me delete it.
Lost customer for you.
One trick that you could do is,
whenever this notification comes,
just before that,
the system actually sends this broadcast,
Action - Device Storage Low.
This is a point in which
your app can capture this,
and then delete its caches.
And that will allow you
not to be there on the list of apps
to be deleted.
Because your app can actually say,
I don't need this cache,
let me empty the cache,
because the device is running
low on space.
It could be an image cache
which is like
hundreds of MB's of data
which is associated to your app.
Your delete that cache
your app is not going to come
on the top list.
So you can react to
these system broadcasts,
and make your app, not be
the candidate for deletion by the user.
So think about this.
Have a handle,
have a broadcast receiver
which gets this,
and then clears up the cache
when the device space runs low.
It will save you
some uninstalls automatically.
Adaptive behavior,
because I did talk about it.
But low RAM--
you can actually capture low RAM
by adjusting, or,
work around low RAM
by adjusting to some of the calls
that I mentioned here.
Like get memory class.
When you start,
how big your cache sizes should be?
How much data should you pull
from the server?
Because the more you ask,
the more JSON is gonna come
or XML is going to come,
which means you need
more memory to parse it.
You need more memory
to store it in your memory.
So all of this can be
controlled by thinking of,
what is a class of memory?
How much RAM is available
for you to work with
at that point of time?
And adapting your--
if you see that,
oh, there's only 10MB of RAM
that's left for my app to be allocated.
That's not a point
that you wanna load
a high res image on your app.
You might want to wait
for more RAM to be released.
And adapt automatically
to these conditions,
so that you don't get
the &quot;out of memory&quot; exception,
and you don't have to
deal with that as much.
It's a tricky exception to deal with,
if it is based on images.
If you have a lot of images,
those are places, where you will need
a lot more of this.
Language support.
We talked about a lot today.
So I'm going to very quickly do
it, but local language support,
really, really important.
A lot of users will
actually appreciate that,
not just in India, globally.
A lot of places, education
is in their local language.
India we use a lot
more of English,
it's an aspirational language.
But if you go to
France, we go to Russia,
English is not the
aspirational language for them.
They are not always
trying to learn it.
And I had this
firsthand experience
when I worked in Portugal.
Portugal everybody studies in
Portuguese, even engineering.
Their textbooks
are in Portuguese.
So their need to actually
study English is a lot less.
And so it's difficult for
them that they would really
prefer to actually have
text in Portuguese.
They wouldn't want
that to be in English.
So it's not like they love
to learn that or anything.
They're likely not
comfortable with English,
so if you have
Portuguese, that's great.
English?
OK.
You want, then I
will stress myself.
I will take that effort
to work with the RAM.
But when your RAM is optional,
that's not what you want.
If your company doesn't support
the language that they like,
they will move on to there.
APK size.
Really, really important.
You give our 25 MB
app, Immediately,
the number of installs
on your mobile data
decreases drastically.
A lot of the top apps
like Flipkart, Myntra,
all these things guys
take a lot of effort
to crunch the size down.
Me?
I work with a lot of
the large partners,
so I know that is
a big consideration
for a lot of them.
And they've seen
strong correlations
between the app size
versus download size,
number of downloads.
When they reduce the app
size, the downloads increase.
So they always take
it very seriously.
Control this one, they evaluate
libraries very seriously
to see how much weight
that gets added to the app
when they actually
take up a new library.
So this is something that you
want to keep trying to reduce.
Try to keep under 65K
which is the next limit.
It's not always
possible for large apps,
and apps with a lot
of functionality.
But still, if you can do
it, do that because then
on all the devices the
performance is consistent.
If you multi-dex on older
devices, Android devices,
the performance is slightly
degraded, especially
the startup time.
This keeping it down here
gives a consistent experience
on all the devices.
It could also across user base.
Update cycle.
This is something quite
interesting in India.
In India, and in the
next billion users,
users don't update that often.
Which means your testing needs
to be really, really strong.
You can make a mistake
that causes a crash
and say, oh I will release my
APK in the next three days.
It takes users roughly
about six to eight weeks
to update to the latest
version of the app.
Majority of your users,
like 90% of users
to move the next version.
So you're testing needs to
be a lot stronger to capture
all these sort of conditions.
And not think that you
have an option to upload
a new APK everybody will
immediately switch over.
That doesn't happen that easily.
And all our data shows that very
clearly that people actually
have slower and often
the newer versions.
And that is something
that you need to consider.
You might want to
also think about
if you're a security app--
I mean, security-sensitive
app, like a banking app,
you need a way of
communicating to user
that they need to update.
I mean, it's important
to upgrade immediately.
Some apps even go to the
length of going and doing
a forced update.
They will not let the user
continue unless and until they
update the app.
So for security-sensitive
apps, these
are all options that you
might want to consider.
But if you're a photo sharing
app or something that's
not absolutely
important, you don't want
to force the user to upgrade.
You might want to
nudge the user.
You might want to send out
notifications so older versions
at the appropriate
time, and they're
connected to the
internet, when they
are on one metered
network, you want
to send that notification
telling them that,
hey, maybe you
should update my app
right now because we have a
security batch list there.
So these things are
important to call off.
Notifications.
Not all users are
online all the time.
So having a notification
with like two hours
as the expiry time, does
not work in India that well.
I did some research
on this last year,
and 12 hours was something that
a lot of partners were using.
We got something like
12% to 15% improvement
just by making that 18 hours.
Just another six hours
more to the lifetime
of the notification bumped up
the rate of delivery by a lot.
Because a lot of
people turn of data,
and you need to wait
for them to turn it
on before the notification
can be delivered.
Putting a smaller TTL, time
to live for the notification,
makes it more susceptible
to be expiring: in the time
the user has actually
turned the data off.
Somebody who turns the data
at 9:00 in the morning,
and then turns it on again
at 6:00 in the evening
means they're offline for
a larger amount of time
than four hours.
So the notifications
will actually reduce.
The other techniques
that we use in order
to improve notification,
but to some
of the partners to
get it as high as 85%.
75% to 85% delivery
rates in India,
working with a few of
the design patterns
that we've talked about.
And also understand
the user's behavior.
Then does your user
actually online more?
When does a majority of
the users coming online?
That's the point that you
want to send a notification.
Don't do it in the
middle of the night,
users will get
irritated by that.
You want to consider
all these factors
and then start using
notification channels better
and have lesser number
of them expiring.
Play services availability.
This is another concern.
But a lot of the libraries
require the latest play
services.
But the same update
cycle problem
that I talked about
earlier comes back here.
Where people don't
update that often.
So play services
also has the trend
of getting updated
not that regularly.
So if you're putting
a library that
requires the latest and greatest
of play services available,
you might want to check
what percentage of the users
are actually on the
latest version of play.
And then make a
decision on that.
Because the last
thing a user wants.
Is he is actually on
a slow speed network,
they open it up use it, and
then suddenly the pop up
comes and says download 20
MB before you can use my app.
Or download some XMB
before you use my app.
Or update something.
These sort of
messes are something
that they want to see
when they're on the move.
This is something
that should happen.
So play services
availability, if you you
can actually track
that in your analytics,
and see that all measure
of different play
services, majority of
my users are on play.
So only a smaller
percentage of users
are going to see
this update dialogue.
So the number of people
thinking about it
and dismissing the app because
they don't want to update
to that point reduces.
Garbage collection.
Low RAM devices have
this a lot more.
The reason I called it is
this is a little technical,
but the whole point is when
you're testing your apps,
if you look at the
performance model
there's an icon for
garbage collection.
So you can actually have
garbage collector run off
garbage collector run
on the emulator then
you're on the device
when you are actually
testing your apps use
that as a testing option
because, you might test it
to that point on the high end
device where the garbage
collector is not coming.
But when the user uses
it, the garbage collector
comes in between.
The large expensive operation
used, you start seeing janks.
So you want to test, by
trying out the most expensive
operations in between what
happens when the garbage
collector comes.
Will the user have a
very bad experience
in the UI because of that?
Something that you
want to test out
and keep this as something
that you want your tester
to do when they are running
some of these really fancy
animations on your screen.
If your UI has that.
Wild animations, when the
animation would have happened,
just click on the
garbage collector.
See what the effect of it?
Does it gracefully degrade?
Or does it really cause
confusion to the user?
User behavior.
I think Ravesh talked
about it a lot.
But then you also
need to consider facts
that fact of first time users
are very sensitive to battery
usage, online offline patterns.
These are all additional
things that you
can consider when you
decide how you want to cater
certain features to the user.
Very highly likely to give
one stars on the first crash.
We are.
As a region, it is there is
this trend of regionally, how
people negatively rate the app.
India users very
quickly rate it.
And if you ask your own
self how many of you
give five stars for
a lot of the apps?
The majority of people
say, I give four
because there's always
room for improvement.
True, that's their benchmark.
This is quite
democratic in nature.
They're always
allowed to do that.
But there's a sensitivity
towards negativity rating
something because they expect
the standards are really high.
So you want to consider that.
Designing differently.
I'll just quickly skip over
this because Ravesh did a talk--
45 minute talk on this one.
So it's most of the things
that he mentioned here.
Learn from other tech.
When we talked about
PWA, a lot of times PWA
highlights what
apps shouldn't do.
Or they tell you the
problems that users
face, like install friction,
the apps size being larger.
So when you actually see
other tech don't ignore them,
let's understand from
them why they are actually
working really well for
some segment of audience.
You could actually
take cues from there.
PWA works really well
for tier two users, why?
Because most people
are used to it.
Then maybe bring
the next experience
from their upbringing
and bringing
in one of the characteristics
of those technologies
into your app, might get
you app to work a lot better
on those two for that
segment of users.
So learn from other tech too.
Local trends.
I would strongly suggest you to
optimize before local trends.
There are a lot of
festivals in our country.
So have people spend more
during festival time.
So maybe a promotion
campaign could actually
take that into consideration.
Things like product
launches, like Android auto
was launched last year.
You have one process
Reliance Jio came out.
So you want to keep up with
these network trends or events
that happen outside
of the ecosystem which
affects the ecosystem in a way.
Because when Reliance actually
introduced the network
and give data for free.
Consumption of video
increased drastically.
So if you have a product, which
is an entertainment product,
you might want to focus
on giving a lot more
of video at that point, to
increase usage of your app,
increase the
engagement in your app.
So these are some of the things
that you want to consider.
I understand I talked
a lot on these factors,
but keep some of them in mind.
Give them priority.
I think a lot of you guys
know all of these things.
But it is more about
keeping these things
in mind when you are
designing your product,
and your solution,
that will actually
make it a lot more easier.
Its like all these small
inches add to the mile.
So one of them is not going
to make 50% improvement
in your downloads.
But all these small things
do make a difference when
it comes to the whole solution.
Like I always mention,
these are my channels.
The @GoogleDevsIndia channel
on the Twitter and Google
Developers India.
These are two channels that you
could follow to understand more
about events, talks, and new
content that we roll out.
And that's it from me.
That's my Twitter
