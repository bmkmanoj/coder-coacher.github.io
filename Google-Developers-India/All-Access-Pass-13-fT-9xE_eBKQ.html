event at Hyderabad right now I have
default with me debug is a program
manager who works at Google hey Deepak
how are you Amonson good so b-but we
have seen that Google has come out with
quite few certification programs
recently so I as a developer myself in
India which are the certification
programs that exist and which I can take
so we have two certification programs
that is available one is the mobile web
specialist and it is coming soon but the
information is already available online
and we also have the associate Android
developer certification that is
available I did notice that there was
this Android certification core desk
over there but I also noticed that you
had a discussion with a lot of
developers we spoke quite a bit about
the associate Android developer
certification it is correctly available
it is online this exam demonstrates the
type of skills that an entry-level
Android developer should have and it's a
very good way for kick-starting your
career as an Android developer so
someone who's taken the certification is
saying that that he or she is in a
position to do the typical types of
activities that an Android developer
does on a day to day basis where can I
get this particular certification so if
you go to developers.google.com slash
training slash certification you cannot
get information about both the associate
Android developer certification as well
as a mobile web specialist and apart
from the certification are there any
contents online or on our YouTube
channel that I can go and simply consume
so if you go to developers.google.com
slash training a lot of the relevant
learning material is also available in
the exam content and what is it that we
look for as part of the exam is also
listed and the relevant material for
someone to engage and self-study is
available through a link on that
particular site and we have a lot of
content related to Android on of a
youtube channel as well it's a complete
course for a beginner level so
definitely try it out thank you debug
for all your time
that is spent talking about the
certification program and Jason Titus VP
talked about the Google developer day
2000
in seventeen and India it's happening in
December so do express your interest
because this event is going to be huge
you check out the space
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
