phonetic oh and I'm a developer advocate
at Google earlier this year at Google
i/o we announced in alpha the
architecture components a set of
libraries that allow you to design
robust festival and maintainable apps
and now the architecture components are
finally in 1.0 and they are ready to be
integrated in your own production
applications today I want to tell you a
bit about the architecture components
and I want to give you a set of best
practices just to make sure that what
you're doing is on the right track with
the components and also I want to tell
you a few things about one of the newest
additions of the components the paging
library which is still in alpha so let's
start with the architecture components
we'll go over each of them so let's say
that this is an activity that displays
information about the user one of the
biggest problems is configuration change
because this is when the activity gets
destroyed and then recreated this is why
in the architecture components we
created the concept of life cycle and of
life cycle owner so an activity or a
fragment has a life cycle therefore they
are a life cycle owner the life cycle of
a life cycle owner can be observed by a
lifecycle observer and you can implement
your own life cycle observer and define
methods that will be called whenever
specific life cycle event is triggered
so for example if you want to start
something like a location listener you
can just define I start method for it
and annotate that method with at
lifecycle events and the event that
you're interested in for example on
start and then this will be triggered
whenever on start will be called like
this we can create components that are
life cycle aware architecture components
provides one of these lifecycle aware
components this is live data
life data is actually a data holder and
other components can set the value of
the data that's being hold and
activities and fragments can observe
that live data and they can react on it
and update the UI but when the activity
is on pause or on destroy the subscriber
is removed the live data is considered
inactive so the events are not
propagated but when the activity is
recreated we subscribe again and then
the you I can again react on the changes
of the live data so the class is
designed to store and manage your data
so it survives configuration changes is
the view model and this is the life
cycle of a view model compared to the
lifecycle of an activity so what's
important here to notice is that
whenever the activity is finished the
view model is cleared so only then so
this means that the view model will
survive configuration changes but it
will not survive
pressing back killing the activity or
the application from recents or when the
fragment the framework kills your app so
this means that when long running
operations serve finish the view model
is updated independent on whether the
data is observed or not so this means
that you will no longer get null pointer
exceptions when you're trying to update
a non-existing view so you need you
should avoid references in the view
model because these can lead to memory
leaks or crashes so instead of pushing
data to the UI the UI observes the view
model so make sure you don't hold any UI
logic in the view but rather you move
this in the view model so it can easily
be unit tested so for example it will be
the view models responsibility to get
the user prepare it for it to be
displayed and then if needed hold it for
the UI and then the UI would notify the
view model about the users
the view model works with a repository
to get and set the data and repository
modules are responsible for handling
data operations they provide a clean api
to the rest of the application they know
where to get the data from what API
calls to make and when the data is
updated so you can consider them as
mediators between different data sources
it's a good idea to have a data layer in
your application completely unaware of
the presentation layer the thing is that
algorithms that synchronize and keep
cache and database in sync with the
network are not trivial so adding a
single point of entry that deals with
this is recommended so the repository
would know what call to to call what API
call to use to get the user and because
you want to make sure that we're not
doing more Network requests and it will
also save that in a database locally to
say that they follow clean architecture
components comes up with a new library
route is a wrapper over SQLite database
an object mapping library that provides
data persistence with minimal
boilerplate code so our table users
table will look something like this we
would have a user ID name and some other
user information and what we want is to
save the users in such a table and then
every row is an instance of the user
object to do this we define our user
object and we just annotate it with that
entity we define what are the columns of
this user by using that column info and
which one are is or our primary keys to
actually access the database and work
with the data there we use the data
access objects so we create an interface
or an abstract class we annotate it with
Dao and then there we define the methods
that work with our database these can be
inquiry in
update and delete Paris can also return
live data objects making this query and
observable query so what's an observable
query let's say that our users table
looks like this so we have two users
with ID three and with ID 4 but what
we're interested in is getting the user
with ID 4 so initially our life data
will emit John because we only want the
name for it and then when we update the
table and then we update the user with
ID 4 and instead of John we said the
username as Mark our life data will
automatically emits mark the new user
room also supports flowable if you're
working with our X Java
so usually developers that use our table
in their application tend to use it
throughout the entire layers so starting
from the repository to the view model to
the yuan so one thing that you could do
is use the live data only on the UI
layer so live data was made for the UI
so leverage that connection to the
activity lifecycle to help with this
transition between live data and our
Java you can use the live data reactive
stream class this provides two methods
from publisher that allows you to create
a live data from an array Chaves stream
and to publisher that allows you to
create an Rx Java string from a life
theta so using the observable queries
means that we can have a UI that
reflects the latest changes in the
database and then the view model
propagates the changes in the repository
to the yuan like this we have a high
degree of testability and a separation
of concerns what we're showing here is
actually the guide to app architecture
it's the way that we suggest that you
could architect your application so you
can have all of these properties
let's talk about saving the day time
let's say that we want to save that they
thought that we display on the UI where
should this be saved in unsaved innocent
state in the view model or in the
database so one thing that we should
really remember is the view model
survives configuration changes but not
pressing back killing the app from
recent or when the framework kills your
app so when we're creating an activity
this is what happens all creates gets
cold then the view model gets created
the view model works with the repository
the repository gets the user from the
API and then saves the user in the
database and then the view model creates
this user UI model a photo class that we
would use to display data on the UI so
let's go over a few scenarios
the first one is configuration change so
let's see what happens in configuration
change the on stop method is being
called and then on start it's being
called so here in on start we would just
display the user the user your I model
from the view model we don't need to do
any calls to the repository or to the
network scenario to the app goes to
background and then the user navigates
back to the application so when the
activity goes to background then the own
saved instance state is called and then
when the activity comes to foreground
again we can just display the user UI
model from the data from the view model
again we don't need to call the
repository we don't need to do any
network requests but scenario 3 the most
interesting one when the app goes to
background and the process is killed
well in this case when the activity goes
to background unsaved instance state is
called so this is the place where we can
save the user ID of our user and then
the activity gets killed
and then activity starts again in the
oncreate in the bundle we have this user
ID that we've saved before so based on
this user ID we can pass that to the
view model and then the view model gets
the user from the repository based on
that user ID so this means that we don't
need to do any network request if we
save the user ID in unsaved instance
State so in the end what should you put
in each of them what should you put in
unsaved instance State in the view model
or in the database well keep in mind
that in the database you should put the
data the survice process test so this is
where you should put your user object
the big one that you have then in the
view model you should put the data
needed for the UI so for example that
user your model that you use to display
on the screen and then in all saved
instance state you should put the
minimal amount of data that allows you
to restore the data so for example a
list of IDs but instead of one user
let's consider that we have a list of
users many applications need to load a
lot of information from the database but
database queries can take a long time to
run and use a lot of memory and we have
a new library the paging one that makes
it easy to load the information
gradually so for now the architecture
components is still in alpha and what
I'm going to tell you is not live yet
it's only gonna be released in the next
version of of the Alpha of the paging
library so the app starts the view model
for the spring is created the view
subscribe to the notifications of the
data the view model works through the
repository and is subscribing to the
data coming from it and then the
repository works with the data source
nothing new so fun so we have the data
coming from the data source to the
repository then to the devii model the
changes the data preparing it to be
displayed on the UI and then the view
model
give that data to the UI so let's say
that in the UI we have a recycler view
and that recycler view would work with a
recycler view adapter so that data would
go to the adapter and only then the
adapter will notify the UI and will
display the list on the screen so this
means that the advantage of this
architecture is that the data source is
completely separated from the UI and
then the UI just observes the data and
we can have one data source and an
recycler views we can easily reuse the
same UI logic the same data source logic
in different you wants and then the
paging library will actually be used
throughout this entire architecture the
objects that all of these classes have
in common is a page list and then
instead of a recycler view adapter you
would use a page list adapter with just
extends from a recycler view adapter and
uses a page list so let's see more
what's going on there we saw that we
have these main components so what's a
page list a page this is the lazy
loading list that pages content from a
data source in chunks it supports both
infinite scrolling lists but also
countable lists creating a paging list
automatically triggers loading of the
data from the data source and this is
why it should be done on a background
thread and this is the reason why the
paging library is using a live data
because life theta ensures that whatever
operation is done to request the data
from the data source is done on the
background thread and then once the data
is constructed then it can be passed to
the UI on the UI thread so let's say
that as a data source we have for now a
database the data source gets the data
for the page list from network or
database then the data is put in the
page list and then the pages adapter
works with the page list and updates day
one
what happens when the user Scrolls well
at this moment the page list requests
the next page from the data source the
data source gives the next page and then
the page list adapter updates the UI but
let's say that the user swipes away an
item so this means that the
corresponding item in the database gets
to be removed so the database is updated
the item is removed but because the
source was updated the data source is
invalidated and this leads to the
destruction of the source and the
recreation of the data source with a
page list so what's important to
remember is that several types of
operations can lead to an invalidation
of the data source so if you're doing an
insert an update or delete in a data
source then that should trigger an
invalidation of the data source and then
to the recreation of the page list and
then this new page list will be
populated with the data from the data
source but then the context of the to
page lists are compared in a digital on
a background thread and then the diff
util will tell the adapter was changed
and then based on this only now the
adapter collapses the missing row so you
can instance data source a database
network firebase file whatever you want
but you'll need to define how that data
is requested so for this we have two
different types of data sources the
first one is the key data source you
would use this one if you need the
elements n minus 1 to get the elements n
because of the key from the element
because based on the key from element n
minus 1 you'd be able to get the next
one so for example when you're working
with a data ordered based on a certain
criteria so when you will need to get
the users by name or
so when you're implementing your kids
datasource you will need to define an
initial load and then how to load after
the current item or before if the
scrolling up is allowed so all of these
would be based on a key this keeps
something that you would define in our
case for the user this key would be the
name of the user because this is how we
are ordering our list another type of
data source is the positional data
source so if you are using a fixed item
count to just based on the position
information you would use this
positional data source when you're
implementing a positional data source
you need to implement a load initial and
then a loads range and this is this
would be the point where you would be
requesting some data from your
background so when the data is received
you would inform the data source via the
load Kovack Kovach so the next step is
to implement the data source factory
that can create the data source and this
is needed because when the data source
is invalidated the factory is actually
the one that knows how to recreate the
data source if your data source is
actually room then just update your doll
to return a data source factory where
the key at least for now is always
integer under the hood in the
implementation of the Dao room will
create the data source factory for you
but how do you know when to trigger
these data requests how do you know when
the users scroll then that then it's the
time to get the data from the network
well for this you would use the page
list boundary callback in the boundary
chromic implementation the this callback
signals when a page list has reached the
end of an available data and this is
actually the point where you trigger
more requests from the database so
whether you should request items from
the front or from the end
of the list and then to actually get the
live data of a page list that ends up
being used by the UI we need to create
an instance of the live page list
builder so this gets us a parameter
let's say the network data source
Factory and then a page size so like how
many items should be in a page and then
you can set the boundary call back I was
showing you earlier this slide and I was
saying that the diffuser compares the
content of the two page lists but paging
library wants to optimize this and
instead of comparing two lists it knows
how to compare elements well it knows if
you tell it how to compare elements more
precisely you will need to implement a
diff call back between two elements and
you will implement two methods or
content the same and our items the same
and then in your adapter you would
extend the page list adapter of your
model and the view holder you would use
as a parameter in the constructor the
default callback that you've just
created and then you just bind your view
holder to the item in your activity you
need to make sure that it extends a
composite activity so it has a life
cycle and then in the oncreate method
you would create an instance of your
adapter and then you would observe the
changes of the live live data of a page
list from your view model and then
whenever that live data emits you will
set the new list to the adapter so now
we have a list the architecture
components have a high usability also
because of you
because of all the feedback that we've
received on it so check out the paging
library and give us give us feedback
tell us what works what not tell us
where you would need more things to be
done by the library instead of being you
the ones that have to implement it so we
had a lot of new concepts and components
we have life cycle live they top ageless
VMO
we have room but the thing is that you
can use them separately you can pick and
choose the ones that you need for your
application or if you want you can use
all of them together check it out and
let me know how it went
