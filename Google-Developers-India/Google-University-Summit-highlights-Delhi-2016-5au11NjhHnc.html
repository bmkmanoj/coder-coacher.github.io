India is coming along layers at this
relation today India is the second
biggest country in the world the truth
of the world about this soon it's gonna
be the real what we want to investing is
actually training the faculty from your
quality potential is so great and what
Google is doing to help catalyze that
innovation is it's really an exciting
time for these campuses we are really
trying to provide the best possible
experience to teachers in these faculty
hubs because the first step to training
2 million developers is to train the
teachers that are going to teach those
two new industry as of now demands lot
of updated curriculum developing two
million Android developers being working
in a technical university we can
contribute hugely on developing those
million have developers so we're excited
that all the raw materials are there to
create an innovation revolution in India
I really think the students are gonna
make some great things and I can't wait
to see what comes out there's not a
potential in India and we need to take
it forward with Google we can provide
rich opportunities to all that is the
essence of Google program which I have
seen this is a good move
and this program will definitely be
useful to to the students because after
development is going to rule the world
for next few years believe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
