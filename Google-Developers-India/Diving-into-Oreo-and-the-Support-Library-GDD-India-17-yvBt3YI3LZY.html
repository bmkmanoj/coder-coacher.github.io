gonna be giving a tour of the highlights
of the latest platform in support
library updates and we have a lot to
cover so Android 8.1 how many people
have downloaded in Android 8.1 image it
adds a lot of targeted enhancements for
Oreo Android go for example and we do we
do a bunch of things to make things work
better on lower Ram devices including
the elimination of these two services
notification listener and condition
provider and we also have new 8.1
Hardware feature constants which allow
you to target the distribution of your
apps and apk splits to devices that have
lower normal Ram of course we have the
new neural networks API and this is
going to work in tandem with tensorflow
Lite to distribute computational
workload across on device processors
including dedicated neural network
hardware graphics processing units and
digital signal processors and if you
don't have these things you know it'll
actually execute them on the CPU and
again you probably weren't going to use
this directly because you'll instead use
the neural networks API things like with
tensorflow lite or cafe 2 so we'll have
a talk on tentacle light tomorrow so if
you want to learn all about that come
and listen to my colleagues 8.1 also
adds a shared memory api and this one
could have actually wanted for a long
time we've had we've had memory file
this actually is a way to share data
enables the creation and an anonymous
shared memory instance you can M map the
shared memory object into a byte buffer
the memory protection can be controlled
on the parsable shared object which you
can pass to another process to a IDL and
once you don't need access anymore you
just on map the buffer what's really
cool is we also support this through the
NDK using a shared memory so you can
just and Mac the FD that you get and
then read and write we have new API for
wallpaper colors in 8.1 you can use the
wallpaper manager to get the most
representative colors from the current
wallpaper system UI and the pixel
launcher will actually adjust the colors
they use based on this API if you've
made a live wallpaper you actually
notify this wallpaper service whenever
your colors change significantly and you
return them in this on compute color
method and I recommend using the utility
functions within the wallpaper colors
class to automatically select these from
a representative but Navarrete Rob
picture-in-picture how many people have
played with picture-in-picture give me a
show of hands this is actually a really
cool way to over overlay a critical task
you know you begin by telling Android
your activity supports it and then we
enter picture-in-picture mode um with
code like this we have some picture in
picture params here we're actually
setting the aspect ratio of the p IP
window which is useful if you want it to
match video you're playing while your
app won't get touch events in pip mode
if your app is using media session
you'll automatically get media controls
so use media session but you can also
create custom actions with icons you can
display these provided material buttons
to allow your users to manually enter
pip mode but you can also automatically
enter it by overriding on lose your user
leave hint presumably only when your app
is doing something really important like
a video chat or playing a movie or
navigating and returning from
picture-in-picture is very simple you
get called back on your activity
transitions and on picture and picture
mode changed and one thing you should
know is that your activity has actually
automatically moved to a new task when
you enter pip mode so you lose the
activity stack so you might want to
recreate it when you're returning from
pip mode if you're a single activity app
this is really simple
of course we support multi display which
is cool they can now be launched by the
app on secondary displays and these have
per display based configurations and
resource management which is awesome so
if you support it - if you support multi
window make sure that this works
correctly we also support longer screens
obviously our was a lot of devices now
that have extended aspect ratios you're
targeting oh we assume you support it
unless you use these constants you can
letterbox your app but you know why
would you want to do that just make your
app actually work properly with long
screens of course we have adaptive
Launcher icons and we did this because
OEMs were using their own launchers with
custom icon shapes but Android shapes
for random so like in this example with
the Chrome in the Play Store they shrink
the icon or put our use a different icon
or using random color shape and it's
really not very cool so we do this you
have we actually have these adaptive
icons your app provides in two layers a
background and foreground layer the OEM
defines a rounded rectangle math shape
the user will then see this and a
circular shape will look like this
everywhere in the system UI that uses
Launcher icons such as in the Settings
app Allah Street
our overview title bar and your shared
sheet dialogue and to support wider
ranges of icon sizes we now recommend
that apps contain an icon asset at least
782 DP in size so it's important if a
third-party launcher wants to render
icons in large size it won't be super
sampled and again the actual size of the
foreground a background layer we want
update apps to is 108 DP so you want to
use them we want to pad this with extra
image around all four sides because so
we can do cool animations so you can
control your brand looks which is great
it's really important to please please
please added active icons you do this by
using an adaptive icon draw ball we
added this to Oreo it's for it's a
foreground and background tag you can
actually do this if you don't want to
waste space you can actually use this
new inset tag which allows for
fractional in sets which is pretty cool
so you can so you could use this magical
16.6 you can pad your 72 DP launcher
icon and that reduces the amount of size
increase you would have but again an
android n since you use this a target o
only and above you can actually use a
vector image which can really really
help keep things small and make things
work great everywhere Dada notification
enough oh of course has bunch of changes
to notifications again in previous
versions of Android you could only users
can only block notifications but in
Android oh we introduced notification
channels named categories of
notifications that share the same
behavior so users can control them they
can click here to see all the categories
clicking on a category reverse reveals
per category things like vibration and
sound etc we also added dots in the
launcher which is kind of a low-stress
way just even a PEZ notification while
pressing the icon reveals the
notification also you notice we can
install widgets this way which is really
cool so yeah I know all the things you
used to customize per notification
applies to the whole channel so again
you can add all this stuff to your
channel now and so a bullet point slide
but at the summary so make sure to set
up your channels with user happiness as
your goal make sure they have the right
defaults and of course make sure you of
course you can use notification compat
to set the channel information and if
you're targeting are a oreo you apps
we need to have notification channels
being used because otherwise your your
notifications won't show up all right so
into Android 7.1 we added these nifty
launcher shortcuts and you just drag
them and off and pitch them to the lawn
pin them to the launcher and apps can
request that a shortcut gets pin but
there was no indication in the app that
this worked and it wasn't great for
users or developers and so it no longer
works in o instead we have a new way of
doing it it uses the same shortcut info
is in Android 7.1 but it now asks the
user whether to add the shortcut and
where to place it and the app can
actually update the shortcut icon' an
intent later which is pretty cool custom
shortcuts were also in 7.1 it allows
shortcuts to be added from the widget
tray with an optional configuration
screen and the oreo api is definitely an
improvement there you just register the
custom shortcut activity with create
shortcut in content filter and in 7.1
they have to return the shortcut is an
intent extras directly in the activity
return but we now wrap all that
functionality which also allows the app
to update the shortcut again very very
cool you can see we can use compat to do
all this it's been a long time coming
with the action for way to surface app
widgets in your app which is awesome so
you know how you can actually request it
that have a button say hey install the
widget we've added autofill to Android
this is really cool
there's services as well as what you can
do an applet book in an app obviously
standard views actually just kind of
automatically work but you can actually
make it work better by providing hints
you can also mark fields at Auto field
autofill should ignore and it another
helpful touch API 27 version of the
support library you can pat now wraps
the autofill methods so yay one reason
have to be 27 so you can request
autofill like this on demand and you can
use it to on completely custom views
such as ones you draw with OpenGL or
Vulcan or just with canvas by providing
an auto-fill virtual structure no matter
how you build your apps please consider
integrating with autofill it is really
cool and it does help give a nice warm
welcome to a user if they're having to
reinstall your app particularly another
thing you can do is you can actually
link it autofill with your website by
using using digital asset linking so you
can do this by creating this JSON file
on your server in this case you just
define you want to share login
credentials with your website in your
app and then you modify your manifest
which points to a json string resource
that contains a list of web targets and
permissions like what you hosted on your
website and that's it if these two
chef's it's two steps you actually share
credentials between your app and your
website and this works for autofill and
it's the first step in implementing
smartlock on previous version of
androids
which lets you automatically sign in
your users but Auto feels pretty cool it
works mostly automatically in oh we also
have things like strict mode
improvements this allows you to do
things like with set thread policy we've
added detection of unbuffered i/o which
is cool and vm policy now will detect
UNTAC sockets as well as when content
URI is sent that doesn't actually grant
the calling a free to write permission
which would be kind of useless we've
added C cable file to scripture
descriptors from document providers
which is useful for large remote sources
such as big audio and video files is
actually really big improvement so I'm
excited about this one
we've also added proper support for
caching the quota can actually change
how frequently the user interacts with
your app the amount used while allocate
actually takes deletable cash into
account so we actually managed this
cache completely on the system for you
which is great and there's tons of other
stuff I know a bunch of enhancements to
accessibility including the ability for
users to actually add an accessibility
button on devices that have soft
navigation paging and content providers
a bunch of great stuff to make the run
time faster such as concurrent copy and
collector and big media changes but
let's turn our attention to the support
library and one of these you can note
here is that device is running SDK less
than the n14 comprise less than 1% of
Play Store active users so we've updated
the minimum SDK level we've gotten rid
of Gingerbread and honeycomb and the
minimum SDK version is now 14 this also
matches what we've done in Google Play
services if you really need to support
older versions you can use an older
version of the support library and this
gives us a bunch of benefits that we use
our method count and it also a lot we're
also going to deprecated more that we're
going to remove later
so you'll notice a bunch of deprecated
API s such as view compat dot setting
that pivot acts is now my viewed outside
pivot X so migrate away from these
deprecated methods otherwise you'll be
surprised when you get the new version
of the support library and suddenly
they're no longer there
of course we're using the Google Maiden
maven repository for the support library
with which you specify like this in
Android studio 3.0
and the threaded oh plug in all right
one of the things that I've been waiting
for forever it's the support of custom
fonts and to do this in the old world
you'd have to load the typeface to the
constructor and use the custom textview
everywhere so you have to build your own
custom view just to support fonts and
this was no no fun so we have a new
resource type for fonts it accepts a
single font as well as families and they
automatically get a resource ID and you
can even have families which include a
whole group of fonts that work together
like this one and you can generate font
families from individual fonts with
weights and styles and this one
generates my font dot font on my font
excuse me and this is super easy to use
in XML because the textview font family
attribute is reused you can handle again
you can handle families and right here
in the attribute it also supports both
attributes and styles which is great and
you can use this code by a resources
compat so again it's all an Android oh
but most importantly it's also in the
support library for API 14 plus another
good reason to move to the latest
support library another cool thing is we
have downloadable fonts because fonts
are big they bloat your apps and now you
don't have to bundle them in your app
you can just use the Google font
provider to download them the font
prefetcher provider professions and
service fonts to your apps so you don't
have to bundle them this is really
really awesome you get to get to save
space make your apps smaller it's shared
between apps so this is great for the
user as well and again this is we have
over 800 fonts in google fonts that are
all supported so this is this is a
pretty awesome thing I highly recommend
using it especially if you know you're
gonna be targeting devices that have
Google Play services to encode you fonts
are requested with the font request you
know authority package query inserts and
you get a callback for success or
failure pretty straightforward here and
then you can just use you can use fonts
contract and Pat you control what thread
runs in just don't use the UI thread
it's also really easy to do this in XML
and so again the and the best part about
this is we've totally integrated this in
Android studio so you can search for a
font you can select it and then you can
actually see the pretty font right in
your layout it auto generates the XML
and the certs we need for our
downloadable font which is pretty darn
cool so check out the sample
the googled Fon stocks and the guide on
DAC developer DeAndre to come for all
the info and once again fourteen plus of
course we have the emoji compat library
this is really important apparently it's
a big political thing what emoji looks
like especially with hamburgers so it's
time to rid get rid of this tofu in
these empty boxes and this allows us to
make emoji show up properly on older
versions of Android because the support
library always has access to a newer
font and it checks per glyph if it can
be rendered and it replaces it with an
emoji span if needed and there are two
ways to do this you can do a download
configuration similar to downloadable
fonts you end up making your font
request and you initialize in your
application on create or you can just
bundle it in your app it's seven
megabytes it's pretty big but this
allows you to work well with devices
that don't have Google Play services and
you configure it in a similar way you
also have to use emoji text view instead
of text view because we have to render
those fans and emoji TextEdit instead of
TextEdit but now we have unicorns and
tacos yay so said I check out the sample
again here and of course this is API 19
plus it does require KitKat so sorry
about that and this is a feature that
I've wanted in Android for so long how
many people have wanted text you
auto-sizing
like this is like it's amazing it's in
the platform in the support library text
actually resizes to fill in its
container like this is my favorite thing
I'm kind of a font nerd so I studied it
when I was at school so you can use the
auto text size uniform auto size text
time uniform very simple or you can get
creative and you can actually set
creative preset set of sizes for array
of values or set a minimum or maximum
font size with step and then this is
supported in API 14 plus so I'm so happy
we're gonna see a whole bunch of apps
that actually scale a lot better I hope
now that this is something that we are
actually supporting again both you know
and the support library we've fixed
vector drawables so because this used to
happen your designer create an icon you
deliver it it imports correctly and then
it looks terrible on the device this
actually is not as bad as it might look
I'm sure how many people have had this
happen with vector drawables where you
imported them and there yeah and that's
because they use these even odd fill
rule there was a big to-do in the source
code saying fix this
and we never we didn't fix it until like
Android n so this defines how the
renderer decides which region of the
images are inside and which ones are
outside so we actually support this in
this in the support library in in API 14
plus so this is this is pretty cool so
now the same XML that you'd use on API
24 looks great and this is really
awesome
another thing that's kind of cool is
we're now supporting path vector
drawables as well for animation so this
is pretty slick
so again this is you can do this to you
know turn your animals like this this
was done with Alex Lockwood shapeshifter
tool which is awesome so again here's
what's going on at the XML level we
start with our vector XML defining the
starting image extracted all the path
data into string resources since I'll be
using them the animation definitions and
then we describe and then we have an
object animator which is pretty cool so
this say here are the path values that
are important to more from the buffalo
to a hippo this seems really really easy
and because you know once you've
actually spent all the work to create
two vectors that have the same sets of
points it's actually really easy to do
this in code so it's pretty slick and
the other thing we can do is we can
actually use the bundled XML format to
actually put this all into one giant
file which is pretty awesome so now even
now instead of having to keep track of
all these different files for for a
single vector animation you can do it
all together
like this the resulting bundle then
packages everything into one file which
is cool then you can just share it now I
do now I have this cool morph we also
back ported support for path
interpolation which is pretty cool so
again this is also from the platform's
animated vector drawable and all of this
is also down to API 14 so you can do
stuff like this which combines path
morphing and path interpolation this
one's actually pretty complicated a
simple example is just like this square
which you know we give it an
acceleration curve as it shrinks it's to
find it's an interpolation path the same
path format that we use for back to
drawables and here is our xml different
definition for that and we use again the
same xml for api 14 then we use for api
26 we do it it's as curved at crops off
quickly from one snaps back a small
amount and slowly tapers off to zero
and then we have our morph animation
which is the same path morphing we just
looked at starts from a square and goes
down to a point
and then we set this interpolator to be
our path interpolator to keep things
contained in a file we can actually
bundle this all together so once again
think about using this bundling it
really does help if you're not reusing
that somewhere else and now we have this
kind of cool stylized shrinkage which is
kind of cool proceeds quickly and then
slowly tapers down another thing we did
is this transition support library on
how people have actually played with
this transition support library out
there
this is actually pretty cool so you have
in API from lollipop and above have
transition types or paths locomotion and
propagation and all of this is now
available in transition XML it's pretty
easy we do have to do this weird kind of
know version transitions as an apt
option and after this you can just use
all the same transition xml's that use
for platform transition API is on API 14
and above so this is pretty slick
actually highly recommend taking
advantage of that all right now to get
into a little bit of deeper stuff how
many people played with physics-based
animations okay this is pretty cool my
my friend Lisa actually wrote a lot of
these slides for me so if we look back
at the material design motion spec and
this talks about real world forces and
again
but until recently you actually would
have to do an approximation of these
forces and you know not a it basically
so physics amp based animation actually
allows basic Newtonian motion to be
correctly simulated in the UX and we
have two different models that are
supported by dynamic animation to make
all of this easier to actually make real
motion happen in your app and the first
one of course is fling animation which
start with you start with an initial
velocity slow due to friction and end
gradually and then you see every sign on
the color changes in this it's starting
a new fling which is cool here's pretty
much the simplest one you can make
ballers of you transition wive's the
property we're changing its velocities
pixels per second everything else is
default and that's really what you just
saw there we can actually customize the
friction so the higher the friction the
less distance your view will travel for
a given velocity we also have the spring
animation type and this exerts a force
back to the end point of the string and
you could even get this nice bounce and
every time the color changes that's a
new spring animation and again here's
the simplest spring you can make
so follows of you transition why is the
property we're changing and zeros where
it's going to stop its final transition
is at equilibrium its velocities pixels
per second and everything else is the
defaults however you can actually
customize this by calling get spring on
your animation or in this case in Kotlin
by applying it and and setting things
like the damping ratio and the stiffness
and the final position which is also
important and damping is the ratio by
which the size of your bounce is reduced
over time and the result the default
here is medium bouncy in general the
lower the number the more oscillation
you'll see aka bouncing before their
force reaches equilibrium at one you'll
get critical damping which means no
bounce and at zero you get no damping
which means infinite bounce in general
please do not under damp your views
because this crazy bouncing is kind of
like maybe I shouldn't use this but
actually so I recommend not using too
much of this stiffness is like this
tipnis of a physical spring for given
starting velocity how far will it travel
from the end point and how fast will be
pulled back and this example is no
bounce which honestly is generally
something I prefer you can see the
stiffness better and the lowest
stiffness is on the left and the highest
is on the right you can also create your
own external spring force and you can
share this across multiple animations
which is cool one thing you might want
to do with these is to allow user input
velocity tracker is one option if it's a
pin in there around since API one and it
really does what it says which is it
tracks the user's velocity from a user's
touch or if you only care what the end
state of the fling is you can actually
use a gesture detector because it's
fling callback actually has velocity
that you can apply to the ball so you'd
use this in a touch listener on the
parent of the view you want to track you
call velocity tracker dot obtain and
then you can feed in the user's touch
events starting with down and continuing
to move and then action up you call
compute current velocity and we'll
compute a nice velocity for you and that
velocity is going to come in two
components x and y so then you'll start
to dynamic animations at the same time
one for the X velocity and one for the
velocity and they're gonna run
simultaneously and this will give you a
smoothly moving interactive
two-dimensional animation as you can see
here it works pretty well
now just be careful flinging those balls
because when you lose one they don't
come back and just like other animations
are familiar with dynamic animations
have ended update listeners which is how
you can chain them earlier how we were
chaining him earlier so let's chain
these to fling animations we're gonna
fling just as we did before using the
velocity from our drag listener and
velocity tracker and create two at the
same time one for X and one for y but
then we're going to stop the first
animation and create a new one in a
different direction giving the
impression the ball was bounced fixing
our problem with the balls going off the
screen this time we'll add an update
listener and an end listener to each of
our flings on each update we'll check to
see if the ball is lift outside the
bounds of its parents just checking the
bounds here there's probably a better
way to do this but you know if it if it
did we'll cancel the animation that
means we'll get a callback to on
animation end if we cancelled it meaning
it hit the edge that fling it back as
you can see I made an extension function
on view because I was really tired of
typing and will use the velocity past
here which is the remaining velocity in
the opposite direction
check out the minus sign of course it's
not exactly this simple now this flings
the ball straight back at you because it
reverses both the velocities x and y we
really want it's a natural reflection we
wanted the ball to only reverse the
velocity on one axis on the other it's
going to keep traveling in that
direction and that gives you that 90
degree down angle so it looks like this
if it's the horizontal edge reverse X
otherwise reverse Y and it works for
different animations ever seen something
like this there's an a that keeps trying
to do this on my home screen it's sort
of a sticky effect where you fling it to
the edge and it sticks there and absorbs
the extra momentum with the spring
bounce it's gonna look something like
this
the thing to note here is that we're
using the ball's current translation
translation value as the end value for
the spring so go ahead and oscillate use
the remaining velocity but then reach
reach the equilibrium exactly where you
are there's a really cool quick demo in
the Google i/o talk of three balls
connected with Springs I won't explain
this here because they really did a
great job in that talk but here's a real
layout using the same effect it's
inspired by a screen of the platypi my
colleague NIST Nick butcher where as
part of the screen transition several
on-screen components translate up subtly
one after another in that effect the
distance traveled is delay of each
element the interpolation used to
simulate acceleration and deceleration
are all hard-coded in this effect it's
all done with the same chain string we
just saw with the balls which is pretty
cool so what's actually going on here
these two screens actually have almost
the same effect obviously the top ball
is the lead and the other two balls
follow each other the lead view in the
chain is the headline in icons the
paragraphs below it are following it and
the fab is following the paragraphs
instead of a touch listener we started
with a spring animation on the headline
the thing to notice here is instead of
giving it a velocity we give it a start
value basically we say pull this spring
back this far and start it there and we
gave it an update listener which we have
seen before and then we made a spring
animation to the paragraphs the same
thing in the listener for getting
callbacks from the head line we call
animate the final position on the
paragraph animation so it's going to do
two things one is it sets the new final
position of the paragraph spring to the
current position of the headline
animation and it starts the paragraph
animation if it hasn't yet and finally
we do the same thing for the floating
action button we set an update listener
on the paragraphs and chain of spring
animation to that and that's how shading
works now the difference here is what
we're doing before with flings is that
those animations were subsequent one
after another and these are actually
happening simultaneously and you might
notice that we also used to spring on
the alphas of the views and on a scale
of a floating action button so what else
can you animate well a lot of built-in
properties certainly everything you know
you think of springing or flinging off
the top of my head alpha translation
translation rotation scroll scale XY and
Z which are absolute positions including
translation if you want to animate
something even crazier or just make a
custom property that groups a couple of
these for example if you want to scale
an object's x and y proportionally
together which I hope usually do you
just make an instance of float Property
compat you also need to set the minimum
visible change so the animation knows
when to stop so it doesn't go on
animating millionths of a bit or
whatever your property is because it
doesn't know you can also restart every
dynamic animation at a particular start
value and you can also give them a
minimum and maximum and this is worth a
shot out and cancel oh sorry
cancel your animations if you use your
quits while they're running your app
will crash keep a reference to them and
call them in on destroy if you need to
and again these api's are in the support
library like everything else we've
talked about pretty much it's available
from in this case from jelly bean and
above so not fourteen but sixteen and
I'm sure you're not all got it but if
you didn't all the code for this is in
Lisa's github so I have talked to Lisa
for doing an amazing job of putting
these together and again what's what
what I wanted to get to you guys you've
got to understand is that these
physics-based animations are not toys or
just for games and they're way more than
bouncing balls they're a great way to
wing to bring natural motion and
interaction to your current UI to try
thinking about what you're doing already
manually that could be easier and more
realistic with a dynamic animation so
and certainly I look forward to seeing
which what you make and so that's it I
hope that this was a wonderful overview
for you of a little bit of what we have
in the support library and Android oh
and enjoy the rest of your day here at
