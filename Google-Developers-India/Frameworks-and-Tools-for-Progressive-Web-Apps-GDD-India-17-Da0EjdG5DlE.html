tools for progressive web apps my name
is Rowan Millard I'm a developer
advocate for Chrome and web I've come
over from London today so the weather is
making me feel very welcome thank you
for that I'm also here for the rest of
the event so this is quite a short slot
but I would love to carry on this
conversation with you if you can't find
me in person you can also find me on
Twitter
Rowan underscore M there so please feel
free to ask me questions now what I
would like to do today is explain the
state of PWA tooling to you explain some
of the goals and the philosophy behind
that tooling so you have a sort of
concept of why you're using it talk a
bit about how you can apply this in
single page applications and finally
give you some best practices as well now
just so I have a bit of an idea of who's
been paying attention and who's still
awake who has already heard the term PW
a good that should be nearly all of you
even the Android developers because it
was in the keynote this morning what I
would like to do is give you some
context before we go into this one of
the questions that we always get is well
what is the right way to build my app
how do I build the perfect PWI please
don't ask me this question because of
course the answer is it depends right
we're all coming from different
situations some of us have apps already
some of us are building brand new apps
and also the approach differs for
differing verticals as well so the
approach you take on an e-commerce site
is very different to the approach that
you take on a media site that said there
are some common themes that run through
this that we have identified and we've
tried to distill it down into four main
pillars that I really want you to think
about when you're busy building these
experiences first of all it needs to be
fast you've probably heard the message
because we've repeated this multiple
times but every microsecond of time
that you make the user wait that's a
user who's abandoning your site that's a
conversion that you're not getting so
you really need to focus on making sure
that the experience is as quick as
possible now secondly because we're
talking about progressive web apps we're
really talking about these high powered
websites the websites that have taken
the right vitamins but that means that
we've raised our users expectations so
they're going to need to be more
integrated with the device that means
there's an expectation they'll have
access to the full control of the camera
I might have access to Bluetooth I
expect location to work I expect my
devices orientation sensors to work and
again as these experiences become more
apt like that also means that users are
going to have more app like expectations
and that means reliability these sites
need to work regardless of the network
connection I always should get some kind
of experience that is useful to me as a
user and finally like Sam mentioned this
morning no matter how many of the
magical bells and whistles you implement
none of that makes a difference if you
don't have the engaging content and
functionality underneath that so with
that in mind let's take a look at some
of the tools that we can use and how
they go about helping you and the reason
I want to do this is because what we
want to do is put the user first we want
to create the best user experience on
the web and we feel that to create the
best user experience we should also give
you the best developer experience so
that it's easy to create these
experiences okay
I'm gonna show you some tools in a bit
but I want to tell you about what those
tools are gonna be able to help you with
first top of the list
like I said putting the user first save
the users time because time is the
biggest investment that the user is
making into your app so you can use
tools to start and fiying those areas of
poor performance and apply common
patterns to make those time savings and
speed up the performance of your app
critical to this and closely tied is
also bandwidth because bandwidth is
spending the time of the user
downloading the app but it's also
directly spending their money as well so
make sure that when you're analyzing
your bandwidth use you're taking a
respectful approach to the users budget
and then one of the things that has
always been heartening about the web is
this idea that it's completely open and
accessible everywhere right I make a web
page and when I publish that any client
any browser can access that web page but
in reality we know that's not quite the
case you need to make tweaks for the
different browsers different things are
supported in different locations but
that shouldn't be directly your problem
again that's something that you want to
make use of tooling and libraries to
handle the differences between those
browsers so that you can focus on
writing the code that solves your
business problems rather than starts to
try and deal with platform
inconsistencies and when I talked about
integration before we enable things like
push notifications on the web across
browsers across systems but there's a
lot of multiple moving parts that you
need to deal with to make those push
notifications happen but again it's all
standard so tools and libraries can help
you here I want to touch on code
generation and how that differs from
just using a library and finally I'll
show you some of the tools that you can
use to make sure that when you've gone
through all of these previous processes
you're still enforcing the best
practices that you start with a good
experience and you keep a good
experience as well
let's look at some of the technology
behind the PW is that these tools are
going to help you build so first of all
a PW a is normally identified by its
manifest so this is a simple file that
you can think of as the public
description of what your PW a is capable
of doing
then there's the service worker the
service worker is a piece of JavaScript
that is able to run in the background
and take care of things for you when
your site is not present in the browser
and finally we're gonna use some of
these tools to actually build great
applications as well which is hopefully
what you're all interested in okay
starting with the manifest then since
it's a standardized JSON file there are
a few tools that you can jump into that
are a gain to help you generate that
JSON file and go through the various
items and they will automate some of the
tedious tasks in there like providing
the multiple sizes of icons and marking
them up correctly but it's also going to
help you make decisions about what kind
of things you may want to include in
your manifest so you've probably seen
that you can specify that your web app
is a standalone web app you may want to
investigate the different display modes
what that means for browser support what
that means for the user experience again
going through these tools will help you
understand the full range of options
that are out there and why you might
want to choose particular ones the
service worker then Falls kind of into
the other category it is a incredibly
powerful tool but with this power also
comes a lot of complexity so as you can
see here this is just the life cycle of
the Service Worker when it is being
added to your page so it can sit there
as a proxy handling all inbound and
outbound requests from your page it's
going to be what handles the incoming
push requests it can also coordinate
all the open clients you currently have
on a device to manage the communication
between them this kind of low-level
power is incredibly useful but there's a
lot that you need to learn to really
take advantage of that so again we can
wrap all of that functionality up in a
library and some code generation to make
sure that this is nice
and simple for you I wanted to show a
bit about what you can do with
serviceworker so file caching you'll see
that there are a number of different
approaches you can take to doing that
you can either do your file caching on
or during the installation of the
Service Worker so this is when you might
choose to proactively fetch a number of
resources that you need to make your
site available in an offline mode but
you might also want to do this at run
time because obviously it would not be a
good idea to spider your entire site and
download it to the users device so you
may just want to Pro you may want to
fetch whilst users are browsing your
site cache the content that they're
looking at and store that in the
serviceworker and finally there are far
more advanced caching strategies that
might be relevant to your particular
business use case for example maybe you
have a special offer on the site that
you want to ensure is available for the
user but it has a hard expiration time
so you don't want to show it past a
particular point push notifications then
like I mentioned there are a lot of
standard parts here you want to do
different behavior when the push
notification receipt is received does
the user currently have your app open or
is it closed if it's open you probably
want to do something different
by showing an in-app notification versus
showing a notification on screen that
the user will tap and navigate through
to your app and finally on cogeneration
then really what I would like you to
understand here is that cogeneration is
a way of giving you code that is
hopefully fast by default is hopefully
great by default and comes with a
selection of industry best practices
built-in so it should have integration
for metrics built in their integration
for analytics security usability and so
on but the distinction between a
cogeneration tool and a library is that
when the code generation is complete
that code is yours you need to make sure
that you understand the code that has
been produced and that you take it
through the same review and testing
processes as you would for code that any
of your developers have written
cogeneration can be a lot of fun but
don't assume that it's some kind of
magic wand that you can just spread over
your application and everything will
work okay I want to split the tools for
building a PWA into a couple different
categories generic tools which we can
apply almost anywhere some framework
specific tools that I'll show you and
then all the way at the end of this line
is once you understand these tools you
start customizing them to be tightly
coupled to your own build and
application process
if we're talking about generic tools
then the best place to start is with the
browser because you are as close to your
user as possible now Chrome has its own
developer tools built into the browser
and we could spend an entire session
exploring this but I want to highlight
two areas that are particularly
important if you're working with
progressive web apps the first is the
application tab and specifically the
service worker entry inside of that if
you go into this when you are looking at
any web page you can see the currently
active service workers that are attached
to that page you can see what's staged
that they're in you can examine what
they're storing you can look at the
console.log specifically for that
Service Worker as well as part of your
development process you are going to
want to be very familiar with this
because as you start to introduce all of
this caching functionality that means
you're also going to need to make sure
that you always know when you are
getting the latest version of the code
you can also see in here that there's a
method to bypass for network so when
you're developing you can always just
make sure that the caching for your
service worker is completely ignored and
you're always fetching from disk now
secondly who's who's already visited the
lighthouse booth yep everyone else after
this you should go see the lighthouse
booth put your site in see what kind of
score that you get out now lighthouse is
a standalone tool but it exists inside
of chrome dev tools as one of the audits
that you can run against your site so
again if you go to the audit tab inside
of dev tools and perform an audit then
you will get
a score that covers the various
progressive web app functionality for
your site it makes a number of
performance related measurements
accessibility measurements and also a
number of general best practices for
websites as well hopefully already
you've heard from some of my colleagues
about work box so work box falls into
the generic tool section because what
work box focuses on is how it can build
out a Service Worker for you with a
number of specific patterns that means
it's actually relatively simple to take
work box and apply it into an existing
site or apply it to a new site as well
it gives you three main things but the
team is always working on bringing
additional best practices into this
first of all various offline caching
patterns so when I talked about the
various approaches you might want to
take work box provides these by default
you can do cache first you can do
Network first you can race the two so
that you can respond with whichever is
quicker you can set expiration policies
and so on it also makes available
offline analytics - this means that when
your app is offline you can still
collect the analytics events and when
you restore back and connect it again
then it will batch those together and
send those on so this is incredibly
important because if you make your app
available offline you still want to know
how your users are interacting with it
so you can improve it in the future
and finally we make use of newer
technologies like background sync as
well so this means that you have a
number of built-in strategies for how
you want to refresh content that you're
storing on the user's device work box is
open source so you can come find this on
github if things aren't working out for
you then pre please raise issues talk to
the team or if you have something that
you think work box should be able to do
you could even contribute some code
yourself now we're not the only people
doing this if you make use of web pack
for bundling or other parts of your
build pipeline then I would highly
recommend looking at the offline plugin
for web pack this does a number of
similar things where enables you to
build out a serviceworker based on your
web pack configuration where you can
specify various
sets for caching ahead of time or our
caching when the user browses to them or
just optimistically making them optional
so that you can cache them when they're
most useful again this is on github and
there's plenty of sample code and
documentation linked off of that
repository to help you get started
and the other thing like I said I really
love the open nature of the web and how
easy that makes it for everyone to get
involved so I also like it when
companies then start contributing this
stuff back as well
Pinterest has been doing a huge amount
in terms of building a very highly
performing web app and they have
actually started pushing back some of
their libraries on creating testing and
experimenting with service workers one
of the things that's particularly
interesting about their offering is they
include a number of tests sort of
harnesses and isolation methods for the
service worker as well so we sometimes
have a tendency with new technology to
get a little carried away with all of
the cool stuff we can build and not
necessarily cover testing it so to me
this is really a sign that the
technology is becoming much more mature
and production-ready as well and then
because of how fast-paced this is I feel
it's also important to understand some
of the history as well so some of the
earlier libraries that are still active
there's sw-precache and sw-toolbox now
these have been sort of superseded by
workbox because they were earlier
they're a bit more tightly coupled to
specific functionality but what you'll
find is that a number of the CLI tools
that I show you for the frameworks are
actually making use of these libraries
in the background so they're worth
looking at but I would look at work box
first if you are starting up something
new of your own ok
it's also always good to have a sort of
industry convention or benchmark that
you can use as well so most of the time
like if you have a device with a screen
whether it's like a graphing calculator
a printer an oscilloscope the the
default sort of benchmark is to see if
you can run doom or quake on it
so for front-end developers it's can I
take your JavaScript framework and write
a hacker news client with it so hmd PWA
is a collection of hacker news readers
built in a variety of frameworks
using a variety of libraries and what I
find really useful is that this is a way
to compare approaches in the different
frameworks so if you're trying to decide
which one you want to choose to solve a
particular problem or you want to see
how the industry is making use of
different technologies then this is kind
of a great playground to go and compare
solutions to the same problem across a
multitude of tools ok hopefully by now
you should have a feeling for the kind
of mindset that I'm hoping that you can
get into what I would really like to
accomplish with this and what you should
be thinking of these tools is doing for
you is one simplifying your mental model
the amount you need to learn to sort of
properly understand and become an expert
and Service Worker is is huge and that
investment is probably not part of the
time that you want to be using when
you're doing your job and also a lot of
these problems have already been solved
so there's no need for you to reinvent
the wheel and spend a lot of time
writing a lot of extra code to handle
all of these edge cases so all in all
this is about saving time for you and
basically getting the best solution for
your user and really what it means is
that you can focus your effort on the
use cases that are important the
problems that are closer to your
business not the problems that are
closer to the platform and as well like
I keep saying the accessibility and the
open nature of the web means that it was
really easy for me to get involved when
I was younger
creating terrible websites with perl
backends but it was still very simple it
was accessible so what this means is
that by using these libraries you can
still layer in serviceworker
with that same level of simplicity and
just get going and get something
published on the web
and when I talk about edge cases as well
like the kind of things that these
libraries will handle for you that you
don't want to have to try and write
again yourself service worker
installation if your app loses
connectivity during the install then
what are you gonna do a naive approach
here would be to say well I had a list
of things I was going to cache so I just
won't cache them or maybe you actually
say I didn't complete caching my list of
things so I'm going to delete it and I'm
gonna try downloading it all over again
neither of these are good solutions for
the user one of them gets them nothing
the other one makes them spend their
bandwidth again to get the same result
they could have had if you use a library
here there are a number of approaches
that can actually go through validate
the existing items that you have cached
and then pick up and resume the download
when you left off
and again what if your user has full
connectivity and by this this seems a
little counterintuitive but what I mean
here is if I'm reading a piece of
content and I'm getting the cached
version from your serviceworker and then
it updates in the background what should
you do should you force me to refresh my
page should you show me a little
notification saying I can tap here to
refresh or can you actually get the
content and dynamically insert it into
the existing page all of these patterns
already start to exist in these
libraries so rather than trying to work
out how you're going to do it you can
just work out which one you want to use
and finally one of the benefits of
serviceworker and having an additional
caching layer here as well is that if
you're dealing with an API that you
don't control you now have the ability
to add additional layers of caching on
top of that this means that if you have
an API that isn't going to work well
offline you can actually cache the
responses from the API so that when your
app is offline you can still act as if
you're getting the last piece of data
that was available from the API
okay now I'm reiterating this again
you're here to save time you have to
save yourself a lot of code it's not
just developer time it's operational
time it's bug fixing it's QA and save a
lot of effort the reason I reiterate
this is because of the number of times
the developers always seem to want to go
off and reinvent the entire universe
because it gives them an opportunity to
write a new JavaScript framework please
don't do that now I want to jump in to
single page applications I also want to
stress here that there are lots of
different ways of approaching PWA s as
as you've probably seen my colleagues
have shown you a couple tomorrow there's
a talk on migrating your existing site
to a PWA as well but if you are starting
with one of the single page application
frameworks then this is a selection for
you to do so now this is by no means a
comprehensive list like I was warning in
the time that I've been presenting
someone has probably written and
released a new JavaScript framework
anyway maybe maybe someone in this room
has done this actually but what I will
do is I will show you examples from
these five because what I would like to
stress is how easy it is for you to just
dip in and get started so that you can
see how these frameworks operate and you
can start to make a more informed
decision about what you would like to
choose for your project let's start with
react to them so react has create to
react app and this is a command line
script that is going to create a service
worker for you it's going to generate
your web app manifest and it's actually
going to give you a cache first strategy
for serving your assets as well and it's
as simple as this I'm using yarn in
these examples but there's no reason you
can't use NPM or your own package
management or manually downloading these
as well so here I'm installing the
create react app into the global scope
so it's available for me on the command
line and then calling create react app
with just the name of the app I jump
into the cook directory and I run yarn
build at the end of this it's going to
output some information for you saying
how you can run a development server how
you can run a production server
run that productionserver and jump in
and you'll reach the welcome to react
page where they're actually just going
to show you where in the code directory
you can go to continue your adventure if
you open dev tools as well this is an
ideal time to go and look at the service
worker that has been installed for you
so you can take a look in there and you
can see the methodology that they're
using to create that cache first
approach to serving the content next up
is pre-act so this is the pre act CLI
this is a slightly more full of featured
by default they give the app creation to
you and what they put out in their
default template is actually an app
shell so you get your static index.html
with some content pre rendered and then
it's going to go and fetch the the first
route pre-act also provides browser
lists auto prefixing what this means is
that by default you are going to get
customized versions for the different
browsers that are coming in and quite
interestingly this is one where you may
want to look at this regardless of if
you are using pre-act they have a
configuration that will interface with
firebase static hosting because firebase
static hosting is HTTP to and can handle
server push so their configuration by
default will actually take advantage of
HTTP push to push some of those
resources down speeding up that delivery
to the user even more like I mentioned
before they use sw-precache in the
background so if you want to understand
what they're doing it may be useful for
you to look at that library too and
again we're just adding the pre-act CLI
in this case we're saying create default
so default here is the name of the
template there are a number of different
templates that you can explore if you
want to create different apps I do that
I jump in
I run yarn build I get my feedback back
for how to run the development server
and I jump in and by default they
actually give you a bit of a material
design style app where you're actually
seeing the routing component in action
as well so the navigation that you have
at the top there will enable you to see
to navigate between different tabs we've
then got the polymer CLI for the polymer
framework this gives you again Manifest
generation and an optional service
worker you can drop in some approaches
that polymer takes that are quite
interesting they actually by default
give you three different bundles they
give you an es 5 bundle in your six
bundle and then they also give you an
unbundled ES 6 version now as browsers
are progressing people are starting to
experiment with should we do we still
need to bundle our JavaScript or can we
leave a unbundled at the moment you
probably still want to borrow but this
is a good way of immediately getting
that unbundled one so you can benchmark
between the two of them to see what the
performance different is for you polymer
CLI also gives you an implementation of
the purple pattern out of the box so
there is a server that comes with the
polymer CLI that you can use to serve
your content using HTTP T HTTP to push
and actually proactively pushing a
number of resources to the user again
we're pulling in polymer CLI and Bower
we're making our directory we're jumping
in we're running polymer in it now this
will take you through an interactive
process where you can select the number
of starter projects I've chosen the
starter kit here and I'm running build
and we get another nice material design
related app with navigation and routing
built in again go and take a look at the
serviceworker that's being run there
that will show you not just the the
caching but also how it handles some of
those incoming resources as well view
j/s so in this case we're going to go
get the CL alloy tool and we're also
going to pull down a number of default
templates this gives us the app creation
manifest the serviceworker the app shell
one of the things that view does is it
actually does some nice lazy loading for
the additional JavaScript CSS your fonts
and so on so I would recommend looking
at what they do there to understand how
you can pull in that functionality as
you need it rather than necessarily
bundling it all up front and pushing it
down to the user that looks like this
we're adding in our view CLI we're
initializing the project this is another
interactive one so it will guide you
through the process and it actually
gives you some helpful hints on how to
name your application so it's not
truncated and so on we go in we build
the own application and then we jump
straight into our view application again
and as per usual go take a look at the
developer tools and there's your service
worker and then finally we can take a
look at angular so angular CLI tool will
also give us the app creation service
worker what they do with the service
worker is a little different so rather
than giving you the service worker
directly they actually have a JSON based
configuration file that is designed to
handle the standard caching there's a
plug-in you can pull in for handling
push notifications and other lifecycle
events so they've kind of tried to
provide this abstraction on top of the
lifecycle so that you can just focus on
the processes that you're trying to
implement rather than needing to
necessarily understand the service
worker itself inside of here I'm adding
angular again I'm running the ng tool to
create this and inside of angular what
you actually need to do is set a few
configuration options here to say that I
want a service worker by default and
then I make the production build of my
angular app and we jump in and we've got
a basic hello world app with some links
off to other applications that can help
get us started okay
that is my like whirlwind tour through
some front-end frameworks you're all
experts now so go off and build the next
generation of pwace but I wanted to
highlight a few other projects that you
can look at PWA rocks and PWA builder
are actually very good tools for taking
you through some of the functionality
choices that you want to make so PWA
builder gives you this kind of radio
selection that you can go through answer
questions about the kind of
functionality you want and it will start
to spit out some basic templates and
starter kits for you
best practices then to finish us off
always remember to go and check the
application tab because I guarantee you
will run into a couple issues the first
time you are using serviceworker Rob
Dodson has actually written an excellent
guide that you can get to here bitly
debugging - serviceworker this will give
you a number of tips on doing things
like adding a kill switch to your
serviceworker so you have a sort of
escape hatch to wipe it making sure that
you know the correct way to reset this
inside of dev tools so that you're not
consistently clearing your entire cache
and cookies
maybe uninstalling and reinstalling
Chrome in the hope that you can actually
get a fresh version of your application
and really the piece of advice that I
would like you to leave with here is try
and follow the tools so if you find
yourself fighting with the way of the
tool is trying to do something then
that's probably a sign that either you
need to change the way you're thinking
or you need to look at a different tool
so the tool should be getting you 80% of
the way there and it's that remaining
20% that you want to be focusing your
effort on not fighting with the way that
the tool is doing the generation and a
couple other caveats amazing as dev
tools is please don't assume that it is
a be-all and end-all there are a couple
things that will not work exactly as you
expect inside of dev tools for example
the off fine checkbox that you use there
doesn't affect every single type of
network connection so if you have
WebSockets say via the firebase real
time database that data may still
be going back and forth even when you're
in offline mode so when it gets through
to the end always make sure that you
test on a real device preferably the
same device that the majority of your
users have I also want to just call back
to the Pinterest stuff because they also
add in the end-to-end tests for
serviceworker as well which can be
incredibly helpful for isolating that
logic and testing it through and then
really the last thing is to stay up to
date and stay involved because
serviceworker is gaining a huge amount
of adoption so safari is going to be
implementing it and so on but it is in
development and the spec is always being
updated so that means you want to watch
for those future developments and if you
have a direction that you would really
like the project to go then this is the
time to put your voice heard so please
go out and give those tools a try give
feedback on how you found them and I
would like to say thank you very much
for your time any other questions come
find me or poke me on Twitter and please
enjoy the rest of the event
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
