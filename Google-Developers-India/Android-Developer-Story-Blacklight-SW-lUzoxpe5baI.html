me a book impossible and just a few
chapters then I immediately realized I
can create some amazing things all by
myself my name is Ruby Sena and I'm a
founder and game developer exactly I
always remember my mom playing solitaire
on a computer but when moving to mobile
she struggled to find a good solitaire
for her phone so she insisted that being
a game developer plus a daughter I
should develop solitaire for her
so I took the idea to commit and silicon
e and I'm co-founder dragon I'm 32 years
old and I have 25 years of geometry
playing them and now design we played
solitaire for are we even bought a deck
of cards real cards to understand the
game better sixty percent of our users
are mommy's and granny so we design
quality keeping them in my big bold card
to the colors and minimal design taking
a load of cue from Google material
design guide it took us six months of
research and design to make solitaire
look great and be very fun to play and
then they noticed lot of visitors are
visiting update but very few of them
downloaded the game so we thought maybe
the logo is the problem
we experimented on Google tech with a
modern design and a very old fashioned
birth and Wow
the old fashioned logo activity pokers
and more downloads and after we adopted
it or total downloads and abide by
deeper less we move to Android studio
which allowed us to integrate Google
Play game services and emulators help
desk design user interface for different
screen sizes and very pixel density the
feeling that something has created is
adding fun and values to so many people
around the world most of them some
places are never been-- true can be
quite profound
so these love of coding and her mom's
love for soliders led to them today we
have five more games in the pipeline and
we hide buy more Android developers to
welcome back
it definitely wasn't a smooth journey
but so hard work and place user feedback
we are Gravier today and we can't wait
to see what we do now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
