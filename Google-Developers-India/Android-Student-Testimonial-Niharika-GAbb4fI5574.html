I was working as
a recruiter, and I
was completely unaware as
to what I'm supposed to do.
I used to feel that I just
don't want to be a recruiter.
I want to be on that other side,
talking technology, and talking
about gadgets, and
how technology is
changing our day-to-day lives.
One of-- a relative,
he challenged me
that, you are a girl,
and engineering requires
a lot of designs and drawings.
I wanted to prove him wrong.
And that was the time when
I heard about Udacity.
I started taking some
online courses in Java,
and enjoyed very basic things.
It is a little
difficult, but it's
just that I don't
want to be let--
you know, that sense of regret.
I just don't want that.
So Udacity has actually
been a savior in my life.
The quality of the
projects is very good.
It's like, after
computing goes, you
feel like you have
gotten good at something.
Actually, I finished
my learning yesterday.
And so today it's just
going to be the celebration.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
