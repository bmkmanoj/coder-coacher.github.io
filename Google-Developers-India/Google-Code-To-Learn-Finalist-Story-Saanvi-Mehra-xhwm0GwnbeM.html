school computer teacher she she told me
about the contest and I came back since
castle with my mom and we saw a shop on
Google and we found it and I entered my
ass
so my ass is about book donation the
children who aspire to bring it or do
not able books anymore can donate those
books to underprivileged children as the
people are giving the books for a great
cause and the underprivileged children
are getting the books and they're
gaining education I feel that coding is
is a world of endless possibilities and
I also think that you can explore so
much and there is so much to be
discovered and you can just create
anything to meet one of stick realized
face during the code 3 own competition
with adding databases to my app so I
have to look it up several times and I
couldn't get it right for the first few
times but I got done my biggest learning
from coach alone is that there is so
much lying in the world to explore and
that we should not always be stuck on
one thing I would definitely tell the
younger kids about qostoul on making I
learned a lot through the process of
making apps and you can also find about
the apps that they use every day and
where they come from and what is behind
them there is so much which we do not
know in which we can explode in this
endless world of coding I feel that
cooked alone provides a very healthy
competition for the youth across India
we should encourage this and they can
get to know what is going in the mind of
the news and what the news actually
means I love the competition and I feel
that a really nice supervised as a
competition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
