gentlemen, please join
me to welcome onstage Purnima.
Could we have a big hand,
Purnima, for the closing
remark, everybody.
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: All right.
So quick, quick closing.
I think Mark said it best when
he said-- from Moonfrog-- when
he said, the time is
now, believe in India
and be patient.
What we want to say
from Google Play
is that we are super bullish
about India right now
and we are here to walk with you
step by step to make the India
opportunity real.
Rajan said it best
when he said, it
is a time to build for
billions and make billions,
and we believe it.
More smartphones
than in the United
States, a billion installs,
150% growth, three times
increase in spend.
There is no better
metrics to tell you
the time is here and now.
The second, I do
want to point out,
is that I am super inspired
by all the developer stories
that we saw on screen,
on video, in panel,
but also the many, many,
many conversations I've
had with all of you.
Believe me, you get it.
And so we're here
to support you,
make all those ideas
big or small a reality.
My morning started with
a 12-year-old from Kerala
who taught himself
coding, and in the six
months has more than
10 apps on Google Play.
And he taught himself coding
looking at YouTube videos
and is coding using Unity.
This is a fact.
I don't know, Chandan,
if you are in the room.
And since then, I have met a
whole bunch of people, students
trying to tell us how to build
better communities, people who
are really thinking,
this is the India
that we are all excited about.
So it's your turn to
really step it up.
So a few lessons that
resonated with me.
Number one, I think
it was very good what
we heard from MakeMyTrip,
where said, get out of your AC
offices, go out there, meet the
real user, observe and learn.
It's a lesson I
think we can all do.
I learned a lot by just
being here with you
today, just being outside.
So thank you for your honesty.
Thank you for everything
you have shared with us.
We will continue to improve
the products and the services
we provide.
The second, which
was also interesting,
which came from
Puneet Gupta, who
talked from Times Digital, who
said, don't forget the basics.
There is no option.
There are no shortcuts.
And he said something
very interesting.
Solve for the setting.
Don't let the user
do the setting.
Do the work for your user.
Do the basics.
I think that's another
really important lesson
to take when you go from here.
Really think about, what can I
do to simplify it for the user?
He told us a story
that it isn't about
whether the app was
in Tamil or not,
it was because
the person did not
understand what is a filter.
And believe me, it's
a good example for us,
in general, when we are
building an app to say,
am I really having an honest
conversation with my user?
Am I talking jargon,
or am I having
an honest, open
conversation with my user?
The way to know it
is that you don't
need to explain
it to anybody who
has never used a smartphone.
That should be the guideline.
Yeah?
So that was another
interesting thing that
stuck with me to say,
how are we building,
how are we
simplifying, how are we
making this in such a
way that can be useful?
The third thing which
also resonated with me
is what we heard in the
video from the folks
like MakeMyTrip and
HealthifyMe, et cetera.
These are real problems.
And the scale of these
problems are mind-blowing,
are totally mind-blowing.
I met Tushar yesterday, and
he was showing me an India map
with a dot for every person
who's using HealthifyMe.
It literally is covering
India, the dots.
It means there's a
pent-up demand waiting
for you to solve real problems.
This is somebody who is
basically making Indians
work out and eat healthy.
And you heard from
MakeMyTrip, you
can go everything all the
way from very expensive
European vacations
all the way down to,
what you call, a budget
hotel near a bus stop.
That is India for you.
The demand is there.
People are waiting.
They have gone over two very
big hurdles, the hurdles
of using data on a
phone and the hurdle
of using digital payment.
The first one is done.
The second one is getting done.
So the demand is here and now.
I'm waiting to be
here next year to see
all the wonderful apps and games
that you have built for India.
And so congratulations, thank
you for everything you do.
As I said, what we build are
just canvases, empty canvases
without you.
Before we close, I do want
to make a big shout out
to a couple things.
One, how many people
went in for consultations
around in all those rooms?
I see a couple of hands.
Every one of those
consultations were handled
and hosted by GDEs.
These are Google
Developer Experts.
These are people like you,
contributing to the community
because they just want the
community to get better.
There is no better example
of the Android platform
and its user base than
GDEs who are contributing.
So a very, very, very big
hand for all the GDEs.
[APPLAUSE]
There's a bunch of folks--
I wouldn't be able to
call everyone's names--
who made today possible.
Everybody who's
standing behind here,
there's a whole lot of people
who are doing magic there,
a bunch of speakers.
I see [? Anuj. ?] I see
[? Parol. ?] I don't know.
I can see a bunch of people, the
folks over there who are like--
so for everybody who organized,
please give everybody
a big hand for
making this possible.
[APPLAUSE]
And last but not the least,
give yourself a very big hand.
I know it takes a lot
to take a whole day
out of your schedules, to
fly from different places
to be here, to put up with
long lines and everything else,
and stay the entire day.
So thank you for being with us.
Make for India.
Thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
