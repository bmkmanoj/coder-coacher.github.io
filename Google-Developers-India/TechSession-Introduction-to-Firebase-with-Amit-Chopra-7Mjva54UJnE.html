part of my day job most of my time
actually gets spent as part of the
Google developers agency program so
parlé here for example is a regional
lead for India handling that program and
I am managing that program in us where
we work with top agencies who are
building Android and iOS apps and make
sure that they are up scaled on the
latest technologies and design
principles another part of my job spend
generally more than 20% of my time is on
the firebase go to market strategy so
there's a group of us who meet pretty
regularly once twice a week and look at
and understand how firebase is being
used how it's being adopted what are the
feature requests that are coming in how
it needs to be positioned and based on
that I've spent a lot of time in this
product for almost a year plus now
firebase was acquired by Google a couple
of years ago and last year at i/o you
actually saw the big announcements
firebase was launched in a big way and
the adoption in the communities has been
phenomenal you know people love that as
a product it's you know meets the needs
of developers and businesses and it's
easy to use and easy to get started so
firebase as a product when we acquired
basically was real-time databases
authentication hosting and storage this
was like the four core fundamental
things and when we released it at i/o
last year we actually provided a very
comprehensive story so we stitched all
the pieces that was required not just
for the developer audiences but
something that makes your app successful
and that's the key thing everything that
a developer a tester a person who's
responsible quality somebody was
responsible for growth for monetization
finds everything in one place which was
the key thing you know a lot of these
pieces existed in different dimensions
and different consoles but the idea was
to put everything together and provide
one comprehensive view another thing
before I jump into some of these slides
which you've probably seen and presented
as well this
is also a very comprehensive story that
goes beyond just the Android platform so
practically every feature works the same
way on iOS and a very large number of
features work that people are using on
the web as well and there are continuous
investments that the team has been
making to improve the product over the
time since it was announced as the
second generation at i/o you'll probably
see a few more interesting announcements
in the next few weeks as well as you
know the company gets prepared for i/o
the next IO as well as a couple of other
events so say to you and if this is
something of interest a lot of stuff is
happening everything around firebase we
know has been stretched around analytics
this was you know the foundation of how
every piece joins together and it is one
of the interesting things it's also free
and unlimited this was something that
surprised a lot of people they keep
funding like they must be a catch and
like no there is no catch this free and
unlimited you can you know use this as
much as you want a lot of other
ease-of-use features something like this
this is from a game and all you had to
do was integrate the SDK without right
writing a line of code you get a
dashboard that's ready to use you know a
lot of people sometimes I found
struggled initially like what what
should I be tracking you know just
figuring that out can be hard
so BSD created an easy job of saying
okay don't think about it we'll give you
something to start with as you refine
these numbers and as you understand what
other information you actually need in
terms of developing some of the features
and this is like the chunk of features
and a lot of you probably in this room
are more familiar and I'm sure more
expert in some of these features and I
am as well but a real-time database
still remains the foundation of what
firebase gets used a lot
so analytics definitely and then it's a
real-time database we've seen tons of
apps that have come out showing the
capabilities of how easy it is to make
apps that are distributed offset can be
offline apps that can work across
different platforms and still share a
same common data repository so this this
has really opened up applications and
developers to a different
of opportunity all together offline if
somebody had to do offline before
firebase was around a lot of lines of
court I mean just thinking about all the
scenarios that you had to deal with
literally this is out-of-the-box
experience for most people another
common issue that a lot of developers
faced was I need to get people signed in
I need to you know find out who my users
is and they have to think about
usernames passwords everybody is doing
that every app does that so why not
provide that as a service so this is
another one of the things that has been
extremely popular and the most common
sign-in capabilities are supported by
the product out-of-the-box hosting again
makes life very simple you publish
something you write you know set up your
database say host it literally a click
of a button and you have your app
available for people to start using
these are little things but you can see
in the day of a life of a developer make
a huge difference in terms of how you're
spending your time and what you're
worried about you should be thinking
about your app not some of these
infrastructure challenges storage you
know is something that everybody needs
you know you got pictures these days
pictures by far take the most amount of
storage but then you have tons of other
data as well and it makes it really easy
when you have the infrastructure of
Google to support some of these things
in terms of both speed and reliability
and the unlimited storage and how fast
data can move back and forth
firebase again integrates everything for
you connecting with your users through
firebase Cloud messaging another one of
those you know free features that you
can use across different platforms gets
very very popular with users as they're
building apps that need to reach out to
the users this is another popular
feature with especially product managers
you know who are trying to tinker and
try to see you know if I make this
change you know how does it impact
certain aspect or usage of my
application a lot of this you can now do
on the server side which means you don't
have to push updates go to the console
make a few changes and you can also see
how some of the changes are impacting
because it's very tightly integrated
with analytics so again you can see a
different audience being
dressed by that a lot of people find
this useful and you know I talked about
a few changes that have happened here
Tesla for Android and I think this is
one of the only features that I can say
runs on Android it's not on iOS right
now but you can actually run tests on
physical devices devices that are
running on Google infrastructure
physical devices and get your results
out pretty quickly really hard to
maintain the kind of inventory sometimes
that you require crash reporting
nobody wants bad apps number one reason
why your apps get poor ratings and
reviews is your apps crashing you don't
want to be thinking you know what really
happened you need to get data you need
to get data really fast so that you can
respond to your customers and fix those
issues so again a native you know
feature of firebase today in terms of
growing your business you know it's
coding is fun we all love to code but
it's not going to feed you you know you
got to grow your business you got to
make some money and that's where a lot
of the growth services have been
integrated in the products you know
making it easy to invite people you know
sharing your app you know it's one-click
hey I I'm a user send it to all your
friends they get invites that are
available and your popularity of the app
can grow you got dynamic links you know
linking parts of the application and
directly sending a URL you can get a
very interesting personalized
experiences around how the information
of the app gets exchanged making money
through Google AdWords you know this is
one of the things you can do you run
your campaigns it helps you grow your
businesses you can promote your
application very tightly integrated with
firebase app indexing brings the ease of
you know people have hundreds of apps
right and I keep looking for things on
my phone and sometimes the data is in
the app and with app indexing it makes
it much natural and easy as you are
searching to something if it's inside
your app it brings up your app much more
quicker and you have the person go back
so it's more of you know bringing back
your user experience as well providing
notifications you know again this is
something that product managers are
loving as well you can set it to the UI
itself broadcast a set of message to a
set of users and communicate anything a
promo that's happening
or a certain feature that you want to
advertise earning all I heard yesterday
also you know the app you know that
people use that you have ads that are
coming in it's a great way to monetize
right it's a delicate balance at times
between you know having too many ads and
you know not having ads and you find the
sweet spot there but it's something
that's available you could definitely
use the AdMob capabilities and make
money as well apart from just selling
your app as well this was something we
talked about at the summit which
happened the firebase summit that
happened in November couple of months
back a lot of new enhancements were
announced in in that particular release
some of you might have already done and
talked about these sessions as well so
again crashed reporting has in improve
one of the big asks there was we need
much faster data so I think now the lag
time is about 20 minutes so if the crash
happens you'll have the data about that
in about 20 minutes and you can see much
tighter integration with analytics and
crash reporting test lab has been
increased the number of device support
7.1 support and there's also free trial
pricing that's available so you can you
know try this thing earlier it was only
in a feature that was available as part
of the paid offering cloud messaging now
is available for the JavaScript for the
web client as well you know a lot of
people are using firebase for doing you
know making web applications so trying
to bring a little more parity there is
critical the UI library makes it very
interesting now to have consistent
experience as you are doing thinking
through the authentication workflow so
again making that you know taking some
of that pain away from developer makes
things very easy and again it's a
complete cross-platform solution lot of
people still like to do command-line so
you know you have the firebase command
line interface admin SDK makes it much
easier for you to plug in lot of systems
that work through scripts to automate
these experiences game developers unity
plugin c++ sdk if you are still doing
you know or your communities are doing
that this is something they'll find very
very useful
got a lot of requests from game
developers I don't know how many of you
are familiar with these two offerings
one is that there is actually a complete
demo project that you can use you know
just to learn experience it's full of
data it's based on a game called flooded
so you can see you know as that game is
used in real time you can see how things
are happening you can explore you know
the complete fire based experience
because when you build a small app and
try it out it takes a long time before
you have meaningful data so encourage
you know I encourage you to try this as
well as you know have other people look
at this to very quickly get familiar
with all the capabilities of firebase
and then there's the new Udacity course
that was announced at the same time it's
about learning firebase in a weekend
like this is perfect for a community
initiative you know this is literally a
program that you can finish for hours on
one day four hours on the next day if
you want to bring people together in a
room and do that that's great
or you can encourage people to just go
online sign up for this and very quickly
get up to speed in addition you know
we've always had the traditional
hands-on labs that are available both
for iOS Android and web that we
encourage you to try and you know spread
the word with your communities as well
so over to you and again thank you once
again and representing the firebase team
so thank you for all the work that you
have been doing with your community
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
