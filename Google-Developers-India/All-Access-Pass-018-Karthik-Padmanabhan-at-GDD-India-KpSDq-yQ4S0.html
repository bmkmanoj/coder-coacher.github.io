VAIBHAVI DESAI:
Welcome, friends.
We are here at Google
Developer Days, Bengaluru.
And we have with
us Karthik today,
who is a Developer Relations
program manager at Google.
Karthik, share with us your
experience at GDD India.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Namaste,
and welcome to GDD India.
It's been an awesome opening.
So we've got more than expected
developers attending GDD India.
And the excitement
is very electric.
And people had very high
hopes on the Keynote,
and I think the
Keynote session has
gone off really rockingly well.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: That
sounds super nice.
How has been your experience
meeting people at the Community
Lounge out there?
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Yeah,
Community Lounge for us
is like the heartthrob
of GDD India
because that's where all the
community folks hang out.
One of the reasons why GDD
India has been so far a big hit
is primarily because of
the power of the community.
And so we have 21 chapters.
In all of that, we have
27 Women Techmakers.
Which is good that Women
Techmakers is more than the GDG
chapters.
I'm personally very
happy about that.
It's the power of
community, which
as helped us get the
high quality attendance
from developers across India.
Not only India,
not only Bangalore,
we have a lot of people coming
from various parts of India.
We have people coming from
other parts of the world,
like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh.
I met some folks from Indonesia.
I also have a big contingent
coming from Middle East, North
Africa, as well as Turkey.
So it's a great global event.
And we've got extensive
support from the GDGs
and the communities across
in these countries too.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: That shows
the power of community, right?
Why is it important to be a part
of such vibrant communities?
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Yeah,
it's all about sharing.
Community is all about sharing,
and giving, and taking.
And in the complex
world like it is,
technology keeps
changing very fast.
So if you're not
sharing what you know
and if you're not
open to gaining stuff,
what you don't know, the
whole concept of community
doesn't work.
So it's like to get
you need to give.
So if you keep giving,
you will obviously
get what you want or need.
So I think that's the
spirit of community.
And that happens even
in developers also.
And that's how we
are able to execute
events of such large scale
with the support of community.
And we will continue to
invest in communities.
VAIBHAVI DESAI:
So Karthik, there
are still a lot of people
who couldn't make it to GDD.
What are some ways in which
they can get benefit out
of the things that
are happening at GDD?
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Yeah,
it's a great question.
Thanks for asking
me this, Viabhavi.
So there's been a huge
waitlist for GDD India.
But the good news
is that for people
who have not been
able to make it,
we have GDD India
being livestreamed.
It's also being recorded.
All these sessions are
going to be made available
on the YouTube Google
Developers channel.
And second, we also have
GDD Extended events,
which are already signed up.
And we increase the
community folks across
to sign up for GDD Extended
on the GDD India website.
And they can host
their own local events
and extend GDD and the spirit of
GDD into their local community.
So we're looking forward
to keep the spirit on,
at least till Feb of next year.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: That
is super awesome.
Make sure you do not
miss the sessions that
are out on YouTube.
And make sure you attend
the nearby GDD Extended
event as well.
Thanks a lot for joining
with us, Karthik.
And I hope you have a great
time for the rest of GDD India.
Thank you.
KARTHIK PADMANABHAN: Thank you.
