those of you from bangalore you know
thank you for welcoming us to your
wonderful city my name is Sam Dutton and
I'm a developer advocate for the web
I've only been here a few days you know
but I've already met a bunch of
brilliant developers doing great work on
the web now I live in London but you
know I grew up in South Australia quite
close to the beautiful Adelaide Cricket
Oval I don't know if anyone has ever
seen this but anyway I'm here today and
tomorrow with a lot of other Googlers
who are web developers and who work on
Chrome so yeah if you have questions
please come and chat to us in the
sandbox area so I think we're at a
turning point for the web and I'd like
to explain why I think that progressive
web apps are at the heart of that so
this is my third visit to Bangalore and
since the first time I was in Bangalore
there has been a revolution on the
mobile web you know in that time the
explosion of mobile usage has completely
transformed the landscape of the web of
course we're seeing huge growth in the
number of people you know who only go
online on mobile even in the United
States as these figures show overall of
course there's a massive increase in
internet usage China as you can see
still on top but you know check out the
growth in India that's just fantastic
and there's massive potential for growth
on the web and again this is where India
really stands out I was just looking you
know the kind of roundup of devices and
a noticing like this you know this
increasing access to affordable devices
like these phones we probably have seen
it like there you know like three to
five thousand rupees and their specs are
pretty good like quad-core maybe 512
mega gig of ram maybe 16 gig storage you
know you can run some
pretty powerful websites on these
devices and of course you know we've had
the crazy price wars like carry a
competition lots of factors driving down
data prices and now you know data in
India has a cost that's well below 2
percent of GDP per capita which has been
defined as the threshold for
affordability for most people but it's
not all good news
globally 60 percent of mobile
connections are still 2g you know even
in London where I live you'll find lots
of areas with poor cell coverage or no
connectivity at all in you know the US
as you can see a lot of people do not
have access to fast broadband you know
it's it's the same on broadband where
infrastructure is often poor and we see
a similar picture in many regions back
in India most mobile connections are
still predicted to be on 2g even by 2020
and of course you know mobile and only
doesn't mean that everyone on the web
has like a high tech smartphone most
users globally of course are on older
low spec phones and there are even some
new low spec phones as you I'm sure have
seen you know the geophone and then the
Alcatel go flip in the US that have
become you know an appealing and
accessible upgrade for some users not
least you know the hundreds of millions
of feature phone users who now want to
like buy pizza and watch comedy online
all this all this is a major challenge
to web developers so like I say I think
we're at a point a turning point for the
web and let me explain with a little
history of where I think the web has
gone does anyone actually know what this
is you know this is a modem this is how
we used to connect to the internet back
in the days when fifty-six like kilobits
a second was very optimistic does anyone
remember this dynamic HTML you know it
spread through the web and
it kind of was powerful the use of
JavaScript but it also gave us kind of
dysfunctional you know slide out menus
and crazy page transitions and so on and
this kind of toxic combination which was
over optimistic coding and poor
connectivity meant that you know I'm not
kidding like some sites in those days
would take like several minutes to load
so dhtml their use of forever script in
those days was powerful and gave us you
know some interesting stuff but also a
lot of poor experiences and to be honest
a lot of us as developers willfully
ignored the consequences of using
javascript in that way and all that
peaked around the time of like the
dot-com bust you know around the turn of
the millennium which coincidentally
coincides with the demise of dhtml but
out of the ashes of the dot-com boom
came a new generation of like really
pared back you know performant websites
some sites that really worked and at
that point we also saw sites making good
use of the web's capabilities as well as
its reach for example you know early
online maps were like a revelation but
you know still very slow and kind of
clunky to use so Google's use of Ajax
for Google Maps and Gmail like mid 2000s
you know really completed this
transformation of the web that we call
you know web 2 point naught now more
recently we've seen an incredible
transformation as the web platform has
become increasingly capable as you can
see from this slide which you know I
stole from tells keynote presentation so
the web had the reach and then it got
capabilities to match native apps so
everything is cool right it's fantastic
well the problem has been that with all
this capability and perhaps you know
because developers are often living in a
world with you know great connectivity
brilliant broadband
we started seeing this kind of stuff
sites with poor page load performance
and a huge number of requests on first
load so just kind of rather like the bad
old days of the dot-com boom and dhtml
some developers you know seem to be
ignoring real users with real world
connectivity so you've probably heard
this many times you know we're going to
keep showing this slide until things
change 19 seconds is the time it takes
the average mobile web page to load on
3G
it's a miracle everyone ever loads some
pages I think and pages have become
heavier too and that's a problem for
performance but also for many users data
costs is a major constraint to internet
access even more than connectivity of
course heavy payloads don't just add to
data cost and radio usage you know the
assets required to run an app can also
use up limited storage space so it's
really important to keep apps light and
I think progressive web apps are really
a response to all this and attitude to
building great web experiences
progressive we're about to make the most
of the web's reach and capability but
they also showed respect to users you
know by being honest about real world
constraints and the constraints of
devices but what does that mean in
practice well you know as a brand
progressive Web Apps has been extremely
powerful very quickly you know I think
we hit peak PWA when I came across this
article in The Grocer magazine saying
that progressive web apps are cool you
know you know a technology brand is
working when it's recommended like by a
journal for supermarket executives you
know anyway but what is what does this
mean for developers I think Alex Russell
really nailed it with a very specific
checklist of the entry level features
that should be part of every website if
you haven't read his blog post about
this I think you should really check it
out
this is really a manifesto for
great web experiences my colleague Chris
Wilson has recently coined this acronym
fire and this really sums up what
progressive web apps are about you know
the expectation from users is that web
experiences will be fast engaging and
reliable and that they integrated with
device hardware and platforms and with
other apps so this is why we're at a
turning point for the web we're at a
point where successful developers you
know are getting realistic about what
works and what doesn't and what really
matters to users and the huge leap
forward in capabilities you know it's
been combined with resilient performant
design Indian developers have taught us
that you don't need perfect connectivity
to provide a great online experience you
know that's where Bangalore I have to
say really is leading the world I think
the flip side of this is that we get
this huge rise now in user expectations
you know the web gets better so users
expect more the bar is high and getting
higher it's it's not enough just to
provide a service and expect the where
the reach of the web to make you
successful a great example from the
chrome dev summit here you know on the
left is like an old-style web site it's
functional the information is kind of
there it kind of works but users expect
something more now the new site on the
right is is a much better experience
it's it's a really beautiful piece of
work I think so the point here is that
it's no longer enough just to provide a
service so a big part of what makes
progressive Web Apps successful is that
multiple browsers are committed to the
technologies that enable them you know
while developer adoption is growing for
progressive web apps so is browser
support opera Samsung Microsoft Mozilla
are on boards service worker is in
Safari tech preview along with the cache
API and many other features that you
know are already in place in Safari one
little furry creature has been missing
from this
you see is a very popular browser in
India and other countries and I'm really
pleased that the incredible work
actually from the engineering team at UC
what they've done to move their browser
to the blink engine making it a great
platform for progressive web apps so
with this in line I'd like to welcome on
stage a very special guest
g'way from the UC browser team
thank you see wait thank Sam hi everyone
it's good to see you here
so as you can see you see now provides
basic support for PWA features including
Service Worker the cache API and for
fetch but the great news is that in you
for two point naught you see will
provide full support for web push and
add to homescreen and fully embracing
you know progressive web apps on the
platform so yeah you have any questions
about UC browser please contact us via
the email on the screen and I truly
believe we can make a mega bet web
mobile web a better future thank you
brilliant thank you so much she we're
here Sam yeah so the UC folks will be on
hand later in the sandbox so please come
and tour thank you
so anyway remember what I said
you know apps need to be fast integrated
reliable and engaging I'd like just like
to dive into that in some more detail
you know loading an app has to feel
instant it's kind of invisible process
you know remember that most users will
abandon sites that take more than a few
seconds to load there are some really
great sites that we would like to call
out though eleme is a great example of
this this is a Chinese site with 260
million users almost kind of Indian
scale and over 1.3 million restaurant
listings its interactive in 2 seconds so
you know check out their code it's
really worth a look they're doing a
great job there now page load speed has
also been a critical goal of the amp
project they took you know a radically
realistic approach building for the real
world and if you want to learn more
about working with amp check out Ben
Morse's presentation and we have an amp
training session tomorrow afternoon as
you'll find out amp and progressive web
apps can work really well for building
sites and apps that as we say you know
start
and stay fast so like I said Web Apps
should be kind of invisible you know by
that I mean you need seamless
integration across devices platform and
context so you know apps should not get
between users and what they want to do
in fact I think people should not have
to even think about the fact that
they're you know on the web or in a
native app or whatever it's just that
they're using their phone or tablet
whatever to complete a task it's a case
in point ecommerce it's all about
removing friction by integrating across
device and platform in context just to
be clear you know mobile commerce is a
huge deal
last year mobile commerce was worth a
hundred and twenty three billion dollars
in the US alone it's incredible and it's
no surprise you know given the the rise
of mobile computing that in our majority
of commercial traffic is coming from
mobile devices now what is surprising
here is how much of that mobile commerce
is actually happening on the web rather
than in native apps however conversion
rates for the mobile web as many of you
will know a far lower than for desktop
websites mobile conversions are about a
third of desktop conversions and this is
a fundamental challenge for the web you
know the web has gone mobile but
conversions on mobile remain low and
that you don't make sense in many ways
because entering data on mobile is hard
so please if you do one thing today
markup your forms properly you know it's
easy add autocomplete and type
attributes seriously this is so easy do
a pull request today and make us all
happy you know it's just it makes your
users lives much much easier but you
know as much as what I feel is great
it's it's really not enough to kind of
transform the web for e-commerce the
payment request API goes a step further
this is if you don't know it a w3c
standard for browsers that provides an
interface for users to enter payment and
shipping data so you know customers get
a consistent it
experience across platforms and
developers don't have to reinvent the
wheel even you know a tiny boutique or a
giant ecommerce retailer what's really
interesting in India is the rise of like
debit cards and but you know all
varieties of online payment it's
predicted that by 2020 more than 50% of
india's internet users will be using
digital payments and the top 100 million
users will actually drive 70 percent
digital payments which is pretty amazing
another area where we've seen fantastic
integration on the web is with media
we've added new api's to give developers
control to build robust secure and
efficient media experiences on the web
and we've made it possible to download
and consume media online with media you
know it's particularly important to get
right over 70% of Internet traffic as
video and you know that numbers
increasing and especially of course here
in India with what's happened with 4G
and so on this is becoming something
that users just expect on the web media
companies are seeing a lot of success
here geo cinema so you know this was a
like an app only business went to web
for the first time a couple of months
ago with this PWA they're already seeing
like 10 percent longer session time on
average then for their native app and
and better reach for their customers and
tier 2 and tier 3 cities which is
fantastic if you want to learn more
about media capabilities I really
recommend looking at this there's a
brilliant progressive web app for media
it's at you know bitly PWA media it's
built by Paul Lewis used to be my boss
now works for deep mind and gives you
adaptive streaming pre-caching custom
controls thumbnails and downloadable
video it's a fantastic piece of work a
great place to start if you're thinking
of implementing video you know this this
technology really opens up the web to
even more platforms with the web VR API
we see this incredible expressive power
coming to the web companies like
sketchfab you know this stunning VR
experience lots of scenes to
explore anyway and after that stuff I'm
just getting back to basics to want to
talk about reliability for a moment so
in order for web apps to take a place on
the home screen you know we need to make
them reliable even when the network
isn't and this has been one of the
things holding back the web as an app
platform we've become too conditioned to
think that the web only works with a
live network this is where service
workers come in so I just wanted to ask
who here has heard of service workers
and has a pretty good idea you know what
they are and why they're game-changing
for the web so who has worked with
service workers ok well that's pretty
good ok but you know the traditional web
model for those who haven't worked with
Service Worker is that yeah their
browser goes to the network and looks up
the web server and asks for a page and
it's resources the browser you know it
has an HTTP cache but the developer
can't control that
and if the network is down you know you
get a visit from our friend the dinosaur
and that experience can be even worse
with flaky connectivity where that's
neither up nor down but you know with
service workers you don't necessarily
need to traverse the network every time
so a serviceworker is a client-side
proxy that acts as an intermediary
between your app and the outside world
it's great for offline but like I say
also for handling an offline connection
or unreliable connectivity for example
you can implement timeouts for network
requests to make sure that users are
never kept waiting so for simple cases
you know service workers are pretty
straightforward but as you can see here
Service Worker design can get complex
for more complex caching strategies in
the real world and this is where work
box comes in this is a great tool box
making it really simple to build
successful cashflow caching strategies
into your web app and it you know
enables you to support offline and
handle unreliable connectivity the
training team will be running a session
this afternoon to teach you how to use
it so all these pillars like fast and
integrated reliable
really lead to engaging and I want to
show you this one app that does that
particularly well for those unfamiliar
trivago is one of the world's leading
hotel search engines operating in 55
countries and you know it shows how
investment in reliable experiences
really pays off and that's because
trivago used serviceworker to build a
really resilient web app i think that
you know serviceworker and the cache API
mean that network resilience is becoming
the norm for high quality web
experiences and you know successful
sites like trivago are really embracing
that now they're PWA it's really
providing business value as well like a
huge increase in click throughs to hotel
offers for them now as Jenny Gove will
be explaining in her UX talk later we
know different research you know people
like the convenience of launching apps
from their home screen if it's something
that turns it regularly and again
trivago is doing a great job of this as
you can see like the code to enable add
to home screen is really straightforward
you know in a manifest file you specify
like a tight ball icon other details of
how your app appears on the user's
device and you add a link to the
manifest in your HTML and that's it you
can add this to your side in you know
about five minutes so all in all
progressive web apps combine the reach
of the web with the capabilities to
improve engagement on mobile now I know
this all sounds great but you know
reality sinks in we go back to our day
jobs and building a progressive web app
can seem like a huge undertaking but
implementing PWA techniques does not
have to be a monolithic refactoring task
and I want to talk about some ways to
get started you know progressive web
apps need a solid foundation no amount
of you know PWA magic it's going to fix
like blocking javascript or bloated
images you need to fix those problems
first before implementing PWA techniques
I mean when it comes down to it
progressive web apps our websites yeah
so there are some
relatively simple changes that you can
implement that can have a big impact on
performance and for security reliability
and data cost now rather than try and
talk through these large number of
bullet points I recommend you take a
look at the guide link to here this
like I say shows how to make a number of
relatively simple fixes that will
improve any website you know these are
low-hanging fruit and really like table
stakes for building a progressive web
app so we've been working on training
resources for progressive web apps and
also on a certification program so on
stage now I'd like to invite Sarah Clark
who manages our training team so I'm
Sarah Clark I'm the program manager in
charge of web developer training and
certification quite a few of you have
probably seen me on the Google
developers India YouTube channel
teaching progressive web apps I came out
here to Bangalore in February and that's
where we filmed the class so remember
this that all showed you in the first
session these are features we've added
only in the last year the ones getting
new features at incredible speed and
best practice which is changing so
quickly that how do you make sure your
skills are up-to-date now we have three
things that have been out for most of
the year or longer the developer
google.com slash training site will
guide you to all of them but we put our
entire PWA course on
developers.google.com you can watch it
there or on youtube we also have
individual courses on Udacity and these
are all free there's no cost for any of
them the courses that we've published
recently the classroom courses are all
open source so if you want to take it
and teach it in your company or if you
want to teach it commercially just talk
to me and we'll get you the materials so
my team has also built the mobile web
specialist certification program and we
announced this a month ago in Krakow we
looked at 10,000 job descriptions to
determine what hiring managers want
today
so and it's not always the absolute
latest thing but it's what gets you
ready for everything we're talking about
here so it's a global certification so
we looked at jobs around the world and
it includes the skills you'll need for
international markets so for example if
you're building for US or Europe these
are core skills you'll need for their
certification is all online it's a test
that you take where you solve about 14
to 17 real programming challenges in
four hours it's not super easy most
developers have to study and most
developers need at least three to four
years of real-world experience or some
pretty intensive study to get through it
yeah I could vouch for that I did the
test it's really hard so but the nice
thing about it being hard like that is
it guarantees that hey you know your
stuff so we provide a free study guide
so you can study for the test
or just make sure your skills are up to
date so feel free to take a look at that
just look at developers.google.com slash
training and then one more thing if you
saw the news last week and it was
mentioned in the opening session we
announced a hundred and thirty thousand
scholarships here in India last week
thirty thousand of those are for Udacity
courses including ten thousand of those
include these the studied course leading
up to the certification and the cost of
the certification a hundred thousand of
these are subscriptions to Pluralsight
where there's a lot of really useful
material you can learn from and with
that that's a lot to remember
so just remember developers.google.com
slash training slash programs slash
india this will get you to the india
specific page with all the information
including all of those scholarships so
Sam why we wrap this up yeah let's wrap
this up so thank you Sarah and yeah I
would really recommend the training a
great way to keep your skills up to date
anyway so to get started with
progressive Web Apps you know we have
some great sessions as you can see
coming up today and tomorrow more
technical content and we also have you
know expert we're Googlers on-hand
people
from the crime team to answer your
questions and solve your problems in the
web area and come and check out our
stuff in the sandbox
check out the lighthouse if you haven't
seen that already the web team is also
running three hands-on workshops 90
minutes each
so today data-driven progressive web
apps how to build web apps that work
with data online and off using work box
from website PWA and then tomorrow
morning combining accelerated mobile
pages and PWA there in the other
building and come on over there free
bring your laptop and we'll get through
to some really interesting stuff yeah
and if you want to learn more about PW
eyes I've actually put together a whole
bunch of links to great resources at
bitly /pwa resources so lots more good
stuff there as well - it from external
experts and lastly always you know if
you want to learn about what's new on
the web do check out web fundamentals
our content at developers.google.com
slash web is you know right at the
forefront stuff from people who are
building building browsers and working
on web specs and that's it yeah I mean
most of all please feel free to contact
you know Sarah and me and and speak to
any of the Googlers here ok thank you
very much thank you so much Dania vada</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
