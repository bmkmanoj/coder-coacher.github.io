advocate in the developer relations team
here at Google and today we're gonna see
something really interesting
firebase predictions and how you can get
actionable insights from that to build
amazing experience for your apps so
before we start let's play a math game
for some don't worry it's not going to
be too complicated if you have already
seen this before just play along don't
spoil the fun think of a number between
one and ten don't tell anybody just keep
it in your mind okay multiply that by
two all good plus eight - it really
tricky all right let's say no worries
probably too long divide this by half by
two half of it and minus the original
number that you thought of initially
from the result that you got right now
you have your numbers okay now you must
have most probably got a number between
1 and 26 you want to convert that to an
character now if you've got one that's
going to be a if it's got two it's going
to be B and so forth okay
all Convertible character now pick a
country any country that starts with the
letter that you thought of the character
that you have actually got right now
don't say that out loud
hold on now pick the next character from
that alphabet Q so if you have a big B
you have B big C so on
okay pick the next character now think
of an animal that actually starts with
the letter a lot of
now the thing that we're going to try
and do here is to kind of think of or
predict what you guys have thought of
how many of you thought of an elephant
just show of hands good number of people
how many of you thought of Denmark as a
country again a good number how many
thought what of that I gave the same
number okay you get a very predictable
audience well interestingly there are no
elephants in Denmark it seems that's a
new thing that I learned but it feels
magical right this is how you want most
of your app experiences to be like where
you have those emotional connects with
those apps so that you retain those apps
more you don't you want to spend on
those apps where those magical
experiences come in and delight you
every now and then now some of you might
have thought of something else could be
any move but that's fine they might they
will be outliers in every predictions so
that's not we love everybody so it's
fine but let's think of building a game
along these lines that we talked about
right now if you have actually seen we
have the elephant so let's think of the
games intention for this elephant to go
around the world and say collect bananas
but if you look at the funnel of this
game there may be something interesting
that you'll find within 24 hours for
most games within 24 hours of acquiring
some users a bunch of users you're gonna
lose half of them that doesn't end there
7 days later most probably you lose
another half and 30 days later another
half this is a worrying trend and yes
the elephant's not going to be happy
you've done a lot of work to acquire
these users and then seeing that these
users are getting lost or a period of
time
now you can as a product magazine
engineer you can think of ways in which
you want to retain these users that
you're gonna lose you can come up with
new strategies maybe new - new workflows
by which you retain these users to your
app but in order to do that you might
most probably want to know who's going
to leave because it's easier to retain
somebody who's about to leave
getting the users who left gave the
users who give back after they have left
but identifying those users is gonna be
pretty tricky because they can be any
bunch from your user set but that's
where firebase prediction starts coming
into picture now
if you've started using Google Analytics
for firebase already it is pretty
straightforward
all you do is go ahead to the firebase
console click on the predictions tab say
you opt-in to work with firebase
predictions and that's all the work you
do from then we actually take the data
from your analytics that you have
actually logged in over a period of time
and then run it through an ml model and
show you predictions this is all the
code there's no code that need to write
in order to do it just click on the
button and the firebase thing that
you're in and you could get start
getting default predictions for this now
let's get a little deeper into how this
is happening now if you look at it at
the heart of this problem this is a
supervised learning model standard way
you have we take the past 100 days of
data we divide the two segments one the
last seven days we know what has
happened so we label that data and for
the data beef before that we actually
study the user behavior and then
validate it against the label data and
then using these two things ramming into
a tensorflow model we would be able to
predict for the next seven is what the
behavior would be like so we have the
training data as well as a holdout data
the training data is used in order to
understand the behavior of the users
based on past history and at every step
of this training we use the holdout data
or the evaluation data to ensure that we
have the right accuracy and we can
feedback data into it now using this
learnt model we can then predict what
would happen with the existing set of
users for the next seven days and that's
how predictions are actually formed and
shared with a with the app
now using this you have firebase data
from tensorflow f-from tensorflow then
flowing into your firebase predictions
console with one check which basically
that there is an internal threshold for
the accuracy once accuracy is crossing
that we then share it to you and your
console you can use that prediction and
the data and then act upon that now it
doesn't stop there you can go ahead and
use that and then use it with remote
config push notification or a/b testing
so the advantage of this comes in more
strongly when you use it with other
tools that are along with firebase so
you might be able to change something in
remote config based on the segment that
you got or the prediction that you've
got or you would be wanting to send push
notifications to a certain set of
audience based on the prediction that
you've got or around a different AV test
on one of the segments which is
predicted let's look at the default
predictions by default you get a few
things and you can also write some
custom predictions but let us start with
the default predictions now this is how
a prediction card comes up this is a
prediction for an app for churn and not
sure like whoever is going to leave the
app and whoever is less likely to leave
the app let me show you the different
sections in the card now first is the
name what what the prediction is about
here it's not the second one is where
users are not going to turn from your
app then you have a person the users
that you would see from your current
user base were predictor to churn in the
next seven days 36 percent that's really
high so you need to do something about
that now you would also see that 36 plus
the north churn they are not adding up
together 200 but that's fair because
there are some users in your system
which we don't know enough data about
and we would not predict for them so
sometimes these numbers won't add up to
100 so there'll be a set of users that
we have not learned enough data to
understand some behavior from them now
the next thing that you want to look at
is the number so we also show not just
in percentages but when you take the
target a percentage
what is the toe
number of users that will be affected or
that is actually in this segment right
now
now the second prediction this is even
more interesting is who's predicted
who's the prediction where you buy which
you can say is this person likely to
spend on the app or is this person not
likely to spend on the app this can
again be used to create some powerful
workflow changes by which you can
increase that revenue now if you see
there was a slider which said which was
there in each of these cards this is
basically the restorin slider now this
is a way of you to tell the system how
tolerant you are to false positives
now you by changing this you will change
the value the number of users targeted
and the percentage so let me share that
explain that with the example in there
now if your risk tolerance this low
which means that you have low tolerance
to say something like the risk that you
want to take with the action that you
take you want to be it to be really low
and you don't want any false positives
then you can share it to be low or if
you want to end of it the risk can be
take a lot motors can be taken you can
set it to a higher risk level giving you
an example if I'm going to target in
this app I'm going to target all the
users who who are about to churn for
example and I'm going to give them a
free gift or rather let me take the
another example let's talk about
somebody who's already spending and
you're putting a new in-app purchase in
the app you want to kind of show the
users who would actually more likely to
purchase that right you don't want to
show it to non spenders so then you take
that you you have you can take a higher
risk because even if you show this new
in-app product to a user that is not
likely to spend it's still fine because
at the most she's gonna not do any
action on it but there's no loss of
revenue or anything for you by taking
that or so you'll actually try to give
it to a maximum risk tolerance but in
the same way if you think about giving a
free say a free product or a free
subscription to
everybody in the game who's about to
churn but to increase retention you
might want to give it to a low tolerance
because you don't want to kind of give
this free to a user who's anyway willing
to pay for this so then you want to use
this tolerance to be minimal so that's
how you want to use the restorin slider
to kind of change your value now overall
accuracy that's the last part in the
card because we know what happened and
we know what we predicted we can have
used that information to kind of tell
you how accurate this prediction has
been over the past takes the last 14
days and then shows you all the
positives false positive scenarios and
the negative scenarios and calculates
the overall accuracy that's the accuracy
card so sometimes you want to take into
account the accuracy before you decide
on your this risk tolerance or decide on
whether you want to act upon that
prediction or not if the accuracy is
really know maybe you don't want to kind
of take take into account that one now
how would he use predictions in your app
now let's take example in this case
where let's take an example where your
lie users are likely to predict them we
want to do something about that now we
know from our apps data that hey at the
level for if people have actually
crossed level 4 they have an emotional
connect to the app and they they tend to
play more because there are more options
available there are more gameplay
choices so you know the retention is
higher after level 4 so that's the fact
that we know now let's see how we can
translate that with a prediction that
you have made so far now you could use
the prediction churn where you had 36
percent of people who are likely to
churn and you could actually use remote
config to do something like this we
could change the game difficulty for
people who are more likely to churn like
in this case predictor churn and when
the user is below level 4 you change the
game level difficulty to easy only for
those users without affecting the
gameplay for everybody you're not
changing for everyone you're only
changing for the people who are
are predicted to churn which means they
will be find it easier to go over level
four which means the retention would
increase for everybody else a default
medium B what the what medium level is
what we want to keep so that way for
people who are enjoying the game so far
and are not predicted to change
predicted to churn you would continue to
give them the same level of difficulty
but at the same time those who are
actually predicted to churn will be
given an easier way to kind of play more
and go over level four now for
prediction of spend let's think about
how we can actually improve that part
there's prediction spent that 22% of
people are willing to spend on it which
is a good number so we should try and
improve that one thing that you could do
at that point is to kind of use a be
testing tool to decide what would be the
quantity of a certain IEP and what would
be the best price that people are like
looking at in this case there are two
variants that you can run against the
people who will spend you could run a
variant a which actually gives you a
dozen bananas for a dollar point nine
nine since and or ten dozen bananas for
$5.99 so if you want to find out what
are people more likely to buy and you
want to kind of send it only to the
users or enable is only for the users
who would actually pay for this right
the risk of running this for everyone is
that you're a B tests can be
inconclusive because a lot of people are
not buying it anyway
so you will actually not be able to get
very conclusive data on it by limiting
it to the users that are spending are
likely to spend you get a much more
accurate way of measuring this and
deciding which one of these variants
should you continue to keep once you see
that a variant B is what most people
want what you would do is just use that
throughout the app so a B test result
would be based on how users are using it
and the right and segmenting it to the
right audience now you also have 74% of
people who are not paying that's an on
spending group here you could use an
alternative monetization model which
could be a rewarded video for example so
that you can increase the revenue from
people
who are not even likely to spend so even
have products they are not buying it
maybe you want to kind of show them a
reward ad by which the revenue increases
they might get some benefits out of the
app you might open up some levels or
things like that but they still are
generating revenue for you so this is
also quite powerful because you now
target people based on what their plan
how they would actually generate revenue
for you by showing a rewarded ad to
everyone your effectiveness is less or
by showing that a B does to everyone
again the effectiveness of this but
every nexus suddenly jumps up when you
actually target them correctly now there
are also custom predictions that you
could do not just the default ones there
are five custom predictions that you
could do where it's as simple as this
let's look at the flow of how you make a
custom prediction you start by taking
one of your conversion events that
you've logged already so when you log in
latex you can say that to be a
conversion event and then you take one
of those conversion events then share
like in this case I've taken whether
somebody would share some data or not so
you want to show show the share dialog
only to users who are more likely to
share it for others it's always it's
some level that you could or a UI that
you could actually skip now you want to
introduce social engagement in your app
and you want to show it to users who are
interested in doing that now I've taken
a prediction I am taking a prediction of
social engagement and I'm looking for
people who will share once you actually
get that say in this case there's 30% of
people who are willing to share that now
with that data
you could then turn on using remote
config maybe turn on a screen which
would show them the search interface for
a share interface for them now just
don't take my word for it let's look at
some examples of how people have
actually used this and made some changes
in their app in the real world Halfbrick
which is one of our partners who worked
at that increase retention for their dan
the man app by about 20% by using
firebase predictions let's see what they
have done so initially they went ahead
and said they were you gonna use forever
addictions and they have
opted in for five days predictions now
where five is predictions in background
actually started preparing this and once
the fire the predictions were ready we
sent them a mail you click on the mail
you open the console and in the console
you get predictions of how who's gonna
churn how much what was it is so 23% in
this case what they did is then clicked
on target users buttered showed up
remote configures an option and they use
remote config in this case they created
a parameter will churn and then
published it now with by doing this what
they have done is in their app they've
now have a parameter for that every user
in the first next remote fetch every
user will get one more parameter which
says whether that person will join or
not which means the app right now has
the intelligence to decide whether this
person will churn or not based on the
prediction that happened in firebase
predictions console they did an
algorithm like this let me not write we
read the code but I'll tell you what
they did in picture they actually share
a special gift for people who are about
to churn they gave them a little bit of
coins and a play button which is very
enticing so by doing this only to the
people that were about to churn they
reduce the de7 retention by twenty
percent twenty percent is not a small
number to kind of keep back right so
there might be many instances in your
apps where you can actually do things
very similar let's take an other example
where somebody is optimized revenue
based on predictions now rock byte
actually is one of those apps that we
worked with who increased or increase
their revenue by using firebase
predictions now what they did is they
basically use the predictions are that
the spent prediction and change the
order in which goods were actually shown
in a be testing sorry in in their
digital store now they used a be testing
tool to kind of do that what they did
has amazing results they've increased
their revenue for spenders by 25%
that's one fourth increase in revenue
not a small number that you can ignore
right now what they have done is they
use
this condition and ordered differently
the way in which they would keep digital
goods the in-app purchases in their app
the in-app purchases that I had and the
order has actually changed based on this
data now for the spender group they
actually gave rare items that is a chest
that you see up front and for for those
people who were not spenders what they
did is they gave things that could
continue gameplay for a longer period of
time like crystals for example which
which can be used within the game so
that by which this is more interesting
for that 72% that did not spend they
increase revenue by 24% for people who
were not willing to spend so this way of
actually changing things using a/b
testing tool which allowed them to kind
of do this and increase revenue on both
the spenders as well as the non spenders
there by both getting customized
experiences which made the spend more
now concrete is another example that I
want to share with you is another
partner who actually improved their
users experience by showing them ads
which were more showing them ads to
users that were actually about this were
more likely to retain more ads and less
as people about to churn they reduced
the number of it and they were gave this
clearly with a very user centric
approach they were able to increase
their inner purchases by about 21% in
summary this whole thing if you are
already using firebase analytics you
cannot start using it if you're already
using that opt-in for firebase
predictions with firebase predictions
you would be able to find out these
interesting bits by which you can change
your flows and improve experiences for
user make it very customized and get
Google ml to work for you as as part of
your team so that's the staff photo
after you in predict after you add
firebase traditions to your team we have
we are also part of that
now if this doesn't end there it's not
just about predicting the user behavior
it's also about using them with
appropriate flow workflows use maybe
push notification where you push notify
to users based on their behavior you
might want to send certain users who are
based on your prediction that segment of
used a certain one type of message and a
different one for different type of
different segments of audience or maybe
change a remote conflict and change the
behavior of the app on the fly or it
could be that you can run a be test on
the more appropriate set of people that
you have so the power really comes in
when you use it all in combination with
each other and if there are more
questions please feel free to meet us at
the firebase our office our section and
with I hope this was useful for you guys
and you gonna try it out if you're there
are interesting cases that you come up
with please do not forget to let us know
