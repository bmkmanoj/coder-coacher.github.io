MANORANJAN PADHY: Hey, there.
We are at day one
of Google I/O 2017.
And right now, I
have Sam with me
who is developer
relations for web.
Hey, Sam, how are you?
SAM THOROGOOD: I'm pretty good.
MANORANJAN PADHY: How
has your day been so far?
SAM THOROGOOD: It's
been long and tiring,
but it's been lots
of fun as well.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Great.
Same here.
So, Sam, do you want
to talk about standards
for the web developers
in India and how
it can be useful for them.
SAM THOROGOOD: Yeah.
So I have a video series.
It's called &quot;The
Standard,&quot; where
I try to cover really basic
HTML concepts that are all
grounded in standards, right?
You know, it's
great that we have
these amazing libraries
like Polymer and Angular
and things like that.
But if you're building
a simple website,
you may not actually
need them, right?
You only need to use
what the platform gives
you to make sure your
users have a great time.
MANORANJAN PADHY: So
you would have heard
and would have known,
networks in India
can get sometimes very flaky.
Connectivity can be very bad.
So can this be useful,
perhaps, to have a link?
SAM THOROGOOD:
Yes and no, right?
So I haven't done
a video on this,
but there's a technology called
progressive web apps, which
is a standard way
to use something
that's called a service
worker to cache your resources
offline.
And so maybe when they have
great connectivity or better
connectivity, they can
fetch these resources.
Then you can write your
code so that those resources
are available even on
lower-end connections.
MANORANJAN PADHY: And do
you have any resources
where you want to
point these developers,
they can go and check out
and learn more about it?
And of course, your show.
SAM THOROGOOD: Yeah.
I have a show.
There'll be a link somewhere.
You can have a look.
I talk about a bunch
of different things,
not just progressive web
apps, but basic things
like how to do forms really
well or how to use features
like Flexbox, which is
a system that is just
the heart of the platform.
What I would
recommend is, whenever
you use one of my
videos, take a look
at the supported rights in
your area, in this case, India.
Look at what browsers
there are out there.
You know, the data is out there.
You can see what your users
are going to be using.
And you can build your
websites based on that.
And the secret that
I like to tell people
is that these features that
people find really scary,
that they feel like
it's new and modern,
the vast majority of browsers
actually support them.
So look at resources
like caniuse.com
to actually see that
your users will actually
be able to use this feature.
Because it turns out, most
of them will be able to.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Great.
Thanks, Sam, for joining us.
And I hope you have
a great I/O ahead.
And you heard him, and the
links that he's pointing to.
Do check it out.
And what you heard in
the background is just
the Google I/O. So enjoy.
SAM THOROGOOD: It's great.
