I'm in grade 7 at Ober International
School and I have a twin sister her name
is Fiona and she's two minutes older
than me just a few years ago I had
attended a summer camp in the US that
was about coding using scratch and so
they thought it would be a good idea for
me to see if I wanted to do this because
she would challenge my skills and help
me learn more a lot of the ways I get
ideas of apps that I want to do or
problems that I find are related to
these things that I like doing I like to
write I like to play soccer and I love
reading and I get a lot of inspiration
from there so my app is called a hay
so it basically lets you send a gesture
enables message to your friends and your
friend shakes the phone to open the
message and then they have to walk a few
steps like watch a video that you sent
them and it's nothing too fancy but it's
more than just normal message since this
is one of the first times as I was
coding a complex app my dad helped me
when I got stuck any he and my mom both
helped me think of this as a fun project
and not a competition and just do
whatever you think you can do because
it's really really fun and it really
challenges you just know we learned a
lot about coding in general and skills
that I didn't have before that I now
have I love that you can get the power
to create whatever you want and I love
how you can use coding to help solve a
problem and make your life better I
think that's really good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
