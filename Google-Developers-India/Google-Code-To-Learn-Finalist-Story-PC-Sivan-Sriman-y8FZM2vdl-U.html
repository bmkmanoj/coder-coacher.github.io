My name's PC Sivan Sriman.
I'm a Class 10 student currently studying
at St. Michael's Academy.
I came to know
about this competition
last year when I was in ninth standard.
Since I've got interest in programming
and plus I play a lot of games
in my free time
I thought why not play
in doing a game contest?
So I discussed with my teachers
who gave me the go-ahead,
and I entered in this competition.
When I participated
in the &lt;i&gt;Code to Learn Competition 2015&lt;/i&gt;
I did a game, but it
wasn't what I expected.
It's a bit too crude
with no animations and stuff.
When I participated again in 2016,
I wanted to make the game
much more animated
and look even more refined.
Well, I just first did the coding
for all the characters
like the hero of the game, the floor,
the platform, the background, etc.
And then I wanted to design
the costumes and animation
during the course of game.
And by creating an app,
I would not have created through &lt;i&gt;Java, C++&lt;/i&gt;
or any other programming language,
I would create it through &lt;i&gt;Scratch&lt;/i&gt;.
I will not have to type in many commands
as &lt;i&gt;Scratch&lt;/i&gt; is only based on block coding
and block coding is much simpler
than typing the commands.
And I will sit and do coding
as long as I want.
And I won't be disturbed
unless my mother calls me to eat
or do something or sleep
or whatever.
So I enrolled again in the&lt;i&gt;
Code to Learn Competition in 2016&lt;/i&gt;
and I submitted my game.
And by God's grace, I won it.
After winning the game of course many kids
would ask me about this competition.
I told them that &lt;i&gt;Code to Learn&lt;/i&gt;
is a video competition conducted by &lt;i&gt;Google&lt;/i&gt;
through which they can get
an exposure to game designing
and also get an idea
about national competitions
being held across India.
After that, they ask me how to do a game.
I just gave them one simple rule.
Don't do the game with your mind
do it with your heart.
Only then you can win it.
I would just like to say one thing here.
In order to win, your will to win
must be greater than your fear of failure.
That's something I applied
during the &lt;i&gt;Code to Learn Competition&lt;/i&gt;.
And it's also something
I'd like to tell others to apply,
not only during the competition
but also in the course of life.
