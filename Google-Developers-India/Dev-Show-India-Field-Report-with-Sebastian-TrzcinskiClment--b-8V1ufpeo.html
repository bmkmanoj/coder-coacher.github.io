with me you had given a wonderful talks
on how to be superhumans can you give a
similar message for the people or
developers that are listening to you
right now so if you participate to a GDG
meet help outside three things the first
one is well actually say if you're going
to attend the meetup the organizers in a
do this on their free time so I think
the minimum of politeness actually say
are you going to tell not the second
thing you can do is after the meetup
give feedback feedback is really useful
and feedback can be both positive
criticism but also things things that
don't work and then you may try and
improve it yourself as a participant
that's the third message I have is give
a hand if you're an expert in some
specific area if you want to speak if
you want to organize or help the
organizers on a specific aspect please
by all means - so what is the message
what is one single message that you
would like to deliver to the members who
are participating actively in this
community three GDG or any other
developer communities I'd say think
about the local challenges the
challenges that are relevant to India
it's really India's turn to shine on a
global stage right the spotlight clearly
is on India and nowadays the growth in
the world is coming from India so it is
your turn to shine make it shine the
future is is now it's yours so do
something about it um with new ideas get
more women to participate in the fields
of science and technology hey everyone
all of you are watching as the bashing
place shine reactive this is the time
this is your time to do things to
innovate and if you have any solutions
do let us know in the comments and we
would love to hear about it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
