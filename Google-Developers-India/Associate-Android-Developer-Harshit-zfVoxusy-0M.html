oh hello good morning nice to meet you
thank you I'm JP oh I'm from Mountain
View and I'm here to give you this
associate Android developer certificate
you were the first people to pass the
exam I think my gender development
started back in the first year of my
college one of my seniors needed an app
so he asked me to do it and I started
looking around on some blogs or some
videos how to make an Android app so I
had to learn Java because I was a
proficient in C++ so I had to learn Java
and then like learn the android
framework and how to how to make Android
apps after that I built some personal
projects on my own
were there any obstacles that you had
and how did you get past them I had what
what's termed as an impostor syndrome
because yeah when you start developing
on some framework of my platform
you might be thinking at some part of
journey that there might be people who
are already working on this platform and
what are doing like extremely better
than I am so what's the point of doing
it there's an instructor online
instructor known as Kathleen phone you
might be knowing that yes so yeah she
gave a good talk on about the impostor
syndrome on and how do you shoot how you
should overcome it
so I think that that helped me because I
hadn't seen that video I would be there
I would have probably stopped bad or
does your name tell me look about like
an app with you that you're proud of her
things that you're working on I've been
working on doing machine learning and
HCI because I want to build intelligent
Android apps starting off my first
project was an icon pack it will replace
all your icons with the custom ones made
by me so that's one of the project
that's close to my heart
tell me a little about the influence of
your family growing up so Matt is a
government employee working in centers
in cooperation and my mother she's a
housewife my brother is right now in
well standard my family was pretty
supportive of me throughout the whole
journey they just let me lose and say do
whatever you want to do but just
remember one thing that you should do
right by yourself it's pretty nice to
have such parents even when I wanted to
give this exam I just asked him today I
want to I want 1,600 piece I want to
give an example he didn't even ask me
what the exams for just told me okay
here's the pin take it and give it if
you think it's right to do same was for
my mother she's always there to help me
out that she's always there to support
me up in his childhood
anything you ask her she okay please
don't do this definitely will do that
yes and some time he suffered also got
very creative and curious also he was
asking so many questions to me any short
of electronic items he just want to see
what is inside when he was by year six
years he opened so many digital crafts
this one once I asked if why you are
opening why you are destroying and a
simple answer was I want to see how this
digits are made on this LCD screen
after this school education I never
impose Hartree that he could go in
engineering or science subject you are
the maker of you own care here I have
some sort of a goal to provide quality
education to not just college students
but even the school students in general
because they are learning coding but
they don't know how to apply it because
coding is not just for being developers
it also helps you increase your logical
reasoning and analytic skills I'm
getting a pretty good feedback from them
so I think I might extend this program
to more schools was there something else
that we want to do before we were so
harsh it we would like to have you come
to Google i/o in Mountain Gear in May
and join us III would be definitely be
honored and all expenses paid we just
you just get on your visa and your
passport if you don't have that already
okay you're very welcome
thank you very much for letting us into
your home today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
