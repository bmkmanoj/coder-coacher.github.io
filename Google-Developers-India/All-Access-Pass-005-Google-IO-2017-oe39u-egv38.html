MANORANJAN PADHY: Hey, everyone.
I'm at the Google
I/O 2017, day 1.
And right now I have
Sarah Clark with me.
Hey, Sarah.
How are you?
SARAH CLARK: Hey, I'm good.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
You have been quite
busy in the codelab
section of the I/O.
So what are these codelabs?
SARAH CLARK: So if you've ever
done a tutorial on the web,
a codelab is a Google
strength tutorial.
It covers typical technologies
such as how to build an Android
app, how to build virtual
reality with Daydream,
all the progressive web
apps stuff, it's all there.
It's all broken down
by steps with links
to all the relevant
Google properties.
So we really help
you get started
with our absolute
newest technologies.
In fact, some of the things
we're doing in codelabs today
were only announced
this morning.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
I am a developer,
so why do I need to take
this codelab [INAUDIBLE]?
What do I get out of it?
SARAH CLARK: So
with the codelabs,
we're taking our absolute
latest technologies,
and the experts that
know them are actually
building up these codelabs
building these tutorials.
So for example, I
and my team build
a bunch of progressive
web apps codelabs,
and I teach the
progressive webapps course.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
Yeah, well from that--
Sarah was in Bangalore, and she
did a long course for PWA on--
those codelabs are
there on our channel,
so please do check it out.
Sarah, what other codelabs that
have already developed and have
developed on google.com?
SARAH CLARK: So
there's a huge number.
There's virtual
reality, and Android,
and internet of things,
and progressive web apps,
and some nuance in
Kotlin for Android.
There's a ton of
codelabs out there.
To check them out, go
to codelabs.google.com
in your browser.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Thanks.
And do we have any videos also
related to these codelabs,
or any code samples where
they can go and check it out?
SARAH CLARK: So every codelab
comes with a code sample.
All the code samples are on Git.
Directions are there
for downloading.
And we have both the starter
code and the finished code.
So if you don't need to do
every step or if you get stuck,
look at the solutions.
MANORANJAN PADHY: You heard her.
You heard the links that she
said, so you check it out.
And I hope you have a
great I/O ahead, Sarah.
SARAH CLARK: Thank you.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Thank you.
