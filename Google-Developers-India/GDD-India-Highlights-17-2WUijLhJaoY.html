PANKAJ GUPTA: This is the
first GDD ever in India.
And this is the largest
developer event that Google
has held in India, ever.

SPEAKER 1: We've been living,
breathing, eating, sleeping,
and writing.
And it is the first
time the event
is happening in Bangalore.
So many of the people we
have seen on online videos,
we've seen them in person here.
That's a different
kind of a feeling.
SPEAKER 2: Well, our
purpose of being here
is to know what's next.
Firebase,
[? codename. ?] We know
that is the future that's
going to change things.
So we want to make our
developers [INAUDIBLE]
with those technologies.
Programming is
like math, that you
need to practice a lot
to gain the expertise.
SPEAKER 3: There
was a session that I
attended in the morning
which was about design.
It was new for me.
And that is how I can
improvise my work.
And then also, [INAUDIBLE]
which I didn't know.
So many things that you could
do which you didn't know.
