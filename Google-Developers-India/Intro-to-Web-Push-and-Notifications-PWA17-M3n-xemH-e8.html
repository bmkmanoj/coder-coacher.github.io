this works it's kind of interesting
because how do you build a push solution
that works across different browsers and
different platforms most push systems
that you hear of our like browser
specific or platform specific like
Apple's push notification or the Google
Cloud messaging so how do you build a
generic solution that runs across
everything so I'm actually going to hmm
oh wait I have a single screen this time
I get this one failed last time I tried
to run it but now I'm on a single screen
I can show you
so the notification generator is a tool
that lets you select various options for
a notification and let me just just come
down to the bottom and say display it
and notice a notification pops up so if
you look in your slide deck it's a
pointer to tests that petered out Sh
notification generator you can actually
play with the notification options and
see what they look like so this is the
first part now we're not yet at push
messaging this is the end of the push
cycle when you deliver the notification
to the user another way to learn about
notifications is called dev quests so
dev quests dev quests appspot.com
actually walks you through the
notification API teaching it to you one
little game at a time right so there I
just started so I can hit begin and now
it gives me the next quest that's
another way to learn notifications
so what are push notifications they
combine the notification API which you
just saw a tiny bit of notifications
with the push API the way push
notifications work is let's say you've
got a back-end server here you send a
message to an intermediate push service
now it turns out the way it works is
that there is a push service here that
is the generic push source for the web
and then it talks to individual gateways
by the manufacturer so it knows how to
do routing that goes ahead and sends the
message across to the target operating
system to the target device the OS wakes
up the service worker and delivers the
message the service worker puts up the
notification and then when the user
interacts with the notification the
service worker gets that interaction and
may in fact wake up your application a
push message will wake up the service
worker and it can bring the app up to
the front if the service worker triggers
a URL so the notification API starts
with requesting a permission so you call
request permission and it takes a
function call back that it calls you
back with the status the status is
usually granted or denied those are
short strings you must ask for
permission before you put up a
notification notifications won't be
enabled until you make this request and
get the permission from the user then to
display the notification so if the if
the permission is granted that'll stick
to the notification class then go to
your service worker get the registration
and then on the registration call show
notification so this logic typically
happens it actually typically happens
inside of the service worker the service
worker will often just call self get
registration or you can call it from the
outside but you have to have access to
the service worker
notification options that you can play
around with and those demos things like
the text the image vibration patterns so
long short long so you can actually
control the vibration long on short off
long on and then you can put a key on
your notifications and the reason you do
this is let's say that you're going to
send a whole series of notifications
from one service maybe you have a
service that you know is a home security
service so you send the notification
that Oh someone just opened the front
door when they weren't supposed to you
know now somebody has gone into your
yeah has gone into your super-secret
money room and now somebody's up in the
vault and now somebody's taking the
money out you don't need four of those
notifications you only need the latest
one like things are continuously getting
worse you just need the latest
notification so if you put a primary key
on the notification you could actually
differentiate between different
notification notifications in a series
and only show the most current one also
because there's more than one
notification on the screen at a time how
do you know which one the user clicked
you can also add notification actions
those clickable buttons at the bottom so
you define an action a keyword that
you're going to use to differentiate
these and what's the title that shows up
on the screen what's what's the button
that they're going to click so it's just
a set of options and it's just a set of
actions in the option so in this case
that's what it looks like right the two
actions that we set were Explorer and
dismiss with the with the titles go to
the site or no thank you now for the
actual interaction this is all driven by
the serviceworker so the serviceworker
will get two events it'll get either a
notification closed which means the
person basically swiped it away or did
it clear all or he'll get a notification
click and that click tells you what they
but they tapped on
handler for clothes pretty obvious get
the notification get the primary key so
you know which notification it is and in
this case we'll log it for the click
you'll get the event the notifications
action and then decide what to do with
it if action is closed then you need to
explicitly close the notification
otherwise do an activity so in this case
clients open window might be a URL into
your own app and that would wake up your
application because right now it's just
inside the service worker service
workers up but your app might be
completely out of memory might be
completely swapped out and invisible so
you need to do an open window to wake it
up so now push notifications this has
been notifications on the client side
how do we do push so it starts with a
subscription the client the on the
device you make a call the initiate the
subscription the client approves it the
user the client on your on the front end
sends starts a subscription you get back
some special data that you then need to
save at the server side because the
server is where the push messages are
coming from but the client is the thing
that collects the data that explains how
to get a message to it so you take that
token that you get that data you get on
the client side save it on the server
side on the back end and then the push
service your server sends the message
from the push service to the push
endpoint and the user's app handles it
in the service worker so the push API
first will subscribe from the page so
you check first if you have a
subscription well show you the code for
this in a minute you'll ask the user to
subscribe they'll say yes you'll send
the data to the server the server hangs
on to it so to create the subscription
the serviceworker registration has a
push manager object in it you ask that
for the subscription and then because it
returns a promise if there's no
subscription already then you ask the
user otherwise you have the subscription
just send that but send that data down
to your back-end because some of the
details may have changed every time you
ask to get the right to actually
subscribe so get the registration call
subscribe user visible only means this
has to be visible to the user it also
here's the other thing about this so
user visible only means that every push
message will generate something the user
can see if that's not true you could
send push messages with empty payloads
or data only payloads and they would get
routed to your code but never notified
to the user that's actually not
considered a best practice if you're
going to do that use background sync
instead so we get a subscription and
then we store it to the server maybe as
JSON maybe as something else now what
does that subscription object look like
it has a URL that you're going to call
to trigger the push message and it has
keys for authenticating this particular
subscription so that the server knows
who it is and whether it's valid now
what's interesting is push messages by
default are not particularly secure now
there is something we'll look at a
little bit for automatic end-to-end
encryption but we're not there quite yet
so sending from the server create the
message send it to that URL that
endpoint the endpoint picks it up
figures out which browser it is and
relays it out and then the browser
receives it so from the server now this
is an example of the web push library a
node it was written by Matt gaunt who's
one of the developer advocates easiest
way ever to send push messages across
the web define your payload define your
time to live call send notification off
you go very simple
now I talked about end-to-end encryption
and to end encryption uses vapid
voluntary application server
identification for web Bush it's
optional the idea is that you get and
you'll have to look up the actual thing
we're not going to go into all the exact
protocol details here but basically what
you do with vapid is is before you send
the push message you asked for a vapid
token which is time limited and it
includes inside of it where this is
going the audience attributes where it's
going identifies the subscriber so the
end point and it identifies the sender
so they can mutually authenticate to
each other and it has an expiration time
on it so you get end end encryption and
mutual authentication of the device and
the sender so an example of subscribing
a vapid is let's say your app server is
published it has a public key so you do
a conversion and then during the
subscription you'd include the
application server key this is on the
client side so the client gets the
public key for the the other server and
includes it in the reg on the server
side the server sets up the subject it's
public key and it's private key before
sending the message and this is used to
encrypt things correctly and to do again
the mutual authentication so it's really
pretty straightforward so the push shows
up wakes up the service worker the
service worker handles the messages and
throws up the notification so in the
service worker listen for a push event
get the text show notification so the
lab that goes with this is you're
actually going to use the notification
API to show notifications and we
actually give you a setup for doing the
push API and the push events from
node.js</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
