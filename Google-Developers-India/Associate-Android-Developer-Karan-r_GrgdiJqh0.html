JP SOUCHAK: Hello.
Karan?
KARAN: Hi.
JP SOUCHAK: Hi, I'm JP.
KARAN: Whoa.
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
KARAN: Hi, hi, hi, hi.
JP SOUCHAK: And we
wanted to present you
with this to commemorate
your certification.
You're one of the very first
associate Android developers
in the world.
KARAN: Whoa.
JP SOUCHAK: Yes.

KARAN: I started off when I
saw a lot of people in college
collected around an Android
phone and playing a game.
When I saw that a device
can bring people together
to have fun, to
learn, I thought,
why not create or use
my technical knowledge
in programming to
make this simpler,
to bring more people together,
to solve the basic problems
that I see around me?
As far as the
certification goes,
when I saw your speech and
your program during the I/O,
I was very much
impacted by what you
said about the gap
between what you learn
and what companies
desire you to know.
The certification was a
step to close this gap.
As soon as it was
launched, I was
very excited to take this
test to, first of all,
understand if I
am capable enough
to pass it, and second
of all, to see what am I
not knowing in Android.
That is why I took
the certification.
And I was very lucky among
the first people to get it.
SPEAKER 1: Tell us a bit more
about Karan's childhood, how
he was as a child.
KARAN'S MOM: He got
the best student
award in his primary section.
He was very studious,
always a rank holder.
And he was a favorite
child always in the family,
as well as in school.
The teachers, they
really appreciated him.
KARAN: She was always the first
person who saw whatever I made.
I used to take the app
and show it to her.
And I used to be like,
I have made this.
Are you able to use it?
If she says, yes, it is
somewhat understandable,
I would understand that, OK, it
can be shown to other people.
Everything that
I made first went
through this tester of mine--
[LAUGHTER]
KARAN'S MOM: Growing up, I think
I grew up with my children.
You know, I was a baby
when they were a baby.
But as they grew, I grew,
because they taught me later,
you know, how to-- what
to do with the computers
and how to go and
find on Google.
KARAN: The
agriculture sector can
be improved a lot using
Android as a solution.
Being able to connect the people
and impact them very simply
is what makes Android
development very
awarding to me.
Currently, a lot of
our farmers, they
have an Android-based phone.
And maybe having a very
simple app that tells them
that this is the soil, this is
amount of manure it requires,
and this is the amount
of water it requires,
and this is the output
you will get out of it.
The best part about being
an Android developer
is the possibility of carrying
your solutions in your pocket.
If someone asks you,
what do you do, all
you do is take out your
pocket and show them,
this is what I do.
And this is how
I solve problems.
