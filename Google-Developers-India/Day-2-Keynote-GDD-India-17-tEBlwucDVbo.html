sebastian Kaczynski Clement
namaskara Bengaluru marinum Sebastien hi
haramein Google men come Carta whoo
absolute I say ho I try to speak Hindi
actually I have to get out of my script
now because I was expecting a very mild
response sometimes I pretend I'm from
Kashmir because I have blue eyes and I
try to speak Hindi and I guess it worked
a bit today right
but let's see if you're a bit more awake
than I thought I'll stick to English if
you don't mind because Hindi is not
exactly my native language and I'll
repeat my question but this time I'm
expecting a much much louder response
from you with all the sessions yesterday
the concert the free food how good was
the day yesterday tell me all right
that's much better
Dania VAT so I'm Sebastian and I have a
very complicated complicated last name
as you can see I've been 11 years at
Google and I guess that makes me a bit
old I currently lead our developer
ecosystem teams across Asia at the
Middle East and Africa
we try to organized a very inclusive
event over these two days we have people
from all over India and even beyond
India thank you to you too coming all
the way there are men and many women in
fact GDD India is probably Google's
biggest developer event in India to date
and according to the stats according to
their stats I have received we have 36
percent of the audience who are women we
still have we still have a lot to do
thank you we still have a lot to do when
it comes to gender diversity but getting
to 36 percent at a major developer event
especially in India I think it's already
pretty good - thank you Google cares
about diversity and inclusion when we
develop products we think about the
diversity of our users wherever they are
never they are those who only use mobile
phones of those who have disabilities an
inclusion is also by respecting and
including the diversity of languages
opinions religions we want to help you
developers and startup founders to think
about how you can make your products
work for everyone or solve challenges
for different segments of the population
we also want you to think about how we
can create tech communities and
engineering environments which feel safe
for everyone today I'd like to talk to
you a little bit about engine startup
which is based out of Bangalore to
illustrate how technology can radically
improve the lives of women around the
world but especially in India not only
that but it also uses artificial
intelligence and machine learning to
come up with innovative ways of solving
a major health issue now let's start
with a number one out of four in India
one in every four women who is diagnosed
with cancer has breast cancer this is a
serious issue in fact breast cancer is
the largest cancer killer for women
today 500,000 women die every year from
it half a million every year this is one
of the leading causes of death for women
in general across the world it directly
or indirectly affects all of us we'll
have mothers wives sisters daughters
female friends so we care about them and
we love them but having cancer does not
have to be a fatality it's actually
quite often possible to heal from cancer
except in India in India one out of two
women diagnosed with breast cancer dies
within five years in the u.s. the
fatality is less than 20% in China 25
percent early detection is one of the
main reasons for the fall in mortality
rates in those countries the problem in
India is that for the majority of the
population breast cancer awareness is
almost inexistent until it's almost too
late in addition there are social
cultural and economic barriers Indians
either don't feel calm
or have preconceived notions about
breast cancer screening and this results
in most people identifying cancer at a
stage to be which is already pretty late
in terms of a stage four cancer and so
the survival rate for cancer is pretty
low compared to other countries
Narim I as a start-up based in Bangalore
Bangalore it was founded in July 2016 by
Geeta Manju not who's the CEO on the
left side and also needy matter who's
the CEO of the company and Niram is an
acronym it stands for non-invasive risk
assessment with machine learning and
artificial intelligence if I'm not
mistaken also means a painless in
Sanskrit how to be healthy so how is
Nair am i solving this problem it has
built a Diagnostics platform using
artificial intelligence to detect breast
cancer at a much earlier stage than
traditional methods or self examination
the solution is low-cost accurate
automated portable and that can be
operated by a simple clinician and in
the near future by everybody so the
startups method of screening is based on
the principle of thermography that can
detect humors five years before
mammography
or a clinical exam and then like
mammography nerim my solution is
radiation-free non touch not painful and
it works for women of all ages in case
you're not aware mammography only works
for women who are older than 40 years
old by processing thermal images and
using machine learning you can get
reliable and accurate results and the
best thing of it all it's as accurate as
mammography if not better now this
unique solution can be used as a cancer
diagnosis test in hospitals to prevent
an early detect cancer but also to
deploy this large scale across rural
areas neuromas innovative approach
provides accurate non-invasive and
privacy secure detection to breast
cancer and that will help to identify
the disease early in the process
Nonnie ramai has also been accepted at
Google developers Launchpad accelerator
program now once it alone what is
Launchpad accelerator it's a six month
acceleration program that matches top
startups from emerging countries with
the best of Google our people our
network our technologies to help scale
great products now we're very excited to
see how we can help near a my scale
they're fascinating solution and now and
it was not completely expected I'd like
to invite the CEO and co-founder of near
my on stage because she drove all the
way to be with us today now please give
a warm welcome to dr. Geetha mantra not
hi good morning morning so let's have a
seat thank you for being with us today
thank you I have a few questions for you
yeah now what or who inspired you to
create this startup just about a year
ago the key installations really about
how technology can make a difference so
in fact in my family very close cousin
party and Lakshmi had this horrendous
disease in their foot and I lost them
before they were even 40 so with that as
a background in my mind I was just
thinking how can we help detect cancer
Enya as early as possible so that the
number of deaths can be minimal
only cancer that can be cured completely
and as a researcher in data analytics
lab at Xerox started working on this
problem and we got excellent results in
terms of pure consonants that you know
we were able to try and address the
biggest problem in women's health today
now you have a very ambitious plan
what's next with nearby what's on the
roadmap sure so right now we have the
solution available in a few hospitals in
Bangalore we are starting to do some
more our critical trials and where are
the promising hospitals now we want to
sort of expand in India and beyond
create scalable solutions where we can
make sure that data collected is really
accurate there are good procedures in
place so that you know there are no
errors that is coming up we can train
the patients train the technicians so
that you know they can collect the data
well and then rest is done in the cloud
so it's just about how we get the data
in so that is the sort of main thing
that we are looking at right now
now you gotta accept it as I mentioned
to people developers Launchpad
accelerator program why did you apply to
it what are you expecting from it we're
very privileged and
very very happy that we are part of the
Google Launchpad program and looking
forward to the exciting time of learning
so really this solution can be used by
everyone right you know we are also
creating a very small handheld kind of
our solutions can be used by every
gynecologist every physician to treat
the lady that is coming in this the
scalability is very very key and so who
else but the IT giant can help us cerise
the scale so we are looking forward to
ml and the crowd I'm getting guidance
from Google right here now to inspire
you and because you're a good observer
of challenges what problem do you face
every day in your life that you think
nobody has solved today and maybe
someone here the audience can try and
solve it in the months to come
yeah so maybe for the last 25 years you
know we have looked at several problems
in my IT career but as Mira my what the
problem I'm trying to see is unsolved is
how do we convince people that AI really
works right so in whatever problem you
are taking you are dealing with domain
experts doctors in our case right so if
you put a machine and say it can do as
at least 90% as well as you doctors how
do we convince them right so that is the
sort of major challenge every day we are
facing through additional clinical
validation and so on so whatever problem
you pick try and see how do we prove
that it is actually working right so put
test cases and trials in place so that
you know it is actually proving what the
decision-making is working right so
that's mainly what's different when you
actually look at a I am l fired solution
what's the best advice you can give to
developers yeah so if you believe in a
passionate idea if you believe there is
an idea that you know you think it will
work
don't let somebody else try it because
only you know the complete you know
undertakings and sort of issues that may
come in and so on so pick it up go for
it you will be able to solve there will
be several challenges
you will be the only one who knows how
to handle those challenges right if you
believe in an idea go for it create a
startup it's really worth it this will
be my final question do you have a quote
you live your life by or maybe something
you think of often or a book that is a
reference to you yeah so I get
influenced by Indian spirituality and
all that quite a bit so two things I
believe in one is learn everyday right
you know keep looking out for small
pieces of advice be it from your
neighbor be it from your boss buuuut
from your own small kid whatever right
so keep learning everyday be open to
learning
second thing is especially when you're
in the turf right when things are not
going well everything happens for good
whatever happens is for good so I keep
thinking like that okay if I'm here
there's something that's coming up later
so that keeps us going so these two
things the what just makes me run thank
you thank you very much for sharing all
these bits of wisdom thank you very much
for coming today and now we're gonna
hear about inclusive design how you can
design products with inclusion in mind
so Maya Subramanyam is an engineering
director at YouTube she's also been at
Google for 11 years and she will talk
about inclusive design with many
interesting funny sometimes surprising
examples so I'd like you to welcome on
stage Samia
Thank You Sebastian it's great being
back in India I was bought I was born in
Chennai and did my high school in
Calcutta and was fortunate to grow up in
different parts of the world including
Lagos Nigeria so to be here today
presenting inclusive design and how we
can build products for all including
emerging markets like India and Nigeria
is really exciting as Sebastian said I'm
from YouTube and you'll be seeing a lot
of videos in my presentation today let's
get started with one can we roll the
video please me love rewind
taking strangers now it's for
and it goes like
you wanna change the world
like the ceiling
this is a clip from one of my all-time
favorite YouTube rewind videos as it
captures the essence of YouTube YouTube
started with a very simple mission
broadcast yourself and has grown into a
global platform with global reach we
have over 1 and a half billion users
visiting YouTube every month with over
80% of our views coming from outside the
United States YouTube is an open and
democratic platform with over 400 hours
of videos uploaded every minute by
creators all around the world making
YouTube the platform with the most
diverse content in the time that it took
me to say this whole sentence almost a
day's worth of videos have been uploaded
to YouTube YouTube unlike traditional
media has no gatekeepers anyone can have
a voice and reach an audience while this
is still very true about YouTube few
years ago when I was looking at some
usage data on YouTube I realized as our
platform and usage have grown human
dynamics and unconscious biases are
creeping in so on YouTube too we see
biases and gender gaps for instance
similar to traditional media for
instance a lot of our fashion content is
created by female creators and a lot of
our stem and science content by male
creators this insight drove me to start
a pitch and a dialogue within YouTube
and across Google about diversity in the
context of product design and how
unconscious biases are playing into our
products so what of YouTube in addition
to optimizing for watch time became more
intentional about a demographic goal
such as gender reach or
nough City reach on our platform this
would open up opportunities for us to
deepen engagement and onboard more users
onto the platform thereby driving growth
for the first time we expanded
conversations around diversity at Google
from diversity in hiring and building
balanced teams to diversity being a
critical factor in defining or product
strategies and growth strategies so what
is inclusive design it's about
engineering products for all your target
users across all demographics broadening
your demographic reach helps unlock
opportunities that will drive growth for
you
inclusive design is not just about user
experience or visual design it's also
about the algorithms and machine
learning about testing and training data
about how you brand your product the
marketing the PR and more it's about
asking the question for which of my
target users can I be doing more for it
can be in the form of gender reach it
could also be that your product works
great when you have good connectivity
but not so well when you're in the
developing world it could be about
optimizing your experiences to deepen
engagement with a certain cultural group
we as an industry have been doing
inclusive design for years now in the
form of accessibility work and this is
about expanding that across other
dimensions for instance when air bags
first came out they caused more deaths
and injuries in women and children why
because air bags were tested with only
tall male crash-test dummies where the
engineers who design
change this test program and plan sexist
no it was their unconscious biases that
informed their approach female drivers
tend to have a smaller build and in
real-world crashes have a 47% higher
chance of fatal injuries once the
automobile industry realized this and
incorporated women into their design and
started using female crash-test dummies
safety of airbags improved significantly
for women and not just for women but for
anyone with a smaller build so this is a
great example of gender-based inclusive
design kids are still an underserved
market here and an opportunity for them
for this next example I would like to
start by rolling a video my coworker
Wanda and I are sitting in front of an
HP media smart computer as opposed to
follow me as I move I'm black I think my
blackness is interfering with the
computer's ability to to follow me so
she moved this way and a camera followed
me
and then he'd get into the screen all
over these completely stable
no face recognition anymore buddy anyone
know what's happening for this we need
to go back to the 1950s when Kodak
dominated color photography and
introduced the original surely color
cart that has become a standard in
photography but has one problem it works
better with lighter skin tones so what
this means is you often have exposure
issues when taking multiracial photos
this became a big problem in the 1970s
when chocolate makers and wood
manufacturers they're having a hard time
creating advertising material because it
was hard to capture the different shades
of Browns and their products and also as
the film and media industry was starting
to become more diverse finally in the
1990s a group of engineers decided to
take an inclusive design approach and
introduced multiracial color cards to
help bridge this gap while it improved a
lot there is still a slight light scan
bias and I'm really proud to say that at
Google the camera team has taken a
proactive inclusive design approach to
help bridge this let's see a video of
what the team has done let's roll the
video please pictures tell stories it
doesn't really matter if it's a selfie
or if it's a portrait that somebody is
taking of another person you are sharing
in that human moment
let's take a picture you too one two
three
oh he's too dark so this is where the
discussion started if you just use my
phone it's got a better sensor better
sensor but what does that even mean
color tuning is an extremely complicated
process when we look at images what we
try to do is figure out how much of a
difference there is between let's say a
reference image and the image that we
actually are trying to quantify we were
running some tests on a product and it
was the proximity sensor we were testing
and we said oh it looks like it does 60
centimeters and we look to each other
and go we're both white the technology
itself as many people will say is not
racist it's just that it wasn't tested
properly to make sure that the designers
weren't unconsciously biased hey there's
an entire world out there and we want to
make sure this works for everybody
I love the fact that we get to influence
cameras that we get to share those
experiences of life and emotion to me
that is what imaging is about it is a
vehicle to express humanity take a
picture of you two
two three thank you how many of you know
of Cheetos again like them most of the
room I like them too did you know when
Cheetos first came out they were only
available in one flavor
the original cheese flavor until a
janitor who worked for the company
started adding chili and lime to his
packets of Cheetos because he was Latino
and liked the flavor of that his friends
and family took to it too so he decided
to pitch an idea of introducing this new
flavor to the CEO of the company who
actually listened to the janitor and
experimented thereby unlocking new
markets every time I told the story
people want to know what happened to the
janitor he is now the senior executive
at the company a true rags to riches
story and more importantly a great case
of culture based inclusive design this
next example is near and dear to me it's
from YouTube few years ago we wanted to
increase engagement off YouTube with
kids and families so we brought kids
into our UX labs to see how they use
YouTube so this is what we normally see
this is how kids see it they only care
about the content on the screen and
nothing else and that is when we
realized to increase engagement with
kids and families we have to reimagine
YouTube from the ground up build a
special app just for them and that's how
the YouTube kids app was born the
YouTube kids app provides an easy-to-use
engaging and enriching experience for
kids and families through a combination
of several user experience and
interaction innovations and also a lot
of back-end
algorithmic and classification work that
we did this is a great example of age
based inclusive design and it also
showcases that sometimes to meet the
needs of specific target groups like
demographic groups you may have to build
something special just for them I wanted
to roll a video to show the original
launch video of YouTube kids
okay so do you want to tell a story yeah
oh my gosh no it's no everything is
popping into my brain okay um once upon
a time it was a boy named Alex three
sisters a bunny to Train he got pardon a
bubble and then he was floating around
he went to France and then he sees
Dracula a few ghosts in Frankenstein and
then the robot came and ate the whole
town and everyone ran like crazy and
then they had to destroy the world while
that was doing sex I put it on the Sun
like so because since the Sun is made of
gas it couldn't eat anything there
got surprised him and he jumped back and
popped the bubble and he fell and it's
really weird
how many of you use emojis most of you
you're not alone 90% of the world's
online population uses emojis well there
are many to choose from
they're fairly stereotypical like this
is how boys are men are portrayed
and this is our typically women or girls
are portrayed to bridge this gap and to
inspire young girls Google has
introduced a whole new range of emojis
representing men and women in different
roles in different skin and hair colors
to be more inclusive and this is now
becoming an industry-wide standard with
iOS Facebook Twitter and others
embracing these again a great case of
gender-based and ethnicity based
inclusive design how many of you are
familiar with harassment of women in
online gaming communities any gamers and
the audience I see a few so then it was
it's been a big problem into himself
female gamers and how hashtags and
online commenting is used to harass them
and many of you might have heard of
gamergate as well few years ago we
organized a women at YouTube hackathon
around the theme of bridging the gender
gap to bring around organic thinking and
momentum around inclusive design one of
the salient projects in this hackathon
focused on improving our Comment system
on YouTube to help them in combat
harassment and feel safer on YouTube as
a result of this hackathon project we've
released a lot of features and
enhancements to our Commons moderation
tools providing a lot more control to
creators to handle these a great example
of gender-based inclusive design
helping us deepen our engagement with
our female creators and also shows you
that grassroots momentum can be built
using things like hackathon to bring
about change YouTube go how many of you
use it some few years ago we realized
that emerging markets had their own
specific needs with connectivity and
bandwidth issues many of you I'm sure
have experienced the spinning wheel when
watching videos waiting for it to load I
see some nods and smiles also
socioeconomic factors not many are had
the latest smartphones and have hardware
constraints and also localization of the
content to make it more interesting for
the local audience to bridge these gaps
we build from the ground up YouTube's
goal that provides localized experiences
and also focuses on offline first and is
very bandwidth sensitive giving users a
lot more control and transparency over
how data is used within the app so now
I've shown you several examples of
inclusive design across different
industries many from YouTube and Google
to and I want to switch to talking about
how can we do inclusive design at scale
and how can you become more proactive
and inclusive Design Thinking rather
than reactive after the fact at Google
these are the different phrases typical
faces of product development that we
have and we are starting to become more
intentional about demographic goals at
every face of product development so
starting from the idea and target user
definition we are looking at our metrics
and the business opportunities to
understand what demographic gaps are
there within our target user segments
and which one should we prioritize to
try and fix and bridge so as a part of
target user definition for instance in
addition to saying we are targeting
users 18 to 34 of age we say 18 to 34
with equal representation of men and
women once we pick the demographic goal
in that target your third definition
phase we carry it through rest of the
phases of product development in testing
whether we are selecting users for user
research or usability testing or running
live experiments and monitoring how the
metrics are moving when you roll out new
features new changes or internal dog
food testing making sure that our dog
food users are representative of the
target users we're trying to go after a
lot of what we do at Google is also
about machine learning and algorithms
and you might be wondering how can
machines be biased they can be because
the training data that goes with them
have biases on a roll of video from the
machine learning team explaining the
different kinds of biases that you want
to watch out for let's roll the video
let's play a game close your eyes and
picture a shoe okay
did anyone picture this this how about
this
we may not even know why but each of us
is biased toward one shoe over the
others now imagine that you're trying to
teach a computer to recognize a shoe you
may end up exposing it to your own bias
that's how bias happens in machine
learning but first what is machine
learning
well it's used in a lot of technology we
use today machine learning helps us get
from place to place gives us suggestions
translate stuff even understands what
you say to it how does it work
with traditional programming people hand
code the solution to a problem step by
step with machine learning computers
learn the solution by finding patterns
and data so it's easy to think there's
no human bias and that just because
something is based on data doesn't
automatically make it neutral even with
good intentions it's impossible to
separate ourselves from our own human
biases so our human biases become part
of the technology we create in many
different ways there's interaction bias
like this recent game where people were
asked to draw shoes for the computer
most people drew ones like this so as
more people interacted with the game the
computer didn't even recognize these
latent bias for example if you were
training a computer on what a physicist
looks like and you're using pictures of
past physicists your algorithm will end
up with a latent bias skewing towards
men and selection bias say you're
training a model to recognize faces
whether you grab images from the
internet or your own photo library are
you making sure to select photos that
represent everyone since some of our
most advanced products use machine
learning we've been working to prevent
that technology from perpetuating
negative human bias from tackling
offensive or clearly misleading
information from appearing at the top of
your search results page to adding a
feedback tool in the search bar so
people can flag hateful or inappropriate
autocomplete suggestions
it's a complex issue and there's no
magic bullet but it starts with all of
us being aware of it so we can all be
part of the conversation because
technology should work for everyone and
finally once a product is built it's
important to the branding the marketing
videos fee are even the support that you
offer are tailored to echo the
demographic goals that you set for
inclusive design to really work within
your companies it's still very important
to make sure you have diverse
perspectives and you have balanced teams
that you've built up and foster an
inclusive culture so to this end the
Google computer science education and
media efforts is increasing access to
technology education around the world to
diverse populations it's raising
awareness of unconscious biases and
unconscious bias trainings and also
changing the portrayal of engineers in
the media because this can be an
extremely powerful influencer this next
video I'm on a roll will show you some
of the work we've been doing in
partnership with the media companies
when I think of the lack of diversity in
Hollywood and the lack of inclusion I
figure if I'm not part of the solution
then I'm part of the problem
when I meet students who look like me I
see their eyes light up when they learn
that I'm an engineer
the most rewarding aspect of this work
is showing girls that they don't have to
choose between computer science and
their passions computer science is
really just a tool for what they love
computer can do anything
this one searches for signs of life in
outer space
growing up I was so good at math and
science but I didn't feel like I could
pursue a career in steam because I
didn't see anyone who looked like me
doing it especially not on TV
Google funded Geena Davis inclusion
potions shows that even when women are
weeds in film they still received three
times less screen and speaking time than
their male counterparts
the only way to find a source address is
to access or analyze the data from
packets and is broadcast we want
technology to look fun accessible and
common as something to do for girls or
as some would say normal because it is
I'm here because I want the billions of
women and girls all over the world to
know it can be literally anything you
want to be our cs immediate team strives
to change the narrative of computer
science for people of color the lgbtqia+
community people with disabilities all
aspiring youth so they can finally see
the reflections in the media as a woman
of color and a mom I want my kids to
know they can pursue any career
regardless of gender or race yes
absolutely if the platform doesn't exist
we need to create it Google is in a
unique position to work with partners to
provide students with access to
technology and empower them to be
creators it is so cool to see their
minds filled with possibilities
so now it comes to you all hopefully
I've inspired you about why it's
important to do proactive inclusive
design thinking and I want to leave you
with a little bit of a cheat sheet of
what you can do when you go back to your
offices or colleges so think about the
demographic gaps that are there see how
you can measure it and have metrics to
go with it
prioritize which gaps you want to go
after solving bridge them and celebrate
your success also foster an inclusive
