mondo today who is the Google developer
expert for user experience so huh
what is UX according to you so UX is as
you know that user experience it's about
understanding the need the basic goal
that they want to achieve and helping
them achieve that goal as simple as that
recently Arab got featured on the Play
Store so what are your tips for other
app developers the first thing is do a
lot of user research understand their
backgrounds their motivations why they
are installing your app in the first
place and then build something for that
after that once you've understood that
you have tested that then some usability
testing then follow guidelines eye
guidelines make your life easier
follow material design guidelines and
other guidelines that's how my app got
feature in the Play Store what are the
tips you would like to give for people
for building for rural India the
challenges in rural India are completely
different
you have to first of all localize the
application right there's so many
languages in India it's very important
that you localize the app and make it
very very accessible
apart from that make sure that the
gestures and icons and the overall
application is very very localized so
people are not used to spying because
that's the first computing device so
make sure that you are building
something that they understand and
finally make sure that you're doing
usability testing that they are able to
achieve the task right in any kind of
faculties so that's very very important
so with all of this you I'm sure you'll
be able to make a great application for
the whole of India you are a be Laroy
community organizers what is it that
motivates you to give your skills and
expertise back to the community I've
been part of this community for since
2009 and initially it was just a member
I used to go to meetups I still learn so
much so meet so many interesting people
such a great experience that you learn
something you meet people and then you
want to kind of give back to it because
it's so good I've learned so much from
it's only fair that I give it back
that's that's my motivation
thanks for joining us today swamp and if
you have got any thoughts or questions

will actually try to get so home to
answer them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
