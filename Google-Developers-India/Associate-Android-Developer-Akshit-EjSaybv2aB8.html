and we went to first to present you the
memory of the associate recertification
absolutely one of the first ones so I
give you that first and see if maybe we
take a few minutes and don't you it
great all right thank you yeah
my journey started when my father bought
a new Android phone in the family
I started playing games on it exploring
apps on it so it really was fascinated
about how such small apps can bring so
much changes in their human's lives then
I started an offline course as a
Institute named CMC it was about Android
and a little bit of Java when I got out
of the CMC Institute it was always like
I was missing something in my Android
world so I really wanted to know more
then I got to serve the Internet so I
got to the developer sites of Android I
learned about Udacity from there it
actually gave me a really really good
boost it showed me how I can use my
Android knowledge I can use my time to
develop better apps
I was midway through the course when I
heard about the Android certification
program I guess it was announced in
Google I was 16 so I also watched about
it and it was really a promising option
like Google releasing a certificate it
will be a very good thing for me in the
future so I took the exam I passed the
exam and also I guess there was an exit
interview which really asked me about
the stuff what you have learned it was
really good so after the exam I
completed my nano degree so when you
journey towards becoming a developer
with any obstacles or challenges you
have to overcome yeah I guess I always
face challenges when I'm developing apps
making some good UI for the app is
always been challenging for me I just to
get more users to use your app we have
to make a good do you iack make a good
impression on our user it takes some
time but yeah I always solved my
challenges somehow no that's great you
found you ways to overcome I keep
working I keep trying pretty much
developing almost every day I take my
laptop and do some coding on it
I mean open I understood you and make
better for the people and of course that
will lead you to a better job
