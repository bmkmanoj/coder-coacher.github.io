AMRIT SANJEEV: Hi, everyone.
We're here with
Jenny Gove, who's
a lead UX researcher at Google.
Hi, Jenny.
How has been your
experience with GDD so far?
JENNY GOVE: Today
has been wonderful.
There's been so much
interest and attention
from the developer
community here in India.
And what's really inspired
me is the interest
that people have had in design.
We've had a whole
series of design talks,
and they've all been
really well-attended.
AMRIT SANJEEV: Well, can
you tell us a little more
about your session?
JENNY GOVE: Sure.
So my session is on
designing for mobile.
And it's about putting
mobile in context.
We're talking about designing
for native apps, as well
as progressive web apps, so
sort of the next instantiation
of mobile web.
And we're also talking
about principles of design
for navigation and flow.
So we get lots of tips and
hints on how to create good user
experiences in mobile.
AMRIT SANJEEV: That's
so interesting.
So in case somebody
missed one of these,
what are the things
that they could do?
JENNY GOVE: So there
are sets of principles
that can be followed.
So these are principles
for the mobile web,
principles for
native apps, and also
principles for
retail that was based
on a study that looked at both
native apps and mobile web
as well.
In addition, we talk
about how important
it is to conduct your
own user research
and to really get
to know your users.
So we provide ideas for
different methodologies
and different types
of user research
that you should be conducting
as you develop your app.
AMRIT SANJEEV: Thank you, Jenny.
JENNY GOVE: Thank you.
AMRIT SANJEEV: And don't
forget to check out her talk.
