AMRIT SANJEEV: So
today we are here
with Lukas, who is a product
manager for the architecture
components.
Welcome, Lukas.
LUKAS BERGSTROM: Hi.
Nice to talk to you.
AMRIT SANJEEV: Thank you.
So tell us a little bit about
architecture components.
LUKAS BERGSTROM: So with
architecture components,
we listened to
developers that said
that it can be
challenging sometimes
to deal with the
lifecycles of Android apps,
and particularly with us
not giving a lot of guidance
about how to do core
app architecture.
And so we're launching
two sets of things.
And one is some components
that help deal with things
like let me build components
that are lifecycle aware,
that don't need to be managed
by the fragmented activity.
Let's make it easier
to do object storage.
So let's build a really
lightweight wraparound SQLite
to do that.
And then let's
have an easier way
to hold data for
activities or fragments
in a way that's going to survive
across configuration changes
but not leak memory.
And so, as well
as the components,
we're also launching guidance
around a recommended app
architecture that ties
them all together--
so a way to build apps that's
really modular, testable, very
robust, but is also
just very clean
and will result in writing
less code than you did before.
AMRIT SANJEEV: So where can
developers go and find more
about this?
LUKAS BERGSTROM:
So we have a site
at developer.android.com/arch.
There you'll find
samples, code labs,
really good documentation,
the Guide to App Architecture.
And you're not required
to move all your apps over
to this if you don't want to.
The components are
very mix and match.
And none of this is required.
But we do recommend
that, if you're not
100% happy with your
app architecture,
or maybe you're starting
a new project, definitely,
we think this stuff is
really, really great.
You should check it out.
And even if you're 100%
happy with your app,
we recommend reading our
Guide to App Architecture
because it has principles that
we think apply to all apps.
So investigate it.
Check it out.
Use what you want.
Ignore what you don't like.
But we think everyone
should just check out
at least the guide
because it has
just really useful principles.
AMRIT SANJEEV:
And once you build
something really
interesting, do let
us know so that we can
actually take a look at that.
Thank you.
