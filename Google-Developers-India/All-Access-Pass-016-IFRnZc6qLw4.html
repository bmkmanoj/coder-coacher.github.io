MRIDULA MALLYA: Hi, everyone.
We have with us today
Lakshya Sivaramakrishnan,
who is the program coordinator
for Women Techmakers in India.
So can you tell us a little
about the Women Techmakers
program?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN: Yeah.
So, Women Techmakers
is a global program.
So what we aim to do is provide
visibility, provide resources,
provide a platform for
people to interact together.
Actually give them a community
where like-minded individuals
actually share goals of tech.
We're looking at developers,
we're looking at designers,
we're looking at entrepreneurs.
All these are our core audience.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK.
And as a program
coordinator, what
is your role in this program?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
My whole goal
is to work with WTM leads across
the cities, to enable them
and empower them in terms
of what resources they want,
what support they want.
And actually, reaching
out to so many women
in technology in India,
often we see that they're not
aware of certain things.
So our goal is actually to
reach out to them in the best
possible way we can.
MRIDULA MALLYA: So,
so we just wanted
to know, what is the scenario
of women in tech, in India?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN: It
is picking up truly rapidly.
Baseline numbers say it's
about 12% to 15% today,
that we have women
in tech in events,
in our community meet-ups.
What we're actually
aiming, is to ensure
that we have a very
gender-neutral event audience.
And that's what we're
striving of in all
of our programs and campaigns.
MRIDULA MALLYA: The women
who are watching today--
so if they want to be
part of this program,
how do they become
part of this program,
and what are the benefits of
being part of this program?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN: How
they can actually be a part
of this program is go
to www.womentechmak
ers.com/membership.
They can enroll for membership.
They'll be asked for questions
like their career level,
their skills, their interests.
And what we do is
we ensure that we
give good curated content to
them, based on their needs,
and based on their skills.
MRIDULA MALLYA: If
there's one message
you could give to all the women
in tech, what would that be?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Be bold,
and do not be scared to
ask for what you want.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK.
That's awesome.
So, if you have any questions or
queries for Lakshya, or for any
of us, please write it down
in the comments section below,
and we will try to
get it answered.
And you can also reach
out to us at our Twitter
handle-- that is
@GoogleDevsIndia or
@WomenTechmakers, and we'll
definitely get back to you.
Thank you, Lakshya,
for joining us.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Thank you so much.
My pleasure.
