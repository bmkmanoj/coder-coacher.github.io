gonna learn how to take a website and
make it into a progressive web app using
work box the only thing you guys need
today is node because work box is a node
module and if you guys already have node
version 611 I think is the lowest
version that you would need then you're
good and if not will help you guys
install node during the lab portion
basically what's going to happen if you
guys have been in the other sessions I'm
gonna talk for a little bit about some
work box concepts and then you guys will
get to try it out for yourselves with a
code lab and then I'll talk again you
guys will code some more and if we have
time at the end we'll do questions and
stuff that's nice
what we're gonna do today or what you
guys are going to do today hopefully is
make an offline capable web app so I
have written a really simple fake news
app and you guys are going to make it so
it has an offline home screen and so
that it caches articles as a user visits
them and so that it has an offline 404
and rather a custom offline and a custom
404 page so let's start with the
simplest situation and we'll move to a
more advanced situation from there the
first and most simple situation is if
you have a static site so that means
your assets don't change that much for
different users and you're not doing a
lot of dynamic like third-party api's or
anything like that in that case I would
tell you that pre caching is a super
powerful strategy that you guys should
be using and if you guys are familiar
with free caching what that is
essentially is the the first time the
user visits your device or sorry your
site you can pre cache all of your sites
assets on their device and that way as
they navigate through your app or if
they reload your app at a later time all
of your assets are already locally on
the device and it's really fast it
doesn't have to go to the network and it
will work offline
which would be great if you were stuck
somewhere like GDD india and the Wi-Fi
was really
so let's look for those that are
unfamiliar how that looks in adjust the
basic Service Worker API you guys may
have seen this in a previous talk but
essentially what we would do if we had a
simple site with some HTML CSS and
JavaScript we would create a version
cache so here I'm specifying a version
number and then I'm have a list of all
of my apps resources and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to have a listener
for an install event that event fires
the first time a user visits your site
and then during that install event I'm
going to open this version cache or
created if it doesn't exist and I'm
going to put all of those those
resources in this list into that cache
this is going to be super cool and great
unless you ever change your app right so
if you make a change to one of your
files or you add new files to your site
you're gonna have to come back and
manually update this list which is going
to get really annoying really quickly
and also if you have routing of some
kind for example slash and index.html
both serve index.html but the cache API
doesn't know that so you would have to
manage multiple URLs for the same
resource updating is gonna be a pain and
you guys might imagine what I would
recommend to you if you run into this
problem workbox
so like I said earlier at the simplest
level work box is a better way to make
service workers I think of work box
personally as two parts the first part
is a library that abstracts common
patterns that you would implement
yourself in the serviceworker and the
second part is it allows you to make
service workers part of your build
process let's look at that in a little
more detail so rather than writing a
Service Worker by hand like I showed you
in that first example what you would do
is you would write a source service
worker and then you have some kind of
configuration file and work box would
use that configuration file and take
that source service worker and generate
a production Service Worker for you so
for this session we're going to use work
box seoi which is just a straight
command line version of work box but
it's also available in web
and gulp and grunt and all the popular
build tools and it's the same exact
process so let's go back to that first
example of pre-caching some some static
assets for our site and look at what
that would look like with work box the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to import the work box library
that's the thing that lets us abstract
common patterns then we're going to
instantiate it so now the work box SW
variable represents our work box library
and has access to all its methods and
the only method we're going to call for
now is the pre cache method which takes
it in a list of files to pre cache which
is starting to sound really similar to
how we had it before but as you'll
notice there's no files in this so we're
actually going to let workbox generate
the files for us and that way we don't
have to manually update them if we
change our Adam so to tell workbox how
to or rather what files we want to pre
cache
we're going to configure it and that's
going to be done with this configuration
file work box seoi config is the first
few lines of this configuration are just
going to tell work box where our source
service worker file is that's the one I
showed you with the empty precache call
and then where we would like work box to
output our production service worker wot
file the file that's going to get built
the next thing we specify is where the
files are that we want to pre cache so
in this case I'm looking in the build
directory for JavaScript CSS and data
files in the static directory or images
in the priority directory this way we
don't have to manually add files to our
list to be pre cached but workbox will
actually go into our directory structure
and look for them for us and we can use
glob patterns to just map to a whole
bunch of files without having to add
each one and the final configuration
we're going to have is this template or
URL properties which is going to solve
the routing issue that I mentioned
earlier so rather than having to manage
a resource URL for each resource in our
cache we can just tell work box what
urls map to what resources so in this
case
I'm just saying hey work box if the user
requests / basically they want
index.html once we run work box from our
command line or whatever build tool you
guys use you're going to get the
outputted version the production service
worker file it looks exactly like the
first file I showed up there except now
the pre-cast call has been populated
with our list of urls so now this looks
really similar to what we had in the
first example except we didn't have to
add any of these files in ourselves so
now when we change our app all we need
to do is rebuild it in addition we've
got this revision property which is a
hash of your files and what this is
going to let workbox do is intelligently
update the cache in the browser so when
your user visits your site work box can
use this hash to see what files are
outdated
and replace them with the newest files
and that way you don't have to manually
keep track of what files the user has it
doesn't have and you don't have to clean
out old caches all right now we're going
to allegedly start the lab section we
had planned on having a USB drives for
everyone but it seems like those have
kind of wandered off throughout the day
so we're going to try and just clone the
lab I guess normally let me skip to that
since we're missing this if you go to
these lab instructions at this short
length in your browser you'll see the
lab instructions and it will tell you
how to clone the repo for the code and
then to install node if you don't have
it I'm gonna walk around and help you
get set up
so hopefully you guys can see that work
Hawks is makes updating much easier but
pre-caching isn't the only thing that
you can do with work box and it's not
the only strategy that's going to work
for you guys so if you guys have a
dynamic application that doesn't just
have static resources right maybe you're
using third-party api's or you're
serving different content to different
users and you don't know what resources
they're going to look at ahead of time
work box has built-in caching strategies
for runtime caching a lot of you guys if
you went past step seven I think it was
you started to see that there are routes
you can establish for runtime caching so
we're going to talk about that now work
box has a lot of strategies built into
it they're kind of self-explanatory but
I'll go through them so let's just look
at this network for its first strategy
so a network for strategy at a high
level would be basically server the
serviceworker is configured such that
it's going to try to get your resource
from the network first and if it can't
then it would grab that resource from
the cache so this should be in the lab
and it would make sense for something
like a news app right where you want to
serve ideally the most up-to-date news
articles that you have but if you can't
because the user doesn't have network
connectivity then at least you could
serve some kind of older article that
had been previously cached and maybe you
could put some kind of toast or a modal
or something on the screen saying hey
you're looking at older content but at
least at least you have some content to
look at there's also stale while we
validate as another example this
strategy basically serves from the cache
media Lisa so as soon as something is
requested the service worker returns it
from the cache and then in the
background the service worker goes to
the network and gets the newest resource
and updates the cache with that so this
would be useful if you have something
like a user avatar that doesn't need to
be up-to-date but you want to serve it
really quickly so it's served the user
avatar right away lightning fast and
then in the background it would update
so next time they refresh or the next
time they navigate through the app
they'll see their newest one and finally
cash first we'll look at this in a
little more detail but as you guys can
kind of imagine like Network first this
strategy configures the serviceworker to
look in the cache first and if there's
nothing in the cache then go to the
network so this might be useful for
static resources in your site that don't
change that much maybe you have like an
about me page or a contact me page that
is pretty much always the same you might
as well just cache that and let the
serviceworker give that to the user
right away we'll look at that in a
little more detail for images which is
something you guys could use in like a
news app for example like the one in the
lab this is the high level code here and
what we're going to do is we're going to
register a route so that's step 7 I
think a lot of you guys have done that
but registering a route essentially is
you're going to tell the serviceworker
that when this particular resource is
requested I want you to do the following
thing so in more detail we're going to
use the register route method of the
serviceworker
router class and the first argument for
this method is basically the pattern
that you want to match the route against
so in this case I'm using a regular
expression for anything that ends in PNG
so this is gonna basically any time I
request an image the serviceworker is
going to see this is a route for images
I'm gonna do the following thing and the
following thing is specified in this
second argument this would be your
handler so here we're going to just use
work boxes cash first handler as part of
the strategies class and that's going to
basically implement the cache first
strategy for us so we don't have to
write any logic to say go to the cache
first and if it's not in the cache go to
the network you don't have to write any
of that you just throw in service
workers built-in caching strategy
further we can configure the caching
strategy so here we're just doing some
simple stuff like creating a name for
the cache this is just gonna name the
cache whatever you want but we can also
do more powerful stuff like set expert
properties so in this case I'm setting a
maximum entry maximum number of entries
as 10 so the service worker will only
cash up to ten PM G's and any new ones
after that will cause the oldest PNG to
get cleared out from the cache and this
allows you to make sure you're not over
filling your users device with resources
so you got you guys concede that you can
cash resources dynamically at runtime
for example images or in the lab
articles as users visiting them which is
super cool but you can also do this for
third-party resources so work box
supports cores which if you guys are
unfamiliar at a high level browsers
implement a single words and policy and
if you guys have ever tried to fetch
cross-origin resource from JavaScript
you'll notice that sometimes you get
errors and the browser won't let you do
that that's security policy and cores
basically allows you to do that if
you're a third party server is
configured for it but a lot of servers
still don't have that configured so
we'll look at an example of how work box
gets around that so here we're
registering a route just like I showed
you with pngs but now we're using a
third-party resource of font and this is
for google fonts which I imagine
implement scores on their servers but if
we pretend they don't we can look at how
that would work so we're going to use
the cache for strategy just like we did
in the PNG example and we're gonna use
the configuration properties for the
name of the cache and the number of
entries just like I did last time but
now we're also going to set a cashable
response property and here we're going
to pass in the status codes that were
willing to cache so 200 of course is
just a regular good response but zero is
a response you would get if you request
a cross-origin resource and the server
that you're requesting it from is not
configured to serve cross-origin
resources so basically it's a lot of
fancy stuff if you don't know about
cores but the moral of the story is you
can cache third-party resources with
work box and serve them in your site but
cookie cutter strategies like these like
the drag-and-drop cash first strategy or
network for a strategy isn't always
going to work for you
you might want more complex logic and
work box that supports this as well so
this is going to be the hardest slide by
far but basically I'll walk you through
it step by step so what we're doing at a
high level is we're going to register
another route just like we did in the
previous examples in this case we're
registering a route for articles in the
pages directory and for the handler
instead of passing in a default ander
like work box cash first or work box on
network first we're going to grab the
network first handler as a variable and
we're going to configure it just like
we've done before and then what we're
going to pass in to our handler for this
route is the handle method of that
caching strategy that's the method that
actually does the heavy lifting that's
what implements the logic of deciding
what to return whether it's from the
cache or the network etc so for the
network first strategy that we're using
here it's going to try to go to the
network and if it doesn't have access to
the network it's going to return
something in the cache and if we did get
something we're just going to return it
like we normally would but we've added
some additional logic here such that if
we don't get a response so for example
the network first strategy goes to the
network but the user is offline so then
it goes to the cache but maybe there's
nothing in the cache we're going to say
alright we don't have a response so
instead we can return our own response
in this case we're going to grab an
offline page from our cache that maybe
we pre cached in the configuration and
then in addition we've got a we could
check the status and return a 404 page
if the user went to a 404 link so that's
basically how you would implement custom
logic for a handler and you guys will
get to do that in the lab if you haven't
already done that and yeah that's pretty
much it for for the rest of the talk so
if you guys want to keep working on the
lab we'll keep walking around and try
and help you guys do the instructions
are linked here but if you've already
got it loaded up and you can just keep
working from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
