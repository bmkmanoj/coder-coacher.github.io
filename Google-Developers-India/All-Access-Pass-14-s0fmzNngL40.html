MANORANJAN PADHY: Hey there.
We are at the Fall for
India event Hyderabad,
and it has just got concluded.
And right now, I
have Rohit with me.
Rohit works with the
Google Cloud team.
Hey, Rohit, how are you?
ROHIT GUPTA: I'm good.
How are you today?
MANORANJAN PADHY:
I'm good as well.
So, Rohit, in your experience
of working with the Cloud team,
what do you think
is the product that
is being used the most by
the developers in India?
ROHIT GUPTA: Surprisingly,
the most used product
for us is the first
product that we launched,
which is Google App Engine.
Google App Engine is
an application platform
where you can run
your application,
let Google worry about
the infrastructure,
and developers can
just focus on the code.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Recently,
we did some announcement
about Java, then Python
and the Go language.
Can you just elaborate
for the viewers?
ROHIT GUPTA: Sure.
We just addressed one of the
most asked feature requests,
which is we added
Java 8 support.
Along with that, just
a few months ago,
we added Python 3 support
and Go 1.8 support also.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Let's say I
don't know Java, Python, or Go.
So can I still learn,
or can I still start
using Google App Engine?
ROHIT GUPTA: Definitely,
you can still do that.
So you can bring any
runtime, any language code
that you want to run, package
it in a Docker container,
and run it on Google App Engine.
And not just that-- you get
all the features of Google App
Engine, like logging, real-time
debugging, available with this.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
So if I start, I'm
pretty sure that the
document will help me
succeed in whatever I'm doing.
ROHIT GUPTA: Definitely,
and not just that.
We've also got
trainings scheduled.
So you can go and watch
and attend light trainings.
And also, if you want to watch
and learn at your own pace,
we've launched product
trainings on Coursera.org,
as well as you can get
certified with our two latest
certifications, which is
the Cloud Architect and Data
Engineer.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Interesting.
Can you tell which are
the trainings available?
ROHIT GUPTA: We've
got multiple tracks.
We've got tracks for
system operations.
We've got tracks for architects.
We've got tracks
for data engineers.
And we've even got tracks for
people who know other clouds.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
For people who are
coming for the first
time on Google Cloud,
are there any free
credits that they can use
if they want to test it out?
ROHIT GUPTA: Definitely.
If you're a new user and you
just want to get started,
we've got $300 for
you and services
available throughout the year.
MANORANJAN PADHY: All the
links that we mentioned
about the certificates,
about the documentation,
will be in the
description section below.
And if you have any questions,
please put them there.
I'll try to make sure
that Rohit answers them.
Thanks, Rohit.
ROHIT GUPTA: Thank you.
