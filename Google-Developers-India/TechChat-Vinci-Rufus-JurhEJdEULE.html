with us today
Quincey who is a Google developer expert
for web technologies Lindsay how did you
get into computers my story so the first
time I saw a computer was somewhere
around 1980 in my neighbor's house you
know the big green so a small green
monitor over there and somehow instantly
fell in love with it and I thought I'm
going to spend my life that computer and
my next interaction with computers
happen way after school in college when
this part of a school curriculum and we
started learning programming languages
learning the C's at the forefront of the
world and as you're working on
programming and writing the code
creating we've asked create assignments
of you know inverting the pyramid and
sorting arrays I started hitting that
and and I couldn't reconcile to the fact
that I love computers but I started
hitting programming and I don't know
what to do and then coincidentally I
discovered something called C graphics
so while my teacher was teaching us C
programming I was actually kidding C
graphics and playing around moving them
around the screen and I was enjoying
that and later then after that I was
introduced to ActionScript so when flash
was introduced with action scripts I saw
how you could create games with action
scripts and that got you really hooked
on and the ability to integrate laws of
physics with computer programming to
build interesting and innovative games
this is what got me hooked on to
programming and that's how I started
learning programming so for me building
games was my step to learning to program
Lindsay today we have a bunch of
technologies like polymer is their
angular their reactors coming and we see
lot of these technologies are changing
every now and then
so how does one keep up the pace with
this so a very good question
yes and a lot of people to come back and
keep asking you know what should what is
the framework that I should learn so
should i laundry ad should I learn
angular or fiddle and polymer and what I
keep telling them is what you need to
learn first is obviously JavaScript make
sure that you are really good with the
JavaScript fundamentals learn your
object-oriented programming linear
functional programming learn
learn and understand how JavaScript
works because all these frameworks are
essentially sitting on top of it right
and every framework has its own plus and
minus point say for example if you said
yet yet is very nice when it comes to
the presentation layer and when it comes
to view manipulations angular on the
other hand is a very very nice framework
when you want to build entire single
page applications you get a lot of
features that comes with angular so
every framework would have a right fit
they go to what projects you want to
work on and what applications you want
to build so choosing the framework will
be an easier choice if you know your
fundamentals right that's one and what I
also like to say is experiment with
everything you know you can work with
multiple frameworks you don't have to be
married to one single framework and the
next time a new framework comes in it'd
be much easier for you to move on to the
next one
many people think friendly is not a
serious programming what is your take on
that yeah if you look at a few years
back a lot of applications that would be
built was built on technologies like
Java asp.net and things like that now
what's happening is awfully javascript
has taken leaps and bounds in terms of
the way things evolved in the JavaScript
space and we are moving to things like
decoupled architecture we're moving to
optimizing front-end bottom using
front-end for mobile and web so here's
front-end is very serious business and
as a matter of fact back-end is actually
going to become pretty mundane or even I
would go to an extent of saying is going
to be extinct with tools like firebase
and cloud-based solutions you don't need
a back in person everything is just
going to be built using front-end
JavaScript technologies and also the
other important thing with front-end is
so now as a front-end developer you're
not building solutions for a single
channel you're building it for multiple
touchpoints multiple endpoints you know
you need to build it for the desktop you
need to build it for mobile devices you
need to build for different forms of
mobile devices right from the low-end
phones to the high-end phones and
tablets and even kiosks right so how do
you do how you build your front an
application and keep it performant
enough to support all these various
devices there's a huge challenge and you
need really smart people in that space
what are your thoughts on PWA so
progressive web apps is obviously a very
very interesting to
because very hard topic a lot of people
are talking about it what I feel is many
people are probably getting into a
misconception that progressive web apps
are a replacement for native apps or
they are these new breed of applications
that has to be built on a completely
different technological stack and what I
think is that's wrong you can take any
existing responsive site and convert
that into a progressive web app you can
start the journey of food converting it
into a progressive other it's as simple
as putting in a manifest file and a
simple serviceworker that starts cashing
in your requests and you're on your
journey to building progressive web apps
and as you go about adding features to
progress a web apps you can get to a
point where you can actually replace the
native app but it's important to start
the journey as early as possible and
started with your existing application
you don't have to rebuild it from
scratch this was amazing thank you in C
for joining us and what you guys are
waiting for if you have any questions
feel free to comment below and we will
have Vincey answer them we'll give it a
try for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
