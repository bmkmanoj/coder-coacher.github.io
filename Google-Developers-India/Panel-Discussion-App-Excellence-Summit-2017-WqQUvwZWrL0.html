read this session and to take things
forward please join me to welcome the
current Gonville head of business
development in there it's an absolute
pleasure to see all of you out here
thank you for coming in a lot of you
have actually braved the traffic of
Bangalore to be here so thank you for
doing that as well I have actually come
on stage with a great responsibility to
keep you all interested enough to last
through to the next session which is
lunch so I'm going to do the best I can
and the what we have for you right now
is a very exciting discussion with some
of the country's top developers people
who have done a lot of great stuff a lot
of things that we've been talking about
that Poornima Raj and Kunal James and so
on talked about around optimizing for
India building for India doing some
great things so to help me help you and
help me talk to all of this about you
please allow me to welcome my great
friend we need cook from Times into that
who need is the chief operating officer
of the news business for timepieces
Times of India neat please
next we have mark at mark is the
director with moon frog one of India's
largest gaming companies one of India's
largest homegrown gaming companies next
I'd like to welcome Unterman Bhavna
who's the chief product officer for make
my trip and finally I welcome ranjeet's
politician who is the chief product
officer for Biden
and I'm going to pull my chair a bit so
I can actually see all of them so guys
thanks a lot for being here really
appreciate your participation so I'm
going to start off by asking a very
simple thing for all of you you know why
don't you just start with maybe
introducing yourself tell us a little
bit about your apps tell us a little
about about how you think and why you
think you are building for India I know
made for India and so on let's see let's
start with you thanks really excited to
be here and really excited to see the
audience here fantastic turnout
my name is Ann Sherman Bhavna I run
product at big mattress a developer and
entrepreneur running a start-up in in
Bangalore before we got acquired by make
my trip used to be at Google back in the
day many years ago and the thing that I
wanted to share with you was about what
we've done at make my trip and we've
done a lot of interesting things the
company itself actually started out back
in the day when the Indian internet
scene started and we actually almost
went under in the first four or five
years but then came back when IRCTC
happened to India and I don't know how
many few I mean you guys look too young
to even remember that
but IRCTC was the first company that
actually managed to convince Indians
that you could buy something safely
online and that's how after that there
was air that can that democratized air
for India so that flights were no longer
the preserve of the few in the rich and
then since then the company has had this
interesting tumult attorney and
including the mobile tsunami that hit us
between three to four years ago and now
with red bus and go I Bebo also as part
of make my trip we are this company
which sells everything from very
expensive European packages to budget
hotels right next right next to the bus
stand across the length and breadth of
the countries we built a lot of
different things which are very specific
to India which I would love to get into
as we get deep into the discussion hi
everybody my name is Mark Skaggs
I'm a director at moon frog labs here in
Bangalore moon frog was started four
years ago with the whole intent to focus
of building mobile games for the Indian
market I joined about a year and a half
ago and the exciting thing to me
is building games for India specifically
and only India I've been in the games
industry for about 25 years and I see
India as the next biggest phenomena
that's going to happen worldwide for
games and so that's very exciting and
you guys might know some other work
we've done at moon frog with teen potty
gold it's the top of the charts about 3
million daily active users we also have
released alia Bhatt's star life looking
at finding out and learning about the
women demographic of women game players
demographic in India and then also most
recently
Bahubali the game based of course the
great work by SS Rajamouli
so we're super excited to be focused
only on India and as again as we get
into some of the more details of this
panel I'll share why we're exciting and
some of the things we're doing with
games just for ya something very
specific in you India itself after 25
years in the gaming industry you move to
India so of course absolutely India is
the place to be much it is the place to
be I believe in wholeheartedly great
thank you thanks much hi guys my name is
Philippe Ireland the digital news
business for times internet while Times
of India does not need an introduction
you know we have been around for over
100 17 eight years setting the agenda
for the country on news and infotainment
I want to talk about what we are doing
apart from time 70 as well on the
Digital side so we run news and
infotainment businesses in nine Indian
languages from banco valley marathi
gujarati kannada tamil telugu malayalam
and all of that and we have a catered
branded product for them we also run a
news aggregator which is in 15 languages
today it's called news points and our
goal is to make sure that we can create
a product that works well for the
hundreds in this room and the billions
outside right that's what we are trying
to solve hi everyone
so I'm Ranjeet and I am responsible for
the product vision strategy and
execution at buy juice prior to much
tainted by Jews I was with bike
messenger again building for India and
prior to hike messenger
with markcaswell building games a lot of
the social gaming titles that bring are
created by Jews we have a very simple
but fundamental mission which is to kind
of ensure that students fall in love
with learning it is something that
Indians associate with and care about so
much education is aspirational in nature
and we believe that the disruption can
happen that all kids can be empowered
with the love for learning which will
take care of results all of that is in
due course with that we essentially have
three teams working together we have our
Academy our team we have a media team
and the technology team all of which
come together to kind of ensure that
learning content the learning
experiences we craft out are specific to
India it is engaging in nature it's
effective in terms of driving learning
outcomes and at the same time it's
personalized because India has got a
million India's within that and hence we
need to ensure that all students are
catered to so that's being a focus right
through and we have been building for
India and been succeeding at that you
primarily have three apps on the Google
Play Store the primary learning app that
you guys might have seen advertisements
on on TV it's got 10 million plus
downloads and it's rated 4.6 testament
to the fact that if we have a good
learning application there's going to be
a lot of delight in terms of how
students receive it so that's been a
fantastic journey for us in the last two
years in terms of crafting our great
experiences for Indian students okay
thank you one of the very interesting
things you just said as you know India
has a billion India's within it so Kunal
also in the previous session talked a
lot about you know how there is a need
to optimize for specific Indian
challenges whether it is battery whether
it is speed whether it is you know the
type of device and so on so tell us a
little bit of neither all for a few if
you could just tell us about one
innovation that you may have done with
with your app which is specific to
solving for a child challenge in India
Angela can I make it - sure so I think
the list that you mentioned the how
India is a balloon India this is
definitely true
technically network devices etc etc it's
also in the way we think and we operate
so there is a psychological part of it
also that I would want to touch so the
first part just from a technical
standpoint
you saw the earlier the presentation
when can always talking about how 10
megabyte is kind of the magic number and
we were at 16 megabytes with a primary
app and trying to hit that magic number
and realize that one fine day I think
one of my product managers came up and
said what's better than 10 megabyte 1
megabyte and said yeah let's do 1
megabyte and we realized that we had a
kind of a backdoor way of doing that so
we had invested quite a bit in this
technology called progressive web apps
bwa
which I hope a lot of you are familiar
with but basically this is our answer to
what's happening on the mobile web make
it as performant as a native app itself
and we've invested quite a bit in that
and we said what if you actually take
that and wrap it in a native shell where
the native shell does does the basic
text view rendering the image view
rendering but everything else actually
comes as an XML that actually does the
server pushes down and that's something
that is worked really well for us
including to the point where now
obviously the app is very performant but
we have the full clitoral of all the
different things that we want to offer
to all our customers in that 1 megabyte
app and the interesting twist to that is
that we've actually we've actually
invested also a lot in personalization
to understand what the users want
what kind of hotels if they have booked
this hotel or looked at this hotel what
are the transportation mechanisms they
might be interested in and we figured
out this way where we realize that
people who are coming onto this app
actually give us a richer data set to
personalize against so if you actually
install that it's called my light if you
install that app you should actually see
a more personalized experience than what
you see on the native app itself
sometimes which is kind of one way of
saying that hey it's not that you trying
to build a lesser version or lesser or a
less featured version you're actually
building a more powerful version for the
next 300 million so that is one part but
the other part that I did wanna touch
upon is can something which amuses me
all the time which is a year back when
all of us in the e-commerce space were
losing money hand over fist there was a
race to understand what is the least
dumb way to lose that that much money or
to put all that money into the customers
wallet and instead of doing discounts
the company which is now part of make my
trip go I Bebo
invented something which I think a lot
of companies should emulate basically
they built the Amway model of the mobile
wallet so the concept was that every
time you actually stuck around in the
app for long enough will actually
incentivize you will put money in your
wallet because you can imagine and
travel people book their travel and then
the uninstall the app so if you stick
around if you don't undersell the app
you get two hundred bees in your wallet
but if you invite if you invite all your
friends from your phone graph then every
time they book you actually get fifty
rupees in your wallet and that's
something which I see a lot of heads
nodding here I'd like to emphasize so
that turned out to be so we actually
stopped all above the line marketing and
we actually focus completely on filling
people's wallet in the most in the
smartest possible way who had the best
graphs so that is another example of how
as Indians we love value we love and be
very social so tapping into that and
allowing that to to make transactions
for a category as expensive as travel
with something that works really well
great thank you okay I'm going to talk
about two areas one is a focus and the
other one is a specific optimization
that we did the first obviously is the
focus of games for India and I'll tell
you why I'm mentioning that obviously
with alia bhatt game and the Bahubali
game they're very heavy India classic in
the IP a lot of game makers look at
making games that are generic and if you
look at the top of the charts for games
a lot of international games and our
focus is how do we make something that
fits the culture that feels like it
feels like it was built here for this
audience and you know I'm still learning
I'm not an expert at what works in the
Indian market I'm expert at making games
so I talk with the teams in all all the
people who grew up here and live here
and we often talk about you know is this
have enough masala in it that the right
Laver for India because I don't want to
bring my own influence of no
international game making so that's one
area focus in it we think that's a
competitive advantage for again Indian
gaming company to make it feel like it's
home the second thing is obviously
connectivity so by hopefully the game is
a strategy game action it has heavy
reliance on the server and when you look
at international apps they rely on
constant always-on connectivity and when
we made a game in the US
we were blind to the realities of
connectivity in places like India and so
what we did we have you know rockstar
programmer we rewrote the connectivity
part of the engine to allow for
connectivity drops on a regular basis
and seamless games later to continue
across those drops and then the catch-up
once connectivity is reestablished so
it's a lot of a very very gentle
handling of a tricky connectivity system
so that was the big innovation there and
of course app size which you know
everybody now thank you okay so I want
to talk about what we did on video
streaming and battery for most media
companies now video is a very very big
focus because more and more consumers
specially Indic consumers are consuming
a lot of videos but when you look at
video there is a distinct problem to
solve
you can either solve it for for the guys
on a poor connection speed 2g where you
will encode it at a lower bitrate and
avoid buffering in which case the
quality of experience for an always-on
connected 4G or Wi-Fi user goes bad and
if you encode it for 40 and always on
the 2g guys will never be able to see it
but it will always keep on buffering so
what we did was using an HLS streamer
and adaptive bitrate dynamically
adaptive bitrate layer so at distinct
points in time we figure out
continuously what's the connection speed
and get the next packet encoded
accordingly so that helps help us a lot
in terms of user experience the second
point that I want to talk about is
battery so well most of us focus on
battery we end up focusing on the code
that we are writing on our own and most
of us forget that we include tons of
SDKs inside our apps so while we were
testing on one of these days we realized
that a third-party SDK a very prominent
one was using 25mm H of Petre every hour
when one of our apps was in the
background we started talking to them we
work with them to reconfigure their SDK
and now the same app uses 1mh every
three hours well right so that's the
quantum of improvement we've been able
to get so I think both of these are very
very important I just want to quickly
touch up on one more point if I can move
this bill to three definitely right
loads the merrier
so most people say 10 MB is the limit
and obviously by it varies by category
it is very very important but I think 10
MB is important from a perspective of
downloads and conversion from your app
listing page on Play Store it is the
install size of the app on your device
is equally or more important right
because most of the time The Times of
India app for example is not compete
with an entity where you see news it is
going to compete with that
one extra vacation photo that you are
going to take on a 20 megapixel camera
and both of them are going to be in the
5 to 6 or 7 mb mb range so not just the
apk size but the installed apps i is
also very important the kind of cache
that you are creating the kind of cache
cleaning of strategies that you have
most people will not delete an app
because of its size it will get flagged
off in a ccleaner on a battery cleaner
of sort and that's when the removal
happens so important on the app size
both pre-installed and on the device and
how you clean the cache right so what
most of my friends here spoke about
adaptive bit rate video LED product so
we need to kind of take care of that
encoding has to be optimized so that you
could have n sure the data consumption
is not really out of hand the initial
load and expedience is gently smooth we
need to optimize for images as well
because the sort of apps would be
creating they need to be aesthetically
rich and polished simply because you're
dealing with age demographics from say
fourth grade all the way up to 10th
grade and you know the sort of apps that
kids use are rich visually so we had
invest in terms of you know using SVG s
and WebP ease as opposed to PNG s to
ensure the app size does not get loaded
up that investment was worthwhile as
well of device and the way we kind of
designed our design Sprint's around
devices oh pete our UI UX flows beat the
way that we went about developing or the
way that we ran our testing cycles we
were always cognizant of the fact that
this is a Mars
app going out to different users who are
probably going to be consuming this
on medium and low end machines and at
the end of the day we need to ensure
that the experience is not broken
fundamentally for any of them so that
was part of our normal process itself
now what anjuman also spoke about the
investment in personalization is
sacrosanct for us because we know if
it's India as I was today India at the
audience that we're going to be dealing
with is going to be even more diverse
later on so our investment in terms of
you know putting data out there having
knowledge graphs and then using that
information to build a learning profile
for every student and then personalizing
the experience what's critical now this
cost was the challenge to us because
when we dealt with our users later on
when we know a paid users at the end of
the day the number one constraint that
they had was this is all great and
fantastic but after I pay for this do I
need to be again consuming some degree
of course or paying a cost for my
bandwidth this is going to be costly my
network is not so great
so my streaming experience is broken and
hence my fundamentally my learning
experiences itself is broken which is
why we had to come with a very pragmatic
approach saying that we need kind of a
mixed model out there we need to have
our personalization layer and everything
else that we have in terms of learning
experiences was perfectly offline for
those users who have intermittent
internet connection once they sync back
the data has kind of you know feedback
and algorithms have to kick in and
personalize things for them
who's that and of course being
future-proof in terms of ensuring that
as streaming users have a fantastic
experience or adapter betray'd
algorithms kick in as well so we had to
go with a model where we cater to all of
these users and today a lot of our scale
comes from the offline and the hybrid
model because a lot of the users have
the pressing constraints in terms of
networks this might change over the span
of time this is something that we had to
cater to at this point of time okay
thanks so I kind of delve a little
deeper into some of the challenges that
we've been talking about for India right
again we will India is a billion India's
or if you look at everything that Poonam
aside around you know the next 300
million Internet users coming on coming
on board would be very very different
from the first few so they're going to
be the we already have different network
connectivity different types of devices
different specific
occations different languages you know
all kinds of challenges that exist in
India so unhuman if I asked you
specifically a lot of the new travelers
would now be coming from tier 2 tier 3
tier 4 cities where there would be good
3G bad bad 3G good 2g even by 2g if that
even exists so how have you tackled this
challenge how have you built a rap to
make sure that in different types of
connectivity a user is able to get a
standard experience the experience is
good and we continue to stick with you
yeah absolutely I think what you're
pointing out is absolutely where we are
at right now so with about 50 million
downloads cumulative so far we are
already touching the ceiling of we're
all comfortable smartphone transacting
users are so we know that our next 100
billion are actually not going to come
necessarily from that channel that we've
acquired so far so there are a bunch of
different things the light is is one
example but I'll tell is maybe I'll just
step back in that question a little bit
more and talk about why we think that we
might actually be completely barking up
the wrong tree right now so one thing
that and Google had a study that came
out and just one of many studies is talk
about how big vernacular is right as
soon as you start tapping out the
english-speaking population which is
comfortable with smartphones and
transacting you're basically now up
against this very massive user base of
hundreds of millions of users one Hindi
Tamil and a bunch of different Indian
languages and just like everyone else in
this space we had actually created the
vernacular versions of all the make my
trip app so and specifically we did both
for the make my trip app and we also did
it for a specific category which is rail
which is railways as Democratic as
widespread in India as it gets and I'm
proud to say I'm just kidding I'm
ashamed to say they were complete that
nothing happened so none of the metrics
actually even barely moved so what we
did is that we actually started doing
what we should have done in the first
place which is to actually observe these
users that we were hypothetic ating
about sitting in our comfortable
air-conditioned offices and there's one
video that I remember which is fantastic
which is of this this lady who is
sitting in in a housewife in a home in
Tamil Nadu
and she's looking at the apps and her
primary reaction is not about the fact
that the content is not in Tamil her
primary reaction is what the hell does
filter mean what is the search thing why
is this circle and this dander standing
there in front of me what am I supposed
to do with that and you realize that
just like everyone else
we've just been boiling down this next
300 million problem to a few technical
questions and a few usability problems
when it might actually be the case and
this is more a call to action to
everyone in the room here especially if
you're developers is to actually see how
these users behave and we think they're
a couple of different things happening
one is that we think that maybe this box
called the app which has these
navigational paradigms of going back and
forth and searching and filtering and
going to the listing page and the detail
page and then booking is something that
might absolutely not work with this next
set of customers altogether you have to
remember that were they're more
accustomed to is whatever navigation
paradigms
what's up efforts them right and they're
not too many of those that's one second
is we realize that you have to somehow
hat trust so when we for example look at
this next 300 million we were looking at
basically our competition and saying
well can we do better than our
competition or sometimes going out of a
category and saying well what about flip
card can we do it better than flick card
or Amazon or someone else who's focusing
on the soap ATM and we realize that the
humble housewife is actually not
comparing us to a flip card she's not
comparing us to a competition she's
comparing us to mr. Ravi Raj
mr. Ravi Raj is the person she reaches
out to one whatsapp and says I need a
flight ticket
I need a hotel booking and he's the one
who actually makes it happen for her now
how do you actually for that to me is
almost outside of the app constraints
altogether so this is literally think
outside the box where the box is the app
and that's something which we have
actually we're investing a lot now in
thinking a lot about what the next
hundred billion users behave like and
therefore and I when I realized is
actually a little ethnographic data
about how these next hundred million
people behave I actually saw a New York
Times article which had more data than
anything else that I've seen published
so far so as developers who
ratchet thinking about this space don't
just say don't you stay is inside your
comfort zone just step out look at the
people around you who are not
necessarily your primary app users right
now and that's where the next big growth
is going to come from I can guarantee
you that there is a Alibaba there's a V
chat there's at out to you etcetera all
waiting to happen inside India if you
just start looking at the users more
closely so not a technical answer around
connectivity and so on but I think a
more important revelation for me a
teacher so do you actually have PMS were
actually out on the street talking to
people trying to all these different
cities understanding exactly hearing and
we are we doing a bunch of different
things including for example stationing
some of our people at hotels right and
what else is something we sell all the
time in spades and all that they are
doing is observing the customers were
coming in and saying where did you book
a hotel from how did you find out about
this hotel and the answers are
astonishing it's very eye-opening for us
right now great awesome mark something
different for you so we've been talking
about you know the magic number
so Kunal had that slide about 10 MB but
that's something that's for apps
unfortunately we've never really been to
the point where we've you know really
some of these things for games but in
your view what is the magic number for a
game in India right all the differences
all the variations that exist in device
sizes and so on I think like every
research there's no one answer but I can
tell you few years ago with team potty
gold we reduced the app size from about
12 or so down to seven and our downloads
it shot up it was just a noticeable
difference so all the PM's out there who
want to see a noticeable difference and
changing your metrics I take a shot at
reducing your app set and thing you guys
found um and so we know that there are
the initial version of team potties
seven megabyte download works with
Bahubali we focused on keeping it under
20 MB and games have a special challenge
because the amount of graphics that we'd
have and so we did the multiple apks for
device with the understanding that we
would have to make some visual
compromises for the lowest lowest
version but that that worked out well
because we could also see the smaller
the apt eye size the more downloads we
have so my suggestion if you're making a
game is make it as small as possible
but be careful when you're crossing that
line between
could that compromise line between small
and ugly because everybody comes to
games they want the beautiful experience
they want the fun experience as you know
small matters
there's also another transition
happening and we're so internally we're
always looking at this and one of the
things we're wondering as the ecosystem
is changing is how that number is going
to change is it going to choose it going
to rise with you know 4G and Geo and
download cost dropping so that's a
question there's actually one extra
thing I want to tie in to what you said
we're finding the same thing with games
that you found with your app in that for
us we have assumed a large number of
game interface paradigms we make games
and we seen them all over the world and
then when we actually go out and talk to
players and watch them use their game
we're finding a very different story
that the things that work traditionally
the games don't necessarily work here
with people who have maybe never played
a game on their device so we're having
to relearn all those lessons last week
we had a crew out in a mall talking
about bajalia getting some real-life
feedback from customers a few months
earlier we had crews out in malls
talking about the alia Bhatt game to
understand customers and if I had to say
anything the win is understanding your
customer better than the rest of the
world and who better to understand
Indian players in our case your Indian
online users than people who grew up
India great thank you
who need you run a news business a news
business you mentioned that you're doing
stuff on video but a news business
starts off as a text business right it's
about people coming to a device people
coming and reading reading 2 / 2 things
that are of their interest of maybe even
even around infotainment so with so many
languages that exist in India how do you
look at vernacular so unlike most other
apps where they're seeing indicator
opportunity now it has been a core part
of our business primarily we had a lot
of market leading print brands already
which I cannot find angular for example
mobster Times in Mumbai and we had a
digital product to cater to those
audiences
right what we have been able to do on
the engineering side is to ensure that a
particular product for us is just a bill
target right so when I build the noose
point app or the Maritimes app for it's
the same code base
only it's a different feed at the build
time and a different set of F opposite
side and so that that's one the other is
that for all of these languages now one
needs to understand that it's not the
same content or the same category of
content that each of the people like the
content preference is very significantly
and we have seen that they vary between
the users who consume it on FF and the
users who consume it on apps so it's
very very important to build a data
science layer to understand what you can
serve to which customer and that
increases engagement disproportionately
one more point I want to add right right
so while we are talking about the next
300 million users we have to talk about
boys in the same same breath when Touch
came it just took over instantaneously I
think the next two years or three years
is the years of boys people would want
to talk to the phone I'll exercise where
Google whom is coming out people are
finally talking to Siri the assistant is
there the assistant is there as well
right and that's going to become a habit
and when it's as easy as saying read out
the top news no one would actually open
the app and go to a particular section
and then read out content because app
can play it out for you
so that's one of the very important
things that all of us would have to
consider for our apps we have already
started integrating Google
text-to-speech works very well
customers who engage with TTS are more
consume much more and retain much longer
than people who don't use it you know
our request to Google is that enable it
for more more languages than what we
have overhead yeah working on that and
so one is the language play out the
other is also language input and I think
on voice you have to work on both of
these in parallel great thank you
so Ranjith here is one thing for you
education is again it comes with a very
different set of challenges right so
you've got different board
in India about different every student
will react to a different kind of
teaching every student would need a
different learning experience you spoke
about knowledge graphs and so on but
tell us more about how you are
customizing the learning experience for
every student what are the different
varieties different variations that you
see and how you are adapting to all of
them right so the inclusions layer that
we have which does the personalization
it's very conventional it's the
knowledge graph it's metadata which is
stacked all of this content and now we
know that every student has a different
starting point X a different destination
Y and we know that at the end of the day
what we need to kind of ensure is that
there's a smooth learning curve while
shouldnÂ´t travels from X to Y now what
we do is essentially try to kind of
figure out and glean information as to
what specific weakness of the child is
what is is essentially a strength and
based on that being able to customize
the learning path in a much more smooth
of fashion or if you don't understand
Newton's second law of motion we have
that information that the child
struggled with a momentum as a concept
we know that when need to come to their
a related concept which is Newton's
second law
you need to handhold the child a little
better because he struggled with the
concept of momentum the way that we kind
of then stuck to the expedient for the
child is little different from say
somebody who's already mastered the
concept of momentum and can get down to
low mastering Newton second law much
faster so one shoe fits all approach
cannot work especially in education but
I think it's the whole same paradigm
right in a classroom of 30 to 50
students
you cannot structure for just the
average student you can only structure
for average student so that's a
limitation of the offline model but if
you take the analogy a lot further
entire India is a classroom and there's
so many students out there with
different backgrounds some of them
coming from ICAC somebody coming from
state syllables their proficiencies what
fundamentals they have mastered all of
that is different right so what we are
looking at very closely is ensuring that
between that information and have
smoother learning curves for each of
these students now the way that we go
about doing this is through creating
fresh content we identify that instead
instead boards certain learning gaps
tend to be a lot more prominent then we
create fresh content for that when we
talking about personalization is this
personalization at two layers
personalization of content where you
identify
patterns and trends among users and see
that we need to go back to the drawing
board and create fresh content which
addresses those points there's a second
layer of personalization that I would
like to speak about which is
adaptiveness of the you is this came by
when we did a lot of the focus group
testing or dealing with because we have
audience across two thousand plus cities
in India Tier one tier two tier three
towns as well the way that we structured
our messaging within the app the way
that we structured our visuals with an
app all of that had different reactions
from different audience all together
right the language that we use ended up
first seemingly for a metro audience
that's because it was being created by
people who are from that background so
we had to go back and see that hey let's
look at a messaging let's look at our UI
elements and all of that needs to be
adapted to some extent again linked to
the use of persona and the demographic
that we are kind of catering to Oh
the third element out there is that we
know a miraculous critical we are in the
process of actually adding multilingual
support both in terms of audio plus
subtitles so that while students might
be still studying an English medium they
believe that their learning outcome the
retention their understanding is a lot
more effective if it's done in a say in
English or one ocular language that
they're more comfortable with so we are
factoring in all of these elements can
you structure different experiences for
different students now does one added
challenge when you're talking about the
next 300 million that's coming on board
Oh what we are dealing with is an age
group say from kindergarten all the way
up to 12th grade now there's there's an
additional few millions coming from the
younger audience the mobile first
audience were probably using game apps
so applying the subway surfers and the
temple runs of the world their exposure
and expectations from a learning app is
fundamentally different from what say an
older age group has so are lower grade
app which is for say fourth and fifth
grade is done in a fundamentally
different style altogether it's not an
earning app as much as its packaged as a
game you have learning videos but you
have exponential content where you play
and figure out concepts on your own we
don't ask questions and tests these are
all wrapped and our gamified experience
where even if they fail or fail to
answer a specific question they don't
lose hope or motivation simply because
it's structured as game acquired
experience so dealing with different
demographics has been a challenge but we
have been finding solutions for that
and the way that you've been able to do
that is testing it heavily with users
great thanks that that's great so thank
you for sharing a lot of this I'm sure
it's very inspiring for all of our
developers here talking about
inspiration a lot of you have done some
great stuff so one last question for
each of you
what could be your one advice to
everybody out here as to what they
should be doing when they're building
for India so one thing to keep in mind
don't listen to people on a panel I
think so this one up I'll probably go
back to something which I've alluded to
in the past which is as developers or
whatever profession you are in at some
levels you need to have a North Star
that keeps you honest because problems
technique hard technical problems are
not an end in themselves they're a means
to an end
so what is it that one thing that will
keep you honest and I would say as
developers focus on usage intense usage
whatever you build has to be used either
by millions of people or by one person
but intensely if you keep that as a core
Mac again say well am i building
something whether as part of a startup
that you run yourself or as part of a
large company am i building something
that is going to get intense usage then
I think that will be one one thing that
will keep you honest for a very very
long time
my my take is constraints is believe in
the Indian market
I know it's it seems like how do you
make money and it's hard it's difficult
but I've seen a number of explosive
transitions over my career games and
before games you know the introduction
of the PC the console transition
explosion that happened around the world
the Facebook explosion and transition
that happened at Zynga when we made
farmville and sit Evo and mobile
transition the us that some companies
missed in some some hit as well as the
mobile transition that's happened in
China India is going to go through that
massive amazing growth we're still very
early very early into that process right
now so believe in the market and as I
mentioned there's going to be so many
people out there that just are hoping to
use a great homegrown India made for
India
that feels real and honest to them so be
those guys that make that where we're
making that you might want to call it a
bet we have that belief at moon frog
that the future is India it's going to
be a massive transition so that would be
my one piece of advice be patient be
smart I believe in the in the future
here absolutely thank you remember guys
1 billion app installs a month
3x growth and monetization so just
remember that it's all starting to
happen and absolutely just just build
for India we need so I would say get the
get the basic side there is no
forgiveness to not using ProGuard
there's no forgiveness to not getting to
2g and 3g and 4g separately you could
miss out on a 2g that masquerades as a
4G but as long as you can separately
solving for each of these that should be
good enough then don't let all of these
options of hide under settings no user
will go to the settings step on it and
configure the app you know we have path
amount of settings in our apps as a
one-time startup exercise less than 2%
of our consumers ever go to settings and
change them right so don't assume that
just because it is in the settings you
solved for it the next step is to
delight the consumer can you
automatically switch the connection
switch the consumer experience when the
connection changes right so when the
Metro is over ground
what are you able to serve when it got
quality when the Metro goes underground
there is no signal what can you do and
when it comes back again does the user
know you have done something to enhance
the experience that's the next step
giant want to add just one more point
invest in a very high quality
it's retention and engagement system you
know you can use something that Google
Offers you can use something that you
have created or bought or built but the
team that analyzes each of your behavior
course not just an equation coverts and
the kind of enablement that you have
provided them with toolset is very very
important right it is difficult to
acquire a user but it is very easy to
love your customers so once you've
acquired them make sure you are serving
them what they need in the manner they
want it so that's it basically build for
people with a 2g network but also build
for people in this room who all got
high-speed Wi-Fi at home
absolutely
absolutely and and that's what you say
you know the rebellion India's in in
India as you said yeah yeah that's it
what would you say yeah so the most
successful labs if you look at China
Japan Korea and all of those are the you
guys don't need to necessarily just look
towards the West to figure out patterns
and app styles and you know just
replicate that the most successful apps
in this specific geographies have been
successful because it accrues to the
audience they really test it out with
audience really really well it injures
we have that strength we have the human
capital you can just walk up to somebody
get feedback it's not a costly process
right so please stay very very close to
your audience your target segments
interact with them you do not need to
make costly mistakes you can show paper
prototypes to them and still get
feedback as to what building out is
right or not use that your advantage our
understanding of the Indian market the
Indian psyche is what is going to get us
to kind of you know build our phenomenal
apps let's not focus at the second
element is something to see a lot of
fundamental apps make mistakes on is the
way that they get kind of you know
onboard users and that's something that
is a very technical aspect but then
something I think a lot of app
developers probably struggle with I do
believe that you need to kind of
innovate there you need to probably have
staggered approaches for different
audience or different users out there in
India like I said the billion India's
within India each of them are simulated
with a few design patterns some of them
are just exposed to whatsapp somebody's
probably exposed to high-level apps you
don't need to have the same first-time
user experience for every single user to
play around with that and have a more
seamless experience when they are
interacting with your app for the first
time because that's the first time that
you make them feel confident about
interacting to app and the delight also
kicks in so that first session make it
delightful so two broad takeaways that
that I am taking away here is the first
is understand your consumer whether it
is by using data the way police and you
talked about whether it's by product
managers going into the field and
talking to people on the ground and the
second thing of course marks the best
statement that you made believe in India
guys there's a lot to happen thank you
all of you for being here thank you for
sharing all the inspirational stuff and
so the developers here will be happy to
replicate a lot of this like being here
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
