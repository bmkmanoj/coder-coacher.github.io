building a progressive web app which is
to cache your core files and just kind
of let everything else come from the
network or maybe cache it as you go but
that's not the only way to do it so the
choices that you make in what you cash
and don't cash have implications both
through disk size and performance so we
need to talk about different PWA
architectures so of course you've all
seen the the offline dinosaur or as
people the page like to say the down-ass
or you know ideally we'd like to make
this dinosaur extinct you know not not
have the offline anymore
so we don't really want error internet
disconnected we want your app to keep
working so one way to move an existing
site to PWA is the thing you've been
doing which is first deploy HTTPS use
caching strategies both for offline to
make it work there but also for
performance cache the things you need to
make it work fast
the thing we haven't talked abouts the
app shell architecture and we'll talk
about that in a minute you should of
course add home to screen home screen
manifest file and then add the other
special features like push notification
payments API and credentials so what's
an app shell so an app shell splits out
the content from basically the
navigation the core parts of the app if
you've been building a single page
application this is usually all your
main navigation stuff and this is the
templates you use for your content it's
really pretty straightforward except it
in a PWA so this stuff usually has URLs
and comes from the cache API this stuff
might have a URL and come from the cache
or it might be in the database and it
might be template rendered or not it's
up to you
so let's talk about some different
patterns first off just a couple of
basic reminders basic terms so
server-side rendering is the thing
you've been doing for a long time where
you build the page on the server and
send it to the client so the page grabs
everything and a page update reloads the
whole dom right this is old-school but
it still has its place client-side
rendering the server gives you a
template page with some CSS and
JavaScript JavaScript does xhr or fetch
hopefully builds the page page reloads
change the dynamic content now a lot of
people think that client-side rendering
is always better maybe maybe not because
the problem is the time it takes to load
all of this extra javascript sometimes
makes your app slow classic example was
twitter twitter was one of the first
places to go from server side rendered
to a front end only html5 single page
app and then about a year later they
reversed course because what they
discovered was this when you build a
single page app think about the load
cycle that you go through you load the
page great you load the CSS you load all
the JavaScript and only after you have
all the JavaScript can you make network
network requests and start building the
page that slows you down
so server side rendered page you could
slap some content up there maybe it's
not interactive but it could be on the
screen and then you load your scripts in
the background
so what one thing there's two things you
could do here one is you could use
server-side rendering but cache the
common files the stuff that shows up on
every page and then for offline use if
you get static pages from the server you
can stick those in the cache right when
you're online you grab the static pages
you can hang them in the cache you're
done and add special code for offline
mode just to tell the user hey you're
offline you're not going to be able to
browse to these things so detecting
offline use I mentioned earlier there's
a navigator online property or you can
listen for on and offline events that
cache client-side rendered you know
basically cache your single page up your
core code your CSS your template page
now cache API or index DB how do you
make the decision cache API takes
anything that takes a URL everything
else typically goes into index DB now
there's exceptions like has anybody seen
the Pokedex PWA there's a Pokemon one
so they're actually caching the images
in the databases blobs it made more
sense in that application the way things
are being pulled up and manipulated the
nice thing when you've got an offline
client-side rendered is when you're
offline you could save user actions for
replay so in an e-commerce app somebody
might set up an order anybody use Gmail
offline so Gmail actually supports
offline mode and you can sit there and
write emails and basically queue them up
for sending when you get back on the
network
okay so fine tuning the app shell we're
actually back at kind of where you're
starting to say earlier about the data
can live somewhere in network or the
cache and how you start
basically what you fetch in which order
is a design decision that you need to
make so the first one what most people
do is cash first or cash only
which is you cache the files and you get
them from there
now cache first means grab it from the
cache display that and then go to your
network and see if there's something
newer any ideas what what kind of data
you might use this for sorry so maybe a
newspaper article something that changes
less frequently but you still want the
current version metadata for the site
you could do this way things that change
infrequently but you really want the
latest now the one thing to watch out
for is if you do this then what you
should do is if you get your data tell
the user if they're reading a current
article if you get a new one don't just
change it on them put a little note on
the screen saying hey I've got newer
data can I update it actually another
interesting place you get this is user
icons you return icons change
infrequently so you get them from the
cache first and then revalidate so cache
their network so network first with a
cache fallback what would you use this
for always asking the network and if it
can't get something from the cache any
guesses right time sensitive data stock
prices in e-commerce like levels of
things in the store weather information
you know anything that can change live
but giving the user some information
even if it's old is better than nothing
just as long as they know it's old
there's another one here that's kind of
interesting you're not going to use a
whole lot the cache Network race this
one's kind of weird you throw the same
request to the network in the cache how
many people assume the cache is always
going to win hi did write the cache
should be faster than the network except
when you've got a really old computer
right if you've got a really old
computer with a slow drive on it or a
network file system that's slow it could
take longer to get something from the
cache than to get a fresh one from the
network this is a pretty rare condition
you'll probably never run into this in
practice
shaky networks well but your cache will
come back first usually because it's the
local storage this is really for if the
cache storage for whatever reason is
going to be super slow you could throw a
race out there and ask for both some
people also use cache network race is
kind of a cheap version of get it from
the cache and then revalidate on the
network but in this case you actually do
kind of want to do them in the cache
first Network fallback
so cache network race is pretty weird
you don't use it very often if the user
clears the cache then it depends how
your apps written you know if your app
if your if the user dumps the cache and
your app is offline well no more offline
experience for that user until they go
back online and they reload and the
serviceworker builds a new cache so the
other thing is clearing the cache will
also remove the serviceworker control
script so the next time would be a brand
new serviceworker
the serviceworker by the way you notice
when we did a list of files to cache we
didn't include the serviceworker j/s the
serviceworker automatically caches its
own control file and does a detection
every time you go to create a new
service worker it doesn't detect whether
the new file is has been updated and if
it's not been updated uses the old
worker if it's been updated creates a
new one so I mentioned all these
strategies the good news is you don't
actually have to write code there's a
tool I've mentioned before called
sw-toolbox that's a library it's
it's on github google chrome /sw -
toolbox and it's a bunch of caching
strategies that we've written for you
now they've got some extra features in
here like you can not only specify the
strategy for a cache but you can say
things like the lifetime of the catch
the maximum size maximum number of
entries so we have logic all written
through that to do that kind of cache
management
somebody was asking me earlier well what
you know like if I have something in a
cache that's in a session and it times
out how do I you know handle it
use this just put a timeout on the cache
or use this and modify one of those
algorithms to take into account the
timeout on that object the other
interesting tool is sw-precache but
we'll need to talk about gulp before we
go very far into that sw-precache is a
code generator tool you tell it what
paths and files you want cast in your
application and it writes a
serviceworker for you again open source
under google chrome so it hooks in your
build process usually gulp or grunt or
whatever you like to run web pack it
writes the serviceworker for you it also
deals with things like content changing
and cache busting it will actually
generate the hash codes for each file
and append them to the URL and detect
when the file changes and grab the
latest so it's all that code that you
would really have to write to build a
professional-grade app already written
for you
then to finish the PWA you know you've
seen the manifest file manifest file for
Android for other browsers include meta
tags there are very specific ones there
in the there in the lab notes in the
textbook so the meta tags make this work
on Safari at least for home screen
install and a special manifest file on
Netscape it's kind of a pain having to
do three different things but this is
one thing is not yet fully standardized
and for push actually we've talked about
push at length when you get the push
message it gets delivered to the
serviceworker serviceworker pops up the
notification and that wakes up your app
we'll go into the details later and so
for high-performance apps let's talk
about the recommended order so I told
you the Twitter story so what did
Twitter wind up doing because they said
well shoot the front end only
application is slower so what they
started doing was they started doing
server-side render of the page and then
once that page displays which displays
very quickly they a sync load the rest
of the scripts to connect to the network
and then start grabbing fresh tweets so
the server-side render once and then do
a takeover and that's exactly what we
recommend is that you design an
application shell server-side render the
initial page defer async load any
scripts that you need that you don't
need for initial rendering let them come
in later cache them and then use
JavaScript to grab anything else and do
a takeover it gives you really high
performance apps and it's not hard to
write the next way to do it is an app
shell and use JavaScript to grab once
the app shell is loaded kind of what
you've done before and server-side
rendering the next best is to a
server-side render the whole page and
cache it and then the slowest would be
to do full client-side rendering
basically your standard single page app
so people have asked me about angular
angular 2
has actually been designed with this
first approach in mind it's written in
Universal JavaScript so you can run it
on the client or the server and get the
same render that's designed to do a
takeover so real-world examples I will
actually leave this up to you to go look
through some of these I'd love to see
some of your stuff show up here it's
kind of an old list and then the
resource was care ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
