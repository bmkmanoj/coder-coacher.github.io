MRIDULA MALLYA: Hi, everyone.
I'm here with JP,
who is the program
manager for certification.
Hi, JP.
JP SOUCHAK: Hi.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK, it's
good to have you here.
So how is your
experience at GDD India?
JP SOUCHAK: Oh, it's
fantastic-- the passion,
just everyone's
experience, just the love.
Everyone is always
excited to be here.
I've been before in
India with developers.
And I'm just always
honored to be here.
And it's a great experience.
MRIDULA MALLYA: And I know you
have a certification lounge
at GDD India.
But I heard you did an
information session.
So could you tell our viewers
back home what that was about?
JP SOUCHAK: Right.
So our information
session was really
about the history and process
to become a certified developer.
We talked about
Android certification,
web certification.
We also talked about some
of the cloud certifications
that are offered.
We really focused on
what was the origin,
why did we bring this program
specifically to India.
They're global programs.
But we really care
about India, and that's
where our initial focus is.
So we talked about
how to prepare
to become a certified
developer, what the exams are
like, what kind of
benefits you might
get as a certified developer.
And it's an early
program, so some of this
is really early adopters
for certification.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK, awesome.
So you mentioned
things like reskilling.
Any developers
that you met today
who've gone through
certification program?
Would you want to share
any of their journeys
after being certified?
JP SOUCHAK: No, it's
some fantastic journeys.
We've heard of some developers
who basically got promotions
just because they
were certified.
Their employers weren't even
familiar with this program.
But they had this certification.
They trusted the program,
and they got promotions.
And some just got--
were concerned to be subject
matter experts in their company
because they have this
additional training,
this additional certification.
So I think what I'm noticing
is that even though this
is an early program, everyone
is really just loving what
we're bringing to the table.
We have over 300 certified
developers in India.
Many of them are reporting
getting jobs, getting
promotions, getting recognition,
being invited to talks,
being invited to just
present in front of a group,
being a leader then in
their G2G community.
Just fantastic, and it's still
early days for a certification.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK, so for
all the viewers back home,
how do they access the
certification courses?
JP SOUCHAK: Well, please
go to the link shown below.
That'll be the first
place in your journey.
Learn about the program.
You'll learn how to prepare
for the program if you need to.
You may already be
prepared to take an exam.
So you'll see all the ways
to sign up, take the exam.
And you'll learn about
some of the benefits
to being a certified
developer as well.
MRIDULA MALLYA:
OK, thank you, JP.
And we heard there are cupcakes
being given out at your lounge.
JP SOUCHAK: Not anymore.
I think they're
all gone right now.
But we do always give out
cupcakes at our events.
MRIDULA MALLYA: OK.
JP SOUCHAK: Yes.
MRIDULA MALLYA: All right.
So thank you so much, JP.
