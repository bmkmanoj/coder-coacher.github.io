not today who is a Google developer
expert for products strategy can you
tell us why product strategy in the
first place it's a fascinating field
it's a lot more about human psychology
then about technology do you meet tons
of people with interesting ideas who say
hey how can I take this to reality how
can I build a product out of it in India
especially you find that people struggle
with the fact how do you get an idea and
how do you really take it to market
right everyone tells you about this but
you can say get to know customers better
get to know business better get to
marketing better do a little bit of UI
engineering and so on but we need delve
deeper it's it's so much more richer Bob
that was quite interesting how did you
get started with product strategy for me
the different journey began when I quit
Nokia and went solo
and I wanted to do things on my own
because you don't have a supporting
structure so my first client project
that's when I learnt the hard way that
you really need to set some deadlines
for yourself because when I started off
I started doing market research speaking
to customers and it took a very long
time till I finally had to say okay let
me start creating all this together
and I think yeah my learnings mean on
the way when I've been doing projects in
the first couple of projects that I did
but really the tests made for this so
there are a lot of developers and senior
professionals out there who have a lot
of passion projects what are your trips
to push themselves to finish those
projects and take it to the next level
some things that I'd suggest one is
spend a lot of time validating that idea
before you start building it go speak to
real users understand the world a little
more but also have deadlines for
yourself
and I'd say coach yourself on different
elements of what makes a product a
success it's not always just great
technology or UI there are multiple
factors around it they could be
marketing they could be a business model
like would be right pricing
understanding competition so a little
bit of learning around that would really
help socially not if I want to become a
GD for product strategy how do I become
one first thing is really build
curiosity for a product manager it's
important that you remain intensely
curious what everything get a horizontal
view
a lot of guys I speak to know they
industry well but to be a effective GD I
think they need to know multiple
industries and how product management
works they're really bring that
experience together and find some way to
share it back with the community if you
can help the community sort of build a
little more product thinking I think
then you're on your way thanks for
joining us if you're not quite
interesting insights that you shared
with us and the people who are watching
this video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
