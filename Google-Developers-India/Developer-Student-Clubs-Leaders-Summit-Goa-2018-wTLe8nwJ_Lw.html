launched in the middle of 2017 to ensure
that students are able to learn how to
explore the power of mobile in so many
different ways welcome to the first ever
DAC summit from across the world we own
boarded 176 leads and then expanded to
190 student leads across 98 cities and
23 states these students organize
workshops where students are able to get
exposure to mobile skills once they have
the skills they then apply their skills
and solving a problem or explore an
opportunity for a local business all of
you you're all leaders you're not only
leaders you are the future generation
and you represent India so what's one of
the most obvious things that a leader
must do you gotta have a vision you got
to be able to persuade people to come
and buy into that vision that you're
presenting before them the DAC summit
was phenomenal I got to interact with
leads all over India we also had lots of
fun sessions right from learning how to
persuade people and we also had sessions
about technology we also got to do a lot
of hands-on experience being a dias
elite helped me improve my leadership
skills it helped me maintain a good
relationship with the fellow students
the faculties the management and
everyone else it gave me like a platform
where I provide people with solutions to
their problems it was such an amazing
experience it's not about just coding
it's not about just critical thinking in
computational programming it's about
your idea about how you solve a problem
why you come up to the solution so
that's the great thing that I can take
from the summit these are tips and
techniques that they're going to take
back to their campuses as they are going
to work with other students and enable
their learning experiences the potential
of students and what they are capable of
doing is something that is now
solidified and absolutely confident that
we are going to see magic happen as a
part of this experience
