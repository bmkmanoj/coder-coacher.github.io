MANORANJAN PADHY: Hey, everyone.
I'm Manoranjan Padhy, and
I'm at the Google I/O 2017.
Right now I have
Ankur Kotwal with me.
Ankur is the developer
advocate at Google.
Hey, Ankur.
How are you?
ANKUR KOTWAL: Great.
How are you?
MANORANJAN PADHY:
I'm doing good.
So I'm going to have a
few questions for you.
One of them are like--
there are a lot of developers in
India developing Android apps.
Do you have a message
for them, for how
they can be successful
in developing these apps?
ANKUR KOTWAL: I think being
successful in app development
has to do with
building a great app.
So have a great idea, execute
on it well, and then consider
some very specific
technical challenges
that you might face in India.
So you mentioned
Indian developers.
I'd probably say
there's three things
that developers could consider.
The first one is your APK size.
Keep your APK size
as small as possible,
because it makes it very easy
for users to get your apps.
The smaller it is,
the faster it's
going to download and install.
The second I'd say is
actually network conditions.
Be resilient to low
quality networks
or intermittent networks.
If you can make your app
independent of the network
quality, you'll have
a great experience
whether you have a
fantastic network
or whether you have
a weak network.
And the third one I'd say is
actually memory usage or RAM,
because when you start to
look at vast amounts of users,
they tend to have
some low cost devices,
and often those low cost
devices have less RAM.
So having your app work well
in low memory conditions
is going to treat you
well, whether you've
got a low memory
device or a device
with lots and lots of memory.
MANORANJAN PADHY:
How did you come
up with this three things in
the list or this list itself?
ANKUR KOTWAL: So
this list is actually
part of the building
for billions framework,
where we actually list
a number of things
that app developers can do
to reach billions of users
worldwide.
And that list, we
actually came up
with it talking to developers,
including developers in India.
They told us, it
was you guys that
told us how you're
optimizing your apps.
And then what we
did is we looked
to formalize those, and then
validate them, and then publish
it.
So
developers.android.com/billions.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Earlier in
the keynote today, [INAUDIBLE]
was talking about Android Go.
So do you have anything to
say about it or talk about it?
ANKUR KOTWAL: I'm really
excited about Android Go,
because what we're
going to do is
make a lighter version of
the Android operating system,
ship it with lighter apps,
and provide a Play Store that
highlights apps that work
great on Android Go devices.
So the building for
billions framework
is perfect, because if you
can adhere to that framework,
you're really
well-positioned to work well
on an Android Go device.
MANORANJAN PADHY: Thanks,
Ankur, for taking time for us.
And hope you have
a good I/O ahead.
ANKUR KOTWAL: You're welcome.
Thank you.
