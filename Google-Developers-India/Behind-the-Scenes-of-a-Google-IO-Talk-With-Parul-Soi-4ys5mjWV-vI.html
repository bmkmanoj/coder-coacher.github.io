hacker and she's going to teach us how
we're going to grow this application
booming is very socks4 you're the one
who bagged it so I've been working with
the firebase team for the past few
months and I had actually come up with
the concept that explains five of these
to product managers and five this team
was quite glad and happy with it so we
decided to do a blog series or video
series and then I submitted a proposal
for Google i/o because there were a lot
of new things being announced and using
the pilot matrix framework was would
have been a great way to explain it my
co-speaker Laurence Moroney he submitted
the session around one and a half months
ago he think me one day and said hey pal
what's up I was like nothing just going
to bed he's like I have some news for
you your session has been selected for
Google i/o as they quite how that's
amazing and I was super excited it sunk
in
okay this is Google i/o this is not your
normal audience this is not the audience
that you were used to in India and then
it hits me
oh it's not only the audience in the
room but also the people who are
watching it life there I had like a
excitement and nervousness
you have to be honest I don't think so
I don't think so nobody's gonna stay up
at 2 a.m. and watch it or they can watch
it lit up since it will be it will
always stay on the internet so if I make
a mistake it's gonna be there on the
internet forever performance in your
analyst in your AdWords analytics
account to measure whether you to just
notice do you notice the would see it's
fun if people notice it that's it
arias ot tomorrow know all the best
don't you go look I'm paranoid I'm
Laurence Moroney I'm doing here today to
talk to you about Pilate man you want to
identify who's worth more than the other
and then Taylor you thought it that's
why we need a really good retention
strategy for example if it is eating too
much network or bandwidth causing it to
slowly alter our through it
Android sustain it in the long time so
that's the Thomas case stances are
protected session
it was good with super fun more fun than
I thought it would be yeah I thought it
would be a little more nervous than I
was but the fact that he had a good
handle over the content once I saw the
audience being engaged early helped and
then he had good chemistry with me and
Lauren so that helped he's a goof up so
it helps to have someone I came around
who can always make you feel no fun if I
have a some container I have to also
create content say yes if I have some
good content and why now this is a great
experience well I really hope you guys
enjoyed this session there's a lot of
new things in firebase that you should
definitely check out this session would
have probably helped you provider
Cohasset picture of how you can use
firebase to track and improve pirate
message and pirate metrics is a very
great way for you to measure the success
of your product but there are a lot of
amazing new things that have been
launched in firebase so I definitely
recommend checking and checking all
those sessions out and yes hope you guys
enjoy
