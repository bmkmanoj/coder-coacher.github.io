work as a program manager on developer
relations so I'm going to talk to you
about backup and restore and Android
auto backup for apps was introduced in
marshmallow if you are 23
and it's a way for developers to quickly
add backup functionality for their apps
auto backup preserves app data by
uploading it to users Google Drive
account where it's protected by users
Google account credentials talking about
our goal Google is heavily investing in
making switching between Android phone
seamless as a user we all know that
setting up applications on a new phone
can be really frustrating
we all have set up new devices before
even though the applications are
reinstalled automatically they do not
return back in the same state as they
were on the old device at a minimum they
require us to login using the same
account credentials that we used some
time ago or the identity provider that
we use on our previous phone very often
we are presented with welcome flows
explaining the feature that we've been
using on a daily basis in the worst case
the progress in my favorite game has
been forgotten I have to start from
I have to start from scratch again think
think of yourself as gamers and you've
crossed like certain amount of levels
and now you switch over to a new device
and you have to start from beginning
this can be really frustrating for
dedicated users of your app as an
example think of The Weather Channel app
set up with your preferences list of
cities you care about the most and a few
alerts that you set up for yourself when
you switch over to a new phone you
presented with same login screen again
like you're using it for the first time
asking you to enter your username
password or the identity provider you
use now you need to go down memory lane
and remember which which exact
combination that you use there so once
you cross that hurdle then you see the
settings and alerts are set back to the
so again you go back the same memory
lane and remember which exact settings
you had placed you had set up an alerts
and then set them up again this can be
really painful for for user of your app
ideally this is where we would like to
be the user doesn't need to log in again
he is just presented with the same exact
screen that he left off on the ozone and
all the alerts and preferences are also
backed up through through Auto backups
so this is ideally where we would like
to be and this experience seems more
seamless for the user you must be
wondering what the incentives are for
for the developers why should you care
backing up app data can reduce user
frustration when switching devices hence
increasing user loyalty to your app
increasing the number it also increases
the number of logged in devices and
reduce support calls recently we did a
we did a case study for smart lock and
we found out they had 20% reduction in
in the amount of support calls they were
getting for forgotten username or
password this also increases your user
engagement with your app and also
handles users that never login because
they simply can't remember their login
or password so avoid user turn improve
UX and be a good citizen how could you
do that as you mentioned before throwing
up a blank login screen to returning
user on a new device can cause
unnecessary churn and prevent users from
re-engaging if they've already used your
app in the past you can pre-populate
login information
skip the Welcome flow and transfer over
settings and other Singh states
basically giving them a seamless
experience when they switch over to a
new device the goal is to preserve as
much app state as possible so that users
stay engaged so how does daily backup of
app data happen daily the application
data is backed up on Google Drive on a
nightly basis either when the device is
idle or charging and on Wi-Fi auto
backup won't happen if the device is
never connects to Wi-Fi but Lee
this backup is stored and the previous
one is deleted and usually a lot of
thought of app developers run into
coding limitations because by default
all app data is backed up but developers
have controlled through the app manifest
to control which pads need to be
explicitly included or excluded but no
code changes are required to make this
work
when a user sets up his new phone their
applications are installed at the time
of installation application data is
downloaded from drive and store locally
when the application is started it
appears as if it was started on the old
device so let's you must have heard
about key value backup which was
introduced in Froyo I'm going to quickly
compare it to auto backup which was
introduced in marshmallow so the Deb
effort required for key value backup is
minimum or medium apps must implement a
backup agent the backup agent defines
what data to backup and how to store
data how to restore data for auto backup
as I mentioned before the amount of
effort required is very minimum and by
default all of the app data is backed up
but you can use xml rules to include or
exclude files so that your app doesn't
run into core element issues for storage
key value backup allows up to five Meg's
per app and for auto backup the storage
is 25 max for app and the data is stored
directly into Google users Google Drive
so as you mentioned in the last slide
auto backup is extremely low effort for
developers and backs up almost all your
data by default all of your app files
were default but you can use custom XML
included school rules to control exactly
what gets backed up now we're going to
spend about 20 to 30 minutes working on
auto backup core labs using that short
link that's over there under auto backup
there's some amazing TAS in the audience
we're gonna help you just raise your
hand and they'll be there to help you
can can the tiers quickly raise your
hands
see them around they're all spread out
so if you need any help
they'll be here to help you out that's
the feedback form link will really
appreciate if you can give if you can
take three to five minutes to provide us
with feedback of where we are currently
and where we where would you like us to
be in the future and finally we're
looking for some case study candidates
so please reach out to me if you're
interested once we're done with the code
labs my coworker Sean will be talking
about some login solutions that you can
use today thank you
alright let's go ahead and start the
second section so I want to introduce
myself I'm Sean McClelland and I'm gonna
be talking to you about optimizing login
so pretty talk to you about auto-backup
which is great for moving settings and
other synced state but it's not really
secure enough to transfer login data
from your old device to the new device
it's important to do both of these
things since users can be frustrated if
their settings are lost today I'm going
to talk about three features on the
Android platform that you can use to
optimize login when users get a new
phone Google sign-in smart lock and
autofill the first one we're all pretty
familiar with already so it's a one
button login solution users can log in
with their gmail account or any email
address and if you think about it a user
that uses Google sign-in instead of
going through a complicated set up form
it's gonna spend less time signing up
for your app and more time using your
app so they're probably going to be more
engaged earlier on Google sign-in has
been measured to lift registration and
activation and combined that means
you're going to have more users on your
app if you adopt a Google assignment you
can implement the exact same sign-in
flow on iOS Android and web when you use
Google sign-in and I really wanted to
talk about Google sign-in when it comes
to account creation here because it's
probably the highest value thing you can
do to move numbers in your app adding a
one button login really makes users get
into your app and find the feature
that's going to engage them faster today
we're gonna work a code lab on smart
lock so that's another feature it's a
password manager so what it does is it
stores passwords for your users in the
cloud and then offers to restore them on
the next phone so it has a great UX and
it's backwards compatible to API 9 and
this is one of the main reasons to
consider using smart lock is the
compatibility story is fantastic it's
pretty much all of the devices that
you're supporting are going to support
some our luck and all of your users are
going to get this feature users are
prompted to save their password after
they log in and it will save to the
cloud if they decide not to save their
password it won't bug them again will
actually remember that never press
it's pretty much permanently for their
account I'm going to come back they'll
be prompted to log in with their
Safety's our name and password and this
is where smart lock really shines
because a user with a password will be
able to log into your app similarly to
the flow that they had with Google
sign-in so they can just hit that Jane
button and log in and start using your
app on their new phone so pratik mention
this but one of the big case studies we
had for smart lock was Netflix so
Netflix adopted smart lock and they use
it in Chrome they use it in Android and
they use it on Android TV and they found
that they had a 20% reduction in log and
related support requests which for them
is a huge deal they get a lot of log and
related support requests a lot of users
and that saves them a lot of money and
more importantly because users are
successfully logging in on the new
devices they have more engaged more
active users who are able to actually
use the app in more places so this is a
great way to kind of keep that retention
number up when you run out of other
options to lift your attention so smart
lock has a great backwards compatibility
story the autofill framework is brand
new it has no backwards compatibility
story your user has to be on Android Oh
so autofill similarly to smart lock will
offer to save user information when they
fill out forms in this case we're saving
a password to a autofill provider called
password manager autofill will also save
other information like credit card data
it'll also save dates it'll save
anything you provide the autofill
service beautiful service can carry that
over to another install or offered
autofill it later when autofill is
saving a password it actually works just
like smart lock so it's kind of a little
bit interesting here so we have smart
lock which is backwards compatible and
then we have autofill which is brand new
and they kind of end up working together
in this really cool way so autofill will
save the passwords to the same place
that we saved a smart log passwords and
if smart lock is used on Chrome for
example or on a older Android device
you'll they'll be able to use smart lock
to log in there are several autofill
service this is kind of an interesting
part about autofill that we've
implemented on Android
so we've made out of filled with Google
which is a great autofill provider
that's going to come with all the funds
that you get in the next couple months
and then other people are making other
autofill services as well so a classic
example is LastPass is going to be
providing an auto fill service so other
providers will be creating autofill
services and your users will configure
that at the phone level no for most apps
in order to configure autofill you just
have to update the XML and here's an
example of an edit text that I've
updated so I'm just gonna set the auto
fill hint to password says this field is
a password I don't actually have to do
that the autofill service will try
really hard to look at the form and
guess what kind of field it is and it
gets it right you know some of the time
but since you're developing you know a
polished app and you want to have a
great user experience this is the way to
make sure that the autofill service gets
it right and doesn't put the users
password in to the email address Moodle
I you should also set important for
autofill this will exclude a field from
auto fill and the reason that you want
to do that so you'd say like important
for autofill know and that'll be
something you want to do for something
like a spreadsheet or a CAPTCHA during
login where you don't want the auto fill
service to be saving that information
because it's not something that should
be auto filled when the user comes back
to the app and for most up this is all
the API you ever need for autofill
there's a bunch of advanced features you
can use if you have a more complicated
app and you can check out the
documentation on developer.android.com
for more advanced features now something
that's really interesting is smart lock
and autofill work together in a really
seamless way so today we're gonna be
working a smart lock code lab and we're
gonna implement smart lock in a
demonstration app when you run this
demonstration app on Android Oh like an
emulator or a pixel phone you'll find
that you will get the autofill UI
instead of the smart lock UI and that's
actually really important to know sort
of autofill we'll be showing as the
smart like UI going forward after
Android oh so
get an app ready for autofill and other
things that's really important to do if
a lot of your users use Chrome and a
website to log in they've probably
already saved their autofill data in
Chrome we can share the passwords
between those autofill services but if
you think about it like we can't just
give your users password to any random
app that's not super secure and your
user probably doesn't want that sort of
security model so in order to allow
those passwords to be shared between
Android and Chrome you can host a
digital asset link and this will let the
autofill services know that a specific
app signed with a specific key is linked
to the autofill data from a particular
website so you would do this for your
app and your website and say that a
password from this website can be shared
with this app and a password from this
app can be shared with this website and
you probably already familiar with this
because you have to do this if you
support deep linking in your app so if
you want to intercept a link and open a
specific page of your app digital asset
links are how you capture that in the
Android system okay so we're ready for a
second code lab the links at the top and
then I actually wanted to cover one
thing before we moved on so there's a
couple questions about how auto backup
works this might say so auto backup is a
service that runs on the Android
operating system and every night it
checks all of the apps to see if an auto
backup should happen and it uploads any
apps that have changed files so it's
it's something that's at the Android
level there's no you know it's actually
your users don't run adb commands to
kind of clarify a question that a couple
people had so be sure to fill out the
feedback after you work the second code
lab and again let pratik know if you're
interested in joining a case study thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
