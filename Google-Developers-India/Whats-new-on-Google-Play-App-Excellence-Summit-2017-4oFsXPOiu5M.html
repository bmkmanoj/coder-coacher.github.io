director of iPad Google Play who will be
joined leader by focus worldly product
manager Google Play good morning
everyone it's wonderful to see so many
of you here the room is absolutely
packed and it's fantastic to see the
growth in there so you're almost in one
room the growth in the developer
ecosystem in India which is growing
hugely rapidly it's amazing that we've
managed to fill this room and we still
have folks in the overflow in the
overflow room thank you to all of you
who have made the journey to be here I
know many of you have flown from every
corner of India says wonderful you've
made the journey and I think you're
going to find today very very worthwhile
so I'm going to be talking a little bit
about what's new with Google Play um
before we dive into what you would play
though I thought it's worth just looking
at some of the latest stats with both
Play and the Android ecosystem so some
of you might know that with Android we
are now activating 1.5 million devices
around the world every single day and
that growth is absolutely phenomenal it
means the total number of active devices
is growing very very fast and earlier
this year as Poorna momentum we've we
announced we've now passed 2 billion
active Android devices which is
absolutely phenomenal and this scale is
giving an unprecedented opportunity for
developers like you to reach what's
almost a third of the world's population
now so an absolutely extraordinary
opportunity as the number of Android
active Android devices grow of course
what we're seeing is the number of
installs are growing and we're now
installing 82 billion apps every year so
really staggering opportunity for all of
you
now this increase in app installations
is lovely translating into success for a
lot of developers now Google is a very
very metrics driven company and we track
a lot of metrics and in the Play
business one of the metrics we track is
how many apps are reaching 1 million
monthly installs and the reason we track
that is it's a very very good indicator
how many developers are building really
large successful businesses on the back
of android and play and the wonderful
news is we've seen over the last year a
35% growth in the number of apps
achieving 1 million monthly install so
absolutely phenomenal it's really great
to see so many developers building big
successful businesses on the back of
Android now getting your apps installed
on users devices is only step one of the
equation if you're going to build a
successful profitable business you need
to add John talked about you need to be
able to monetize your app and you know
many of you monetize your apps with ads
we want to build paid paid downloads
in-app purchases as a second
monetization opportunity for all of you
and plague has been investing very very
heavily in building a world-class
ecommerce platform now as you can see on
the screen we now accept credit cards in
135 countries around the world
we've got carrier billing with 140
carriers in 55 countries we sell gift
cards in 700,000 locations in over 30
countries makes that PayPal in 20
countries so the sheer scale of this
payment platform is creating huge
opportunity for all of you to reach very
very large numbers of paid users with
your apps now as a result of this more
people are buying and paying for your
apps than ever before and in the last
year the number of paid buyers on play
who's growing 30 percent year-on-year
and in particularly seeing a huge growth
in the number of users that are
subscribing so paying daily or monthly
for a subscription for us for an app and
the number of subscribers has grown to X
in the last year all sorts of apps are
running subscription from video on
demand to dating to today's and it's
great to see so many app developers
turning on subscriptions as another
payment method for their users now when
we talk to subscribers
we ask them health and they use the
subscription apps once they start
subscribing and what we're being told is
that 62% of subscribers use the app
they're subscribing to on a daily basis
they're absolutely phenomenal engagement
now when we look at subscriptions the
business has really skyrocketed three
years ago we were Temper sense of what
we are today so subscriptions on players
grown 10x in the last three years and
that creates a huge opportunity for all
of you to make more money more regularly
and more reliably than before and to
support your capturing this momentum
we've enabled new functions within our
subscription API and we've also turned
on analytics for subscriptions in the
Play console we're also continuing to
invest very very heavily in letting play
reach users or new types of devices now
in the last year we've gone and launched
to play in daydream so that those be
building VR apps can start reaching
users on on our VR platform daydream and
we've also turned on play for
Chromebooks which many of you will know
are the most in some segments now the
most popular type of laptop in the world
and beyond that we've been investing
very very heavily in multi-screen
devices so Android wear we launched two
Android web 2.0 which has new watch
faces and new ways to build useful apps
we're investing very heavily in Android
TV and I think over the last year we've
seen the number of Android TV devices on
the market really skyrocket you're going
to continue to see very very strong
growth there over the coming year we've
turned on the Google assistance on
Android TV as well so we're investing
very very heavily there as well many of
you will have seen potentially
experimented with instant apps so
instant apps are a new type of app that
close the gap between websites which are
very easy to get to but slightly harder
to pull functionality for and apps which
have a hurdle of installation but build
really great functionality with instant
apps without the user installing
anything they can have app functionality
as your app is modularized and a module
if your app downloads to the users
devices you can get app functionality
without the hurdle of install and
users like your app then they can go on
to install it we've seen success with
early testers like Vimeo and IO this
year we announce that we've launched
Android we've opened up Android instant
tapster to every developer so hopefully
we're going to see many of you trying
with android instant apps as well and
then finally Android go so earlier this
year we announced Android Go which is an
optimized version of Android for the
next billion users for developing
markets and for those of you deciding to
develop for Android go this is going to
give you access to literally billions of
new users so the tons of investment we'd
be making across many many platforms to
enable you to reach way more users than
you used to be able to reach even a year
ago um just as smartphones and tablet
computers and we've also started
investing very heavily in recognizing
app quality so we've launched the early
access program which gives you access to
23 million beta testers for your
platforms these are really engaged users
you can launch your app just to the 23
million beat testers you can get
feedback from them and once you've
incorporated that feedback into your app
you can then go and launch your app to
the wider world on Play and from day one
of having your app launched you should
be able to get very high ratings from
your users we're also very actively
engaging the envy developer community
because we really want to find the
highest quality apps and their creators
and showcase them to the world so within
the Play Store we've launched the indie
corner where we recognize what we think
are the best in the dumb independent app
developers so the users can find really
great apps from indie developers and
then finally we've done launched the
Google Play Awards where we reward
developers that have developed really
really great apps um finally and to
encourage investment in quality we've
also tuned our algorithms I am that
decide on which apps we recommend in the
store to take account of user engagement
not just the number of installs so the
higher quality our apps are the easier
it's going to be for users to find them
in the store and for you to grow your
user base
so the key here is please make quality
apps now I know that sounds super easy
but of course it's very difficult and
all if you know that but obviously we're
here to help
now Google IO earlier this year we
introduced a whole new set of tools to
help you improve the quality of your
apps more easily and we're joined here
by Fergus our product manager of the
play console who's going to explain this
in more detail so Fergus please welcome
to the stage
let's say hey I great to be here I lived
in India for three months nearly ten
years ago as students and it's great to
see so many people investing in a PEC
Slim's here and I'm excited to show you
some of the new tools we're going to
make available to you so at Google i/o
we relaunched the Play Developer console
at the Play console we realized that a
lot of our users who come to the Play
consoles even though they work at
companies they're building apps they're
not developers themselves and there are
a lot of tools in the play console that
can help your team find more success so
we redesigned the console you're using
material design and made it more easy to
navigate and enables you to be able to
have your team who are working on let's
say the marketing creative are the
design are the customer support to be
able to come and feel like it's a
welcoming place for them to so encourage
the rest of your team who may not be
here today to start using it as well we
have two sessions later today
talking about a lot of the tools that we
are making available in the Play console
help you improve the app excellence of
Europe we take up excellence at Google
extremely seriously we have a full team
of product design and engineering
dedicated to building these tools for
enabling you to achieve app excellence
and I'm going to focus on two of them
right now putting the afternoon sessions
here about a lot more than before I jump
into the tools let's say who thinks that
app excellence is important and up right
you came to the right event all right
what we found by looking at the reviews
on Google Play which we have over a
billion written reviews we found this
50% of the 1 star reviews are talking
about the stability issues so if you
want to be able to increase the star
rating of your ass the fastest way for
you to do that is improve the stability
of your application then once you fix
those issues you want to go to that
being a 5 star application the best way
to be able to do that slow down speed
design and usability one of the main
tools we have to help you doing this
is the pre-launch of work this is a tool
that enables you to be able to upload
your app to the alpha or beta Channel on
the Google Play console and within less
than an hour you get a report back of
how your app performs on ten physical
Android devices running in a Google Data
Center this involves a robot a virtual
box interacting your application for
about five minutes and running different
languages and it shows you the crashes
that are detected it shows you a video
of the bot interacting your application
it shows you the screenshots of what
your app looks like in these different
languages and it shows you any security
and privacy of our abilities that we've
checked to your application and since
last year when we announced it at Google
i/o we have great success with it with
the product and in terms of adoption
we've had sixty percent plus of the top
thousands developers on Google Play
using the tool we have had over a
million apks tested and over 10 million
robot crawls of the applications if you
go to the screenshot section of the
console in the pre-launch report you'll
be able to see that we actually have a
device dedicated to Hindi as well so you
can be able to see why your app looks
like and in your in the users that are
using your application
the next major initiative we have to
help you improve the quality of your
application is Android BIOS Android BIOS
is a new initiative at Google to help
improve the stability and performance of
Android devices we're making a big
investment in this area and you're going
to see many metrics launched over the
next year to help you in this area I'm
going to talk about some of those
metrics and the next slide
but to really help you be able to focus
your attention in this area what we do
is we take the top I house mask and we
look I water the bottom 25% of 25% of
those asked for that metric and if you
fall within the bottom 25% we flag your
app as having a bad behavior derails to
really understand okay I'm not doing
what
compared to top app for this metric to
even really focus on okay this is an
area I need to look into whereas a lot
these are the ones I'm actually doing
okay I don't need to spend as much time
on the three major performance areas
that we have right now
our stability so we have the crashes
main or section in the playing at Play
Developer console and this has been
there for many years actually but we've
relaunched this with the crashes naen
ors from users who have opted into
sharing their device diagnostics and
usage data with Google and our partners
you guys this enables you to be able to
see in a lot of cases 10x more data than
you were able to see in the previous way
we selected where users had to self
report each individual at crashing a an
or event you can be also be able to see
the crash rate and ANR a itself so you
may have to see how is this over your
user base right now its lowest on pixel
and Nexus devices we're going to be
expanding to a lot more devices over the
next couple of months so add the next
area we have is battery where we show
you stuff wakelocks and this enables you
to be able to see the wakelock name so
you can be able to focus on fixing that
and and then if you have if you don't
use weight loss you can move on to the
next area which is excessive wake up and
this is where you can be able to see the
weight loss and tagname as well and
we're going to have a session later
today to show you how to debug those
issues and using Android studio and a
bunch of other tools that we have
available and what other ways you can be
able to implement the same functionality
within your application in rendering
which we are hoping you'll be able to
provide your users with a silky smooth
experience within the application we
show you when you have frozen frames
where there's 700 milliseconds lag
between frames and we show you when you
have slow rendering where 50% are more
of your frame take longer than 16
milliseconds to load
this is available right now in the play
console now you just need to go in and
there's a section called Android files
and you can go in there and yeah you can
be able to see the data for yourself for
your own application if you don't have
data there right now it's probably that
you don't have enough users on the
devices that we support as of today but
keep coming back to check it out over
the next couple months as we add more
devices and more metrics to be able to
help you be able to understand the
performance of your application one of
the reasons why you should take this
seriously is because it's aren't to be
included in the search ranking and
discovery in the Play Store itself so if
you want to be able to be featured and
ranked well in the store you need to
invest in improving the performance of
your application and now we're providing
you the data to be able to start taking
it seriously and improving it first we
want to provide it before it's actually
completely implemented in the ranking
which will happen later this year thank
you very much everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
