JP SOUCHAK: Hi, I'm JP.
CYRIL: Yeah, I know you, man.
I've seen you in the Firebase.
JP SOUCHAK: Oh!
Oh, you saw me in the
Firebase First, yeah.
I'm the guy that worked on the
developer certification, which
you've earned.
And we came here to give
you this certificate.
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
JP SOUCHAK: And you are one of
the first alumni of the program
worldwide.
How did you find out
about certification?
And what do you feel that
certification will do for you?
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI: Basically,
I found out about it--
well, I read it.
It has increased my level of
confidence, and just a thing
to boast around to my
friends and colleagues
that I have the certification
from Google itself.
I've been born and
brought up in Mumbai.
My mom passed away when
I was five years old,
so my grandparents have been
taking care of me since.
SPEAKER 1: How did you feel
like when he started building
Android apps or computer sites?
SPEAKER 2: I was very happy.
And of course, I'm
proud of him, also.
It's my grandson.
He's very good in studies.
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI: When I was
in the third or fourth grade,
I started using
computers in school.
I used to get around
30 minutes for myself.
I had no idea about the
internet and all that stuff.
So the computer was
basically like playing games
until around 9th or 10th grade.
I got a computer for
myself at my place,
and I started using
various applications.
I was just astonished
that you could develop
particular software so that
others could use it and benefit
from it.
I always wanted to do that.
And then I promised
myself that I'll
learn the basics of
programming languages.
How it works, how a computer,
how a compiler works,
and all that stuff.
And I made the first Android
application in two weeks.
It was a keyboard application.
This first app, BusyKey,
it was a shortcut app.
You can edit the keyboard.
I still remember it.
I had recommended
it to my friends.
It was a good idea.
So from that, I knew
it would succeed.
I could tell you all
of the applications
that I've worked on, and
each and every application
has one major thing that
I've learned from it
about the Android ecosystem.
And a realization that I had
is that code is never perfect.
Currently, if I write code
based on all of the knowledge
that I have, it's the best
code I've ever written.
But if I see it after
two or three months,
I think to myself,
who wrote this code?
SPEAKER 1: What are the certain
challenges which you see around
you that you would
like to solve?
CYRIL MELWIN
PILLAI: Most people,
they have the resources
to connect to internet,
but they mostly use things
that aren't that useful.
Most of these younger generation
kids, they use Instagram.
I know it's good, and
people use Instagram,
and they are happy
sharing photos about it.
But when I look at the
app, I'm mostly stunned
by the UI and all
that sort of stuff.
Around sixth to seventh
grade, basic programming
has to be taught
to everyone else.
Basically, learning English
or Hindi or Marathi,
any of that stuff, a
programming language
should be a default so
they know how hard it is,
and how beautiful it is to
create what others could use.
And if everyone is working
at making life easier, then--
JP SOUCHAK: What a
beautiful world it would be.
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI: Yeah.
SPEAKER 1: You mentioned
about your dream
to come to Google Bangalore.
So you are coming over
there on Saturday.
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI: Yeah.
SPEAKER 2: But we have
brought another thing.
It's a full expense paid trip
to Google Mountain View in US.
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI: Oh!
That's awesome.
SPEAKER 2: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
CYRIL MELWIN PILLAI:
For the last two years,
I've been watching
Google I/O on my YouTube
app, your live streaming.
And this is a big deal.
Yeah, so that's a surprise.
And I'm speechless right now.
