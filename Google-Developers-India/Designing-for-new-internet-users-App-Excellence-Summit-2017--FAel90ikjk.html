please welcome Muzayun Muktar.
MUZAYUN MUKTAR:
Hello, everybody.
How are you feeling?
How is the day so far?
Awesome.
I'm excited, and we are actually
really excited that all of you
are here.
I'm a researcher.
I spend a lot of my
time being in the field,
observing people, seeing
how they utilize our apps
and how they make use
of these Android apps
that we are building.
I'm today also representing
two of my colleagues, Tracy
and Garan, who most recently
worked on YouTube Go, which
is a separate YouTube app built
specifically for new internet
users in countries like India.
And if you are looking
out to build apps for--
that really work very well
for such users, people
who are coming online
for the first time,
this talk is going to be
really, really helpful to you,
and we are glad
that you are here.
Well, the reality
of today's internet
is that most of its
growth is happening here
in India year over year.
2 billion new
internet users have
come online in just
past 15 years, mainly
from countries like India.
And for almost all of them,
their exposure to technology
has been purely on mobile
phones, not desktops.
And most don't even
have access to desktops.
These phones are
cheaper, slower,
and aren't always up to date.
The internet is relatively
a new concept to them.
It's expensive, it's slow,
and it's intermittent.
And rarely they ever get
a chance to use Wi-Fi.
So while universally we
are all human beings,
we might have had different
experiences in life.
We might have lived in different
cultures, different contexts.
But what we believe at Google is
that we can do a far better job
at designing experiences
that addresses
different constraints,
different technical know-hows,
and different mental models.
Over the past few years,
Google has spent a lot
in understanding how to
approach these challenges.
And we are excited to
share our framework
that we use within the
company to think about this.
This framework helps us to
make really usable and useful
products-- engaging products.
We will walk through two
important factors today,
and we'll provide
you really clear,
simple focused tips that
you can straightaway
apply on your products.
Let's start.
We'll start with
a usable bucket,
which focuses on a very simple
but most important question.
Can your product be used?
The three important
components-- concepts--
in that are cost, connectivity,
and compatibility.
First, cost, here
is a comparison.
For one gigabyte of data
that users use in US,
you would have to work a
little over 20 minutes.
To afford the same in India,
people work around 12 hours
to afford the same,
and typically, it's
going to be a flaky connection.
This is changing
from past few months,
but typically for these users,
data is much harder to come by.
And for that reason,
people really
value each MB that they spend.
Of course, we know in
India that prepaid--
people are using prepaid data.
Prepaid is where people do
not have to really commit
to an ongoing plan.
People are buying denominations
based on what they can afford
and what they foresee
as actually needing.
Therefore, they almost
like budget it out as they
find it's necessary.
Data is money for these people.
Well, how-- what about Wi-Fi?
So we know Wi-Fi is
rarely connected to,
because it's not accessible.
It's not available.
Globally, there is one Wi-Fi
hotspot for every 150 people.
And in India, it's lot higher.
That means one hotspot
for 3,900 people.
So in order to meet
the global average,
we will have to
install 8 million
more hotspots
throughout the country.
The point here is that
public Wi-Fi is rare,
making data that much more
precious that, far much more
expensive.
You might now be thinking
about Wi-Fi at home.
Do you know how many people
really have broadband internet
at homes?
Yeah, it's really, really less.
It's 1.6% of the
entire population
is subscribed to a fixed-line
broadband internet.
Therefore, these people,
if they're actually
accessing internet at home,
they are using mobile data.
In short, internet is
expensive, and internet
is rarely available.
So here's our
first tip for cost.
For data-heavy tasks, provide
transparency and control
over data consumption.
The example on the
right is from Google--
YouTube Go app.
In order to after
selecting the video,
users are given the control
to select the quality, what
quality of the video they want
to watch, so they see upfront,
know upfront how
much they are going
to be spending before they
actually commit on an action.
And we say specifically
for data-heavy tasks,
because this
transparency definitely
is not that
important for smaller
amounts, negligible
amounts, like 10 KB or so.
The second topic in the usable
bucket is about connectivity.
Of course, we know
that these people
who are coming online
for the first time often
have really slower speeds.
They use cheaper 2G,
cheaper 3G connections.
What is also
important to know that
according to one
of the studies, we
figured out that the
range of 3G network
calls succeed only 65%
to 80% of the times.
Crucial that most of us who
are trying to build these apps,
we have to acknowledge
and embrace intermittency.
That means flakiness.
Designers, as we develop
and work with developers
and design various states,
we are familiar with that.
We understand online, which
is a very ideal state.
We also design for partially
loaded states and error states.
A typical design thinks like--
it is thought through
as we are moving
from one online state
to another online state
to another online state.
Often, we also design for error.
Very hardly, we consider
slow flaky connections.
So when thinking about designing
for slows flaky connections,
we have added a few more states
to make it more comprehensive.
So while historically, we
know that only online is idle,
now offline is idle too.
In addition to showing
loading in progress,
we want to differentiate
between loading started
and then the progress--
then it is progressing.
On top of this, we
also have to take
account of no online content.
As we know that
more zooming the app
will be used in
offline usage, we
have to take account
of times when we really
don't have any content to show.
So instead, we might
actually look like this.
We have no offline content.
We start with that.
Loading starts.
Content is partially loaded.
And then we have a
fully rich online state.
And we definitely consider
offline as premium as online.
So accounting for
each step, we are
resilient for these slow
and flaky connections.
We have thought
through at each step.
There's an example.
This is our first
tip for connectivity.
Expect latency by
designing offline.
Design for the loading
retries, success experiences.
Make great connectivity
as your edge case.
That means designing
for the slow internet
speed is your primary use case.
Example from Chrome has added a
feature that downloads a page.
It allows you to
download the piece later,
allowing that state
to be far richer.
Another example is
from Search itself.
Without, if you search
without internet intentionally
or unintentionally,
Search will tell you--
it will give you a notification
when the result is ready.
Also the second tip
for connectivity
is allow offline usage.
That means that
offline, more people
can use in offline modes.
It helps keep the information
available when the data is off.
We of course, know
how Google Maps
helps navigate the
users when they are not
connected to internet.
The final component to
usability is compatibility.
Often very technical about
OSes and hardware, which
is of course really,
really relevant, here we
will only focus on the
design, and implications,
and how we have to consider
compatibility of devices.
Half of smartphones in India
are really low-end, below $100,
and sometimes even cheaper.
As you can imagine, the
hardware is not as premium.
They are not as great as the
premium devices that many of us
here use.
Screen resolutions are bad.
Also contrast is really bad.
Touch feedback is worse.
We're using slow processes,
so working with the developers
to figure out how best
can we design for that.
On top of that, many of
these people's first phones
are second-hand.
That means they're using--
phones are expensive
for them-- and they're
using someone else's phones
or also broken phones.
All of these contribute
to a ecosystem
that we have to take care of
and pay attention to every time
that we are designing
for such devices.
Here's a tip for compatibility.
So basically, support
screen rotation.
That means allow
users to use your app
in both the orientations.
That way, you will have
different button placements,
and user can use your app
even on broken phones.
Material design, of course,
gives you a lot of affordances,
a lot of different
various button options.
Choose the ones that
are most relevant
for these types of devices and
these types of mental models--
people's mental models.
What we have also learned from
field, like being with users,
we have understood that buttons
with the border or little drop
shadows, they seem to work
far better than plain text.
Here's our first tip
for compatibility.
Design larger, clearer,
farther apart affordances.
So example here is
from YouTube Go App.
The buttons are
big high contrast.
Also what we have understood
is pairing of icon
and the text helps
people to understand
what the affordances are about.
They can remember it.
Think of each of these items
to work as compensating
with each other.
In a way that if anything
gets lost in translation,
they can support each other.
So now we will move to the
next bucket that is useful.
Useful means is your app--
is your product valuable?
Is it really meeting
the needs of the user?
Is it of a good use?
In this, we cover
three main topics--
culture, content, and commerce.
Culture-- culture is the
way we do things here.
It manifests in different
variety of ways.
But for today, for
the time purposes,
we are going to
concentrate on one aspect.
That's information density.
These images are very,
very common sight in India,
very dense signages.
The point here is
that what is clutter
and not simple clean design
could be actually preference
to others.
And the point-- and while
we see these differences,
they can be really overwhelming.
But let's embrace
these differences.
Here's our first tip.
Show the breadth of everything
that is on your product.
Do not assume a mental model
and end up skipping details.
Here is an example
from Google Search.
It actually helps you
discover various categories,
gives you facts,
like current weather,
maybe news before actually
worrying about writing.
For these-- some of
these new internet users,
writing is added effort, and
it can be really hard also
to do it on small
mobile devices.
Another example is UC Browser.
It has a lot of bookmarks and
app launchers front and center.
The line between density and
clutter is a very tricky one.
Balance the meaningfulness
and hierarchy,
but the local aesthetics--
that's our next tip.
Don't Westernize everything.
Make sure that you are
using local aesthetics.
This way, your product
will be more relatable.
It may appear-- it may also make
people realize that you care
and pay attention to
cultural aesthetics.
A great example is
Google Allo stickers.
These stickers are
downloadable packages
that you can use
while you're chatting.
Not only can you
see that there is
a lot of local aesthetics
in it, but also common
phrases that they are using.
OK, let's move on.
The content is our
next important bucket
in the useful part.
One way content
manifests is language.
So the stats on the
English language
are really sometimes unreliable.
We say that we have 30%
of population in India
that can also speak English
whereas as 1/3 of it
is what actually people
can read and write.
So it's about 10% overall.
Interesting stat to
consider besides this
is that lot of people--
a lot of these new
internet users--
are using Android OS in
English, despite it not being
their first language,
despite them not being
able to read and write so well.
So what we need to do is we
need to make our English UI also
really simple.
First tip for that, use
short, simple, and very direct
English, so that you
have maximum clarity.
With that, we also want to
say that there is an example
that we have given where are--
it's an example which
we should not be doing--
[INAUDIBLE] YouTube
onboard flow,
there is a word
&quot;awesomeness.&quot; basically,
&quot;awesomeness&quot; does not
mean &quot;awesome&quot; or &quot;great&quot;
for many of the
vernaculars in India.
Second tip would be
to speak the language.
Offer regional languages.
English does not
work at many places.
Make language switching easy.
Example from Search itself,
you have English and Hindi side
by side.
Another thing that
we have learned also
is among these new
internet users,
they rely a lot on sharing--
sharing of information.
And what here you see
is on the YouTube Go,
we have clearer
share affordance,
centered underneath the
video with the title.
It's easy to
discover, and once you
realize you want to share your
content, you can click on this
and share the content
with the user.
Another thing that
you could do is here
is another manifestation
of the same--
how you can encourage
sharing of experiences
is by peer-to-peer
sharing feature.
On YouTube Go, we have a way to
allow people to share videos--
it's a social
currency, basically--
to any friend with a
really minimum use of data.
Final component in
useful is commerce.
Economies and the mental
models around money
are really, really different.
And there are different forms
of payment that we also know.
For design, we need
to understand one very
important aspect.
That's a discussion
that I would have wanted
to have with some of you--
is about the sachet
model of consumption.
People often buy small packages
say in shampoos and detergents.
They are low cost.
They're easily accessible.
And basically, it's about
trying an experience
a little by little.
That's essential,
especially when
people don't know
what the product does
or what the product
is useful for them.
Is it useful or not?
So what do you--
what's the tip for that?
Here is a tip.
Allow people to try and
see before they buy.
Provide the taste
of the experience.
And the example
here is Flipkart.
Flipkart heavily invests in
apps as well as in its web app.
People can see what Flipkart
is like after downloading--
before downloading the app.
Basically what
they do is people--
these users-- can
go online and see--
feel the experience
before they actually
commit on using the mobile
data, battery, and storage space
on their phones.
Another very good
example is YouTube Go.
When people can click on the
video, they see a preview.
They get an understanding
of what the video is about
before they commit on the
mobile data to download.
Remember that data
is really like money.
Another tip for commerce is
support alternate billing.
Less than 2% of India's
population uses credit cards.
It's really important
to figure out ways
that we can support
local forms of payment.
Here is an example from the
World Cricket Championship
app, which is a really famous
popular gaming up in India.
It allows you to pay from
your cellular deposit.
So like in India itself,
we have so many people
coming online every year.
Let's not forget while we are
humans, our context, culture,
and constraints are different.
We have to design for all of
those different experiences.
Thank you so much for
following along with me when
we saw how we can make
products more usable and useful
by these simple tips.
One last piece of
advice if I had
to give you other than
to follow this framework
would be to listen to users.
Meet them in personal
conversations.
Spend time with them.
See being there.
Observe how they use things.
Also get feedback
on your product
and ask the question why.
And therefore, make
sense out of that
and apply it to your products.
This framework is
a little bigger
than what I showed you today.
There are a lot more tips.
I would encourage you to go to--
it's published at
the ACM Interactions.
There is a link there.
Also, you can go to the link
developers.google.com/billions.
We constantly keep it updated.
And I'm also available
at the consultation zone.
I am happy to answer any
questions, any discussions
that you would like to have.
Thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
