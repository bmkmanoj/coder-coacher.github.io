generally using our api's because I'm on
the G Sui team most of the api's we're
gonna look talked about today
our G suite relator or Google Apps
alright so Gmail Drive app script
calendar sheets slides and all those
things so you'll be able to learn those
things but you're not restricted to just
those things once you learn how to use
Google API in general you can also use
the cloud platform stuff and other
Google services that connect to Apps
Script ok so today we're gonna show you
two different ways to programmatically
access G suite technologies and build
apps that use these tools that you
already know how to use right everybody
knows how to use Gmail I think everybody
knows how to use sheets and drive but
now we're gonna start coding those
things and by the time you're done with
these two code labs and you have enough
you will have enough information to get
started on a real projects so it's
really up to your imagination as to what
you can do with it afterwards ok ok so
each each code lab is about 40 maybe 30
to 40 minutes long so we're gonna be
together for the next 90 minutes and so
like I said we're gonna explore two
different ways two very different ways
of using Google developer tools and
api's and you kind of decide what you
are comfortable with okay because my job
is to make sure that you are successful
using our developer tools and if certain
things like slow you down make it hard
for you to get started I'm here to break
down those walls so that you don't have
any problems ok so that's really my job
some of you might know that I host the G
suite dev show on YouTube so every month
or so will come up with a different
video to show you a different way of
using a different G suite API and also
am a contributor to the blog as well as
our Twitter my background is I've been a
software engineer for more than 20 years
probably the most well known thing I've
ever I've done is I was one of the
original ten engineers that built yahoo
mail 20 years ago if
anybody has used yahoo mail before long
time ago in fact it was it was called
rocket mail that was the very first
version it was came out about eight
months after hotmail so we were the very
second web-based email system would come
out so there were 10 of us that did it
using Python and no one ever heard of
Python before in 1997 I also wrote some
books some Python books so if you know
those that's great but I've been a
teacher since before many of you were
born so that's not a typo it is 1983 so
I know a lot of you guys are much
younger than that so I'm very old okay
and I'm also of a Python community
member okay so we have some helpers
helping us today so I'm just going to
ask them to raise their hands as I
introduce them so we have Patrick back
there he he lives in Chennai so he's
pretty close right he's a local so he
can go find him later okay but he is a
Google developer expert which means that
he is not a Googler but he's as close to
a real Googler as possible and in fact
he knows more than some of us because he
makes his living working with G sweet
api's as well as GCP api's okay and then
we also have alex alex on the training
team he's back there he'll also help you
out with he's so he works on like I said
the Google developer training team so he
has helped put together multiple
training courses in the past and then we
have Roman Romans right there yep so
he's also a GDE
specifically for GCP and so he's helping
as well - all right I will tell you this
though the code samples we will do our
very very short there are only four
lines each so four lines for each code
lab but the most important thing is the
barriers that we break down not the
number of lines of code
once you get these four lines of code
working then the sky is the limit you
can do much more with it and it's only
what you can do in Europe once you can
think of in your imagination okay all
right so let's talk about the training a
little bit
and let's get started okay so first of
all I'm very happy to be at GDD India I
love coming to developer events when I'm
not making videos and writing blog posts
I like to go out and talk to developers
because I like to see developers build
exciting apps I like to see developers
become successful okay so that's really
my main job so I'm very happy to come to
events like this even if it's halfway
around the world for me you know I
haven't been in India in 16 years so
it's been a long time since I've been
here and so I'm very happy to be back
so namaskara all right yeah if you want
to know where I've been in India I've
been to more places and you guys have
okay
Mumbai Arang APOD Jaipur Delhi Agra
carajo Varanasi and now Bangalore or
Bengaluru okay so it's true you're
nodding your head because you know I've
been to more parts of your country than
you have okay why because you don't feel
like a tourist and if you go somewhere
far away they don't speak my language
and things like that okay I don't let
that bother me alright
wherever I go I try to learn one or two
words in a language just because I like
culture and I like meeting people
alright but I'm here today for you and
our job is to make you guys successful
okay so what are some of these things
well guess what these are tools that you
guys have seen many times before all
right these are our consumer tools you
have you search you have use YouTube you
have an Android device you've used
Chrome and you probably have used Google
Apps alright however that's only for
people who are users you guys are more
than users that's why you're here at GDD
you are a developer okay so while it's
true that my co-workers are happy to
produce tools like this for you we can't
write everything so we rely on you guys
to actually build things on top of our
stuff because we can't do it we don't
have time or the effort to go and write
an HR tool a payroll tool a benefits
tool travel app you know Metro app bus
and taxi app we don't have time to write
all those things but you can leverage
our technologies to help you do that
okay that's what our developer tools are
for so instead of using waiting for
Google to write a tool you can use our
technologies and write your own tool
whether it be for mobile or web or most
likely both right because in order to
succeed you really have to do both these
days okay you can't just do only one
okay however one problem people tell us
is oh you're a PRS are too hard to use
you know every time I try it like I
can't get past the OAuth it's really
difficult and I'm just you know I'm just
gonna do something else right so I don't
want that to happen so that's why my job
here is to fix it so that this is not
not not a problem for you as much okay
so we're gonna focus of course on G's
week because that's you know that's the
the the team that I work on but you can
leverage other Google developer tools to
not just not just these okay and by the
way so yes we used to be called Google
Apps but we changed the name of Jesus we
because a lot of times people ask me so
what do you work on at Google I say oh I
work on Google Apps and then people go
which one okay so it's kind of confusing
so we just want to make it you know like
it's called G suite because it is a
suite of tools to help people become
more productive all right so that's the
main reason why we changed the name okay
and there are many companies that use it
to become productive okay and it's also
used at a lot of schools too so it's not
just companies so it's used at companies
that use at schools and we don't Google
does not charge force to schools to use
it in the classroom so that's why you
know we have a lot of students that that
know how to use they know how to use G
suite okay okay
so bring up your laptops and go to the
first code lab okay so we are going to
do Google Apps Script now so this will
introduce you to this this technology so
it's at the link that you see on the
screen there so we have this really cool
JavaScript environment and we have an
IDE that's built into the browser to let
you quickly hack things together okay so
we're going to create something really
quick and we're gonna do a little bit of
Apps Script code use some Google
technologies
then we're gonna run it and then we're
going to be successful and then we can
move on to something that's a little bit
more difficult which is using our REST
API s okay okay you should see something
like this okay and so in this code lab
we're going to learn how to use Google
Apps Script with various Google services
okay we're going to develop code from
within the development environment okay
so I'm going to do it with you
okay so what you need is you need
internet access okay you need a web
browser I think you guys all have a web
browser okay a Google account I think if
you guys are at this conference you
probably have a Google account okay you
need some basic JavaScript skills you
know nothing hardcore just using
JavaScript as a programming language not
like oh I don't know how to access the
Dom or whatever it's nothing like that
okay and then just basic spreadsheet
like you know how to open a spreadsheet
you know how to type something into a
spreadsheet so I'm pretty sure you guys
can do that okay so what are we going to
do exactly so we're going to learn
something about Apps Script enough for
you to get going we're gonna create a
new spreadsheet okay we're gonna put a
street address in the spreadsheet and
then we're gonna learn how to use a
script editor too for any document and
then we're gonna type in Apps Script
code we're gonna save it we're gonna run
it and then you're gonna use Gmail to
show that everything's working all right
so you're gonna use all those things
once you get it once you get online okay
so you can read all this stuff I'm not
gonna like line by line talk about the
code lab because it's accessible to you
guys after this class is over all right
so I'm gonna let's see I'm just gonna
show you what you're going to do once
you get once you get working okay so
down here you don't have to read any of
this stuff and you can read it later you
should read it just don't do it now okay
so the first thing we're going to do is
I'm gonna ask you to go and create a
spreadsheet all right do we have a
shortcut if you need to create a brand
new spreadsheet from scratch you can go
to that link sheets that google.com
slash create and it just makes a
spreadsheet for you okay so that's the
first thing we're gonna do otherwise you
can go to your Google Drive and then
pull down the new click new and then
Google sheets and then create a blank
spreadsheet okay so that's what we're
gonna do and then once you have the
spreadsheet the first thing you're gonna
do is type an address it doesn't have to
be in the US it could be in your home
area
all right anywhere you want just any
kind of address that Google Maps should
be able to find
so I'll show you the four lines you're
gonna you're gonna do okay it's very
very basic this is one JavaScript
function it's got four lines of code and
I'm just going to describe every single
piece of every single line so you
understand everything now in general the
JavaScript code that we do for Apps
Script should be fairly easy to
understand if you know any kind of
JavaScript you should you should be able
to figure this out without me telling
you but if you cannot that's fine too
because I'm going to explain everything
alright so this is one single function
this is the only function we're gonna
write in this code lab okay in the first
code lab all right these four lines the
first line spreadsheet app that means
that whatever spreadsheet we created
this will give you access to that
spreadsheet just by doing spreadsheet
out when you're in the editor as soon as
you hit the dot the period after a PP it
will show you the names of all the
commands that you can do one of them is
called get active sheet okay what does
that mean that means whatever
spreadsheet that I'm using right now
it's going to get that object okay easy
everybody understand the first line get
the current spreadsheet the second one
is now that we have the spreadsheet
assigned to the object in the variable
sheet what can we do with it I could say
give me the cell range a1 now I can do
more than a1 I can do a 1 : d5 to get a
box of multiple cells but I just want
one so I just leave it as a1 so whatever
is the upper left corner dot get value
which means pull that out right so you
remember you typed in the address or
you're going to type in an address once
you have Wi-Fi access okay so you will
get the address and now it's gonna sign
it to the address variable alright and
then on the next one
I'm gonna say hey Google Maps dot okay
they should have probably called it Maps
app but maybe map app is it sounds too
funny
so it's just Maps dot create a new
static map dot put a pin with the add
marker
fit on that address that I pulled out so
now Google Maps is going to make a map
and I assign it to that variable and in
the very last line of code mail app okay
I'm gonna ask Gmail to send an email to
my friend change the email address by
the way don't use that because you're
not gonna get any thing change it to
yours or your friends or something
subject line is map and then for the map
object I'm going to get the URL for that
map so what does this app do right
it takes the address that you typed in
from your spreadsheet it creates a map
it puts a pin or a marker on that map
where that address is and then it's
gonna mail the URL of that map to your
friend or to you what you're going to do
okay then you're gonna go check your
Gmail then you're gonna see that there's
a new email with the subject line map
and then you're gonna click it and then
you'll see a Google map show up on your
screen of the address that you typed in
okay so the magical thing about this is
that it is only four lines of code but
it uses three different Google products
right it uses Google sheets Google Maps
and Gmail all in just four lines of code
now this is you know this app is not
gonna make you rich okay but it shows
you what you can do right now you just
gotta use your imagination and figure
out what else can I do to make it useful
and if you guys came to my Apps Script
add-ons talked yesterday I gave more
examples of the things that you can do
all right otherwise if you weren't able
to come then just you know watch the
video right so the videos will be up
very soon if not already and you can
watch that to get more ideas of what you
can do with Apps Script but the main
idea is to get you started with Apps
scripts so you know how to do Apps
Script and the next time you want to try
this you won't be scared you know how to
do it maybe you don't want to do it with
a sheet maybe the next time you're gonna
use a Google Doc or a Google Form or
something else right so all those
different things all the editors you can
actually do Apps Script apps with them
I'm going to slowly walk through the
rest of the code lab ok so I'm just
going to go back a little
so create a new spreadsheet so that's
the first thing all right so can you
guys raise your hand if you're able to
make a brand new spreadsheet that's a
lot of you okay
okay good all right so you have a blank
spreadsheet that's great so I'm gonna go
slowly type an address into the upper
left hand corner just like this okay and
then the next step is open the script
editor so once you've typed in the
address go to tools and then pull down
the script editor okay and then you
should see your code editor underneath
so this will open a new window okay so
then you have this blank right here okay
now I'm just gonna keep on checking to
see how far you guys are at how many
people have a code window right now okay
a little bit less all right
okay everybody try and catch up try and
once you have the spreadsheet some more
of you guys raise your hand so you
definitely got the spreadsheet okay
type in the address and then go to oops
go to tools and then script editor and
then that should open another window for
you into the code editor okay and then
so what you're gonna do is you're gonna
actually take the code that I just
showed you on the slide just copy and
paste the whole thing just grab the
whole thing and stick it into your
spreadsheet so I'm just gonna demo
demonstrate it here
okay so my address is
okay so I type in this address which is
Google corporate headquarters in
California and then I'm going to do
tools script editor okay and then I have
my code editor now so all you do is just
paste the whole thing over this okay so
it's the same thing except you know
chain obviously you have to change the
email address to your email address
okay otherwise everything else is
exactly the same exactly the same okay
okay one of the other things that we're
not going to cover in this code lab is
the only current duct all right this is
an additional annotation okay in order
for you to restrict this app to only be
able to run with this sheet instead of
everybody sheets okay so it's an extra
level of security so you can read more
about it in the documentation okay so
there's a link there okay and then you
have to replace the fake email address
with one of your email addresses okay
once you pasted the code in save it
and then we can move to the next page
okay
and then you can click on Run Run
function there should only be one
function you can run okay
all right how many people are able to
cut and paste the code into the code
editor and save it oh that's pretty good
okay good we will finish this code lab
on time okay when you try to run it you
will see the authorization what does
this mean okay this means that your code
is trained this code other users can use
it but they have to give your code
permission to access their spreadsheet
because it is their personal data do you
guys understand that you can't just
arbitrarily just run this anywhere okay
that person who owns the data this
spreadsheet has to give your app
permission to run that's why a lot of
times you know when you install an app
or when you run a web app it will say
some you know bring up a body log box
that says this app needs these
permissions and you need to click allow
right so that's exactly what's going on
here is that because this could be
foreign code right you don't know what
go maybe you're just a user and you see
this right you need to be aware of what
you're granting access to you just don't
grant access to everybody that wants
access to your data right so that's what
this box is is you need to review the
permissions okay since we're in
development mode we're gonna get
something like oh this app is not
verified it's really scary okay
we're gonna try and make this a little
bit more simple but you know because
we've had some security issues lately we
wanted to make sure the security is very
tight so what's going to happen is
you're gonna see something like this
were Oh the app isn't verified so you
have to click on advanced and then go to
the one that on the bottom where it says
unsafe and then you have to agree to it
I think it's it's simpler than this now
but you may still have to go through
this whole process okay has anybody seen
the warning yet have you guys tried that
try to run it okay so you basically have
to you know just go through this whole
process we're gonna try and make it
simpler over time but right now it's
still pretty restrictive okay so don't
be scared remember this is you this is
your
app okay it's not somebody else's app so
you can give permission to yourself okay
okay so that's the next step we have
five more minutes left I think you guys
are doing very good okay and then you'll
actually get the real dialog box which
is the thing that says I want to I want
to allow this app to view and manage my
spreadsheets because I need to be able
to read the address that you put into
cell a1 so the code is requesting for
that permission it's also requesting
permission to send email as you because
you're calling Gmail are you calling the
mail app the mail service okay so those
are important permissions and you have
to click allow in order to give
permission for this code to do those two
things okay everybody got this screen
how many people have gotten that screen
okay good you guys have made it very far
okay good we are gonna finish on time
all right so once you click it it sends
an email how many people have gone to
their Gmail and see the link oh wow okay
almost all of you okay great so once you
click allow you're gonna see a little a
little yellow box on the top it says
running this script or something like
that okay and then once that yellow box
disappears the code is done and then you
can go to your Gmail or whatever email
service you use and then you should see
a link to whatever address you have and
then when you click on it hopefully you
see a Google map of the address that you
put in right how many people have seen
the Google map Wow good you guys are
making good progress wasn't that cool
right it's exciting now use your
imagination what else can I do now so
watch the talk from yesterday I have a
whole bunch of videos that show what
else you can do with Apps Script but
congratulations you've just used some G
suite in Google api's okay yeah great
we're ahead of time now so let's see
what else there is in the code
and what else you can do next okay so
what can you do next we have a whole
bunch of documentation so the the first
link is general documentation for Apps
Script the second link is specifically
if you want to find out more about using
Gmail the third link is if you want to
find out more about doing spreadsheet
stuff the fourth link is about more
stuff with Google Maps okay and then I
created a whole bunch of videos I don't
have a private life anymore okay so you
can watch any of the videos that will
help you so the first one is that quick
introduction it's kind of like this
easier than this one where I talk about
what is Apps Script why is it a secret
because people haven't heard of it
before all right
and then this example the example we
just did in this class has an a video as
well too so that's the second one and
then I have I have like three more Apps
Script videos that you can watch so if
you go to that link there you'll just
see all of my Apps Script videos but
it's Apps Script only though okay if you
want to see other videos that I did then
that's these two okay so I have this is
the current dev show that I'm doing and
then this was the previous show that I
worked on which was more for startups
but it's still beginner content just
like this one you can read our blog you
can follow our Twitter and then we also
have a monthly newsletter as well too
okay so lots of different things that
you guys can do and then the next thing
we're going to do in this class is move
on to something a little bit harder okay
and that is the G suite in Google API is
code lab okay once you finish that one
once we finish with that one then you
guys will have the ability to do the
harder ones and then maybe look at the
reference app as well too
okay so these are these are harder than
the intro the other intro one we're
gonna do right now and then a reference
application is what is sort of a
medium-sized application that uses this
API so in other words this is the the
example for the slides API where you can
actually write an entire slide
presentation in markdown and then it
will automatically convert that to
Google slides for you so you can
actually get that medium-sized
application and use it and modify it and
do whatever it's on github okay so it's
all open source but it's written by one
of my colleagues
okay alright so how many people have
everything working for this code lab you
feel sense of accomplishment excellent
okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
give you guys like maybe two minutes to
ask me some questions about this code
lab or anything else related to Apps
Script and then once we finish with the
questions for this part then we move on
to the next code lab okay so who has
anybody has questions if you ask
questions you will get something
all right so question the question is
can I get user information in my app I
think there is a service that allows you
to get the users email and maybe part of
their profile information so pretty sure
that's where I answer okay come and get
a something for the bag its user yeah
the way we did here like just one
address with the map yep okay I mean
let's say we have hundreds of users at
risk and we just have the single map
with you know where all the located and
exactly that was part of my talk
yesterday so the main idea behind this
example that I showed yesterday in the
talk is that maybe you're a salesperson
and you're trying to visit multiple
customers so you can have multiple
addresses in your sheet and then you can
create one map and put a pin on every
single one and then also the other thing
you have access to with Google Maps is
you can actually ask for like driving
directions walking directions or
whatever so you can actually plot the
best route to visit all of them so it
had all the I think the markers in the
URL itself so is there a limit that you
could have this much data or let's say I
mean we have finder shops in Bangalore
for example the person has to visit yeah
and we have all the addresses we just
mark it off and give it to him so he can
see where it's located and you can plan
his day or something like that yeah I
think the restriction is what I am yeah
that's a good question I don't know the
exact answer but you should be able to
you may have to create something that's
not a static map you may have to create
a dynamic map okay so there's just check
the validation
exactly okay come and get something to
okay how about you sir okay one over
there so the question is that right now
I had to manually go ahead and run the
script right can it be done by a trigger
like you know a new event is coming you
know something like that
is there a mechanism for those kind of
hooks or a trigger so so so the answer
is yes you can make it so that if
somebody types something into a cell or
if a file is uploaded to drive that you
can run some code so basically like I
could have a Google Form where people
are inputting the routes and this could
automatically drop me a mail in the
customize form and mm-hm yeah yeah like
exactly so I'd like as soon as somebody
fills submits a form and it gets entered
into the spreadsheet you can like send
them an email to acknowledge hey you've
entered something yeah okay great how
about you sir so actually I was working
on a project where you know how to write
some data from Android to Google
spreadsheet aha so my question is like
is it possible to create kind of like a
URL where I can put that spiritual tidy
and if I'll execute that URL then that
all the data and all this thing will be
there will be written on it directly go
to that spreadsheet yeah let's wait till
after the second code lab because like
we will learn how to do that you won't
be using Apps Script you'll be using an
API so that's the part of the second
code lab okay thanks ask again
afterwards if that still doesn't answer
okay well do two more and then we'll go
generate charge
oh you know what maybe not
you might have to use the sheets advance
service right now the sheets the
spreadsheet app is only tied to the last
version of the API v3 right now v3
cannot do that cannot create charts but
v4 API can so at 5:20 today I have
another talk on the sheets API if you do
want to use the API from a script you
can use what is called the advanced
service and that will let you talk to
the v4 API and then you can create
charts
real-sized is just whatever is the
maximum size of the type of document
that you have so like for spreadsheets
you can have up to like what 5 million
cells or something like that all right 2
million 2 million cells but otherwise if
it's if you can upload it to a drive
folder you can get access to the file ok
that's one last question then we're
going to move on to the next code lab
and then save your other questions for
afterwards yeah so again we connected to
the external services that we write
uh-huh so watch the talk from yesterday
but yes you can use URL fetch to post or
get to another web service or if you
want to have an external database you
can use a JDBC service ok it's got any
limit to that there's always limits
there's always limits it's one of the
easiest things to do if you want to
learn more about a script so if you go
to the if you go to the documentation
which I will do right now if my internet
is working ok there is a quota so under
this quota page you will find out what
all your limits are like you can only
create you know 5,000 calendar events
every day you'd only create 1000
contacts every day ok so there's a whole
bunch of limits depending on how much
you know you paying customer are you not
a paying customer obviously get higher
you know higher limits so anyway all
your scripts have to run within 6
minutes otherwise they get terminated ok
your maximum of attachment email body
size okay so all this stuff is in the
documentation so if you want to find out
what the limits are ok great all right
let's move on
ok one more that's it
yeah so the question is can we automate
doing tasks with this and the answer is
yes you can have time-based triggers
that will run like every night kind of
like a cron job in Linux so you can run
at night every night go and fetch data
from other sources and then put it into
spreadsheets or do whatever or you
cannot port VB code into it but if you
port your application from VB into
JavaScript and you can stick it into
Apps Script okay but you have to like be
B to JavaScript okay okay great
all right let's move on so we are now on
the second part okay
so again congratulations you guys have
used some G suite in Google API s but
Apps Script is very user friendly
there's actually a little bit more going
on under the covers remember that olá
permissions okay well you know what that
is done for you by Apps Script but as a
developer you normally have to do it
yourself so now we're gonna go a little
bit lower level where we actually have
to work on the OAuth code okay it's not
that bad but I need to explain how it
works okay so in other words Apps Script
is made easy because it's made for
people who are not necessarily full-time
engineers or people that have computer
science degrees you could be a business
person and you need to write some code
right so that's why Apps Script handles
a lot of things for you so that you
don't have to worry about it but if you
are a you know more of a serious
developer or you're a software engineer
then you're more likely to use the API
is because it's less restrictive okay so
you notice that you know one of you know
the last question we asked that we have
is can I actually do this in a different
language and the answer is no because
Apps Script only supports JavaScript
okay and also you have to edit your code
in that code editor so those things are
more restrictive right what if you want
to use your programming language what if
you want to use your development
environment okay and so that's what the
second part of this code lab is about is
learning how to use the REST API switch
is
lower level but it gives programmers
more flexibility okay and you're not
tied to the environment that Google
gives you okay so that's really the main
idea so that code there cause our api's
under the covers but now we want to do
it manually so that you know how to do
that this harder part okay so those
these are the fundamental building
blocks that you would use to actually
integrate with Google technologies but
you don't have to do everything inside
Apps Script okay so that's the main idea
all right so everybody go to this code
lab okay and so it would look something
like this one okay and then we can take
a look at what we're going to do here
all right we're going to create a
project using the Google cloud
developers console we're going to get
our Olaf applications we're going to
learn about using client libraries we're
going to write applications with Google
and G sweet API s and then the
demonstration app the four line
demonstration app is it will read your
the first 100 files in your Google Drive
files or folders in your Google Drive
okay again you need to have basic
internet access and a browser a Google
account that's easy I'm going to do the
demos in Python because I'm a Python guy
and also there's fewer lines of code but
if you want to use another language you
can so just go to the other link and get
the client library for your favorite
language so you can do it in Java
JavaScript PHP dart c-sharp go Ruby okay
there's lots of options so whatever is
your comfortable development language
you can use it you don't have to do it
in Python even though I'll do that as
the example okay and then we're going to
you should have some files and folders
in your Google Drive because if it's
completely emptied it's not going to be
a useful demonstration okay so that's
what we're going to do okay so in this
code lab we're going to download the
Google API client library for Python
we're going to create a new project in
the developer console we're going to get
those credentials and then we're going
to use those credentials okay a lot of
it has to do with security of course and
oh up so that's the one difference
between using Apps Script and the API is
you have to do it
more yourself okay okay so if you have a
Linux or a Mac machine you probably have
Python installed already you can find
out what version you have by doing that
it in this code lab it doesn't matter
what version you use because the client
library works for Python too and Python
3 so you can actually try to see whether
or not you have Python 2 and your
computer or python 3 the only people
that really need to install Python our
PC users running Windows okay those are
really the only users that have to
install it unless your company has
already installed it for you okay but
basically what you can do is you can
type python 2 or 3 to see which version
you have and then ctrl D to exit that ok
and this code lab also assumes you have
the p IP installation tool called pip ok
if you have pip on your computer you
should be able to run pip install -
capital you Google API Python client
with hyphens in the middle okay so run
this command from your command line ok
either it's pip pip 2 or PIP 3 depending
on whether you want to do it in Python 2
or 3 but try and get this installed okay
so it's it's shouldn't take very long at
all if your internet is working ok
and then the way you tell if everything
is working is that once the installation
is finished and you start up your Python
again if you can type import API client
HTTP lib to an oauth2 client and you
don't get any errors and you get your
Python prompt then you know it's working
if for some reason somehow you get
completely stuck then just feel free to
kind of like maybe look over your
neighbors shoulders or just kind of like
start talking to people maybe they can
get you your next job ok this is a
community event meet other people from
different parts of the country you know
see what language they know right it's
fun ok it's fun meeting new people
yeah again you can use Python two or
three it doesn't really matter the
client library works for both versions
okay you don't have to do Python three
if you only have Python 2 that's fine
it's not a problem all of my code works
for Python 2 or 3 ok the next thing
you're going to do is go to console dot
developers that Google well you can't
really read that let me go back to this
and move to the next page ok the best
thing to do is when you're on this page
page number 4 in the code lab click on
this because it's the easiest way of
creating a new project and turn on the
drive API so click on this link that's
console developers.google.com slash
start slash API question mark ID equal
Drive okay and then login to your Google
account if you haven't already otherwise
we have to do it more manually this link
is a faster way of doing it because what
will happen is this command creates a
brand new project and it automatically
turns on the drive API otherwise you
have to create the project on your own
and then manually turn on the drive API
that's fine too if you want to do that
but this one's just more for convenience
it just does everything in one shot ok
so you'll get this screen that's if
you've never done any Google projects
before you're gonna get a screen that
says you have no existing project and
then a new project will be created and
then you know you have to click yes or
no on the questions and then you click
agree and continue
ok but if you've already created a
project before then you'll get something
like this like do I want to create a new
project or do I want to use an existing
project ok so whether you have one or
you don't have one it doesn't really
matter but you're gonna create a new one
ok and then when you create a new one ok
so you can go down here and when you
click on it it'll actually bring up all
the existing projects that you have and
then it will ask you to either manage
your existing project or create a brand
new one
okay so once you've made your selection
you can either choose an existing
project if you have one that you started
that you want to continue or you want to
create a brand new one from scratch
okay the drive API will be turned on for
you okay and what happens is you will
know the drive API has been turned on
when you see something like this where
it says the Google Drive API has been
enabled okay so I'll let you guys kind
of like catch up to this point so if you
created a project manually you didn't
use that link okay you would have to
turn on the drive API by yourself and
the way you do that is you click on API
library and it shows you all the
different API is that you can turn on
there's so many that you actually have
to search for it so here's Google Drive
you can see it here but if you don't
want to scroll down because there's too
many you can just search for it and just
type Drive up here okay and then it'll
just show you all the Google Drive
related API s and then when you click on
it okay it'll say something like try
this API or it's already been enabled so
for you guys if you haven't enabled
it'll say something like click here to
enable or something like that so this is
tells you a little bit about about the
API okay so once you enable Google Drive
when you go back to your project when
you go back to your dashboard so you get
a dashboard on the left hand side you
can see the the dashboard link and then
the library link is the one we were just
at the API library okay and we're gonna
go look at credentials pretty soon but I
just wanted to get familiar with this so
once so this dashboard gives you all the
information about your app that you're
working on okay and down at the bottom
you can actually see all the different
API as you have enabled so for this
particular project that I worked on I
have the drive API enabled I've got the
Sheetz API the slides' API the Google+
API the YouTube API the calendar API
Gmail bigquery I turn on a whole bunch
of them and you can do that
okay and the reason why you do this is
because Google is not going to make
every API available for you by default
you have to actually tell Google which
ApS you want to use so that we can go
and allocate those resources for you
okay so that's why you have to turn it
on some of sometimes some projects will
automatically turn on some other cloud
stuff but that's okay you don't have to
use it you can also turn them off if you
feel uncomfortable that they're there
okay so when you look at your dashboard
you may have some cloud ApS turned on
it's very easy to turn it off okay just
click disable if you're not going to use
those ApS just turn it off because
you're afraid that you know it's gonna
start charging your credit card or
whatever that's fine okay turn off
anything that you're not going to use
and just leave drive on the G sweet
api's are free they don't cost any money
so they don't require you to put in a
credit card okay
but of course the cloud ones charge
money so you have to be a little careful
okay so how many people have created a
project okay and of the those of you who
raised your hand how many of you have
the eight drive API turned on now okay
so that means that everybody else double
check to see whether or not your drive
API is turned on by going to your
dashboard and just looking for one if
you only have just to drive API by
itself that's fine you don't have to
have the list of ten that I have is just
that I use this project for a lot of
stuff okay alright so let's move on see
what the next step is I think the next
step is credential so it's getting a
little harder okay so the click go to
credentials so either you click on the
button to go to credentials or in your
project let's see I'm just gonna close
the sheets one yeah so over here you can
also click on credentials right here
same thing okay
so whether you click this button or you
click on the credentials on the left
hand side you will arrive at a screen
like this and you're gonna have blank
right now I already have some IDs
created okay but you won't have anything
created yet so I'm gonna talk you
through it okay so what we're gonna do
is you're gonna on the credentials page
okay ill it's going to
see these questions all right like what
credentials do I need what API are using
the drive API where will you be calling
the API from ok so from this select
choose ok so where will you be calling
the API from ok we're going to use a
command line tool because we're just
going to different command line so we're
gonna do other UI okay whether you're on
a window system or you just want to
write a generic Linux command line tool
just click on this other UI ok but later
on if you guys want to build other apps
using our API so you can choose any one
of these is it a web browser app is it
iOS is it Android Chrome whatever okay
so you can choose but for now for our
example we're gonna do other UI okay so
why don't we do that and so once you
select that that's what it's gonna look
like on your screen and then it's gonna
say what data will you be accessing so
user data application data so we're
gonna choose user data ok and then it
will tell you you need to create an
oauth2 client ID ok so create an oauth2
client ID and just choose whatever name
you want just make it generic okay and
then create client ID when you're done
ok once you press create some gears are
gonna whirl around in Google server
somewhere it's gonna make your
credentials and then it's gonna say do
you want to download it ok so it's gonna
show you something alright and you're
gonna click on download or you can do it
later that's fine too but we should do
it now so download this file ok you can
call it client ID or client secret it
either one of these names is fine what's
gonna happen is when it gives you the
default one it's going to be client
secret and some really long name so you
can change that to client ID or client
secret it doesn't really matter just
something that says clients something
alright and you can cut off the extra
long part cuz it's a big hash number for
your project ID you don't need to have
that ok and
once you download that download that to
a folder that you're working on this the
codelab okay so I'll let you get that
done and then I'll come back and we'll
continue I'm also going to show you like
if you don't use this wizard what it
looks like if you're gonna do it
manually okay so if you're on this page
like this I don't have the wizard here
to ask Oh what kind of app are you
writing what kind of api's are you using
where where am I going to access this
app okay if I'm gonna create it manually
I click over here it says create
credentials and then I will select Olaf
client ID so let me quickly kind of
describe the different types of
credentials and why we're creating an
OAuth client ID so these are the three
types of credentials that you can get
for your projects the reason why we're
picking the middle one is because you're
asking this app to access your personal
data which is your files and drive if
you're not gonna be asking for
authorized data like that maybe you want
to you know search for YouTube videos or
you want to look through public Google+
posts or you want to use the Google Maps
API to look up a location that is all
public data and then public data does
not require Olaf because you're not
accessing user information in those
cases you can use API key
so API key is just for simple API access
where you're not asking for private user
data if you're asking for private user
data you need raw client ID that's why
we're doing that for this project and
then if you later on you want to write
code that runs in the cloud and you need
to you know the your cloud vm has to
quote pretend to be a user then you
would be using a service account because
it's basically a robot that is a user
but it's really your app that's running
as a robot right so these are the three
types of credentials you can create and
the reason again the reason why we're
doing is because I'm accessing private
user data okay so once you select this
if you did it manually it's gonna ask
you the same information like where's my
app going to be running from well it's
going to be a command line app
and then I can create create and it's
gonna make one for me I've already
created a whole bunch of other ones down
here that I'm not using okay I think
yeah I think I use I'm using this one
that I created like six years ago it
still works which is great okay but you
can you don't have to use the wizard to
create your ID you can do it manually
too so if you kind of mess up and you
pop out of the wizard and you can still
do it manually here okay how many people
have created their oath to client ID and
downloaded the file okay great you guys
are doing really good we are gonna
finish on time you guys are gonna be
really happy about this okay great
that's very good alright so let's move
on to the next step which is the actual
code and so let me read you I'm gonna
walk you through all of the lines of
this code okay and it's only actually I
was wrong I thought this was a four line
application it's only three lines the
real application is just down here if
you can believe that well okay I'll
count this as the fourth line okay so
maybe there's for everything else above
it is just for OAuth something we didn't
have to worry about with Apps Script
right so let me just kind of like talk
about all these lines of code so at the
very top we have this print function
import what does that do that makes my
code run in Python 2 and python 3
because what happens is in Python 2 we
have a print statement in Python 3 it
changes to a print function and so what
I'm doing is if I'm in Python 2 I am
gonna ask Python hey can we use the
Python 3 print function so I only have
to have one thing because that's gonna
break your code that's one of the
reasons why python 2 &amp;amp; 3 are backwards
incompatible because print changes from
a statement to a function so I want to
make my code run in Python 2 and 3 so
I'm gonna tell Python to hey import me
the Python 3 print function I'm gonna
use that instead and then this line of
code is ignored in Python 3 because
print is already a function okay so
that's the top line the next three
imports are importing different pieces
of the Python client library remember
when we did pip install python client
library for google okay that's just
importing all the things that we need to
be able to make our code work okay and
I'm gonna talk about those objects as we
go through the source code
and then the first so the first real
line of code you see is a scope okay
what are the scopes so you know when you
get that dialog box it says this
application wants to view and manage
your spreadsheets this application wants
to send email as you okay
remember that dialog box that Olaf box
well all each of those lines is one
scope a scope is a permission a
permission that your app is asking for
so in this case I'm only gonna read the
file names and the file type from your
Google Drive I don't need to read the
file I don't need to upload files so I
only need read-only access to the file
metadata so that is the scope I'm asking
for if you want to ask for other things
like I want to be able to send email on
your behalf I want to be able to view
and manage your spreadsheets just like
our Apps Script example you would have
more than one scope you would have an
array of scopes that you would be asking
for for your users so when your user
runs the code then they're gonna see the
dialog box that says I want to act I
want to read your Drive file metadata I
want to view and manage your
spreadsheets I want to send email on
your behalf and things like that right
so this is where we're creating the
OAuth ourself okay the Scopes are
necessary because your app needs to tell
Google then who needs to tell your user
what permissions your app is asking for
so it's either one string or you can
have an array of strings it doesn't
really matter okay in this example we
only need one okay so that's the Scopes
line and then in the next line file that
storage that says when I get my
credentials from the Google server where
do I save that I'm gonna save it in a
file called storage that Jason okay so
you that hasn't you have to have these
tokens in order to talk to the Google
API to get access to the user data you
don't have a choice okay so just be
aware of that okay so all that
information goes in storage Jason okay
then what happens on the next line is
I'm gonna say go and get those
credentials get those tokens from this
storage file okay if I do not have any
credentials or my credentials are
invalid like they've expired or
something
that I need to go and run the flow okay
and the flow is that big box it says
what permissions I'm asking for okay so
what it's gonna do it's gonna go grab
your client secrets or whatever you
saved your file name as make sure that
you change this file name if it's client
underscore ID or client underscore
secret make sure that line is the same
because it has to go and read your OAuth
credentials your OAuth client ID and
then it's gonna pair that with
permissions that you're asking for okay
so that's how it builds that big dialog
window that the OAuth flow so that saves
the flown to the flow variable and then
you the next line is to run that flow
which is actually making that dialog box
show up for your user which will be you
okay so that that person clicks allow so
this runs that flow the first line
creates the flow the second line runs
the flow and if the user clicks allow
then Google will send back an access
token so that you can talk to the API
and get access to the data okay
it tells it I'm gonna someone so I get
that access token I'm gonna stick it
into stores Jason okay so that's the
stuff and then what happens is because
Google we're very paranoid about
security so you're at those access
tokens expire in one hour so it's not
very long okay and so what happens is
when it gets the access token is
returned to you from the Google server
it also returns to you another token
called the Refresh token okay and so
what that means is that when that access
token has expired it will use the
Refresh token to talk to the Google
servers and say oh you know what this
person got this permission before can I
get another access token please okay and
if that's the case then that will get
saved in stores out Jason so then once
you have a valid access token then you
can go and talk to the Google API and
get access to the data but you always
have to have a valid access token and if
you do not have a valid access token
that it uses the Refresh token to go and
get another one
okay unless of course you have no tokens
at all in which case that's when the
dialog box shows up so by the time this
line ends okay we need to have valid
credentials so that we can make this
call to discovery that build and ask for
a service endpoint to the drive API I
want to use the Google Drive API version
3 because that's the newest one alright
and once I have valid credentials I'm
going to create an HTTP client sign it
with their credential so everything is
encrypted okay and then once that's done
I have a handle to the drive API I can
now make calls to the API so what am I
gonna do I'm gonna say Drive dot files
that list which means give me a listing
of my first 100 files that's the default
you can change it to like 50 or 75 or
200 files but if you don't say how many
files you want it will do 100 by default
and then I'm gonna execute the command
and then I'm gonna get back a JSON
payload and in the JSON payload I will
have a key called files once I get that
then those are actually the files I got
from my Google Drive for every file in
my files print the name of the file and
the type of the file okay so that is
line by line how this application works
and then it's only these four lines of
code
everything else is authorization and
that code you can cut and paste that and
drop that into any app that you use that
to talk to any other API because once
you can talk to drive now you can talk
to Gmail API calendar sheets slides all
of those okay if that code stays the
same the code above the OAuth code stays
the same when you look in our
documentation our off code is probably
going to be longer than seven lines but
because you know I spent so much time
doing Python I basically optimize it
down to seven but if you look at our
documentation just be aware that it may
be like 40 lines of off code okay I just
cut it down to seven because I don't
like extra code okay all right so that's
what it does and then once you cut and
paste that into some file call it Drive
list okay so that's the name so cut and
paste this code save it into Drive lists
copy and paste this whole thing okay
save it as Drive underscore list in the
same directory that you have your client
secret or your client ID JSON file and
then pretty soon you will have a storage
jason once you run this thing okay let
me see okay once you run it all right so
why don't I let you guys do that
can you guys copy and paste that code
and save it into Drive list and I'll
give you a minute and then I'll continue
after that I'm gonna so we're gonna try
and wrap this whole code lab up in about
six minutes so I can leave the last ten
minutes to show you how to use the other
api's because what like I said before
the all the code at the top stays the
same I'm just gonna change the bottom
four lines to show you how to use
calendar and Gmail and sheets and slides
and all those things so I want to save
the last ten minutes for that so if we
can just do this save it and then when
you run it you're gonna see this show up
okay so when you run it it's gonna give
you some kind of messages it'll say
something about a browser window has
been open so you should actually see a
browser window with guess what you're oh
I flow okay and then if your web
browsers on a different machine because
you SSH into a server then you actually
have to run with a local web server all
right so hopefully you guys can just do
it on your own computer now okay and
then you'll get this which is some you
know the name of your tool it wants to
view your metadata for your files in
your Google Drive right this is the
typical auth but notice this time we had
to write this code with Apps Script it
handled it for you so that made it a lot
easier right but now we're going lower
level we have to do it ourselves okay
and so that's what the the OAuth
dialogue is here okay when you're done
you click allow guess what as soon as
you click allow you're gonna see all
first 100 files in your Google Drive
folder just pop out once you get that
working that should make you very happy
because they're your file
and you actually use the Google API
because that's really exciting right so
try and get this thing working so I'll
give you guys like another minute or so
to try this working but you know I'll
continue afterwards but try and work
with each other if you if somebody is
stuck try and help out your neighbors
okay so please try and get this working
if you need any help raise your hands
and our helpers are back there they'll
be help able to help you out okay so
raise your hands if you need help and
just for fun I'm gonna try and run it in
real life and see what happens
I have ten thousand versions of this app
so I just want to make sure I run the
right one so this looks pretty much
exactly the same as the one I have in
the code lab except I moved the the
drive API line down here so it actually
have four real lines of code it's really
these lines of code that are the same
for every app so this is the version
that I want to run so I can run it in
Python 3 and so right here because of
the pause notice the pause okay the
reason why it's paused here it's because
it recognized that my access token has
expired and it's using the refresh token
to ask the Google servers for a new
access token so I paused it as well - it
should be done by now but I paused it
but you notice that there's a pause here
- right so I'm gonna unpause it okay so
here are my hundred files ok so it
should work alright how many people see
100 of their drive files really exciting
right right you've got something working
now you can actually do other stuff too
okay so anyway so that's pretty cool ok
awesome let's make this bigger ok great
alright so so we've finished on time and
we can get to doing the other parts of
the slides showing you how to do the
other api's what can you do now you can
read more about the drive API
documentation we have a REST API which
we just used we also have an Android SDK
and we also have iOS version as well you
want to if you want to learn more about
other g-suit api's there's the dots
there if you want to learn about other
google api Azure dots there if you want
to again do this in different languages
go look at the page for our client
libraries if you want to find out a lot
more about OAuth than you really want to
know there's this we have 10,000 pages
on ooofff ok so if you're really if you
really find difficult to go to sleep at
night read the Olaf to documentation
it'll put you right to sleep and you'll
be very happy ok it makes me dizzy too
all right and then let's see so I have a
video a video that is about what we just
did in the cut developers console I have
another video about the authorization
code that I walked you guys through okay
also this code lab has a video and a
blog post as well okay and then I have a
whole bunch of other videos specifically
for the drive API so you can watch those
if you want and then the other videos
that I've done then are blog Twitter our
newsletter again okay so that's it for
the code lab congratulations what else
can we do now all right the next step
for you guys is we want to do something
more serious with Google sheets do the
intermediate code lab which is where
you're building a node.js app that is a
customized reporting tool for a toy
order company okay and then the the
slides rest API has a code lab where
you're you looking analyzing github
licenses using bigquery so you're
looking at all the open source projects
out there and finding out what are the
licenses they're using what open source
licenses are they using so using
bigquery to do that and then what it
does is Auto generates a slide
presentation for every license that it
finds okay so that's pretty fun and then
there's the mark down the slides
converter that I told you guys about
okay cool so we are right on time so
let's move on and start this back up
again okay so there's the example all
right
okay
so when you're done you should feel like
this okay should be celebrating okay so
so now I want you to come go back and
think about the first codelab that we
did with Apps Script which is better
right it all depends right you can do
some pretty cool stuff with Apps Script
you can write little apps that directly
tie it to a spreadsheet a doc a form you
can write add-ons to further enhance
your Apps Script apps and to be able to
extend what is available in you know
sheets Doc's lies Gmail and all that
kind of stuff but you can also take your
existing app and integrate that into our
Google applications okay but it's also a
limiting environment in other words you
have to do it in JavaScript you have to
use the code editor you can't you're
constrained environment you don't have
full control okay again but maybe you
want to have more heavy lifting you want
more flexibility you want to use your
own language your own platform you want
to be able to run through your
continuous integration tools you want to
have source code management versioning
okay in that case you probably want to
use the REST API it's lower level but it
gives you more control so you kind of
decide which is better for your
application right something you might do
both sometimes it's perfect for Apps
Script sometimes you might want to use a
REST API okay so it all depends but one
thing that you know one thing that is
true is that no matter what you do you
if you have a great idea you can
actually list it in the G suite
marketplace and maybe if something you
wrote is really useful maybe companies
will want to install it okay then you
can get some money there and then maybe
you've become a consultant and then you
become very rich and then you can buy a
big house and then you'd be very happy
okay so you know it's and isn't the
thing that's different about the G suite
marketplaces is that you know with the
Play Store you have to hope for
individual users to install your app but
when you put things in the G suite
marketplace you can have an entire
company installing your app right so
it's like a different kind of viral it's
a more chunky viral right so you're just
hoping
or bigger and bigger companies to
install your app and then like I said
you can provide support and you can sell
extra services on top of your app you
know so you can I mean if you look at
some of these you can see how many users
these each of these apps have you know
it could be a pretty big number right
it's not necessarily like oh you only
have 10 users or 20 users or a hundred
users it could be pretty big okay so
that's an important thing all right and
of course if your app is really
successful okay
then you will be rich all right or I
would say successful I wouldn't say
necessarily rich cuz money doesn't buy
happiness right most important thing is
to be happy okay so now that you're
familiar with the drive REST API let's
talk a little bit more about what else
you can get with G suite okay more G
Suites so slides so you can use the REST
API and create slide decks how do you do
that well guess what the OAuth code is
the same you'll have a slides equals
discovery build slides v1 HTTP right it
looks just like the drive one but maybe
you want to automatically create slide
decks like you know for your sales team
because they have to go visit different
customers but you want to give the same
slide deck to different customers so
what you can do is you can put like the
name of the customer in a variable I
call title or the name of your slide
deck maybe you have a space in the upper
corner for the company logo so what you
can do is you can actually do search and
replace so you can copy the slide
template deck for a different customer
and another one for a different customer
another one for a different customer you
just go through and replace the tiles
with the name of the customer and then
you can replace it with their company
logo okay and then you make you send
this JSON payload of the request that
you want two slides that presentations
batch update and it'll actually update
this for whatever presentation ID that
you give it okay so that's how use the
slides API now spreadsheets okay so
let's say I have a spreadsheet that has
a lot of data I have a header row at the
top I want to make it bold I also want
to make it frozen you know when you pull
it down so that it stays there
you scroll everything right so I'm gonna
say I want one frozen row and then I
want to change all the headers to bold
okay so I send this command just like
which slides to sheets so remember I
created sheets equals discovery dive
build sheets v4 HTTP well whatever okay
and then I get the sheets API endpoints
so sheets not spread sheets that batch
update body equals all this commands
send the spreadsheet ID execute and then
it's done so you can just make a
different you know well so for this one
spreadsheet you will have made the first
header column and then it would be bold
okay and in Gmail so here's an example
where I want to show all non-empty email
threads so we create Gmail equals
discovery build Gmail version 1 API I
want to get all my email threads and
then for every thread I'm gonna find out
how many messages I have if I have no
messages I'm gonna skip this until I get
to an email thread that actually has at
least one message in it and then when I
get done I'm gonna scroll through all
the headers looking for the subject line
because all I'm gonna do is print if the
subject line is not blank all right I'm
gonna print this I have n messages in
this email thread and what it's called
and that's a subject line okay so that
is how you use a gmail API again all of
your off code stays the same but now you
can actually start playing around with
different Google api's okay how about
calendar okay so calendar is useful
because what if you want to write the
next travel app or the next hotel
reservation app the next you know the
next Ola or whatever right so you want
to do that and the thing is that if they
use your app and they make a booking
well they have to exit your app and then
they have to open their Google Calendar
and type everything in why why not give
your users a better experience why don't
you put that thing into their calendar
so they don't have to do it by
themselves okay so that's one reason why
you would use the calendar API so ge
calendar equals discovery build
calendar v3 API HTTP blah blah blah
with all that off coat and then we have
something like this where I can create
an event maybe it's a dinner with
friends it starts at 7 o'clock ends at
10 o'clock I'm gonna invite these people
and what it'll do is when you call
events don't insert it will add these
events to their calendar it send them
email you know just like when you invite
people to a meeting in Gmail or in
Google Calendar right send email
notifications execute it'll actually do
that it'll create it in their calendars
and send them email to tell them hey
this event got added to your calendar ok
so this is another example of what you
can do all right and then there's other
ones like so we already did Drive we
looked at Apps Script but there's also
admin SDK if you have to manage like all
the employees at your company like you
have 100 new employees starting next
week you don't want to create their
gmail accounts one by one by hand boring
right
so you want to automate it so that you
can use the admin SDK to do that kind of
stuff it'll help manage groups within a
company and things like that and then
the last one is Google classroom which
is you know for schools that use
classroom to help teachers manage
homework to manage students courses
assignments and things like that that's
what the classroom API is all of these
work in the same way ok and I don't
think I have it here I don't have it
here but a lot of the GCP api is of the
same way I can use bigquery I can use
Google Cloud storage ok so I can do all
those different things and the code that
you guys did today you can reuse the
same code all right so my main point is
to help you get over the hard stuff
which is how do I get a project created
how do I get my credentials and then how
do I make what is the OAuth code about
once you know how to do with that stuff
it doesn't change you just go and use
all the other API it'll be easy for you
ok so next steps again try the
intermediate code labs the customized
nodejs reporting tool for the toy orders
the github license analyzer watch videos
you'll be tired of me very soon ok
documentation developer everything is
always at developers.google.com and then
you just do slash the name of the API
slash Gmail's
drive slash seat slides calendar uh
actually not calendar calendar is in the
wrong place right now you actually have
to do slash Google Apps and then slash
calendar but just just look for calendar
in the search bar okay but it's the only
one that's in the wrong place right now
okay
then our blog and then you know again if
you don't need anything this complicated
you don't need that flexibility you can
do it in Apps Script and that is a good
alternative okay so you're not tied to
one technology okay
make lots of money be successful okay
and learn more no there's 16 seconds
left
sorry join me at five o'clock if you
wanna learn more about Google sheets
join me tomorrow if you want to join us
at the Bangalore Python users group
across town and then if you want to join
me in Singapore you can do that on
Monday okay it's a little farther away
but I figured the the Python users group
is pretty close so anyway so I'll be
there alright thank you everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
