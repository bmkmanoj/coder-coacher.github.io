Google Play Puma
Portugal good morning you can do better
than that
it's wonderful to see everyone here in
case you find there are no seats it's
because there is so much excitement
about Google Play and Android there's an
overflow room you believe me you will
hear all of us and you will see all the
videos so if you don't find seats please
look for somebody to show you an
overflow room ah first of all thank you
for your interest thank you for your
patience in trying to get in here and
thank you for being here so 2 billion
active users isn't that amazing I don't
know if you heard are in at Google i/o
we announced that there were more
smartphone users in India than in the
United States let's take a moment to
think about it think about what it means
for you when you think about the Indian
market more smartphone users in India
than in the United States now the
question I'm sure a lot of you are
asking and several of you asked me
yesterday when we met is to say are they
doing anything with their phones are
they using data so I am super happy to
tell you that we hit 1 billion app
installs a month on Google Play in here
just think of what that means right it's
almost the size of our population it's a
hundred and fifty percent growth year
over year and that is a testament to all
the amazing apps and games you and other
developers on Android are writing now we
have been looking to celebrate the apps
and games you write by really thinking
about how to celebrate
the Indian cultural dice for oh we have
had collections for you know Diwali and
cricket of course everybody loves
cricket as well as for subsets of n sub
dollar pricing pricing for India etc to
celebrate but we also been spending some
time really thinking about how to take
away the friction for getting people to
pay for the amazing apps and games
you're writing when we thought about
payments on Google Play overall we
realize that payments is a cultural
thing a lot of people prefer their mode
of payment just because that's what they
have been used to Germans for example
prefer PayPal Japanese prefer our
carrier billing because your days they
bought a lot from NTT DoCoMo right even
before Android and play so when we
looked at the Indian user we found that
you are used to paying for the on the
carrier billing because you bought
value-added services like ringtones and
wallpapers etc this is also a very cash
economy which means that we you know you
like to pay with cash so we had gift
cards come in and then you wanted it to
be in using those payments that you like
which is the wallet so let's talk about
it one by one so I'm super happy to
announce that today we have prepaid and
postpaid support for carrier billing
across Airtel Vodafone an idea which
means you have enormous coverage in
anybody wanting to pay for your content
using carrier billing it's there
second we have more than four thousand
retail outlets where people can go pay a
cash like top-up cards buy a gift card
and then pay for apps and games when we
did that several of you told us that you
want lower denomination hundred rupees
you said is the right price point for
India and you also said can I not have
to do it by going and getting a physical
gift card can I do it on pin on receipt
so earlier this year in January we
launched a game of global first a lot of
things we do here end up becoming Global
Solutions
we launched pin on receipt with your
favourite wallets
KTM and others and this was you know
well in line with all of you as you know
India went into D monetization and more
people are using wallets there is more
people now who can use you know a lower
denomination with the ax popular wallets
all good
so more people can pay now the question
is are they paying let's find out so
consumers spend through 3x over the last
year to think about this right more
smartphones in India than in the United
States a billion installs means people
are actively consuming data and consumer
spend has grown 3x I can't find a better
confluence of circumstances that tell
you that this market is ready and for
your innovation so today we want to
celebrate you and all the amazing ideas
that you are going to build for the
Indian market and so let's take a moment
to figure out I see the video about some
folks who are building for the Indian
market
as you know India is the land of about
1.3 billion people has a big demographic
divide with people of multiple income
levels multiple literacy level multiple
languages what technology can do is to
create a common layer and it can
actually improve the quality of life of
people I think the greatest school we
have today in front of us is a
smartphone and there's a hell of a lot
of things you can do with that and
real-world problems you can solve with
that the mobile phone along with those
internet connectivity just makes
everybody stand at the same level how
the family is India's largest health and
fitness app slowly but surely a NAPA day
we are keeping the health momentum and
revolution going in the country there
were no calorie counting tools for this
country and we are the diabetic and
heart problems capitol of the world and
I felt that that's the problem of
hundreds of millions of Indians and
someone had to build Indian nutritional
database golden clap is an app which
helps you buy very high-quality and
trusted home services everything from a
beautician to an interior designer and
everything else women if you look at the
service professional ecosystem in India
the vast majority of these people even
though they are good at their craft make
10 to 15 thousand reasons and multiple
reasons endure them from becoming a
fully organized microsomes on the floor
who can make 40 50 60 thousand bees
month and the real part of India's
middle class really is about helping
travelers in India who use railways as a
board of transportation to make smart
decisions we have gotten used to
tracking an envelope going from one part
of the country to the other part of the
world why can't we track about a half a
kilometre long trade we clearly knew
that people use language for content
consumption if you look at the
leadership of newspapers which will look
at leadership of Bollywood movies I mean
they all in local language so that came
intuitively rather than me market
research done around it we intuitively
thought about that as a core pivot and a
core reason why people would use our app
daily and that is the one of the most
popular apps in the country 95% of our
consumption is on local languages which
is non-english today the app is used by
sea
users everywhere we've got nearly 200
coaches and nutritionists spread all
over the country and our app is one of
the highest-rated apps in India on a
monthly basis we are reaching to about 9
million people over a period of that now
you've added all the routes hospital
information and all we have about 70,000
service partners who use our app the
tree every single day we continue to
serve more than 10,000 customers every
single day we want to create a million
jobs in the service sector and again my
suggestion to everybody who is thinking
about doing something of their own is
don't be scared nobody to the best of my
knowledge and the IDE of
entrepreneurship we've got a great idea
just keep at it you need to gather of
your office's and go into the real
ballot in India if you really want to
build an app which is to be successful
in India
give yourself a big hand you know think
about the massive problems that are
being addressed here right health for
Indians by addressing everything from
cardiac issues as well as diabetes to
understanding how you create employment
and better outcomes for the service
sector to keeping Indians informed in
their local language to getting people
safely from one place to another can you
think of any other market that has this
immense opportunity and this great
active ambitious developers to solve
them I can't so this is an invitation
for you to solve for India and who
better to tell us about it than the VP
for India and South Asia Rajan London</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
