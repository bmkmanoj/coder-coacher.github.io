My name is Kartik Singh.
I study in St. Marks Senior 
Secondary Public School, Meera Bagh.
I came to know about 
this Google Code To Learn contest
from my [inaudible] of Gaming Taboo,
he called me to participate 
in this contest.
I made this game &lt;i&gt;Vertica Max&lt;/i&gt;,
which I was inspired from a PC game--
I love that game,
so, I've made this game, which was
an adventure and [inaudible].
I made this app using the software Scratch.
Scratch is an easy platform
as it has embedded coding,
so we have to just drag and drop
and we can place these codes
and we can move further.
While making this game, 
I faced many problems
as sometimes I didn't know 
what to do next.
&amp;gt;From Google Code To Learn contest,
I learned even how to manage my time
between gaming and studies.
And after doing many hard works,
I've overcome all of the problems.
I want to become a software engineer--
it was my dream,
and I want to make games and apps.
Google Code To Learn contest 
was the right platform
on which I can show my skills 
in gaming and doing codes.
With my coding skills, 
I can help my dad in his business
as I can make many websites and apps.
I learned even how 
to overcome all the problems
and it increased my self-confidence.
