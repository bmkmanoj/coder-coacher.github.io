SPEAKER 1: I want to thank you
all for taking time to come.
The reason why we started this
program called Solve for India,
we want to make sure
that we're able to reach
people who are using
smartphones across all class
and categories.
SPEAKER 2: So the
next billion is
a term that's been
used for a while
now about the people
who are coming
online for the first
time in their life.
A lot of these users have
very different characteristics
compared to the users of before.
SPEAKER 3: Building apps,
keeping that in mind,
becomes critical for us.
SPEAKER 4: Why should
we focus on emerging
markets, the rationale for it?
And the things
that you might want
to keep in mind if you
want to get engagement
from the next billion users.
SPEAKER 5: It was an overall
very good experience.
I am a mobile
developer, he convinced
me to move to [INAUDIBLE]
from [INAUDIBLE]..
So it was very good.
SPEAKER 6: We got
to learn many things
like how to get started
with Firebase to improve
the quality and the
memory of the application.
SPEAKER 7: When it comes to a
[INAUDIBLE] app in Firebase,
it's not very easy
to understand.
But they explain it, which we
can understand really well.
SPEAKER 8: Very nice to
see such a fresh people
working in the tech field, and
doing something for the nation,
and following their passion.

SPEAKER 9: Google
Solve for India.
