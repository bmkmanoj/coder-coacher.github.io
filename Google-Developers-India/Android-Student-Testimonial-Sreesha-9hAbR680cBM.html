audacity to create the content itself
you know we were we were amazed about it
when I was eleven year old kid I got
into a robotics class and I learned
basic C C++ which would interface with
the robot itself I'm not a single
handedly a geek so I have a group of
friends and we were looking into a
reliable resource and we found Udacity
from that point on I code almost like
three four hours a day as a computer
science engineer I've always wanted to
be a full-stack developer the on the
goal of software development is what
attracts me to Android I could put it up
on the place where I could see the users
videos I could see that it's actually
impacting someone computer science is
about having the urge should develop a
piece of software and give it out to the
end user and you're seeing that the
users are benefitting from them that is
one thing that all every developer V
full stack developer every UX developer
should aim towards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
