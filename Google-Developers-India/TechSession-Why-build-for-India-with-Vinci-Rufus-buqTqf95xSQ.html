VINCI RUFUS: So I'm here to
talk about why build for India?
How many of you have heard of
this thing called the Internet
Trends Report?
Something that comes out
every year from Mary Meeker?
Only one?
OK.
I would strongly encourage all
of you to have a look at that.
It's an amazing report
that comes out every year--
a lot of CIOs,
CTOs, and big brands
eagerly look out for it, just
to see what consumers are doing
year on year over the internet.
So a couple of years back,
it was primarily US-focused.
Last year, there was
a big focus on US,
there was one section
on China, and a couple
of slides on India.
And this year, there was a
complete section only dedicated
to what's happening in India.
And now a couple of
slides to try and sell
the whole case of why you
guys should start building
for India.
The first one, I think there
has been no better time
to be living in India right now.
Right?
India is growing at
the fastest pace.
So the year on year growth
for India was at about 6.8%,
which is actually
beating China, in terms
of the pace at which
you are growing.
And if you are a technologist
building for the web using
the internet, that's even great
because the internet growth
in India is amazing.
In 2014, we had about
233 million users.
We were ranked
third in the world.
And in 2016, we are about
462 million users, which
is-- we are at number two now.
So we beat US and we are
really close to beating China
right now.
So we are kind of doubling
in the next two years or so.
And it's not that we're
adding users to the internet,
but also the kind
of data consumption
that people have been
using has actually shot up.
So this is a graph
of how data has
been consumed by different
users across India.
And you'll see that it
has been sort of stagnant
for a couple of months, and
then suddenly, in the last year
or so, it has shot up.
And we call it the
geo effect, right?
So once geo, you
can actually see
that 9x growth that has
happened up on data consumption.

And what's also
interesting is-- so yes, we
know that in India, people
are very sensitive to data.
We are very careful about how
much of data is being used.
But trends are changing now.
So two apps, gaana.com, and
even Hotstar, which consume--
which are sort of high data
consuming applications,
they are seeing significant
traction happening.
So they're seeing 2x
growth, 3x growth happening.
So what's great in India
is a huge [INAUDIBLE],,
people are coming online,
and they are consuming data.
So we have about
100 million people
getting added every year.
So it happened last year.
It's happening again this year.
Right?
And who are these new people?
Who are these new people who
are coming on the internet?
Let's kind of get a
good profile about them.
So for one, they
are the millennials
and the centennials.
So millennials are
the people who were
sort of born in 1985 onwards.
They are sort of, now, the
biggest consumer segment.
They're making a
lot of purchases.
And they constitute
most of the biggest work
force that's there in India.
And a lot of brands,
companies, are
very eager to understand
who these millennials are.
How do they behave,
how do they interact?
A lot of research work
is happening over them
and brands are trying to
adapt to them because they
are the biggest consumer base.
What's interesting is the next
generation, the centennials,
who were born
around 2000-on, they
are actually getting into
the consumer space right now.
So they're going to be adults
in the next couple of years,
and probably in some
of the applications,
they already are users.
And what's different
for centennials is these
are probably the
very first generation
who are born with internet
being a part of their life.
So from the day
they were born, they
have been experiencing
the internet.
They have been seeing
YouTube videos.
The moms have been giving them
breakfast and lunch and dinner
making them watch
YouTube videos.
They have learned nursery
rhymes watching YouTube, right?
They have learned to swipe
on mobiles and tablets
even before they
have learned to walk.
So that's a completely different
segment, and that's a huge--
and it's a very
interesting space
of how these people
are going to be
interacting with the internet.
The next people are
coming online in India
are the people
from the villages,
the small towns,
and tier two cities.
So these are the
people who are getting
their very first
smartphone, they're
getting experience
of the internet.
And they're being
fascinated by it.
And what's common
between both of them
is their very first
experience of the internet
is on a mobile device.
Very different from what it
was during my generation.
I mean, for me, the first
time I got onto the internet
was on a 512 kb2 modem.
Dial up [INAUDIBLE]
and you open a browser.
You go to Yahoo.com.
Google wasn't at there
at that point of time.
But today's generation
experiences internet
for the first time on mobile.
And they spend a lot
of time on mobile.
What's also very interesting is
everybody has a mobile number.
They may or may
not have an email,
and they actually do not
use an email very often.
Because they have messaging
apps to take care of.
And that's also another
very interesting fact.
You know, there was a time
when me and my friends
were debating, what's
making WhatsApp so popular?
WhatsApp is the number
one app all across.
What is so popular
about WhatsApp?
Would any of you guys
take a shot at it?
What makes it so different?
I mean, at the initial
stages when WhatsApp just
came into the market,
they had one feature
that made it different from
every other app that was there
at that point of time.
If anybody had to take a guess,
what would you think it was?
Sorry?
Exactly.
I think WhatsApp was one of
the very first applications
that did not require you to
have an email or a password.
Even today, I do not have
a WhatsApp password, just
a phone.
I put in my phone
number, get a OTP.
I'm on immediately,
up and running.
So there is one single
thing, which-- you know,
it took me a while to figure out
that these guys had implemented
that years back.
And that's what
makes it different.
And I think that's something
we should also start doing.
Why have an email?
Why do a forgot password
and all of that?
You have a mobile
phone, you have OTP.
Go and build applications
on top of that.
So those are the things.
A couple of interesting quirks.
I think something that even
[INAUDIBLE] touched upon
earlier.
So about 33% of
smartphone users in India
run out of storage every day.
So you're, every day,
deleting your morning messages
from WhatsApp, your codes, and
your videos, and all of that.
And the next day you wait
for it to, again, get loaded.
So 33% of your smartphone users
are running out of storage
every single day.
About 50% of the Indian
users are at 2G speeds.
Your phone still
says, probably, 4G
[INAUDIBLE] but you're
experiencing it on 2G, yeah?
It's the fact that
it is that, and we
have to take that into account.
And the cost of running an app.
So obviously, a lot of
echoing the same points that
was already mentioned before.
You may build a free
app, but it actually
can cost anywhere between
100 rupees or more
for them to download the
app and experience it,
and people might be
sensitive towards that.
So these are some of
the high-level personas
and guidelines that
a person is there.
And the second thing
I want to touch upon
is the diversity that's
available in India.
So I'm sure
everybody knows India
is a very diverse country,
culturally and all of that.
But also, the interesting
thing is that the technology
landscape is diverse.
I think India is one of the
very few countries where--
we probably have the most
number of mobile manufacturers.
The kind of mobile
devices that you
have from different
operating systems--
not operating systems-- from
different manufacturers,
to different screen sizes,
to different combinations
of screen sizes
versus battery life,
versus the quad core processors.
That is the biggest
that's available in India.
In no other country
will you find
that kind of a fragmentation
of devices that's there.
The second thing is
the connection speeds.
So India is one of the
very few places where
you can find anybody
from 2G to 3G to 4G
all being consumers
of their app.
Right?
And you need to start building
applications for them.
And finally is the diversity
that actually comes
as a part of demographics.
So in terms of the dialect,
in terms of consumer behavior.
So I think India, as a single
country, offers all of this.
And what we keep telling to a
lot of our clients in the US
and others is, if you want
to build a mobile strategy,
and you want to experiment
it, do it in India.
If it works in India, it's
going to work anywhere else
in the world.
Because there's no
other country that
can give you this
kind of diversity
across the various technological
landscapes that are there.
So that was there.
And the next question
is then, OK, fine.
Great.
So what do I build?
You could look at a
couple of options.
So as per the latest
trends that we're seeing,
most of the Indians
are spending about 45%
of their time on entertainment.
So that's essentially consuming
OnDemand videos from YouTube,
from the Hotstars of the world.
Or listening to music when
you're stuck in traffic jams
or waiting for a bus to come.
So about 45% of the users are
spending time on entertainment.
And 34% is actually on social
media and messaging apps.
And only about 4 to 2%
is on shopping and news.
So entertainment becomes a
big segment over there for us.
Health care could be
another potential area.
Another interesting stat
that came out was about 80%
of a person's private income is
probably spent towards health
care and health care products.
I'm not sure how true
that is, but that's,
again, from the Mary Meeker's
report that says that.
So 80% of Indians are actually
spending on health care
because you do not have
a very strong health care
system in India.
And another interesting
fact was the ratio
between urban Indians
and rural Indians,
in terms of how much money
they spend on health.
It's actually the same.
So it's not that
people in rural India
are not spending on health care,
but in urban, they are not.
So health care is
another interesting space
that you can look at.
Third, and another interest of--
more interesting is
the self-coaching area.
So we had about 250
million children
get onto the education system
in India in one year alone.
Again, that was number
one all over the world.
So we have the maximum
number of children getting
onto the education system.
And I think there is a tendency
and a trend to always augment
that, using [INAUDIBLE]
and additional coaching
and stuff like that.
Previously, we would
go to coaching classes.
We would have tutors
coming at home.
Now that is changing.
People want on-demand coaching.
And a lot of apps that
are focusing on that area
are doing very, very well.
So on-demand,
self-paced coaching
is an area that you can look at.
And finally-- I think
it goes without saying--
India has a huge
unorganized sector,
and anything that you
can do to try and bring
some sort of an organization
thing into space,
and cut the
middleman and take it
from the unorganized people--
sector-- dedicate to the end
consumers.
That's an interesting space
to build applications on.
So that's an area where you
can start building apps.

What kind of architecture
and design patterns
that you would want to use when
you're building applications?
So any app that you build has
two primary contents, right?
One is the content and the data.
So you know, every app has
to have some data on it.
The second is the
user experience.
So any app that you've
built can be broken down
into these two aspects.
And what we strongly encourage
you is to decouple them
from each other.
Not build an application
where both of them
are together as a monolith.
Now, you know, as a
startup, or maybe you
want to do something very
quickly, you try and find
an open source tool,
like Magento or Drupal
or some other application,
go and build out
that application there.
It then becomes a problem
to scale it up later.
So try and focus
on being decoupled.
And if you dig deeper
into this layer,
it could look
something like this.
So you have a bottom layer that
all the data is taking place.
So you have data
stored in databases.
You're probably aggregating
data from different sources
or, in fact, even using machine
learning to actually build up
that particular data.
And that data is funneled
up to the user using
web services or micro services.
So micro services, as a
concept, is established pattern.
So you would have
Microsoft as a second app.
And then, when you move on
to the experience layer,
you'd have an orchestration
layer, which is probably
built on Node, where you're
kind of orchestrating
this data from
the microservices,
massaging it together,
and then feeding it up
to your end client side app,
which could be a web app,
it could be a native app.
So that's essentially how
[INAUDIBLE] recommend that you
build your applications.
The primary reason
is because it allows
you to swap each of these
layers as and when required.
So for tomorrow, you
have a new technology
coming in for the data earlier.
Or you're switching
your engine from machine
learning from one to the other.
You can just do
that without having
to impact your presentation
layer on the top.
The very fact is your
presentation layer--
when you're building it on,
say, any of the JavaScript
frameworks, or you're building
it on Angular or React--
every six months,
every one year,
there's a new
framework that's coming
in that's doing a much better
job than the previous one.
And you want to switch.
So you can very easily switch
without having to impact
the rest of the application.
So try and build
your applications
in a decoupled way.
It's a very important thing.
The second thing is, have
a true mobile strategy.
So we keep talking about
mobile first, mobile first.
And it just stops over there.
And then you go to
build your application.
Oh, I have a desktop
app, I have a mobile app.
And I have these two
different versions of the app
and it just goes divergent
all the way from there.
I think that's outdated now.
I mean, you need to look
at building applications
for the mobile and
treat your desktop
as just another mobile device.
End of the day,
that is what it is.
It is just another
mobile device for you
with a slightly
larger form factor.
So if you look at
it from that angle,
then any time any new
versions keep coming up,
it's much easier to maintain.
It's much easier to scale
your applications from there.
And the third I
want to touch upon
is with regard to the
single page applications.
So you know, when you're
building front-end for the web,
you have this thing Tom called
the single-page application,
which is supposed
to be very fast,
has a very good user experience.
And then everybody wants to--
kind of rushing to build
single-page applications
on Angular, on React,
and all of that.
It's great.
There's nothing wrong with it.
But then there are
certain pitfalls
that come along with that.
To build single-page
applications,
it sort of becomes a monolith
application on the front end.
So if I told you to
make every small change,
you'd have to deploy
the entire front
end, which means
your regression tests
and all keep increasing, one.
Secondly is, if you
want to swap it,
it tends to get a
little difficult.
So what we kind of recommend
now is this whole thing called
the single-page experience.
As an end consumer, I
don't care if your app
is a single-page app or not.
I care about a single-page
experience, which
means when I'm transitioning
across your apps,
I get a nice
experience out of it.
And you can achieve that
in something like this.
So you break down
your app into modules,
and then you have each
of these modules working
as a single-page app in itself.
So this is a rough example
of how you would do it
for an e-commerce site.
So I would have my home
page and my landing pages
and my categories section.
There's one sort
of single-page app.
And then my product listings
and my details is under the app.
My checkout process is under
the single-page app in itself.
And they're all connected
with each other.
So something like this allows
me to very quickly swap, even
on representation layers.
For example, I have this
entire thing built on React.
Now I want update it to Preact.
Now, doing the entire app
is going to take me time,
but I could just experiment by
changing my PDP on my product
listing page into a Preact page.
See our performance,
see how it works.
And I can gradually
keep scaling it up.
So we have done this for
a couple of projects.
We have gradually moved
projects from Angular
onto React in such a way that
half my site was on Angular,
half was on React.
It works perfectly fine.
So this is something that
you should definitely
try and explore.

The next point I
want to make is not
every app needs to be native.
Right?
So I have asked this
question to a lot of people.
Why do you build a native app?
And these are the
standard answers
I keep getting
every single time.
One is, oh, we have to
have push notifications.
We want to send messages
to my consumers.
OK, great.
Fine.
The second thing
that comes up is
we want a good user experience.
I'm going to dig a little
deeper and ask, what do you
mean by user experience?
Most of the time, it
actually boils down to I
want smooth scrolling, which
is a very small part of a user
experience, actually.
Or we want it to
work in offline mode.
Or we want to take advantage
of a device capability.
So these are the
standard points that
come in every single
time I ask somebody why
you're building a native app.
The truth is all of
that can actually be
built by a progressive web app.
And what exactly is
a progressive web
app, if I were to ask you?
Many people have this--
I mean, it's a new term.
Many people are getting
used to the concept.
A lot of people think
a progressive web
app is a replacement
for native apps,
or something on those tracks.
But we try to differ.
I think progressive web app
is a much bigger platform
than a replacement for native.
What we're trying to
say now is it's actually
a methodology for building
applications for the web,
for building modern
applications.
And this is now
becoming a de facto
across most of the frameworks
that we're looking at.
So if you're looking
at using Angular,
Angular is going to come, by
default, with PWA capabilities
into it.
React boiler plate
supports PWA into it.
Or even if you're
looking at Polymer.
So PWA, or progressive
web app, concepts
are, by default, becoming a part
of any web-based application.
So it is not just a
replacement for mobile,
but look at it as a matter of
building modern web apps right
now.
I'm going to spend a
little bit of time talking
about progressive web apps.
So what exactly is a
progressive web app?
What constitutes a
progressive web app?
These are four or five
guidelines that are there.
You can go around
Google about it.
I'm not going to go
into the details of it.
I'll just give you
some high-level points.
But an application that
has an actual concept where
certain parts of
the application,
which are common across
the site, pre-load first,
and the rest of the
site loads within that.
That's called an app shell.
Your applications
are instant loading.
They have offline support
using service workers.
And they run at 60 frames
per second, which takes care
of my smooth scrolling problem.
An application can be
added to the home screen
and can be launched from there.
An application that
supports push notifications.
So if you have all of
these various parameters,
then you are technically
a progressive web app.
And what I keep saying
is progressive web
app is not a new technology
or not a new method of--
not a new-- oh, you don't really
[INAUDIBLE] an application
to convert it to a
progressive web app.
Every single site that you
build can be easily converted
to progressive web app
just by adding a service
worker and a manifest file.
Just two additional files
that you need to add in
and you're already on a way
to build a progress web app.
So I sort of like to try and
break it down into two ways.
I call this the minimal
viable PWA, or the MVP.
So if you have these five
or six things in your app,
you're already on a journey of
building a progressive web app.
So have an app shell, the
ability to add to home screen,
and offline support.
And trust me.
These are done just by adding
two simple files on an existing
application.
You have an existing
responsive site.
You can convert it to a PWA
just by adding a manifest
file and a service
worker file that
does some sort of
offline caching for you.
And you're already on a
journey for building PWAs.
And once you achieve
an MVP on a PWA,
then go ahead and build a
full-on progressive web app.
And that's where you can go
and add push notifications.
You can also get into something
called a deeply integrated PWA,
where you're PWA actually
works like a native app.
So if you go to my app
section and search for it,
or I go to uninstall, I
can even uninstall my PWA.
So you can do that.
And another cool
thing about PWAs
is a support called
background sync.
What this means is--
suppose I'm doing-- so
by default with the PWA,
you can do offline browsing.
So suppose you run
an e-commerce site
and I'm searching through
my various products.
I can do it whether
I'm online or offline.
It'll still work.
But I'm not going to be
able to do transactions.
Now, with background
sync, it also
allows you to do transactions
to an extent, which means
I can place items to a cart.
I can fill in my
forms and everything.
And I could still be offline.
The end consumer might just
get a notification saying, hey,
I'm offline.
But I'm still
capturing all the data.
And then, the moment I
get online, respective
of whether my app is
on or off, my data
will get synced to my
server from the background,
and my transaction will
actually get completed.
So background sync
is a great way
to reduce your drop-off
rates, especially
on transactional interactions.
So you should definitely
have a look at that.
And these are some
statistics that
have come out from people
who have implemented PWAs.
So Flipkart Lite were
one of the first guys who
implemented PWAs
and their numbers
were like-- they found people
spending more than three
times time on the
PWA than they're
spending on a normal web app.
They found a 40%
higher engagement rate.
They said a 70%
increase in conversions
when it was launched
from the home screen.
And they also found that three--
the data usage dropped by 3%.
So that actually helps
across the board.
Not only is it saving
your end consumer,
it's also saving
Flipkart a lot of money,
which they're paying for
data transfer and data
bandwidth over the internet.
Because the number of users
that they have is so large.
So anything that you
do to lower data usage
helps the end client also.
These are some numbers from OLA
that they recently launched.
OLA recently moved
to a PWA, which
means I don't have to insert
the OLA app to go and book
a cab right now.
And this is some
high-level numbers.
So their original app on
Android was about 60 MB.
On an iOS, it was about 100 MB.
And the PWA is 0.5 MB.
Consider the vast
difference that's there.
And it pretty much
does everything
that your native app does.
So like I said, many
times, you may not even
need to have a native app.
But having said that,
that does not really
mean that PWAs are
competing with native.
I'm not trying to
tell you to replace
your native app with a PWA.
But what I'm
definitely telling you
is replace your responsive
site with a PWA.
So if you have a responsive
site, or active site, whatever,
that has to convert into a
PWA because it's, eventually,
the next generation or the next
evolution of a mobile web app.
So do that.
The next thing I walk
to talk, very briefly,
is about accelerated
mobile pages.
It's called AMP.
It's, again, a
product from Google.
So what PWA does is it gives
a very great experience.
And as you are using
the app, the experience
actually increases.
It becomes faster and faster
because your service worker's
caching your data and it's
actually improving performance.
But one of the
drawbacks of a PWA
could be that the first
download can be a little slower.
And that's where AMP comes
and solves that for you.
The AMP, at a very
high level, is
comprised of AMP HTML,
AMP JS, and AMP Cache.
So they give you a
set of HTML components
that you can add onto
your application.
Add a JS file and your
application is pretty much
an AMP-ready page.
It gets cached on Google CDN.
So when you search
on Google, you
get a nice AMP icon next to it.
And when people are
browsing through your app,
they get a really
super fast experience.
So without having to get
into deep engineering of how
to improve the
performance of an app,
you can very quickly convert
your regular website or an app
into an AMP just by
these five or six steps
that are available over here.
So AMP has been really great
for content-based websites
because, one, it gets
indexed really easily
and, also, the experience
is a lot better.
But we're also seeing a
lot of e-commerce sites
moving onto AMP right now,
and experimenting with that.
And what's interesting is this
combination of both of them.
So we are also-- so there's a
new project that started off--
and a lot of studies are
being done where you're
trying to combine AMP
with PWA, which gives you
the benefit the worlds.
Which means consumers start
their journey as an AMP,
and then they gradually
transition into a PWA.
Which means you get the
benefit of both the worlds.
So instant loading immediately
and a very good, rich
experience as you
continue through the app.
So that is something that you
can definitely try and explore.
And yes, I think it's
high time that web
goes beyond the screen.
So most of the things
that we are building
is always screen-dependent.
Oh, are you doing for 1024?
Are you doing for,
whatever, 1366?
Are you doing for a mobile
screen, tablet screen?
What not.
But the web has
actually moved beyond.
You can go beyond the screen.
And I think these are a few
things that you can look at.
Web VR.
VR is gaining a
lot of popularity.
Somehow, in India, it doesn't
seem to be as popular,
but in the US, it is.
So for example, a
couple of months back,
I was at South by Southwest.
It's a conference that
happens in Austin.
So every stall that was out
there had a VR headset and it,
hey, experience our product or
experience our service on VR.
So VR is gaining a lot
popularity over there.
Then thanks to Google
Cardboard, the prices of VR
headsets have actually dropped.
So you can get a VR headset--
a very nice headset-- for
between $500 and $1,500
on Amazon in India.
It's a nice toy that people can
have, put on a mobile phone,
and you can have a
very good experience.
If you go to YouTube,
there are tons and tons
of 360 videos or
VR-friendly videos
that you can watch
straight out of YouTube.
You don't need to have an app.
You don't need anything.
So that's great.
And we are actually
experimenting
with a couple of clients.
So for example, one of the large
cruises that's out of the US--
buying a cruise
ticket online is--
cruises are very
expensive and people
want to make sure that this is
the right experience for me.
So what we're trying
to do is embed this VR
as part of their
checkout experience.
So you're browsing
through the cruise.
It tells you the photographs,
blah, blah, blah.
And there's an icon
that says, &quot;Experience
this cruise in VR mode.&quot;
You click on that.
It launches into web VR.
And then the person
can experience
how the cruise looks for him
or her in a web VR environment.
And then they can make a
more informed decision of
whether they want to
go with it or not.
So web VR is something that
you should definitely explore.
The next one is this
whole IoT thing.
I'm sure everybody
has had it offered.
Everybody knows the power of it.
IoT also comes with some
interesting challenges.
So most of these IoT
devices have their own sort
of ecosystem of how they work.
The way they
interact and the way
they communicate
with the internet
is on a certain protocol.
The way you control the
device is on a certain app.
So you end up in
situations where
you have an
IoT-enabled light bulb
and there's a
separate app for that.
Or you have a
thermostat, and there's
a separate app for that.
So if you want to
try and control,
you have to keep
launching different apps.
And try and imagine IoT in
a more business environment
or modern enterprise
environment, like a hotel.
A hotel has got
security cameras,
it's got a heating and cooling
system, it's got lights.
And you want to control that.
Now, switching between
different control interfaces
is going to be a pain.
But now this whole term has
been coined the web of things.
So whether you have a
single web interface,
which is powered by data coming
in from rest API and JSON,
and you have a single interface
to control the various devices
that are out there.
So that's the next
sort of thing.
and I think it's high time that
we can start building, or think
of building applications that's
beyond the regular screens.
Look at VR, look at
IoT, and the web IoT.
Thank you.
