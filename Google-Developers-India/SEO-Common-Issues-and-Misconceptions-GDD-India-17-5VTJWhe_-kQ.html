I'm saying Mallick
I lead search outreach in India and
South Asia
and I must say I'm super excited to be
here and to be talking about some of the
most common issues and misconceptions
related to search engine optimization or
SEO that can affect the visibility and
appearance of your pages in Google
search results now what I have what I
have for you in these slides is
basically three things first we will
look at the general mistakes that
publishers make or some of the things
they tend to ignore and some of the
misconceptions that they have then we
will move on to looking at things that
are related to mobile-friendly sites and
then I'll leave you with a piece of
advice on how to hire an SEO meaning if
you want to hire somebody to do SEO for
your website what are the things that
you should look for and what are the
things that you should watch out for so
let's begin first some of the obvious
but not so very obvious things you know
these are some of the common mistakes
that publishers make when they do SEO or
some of the very basic things that they
tend to ignore thinking they are trivial
they are not useful and things like that
and some of the misconceptions they base
their SEO strategies on which of course
if there are misconceptions they will
fail them yeah so what I have done in
this section is basically collected a
bunch of statements from Google's
guidelines and also some of the
statements that we hear from the SEO
community and the publishers time and
time again and some of these statements
are true and some of them are not let us
see how many of these you give them
right okay okay the first one
descriptive page titles meaning
the using the wish implement using the
title tag and URI HTML documents and the
good meta meta descriptions meaning
again the Meta Description tag that you
use in your HTML documents or important
for better search ranking how many of
you think this is true many hands how
many of you think this is not true a few
hands okay all of you who said this is
true were correct yes this is absolutely
true because if you think about it you
know although this may think this will
look like a very trivial thing you know
just a title and a page description
which is actually not visible to your
users on a web page right these things
are not visible to use it however these
are very very important and if you think
about it when a user is in a search
results page these are the only things
or the only window they have into the
content of your website when they're on
the search of those page when your when
your site appears in the search result
this is the only window they have this
will allow them to judge basically
whether they want to click through to
your site or not that's the decision
point so there this is this based on
this so if you do not basically you know
give good creative and useful titles and
descriptions for your pages then even if
you manage to rank well in Google search
results you may lose traffic now this is
not to say that Google always picks the
titles and the descriptions that you
give or you provide Google may also pick
the title in the description from for
example the content of your page right
it tries to make the description and the
title of your result as relevant to the
query as possible however if you do not
have a lot of content on your page
itself then it becomes even more
important for you to provide good titles
and descriptions so this is extremely
important now for the next statement but
content is still King meaning yes of
course you have your titles and your
descriptions and this and that and
everything that you have done for SEO
but if you do not have good quality
content useful content organic and
original content that can give value to
your users
do you think you're going to do well in
the search results do you think content
is king ultimately yes how many of you
ok many hands again how many of you
think it is not I will put my hand down
because I do think it is extremely
important is I see I still see some
hands
some people think content is not
important which is no no no absolutely
wrong because content is definitely the
king because if you think about it again
why would somebody like to come to your
page what are they coming there for not
not for not to see how well you have
optimized your pages for search engines
they are coming there for basically the
content of the page right they want to
consume the content now if you don't
have that content with providing value
to them useful usefulness to them then
of course they will not like your
webpages when they don't like your
webpages Google would not like to show
those web pages to those users of course
right because they don't like it okay
now for the next one and there is a
minimum and a maximum limit of words for
an article for it to rank better right
meaning if your article is too short or
if your article is too long it may not
do well in search results right how many
of you think this is true okay a lot of
hands again how many think this is not
true okay a very very mixed response you
know 5050 I can say well let's see the
results of course this is not true right
so if you think about it again I mean
there are different types of content on
the Internet so one piece of information
can be delivered completely in just one
paragraph for example and the other
piece of information meaning in many
Daan entire page to explain right for it
to be complete so instead of focusing
and counting the number of words in your
articles what you should be focusing on
is are you providing complete
information to your users
organic complete and authoritative
information to users is what actually
matters not the number of words in your
articles now for the next one there is
an optimal keyword density that can help
rank better for the desired keyword
meaning if there is a page and you're
targeting that page to rank for a
particular keyword now there has this
word has two
repeat certain number of times on that
page otherwise Google may not speak that
keyword from that page in the may not
associated your page with that keyword
and may not ultimately rank that page
for that keyword in the search results
how many of you think this is true
Wow a lot of hands how many of you think
this is not true okay for the people who
said who said they think this is not
true you have good news you are you
right this is not true okay so there is
nothing called optimal keyword density I
know there are a lot of hands that were
raised and these are the misconceptions
that I wanted to bust in this session so
there is nothing called optimal keyword
density what you should actually focus
on is the user well of course the
keywords are important you should
definitely step into the users shoe and
think about them think about what are
those keywords that they would type in
this Google search when they are trying
to look for content that you are going
to write write and consider those
keywords and try to include those
keywords in your content definitely for
sure but overdoing that it's not going
to help you indeed it can basically harm
you
you know because imagine reading a
newspaper article which is full of
keyword stuffing you know you see one
one word key repeating many times would
you like to read such kind of an article
in a newspaper absolutely not
so try to make it as natural as possible
do not focus on the density or the
reputation of the words their proximity
and things like that focus on the user
try to make your article sound as
natural as possible and ultimately try
to give them value in your articles now
for the next one it is super important
to fix all the 4:04 errors warnings that
are shown in the search console how many
of you by the way you search console
here well not a lot of you how many of
you I mean I'm so the rest I'm assuming
you don't use search console so search
console is basically a free tool and it
is the only tool in the world by the way
that can give information about your
websites in relation to google search as
in warrior the problems that Google is
encountering what
trying to crawling your pages indexing
your page is a number of other issues
that is encountering that can hinder
your accessibility in Google search
whistles this is the only tool that can
provide you information
it is absolutely furious I would highly
recommend YouTube you now use this tool
it will have a link to this tool in the
coming slides please note that down I
would highly recommend you to sign up
for this tool so when you sign up for
this tool this tool also shows you the 4
0 4 errors Googlebot has encountered
while it was trying to access so it
might have found some links to your
pages which may not be existing or maybe
existing but there are some errors there
and found for zero-force and start
showing these URLs in the search console
now how many of you think fixing all of
these 4:04 errors is like mandatory you
must otherwise your ranking will get
affected many hands again okay
the good news is no you don't need to
write because for the pages that do not
exist they do not exist right it is
right for them to show a 4:04 and that
is what those pages are doing but
Googlebot a Googlebot is somehow you
know coming across the links that are
pointing to those pages and it's trying
to crawl those pages and it is showing
you those warnings but if you think that
page need not exist on your website you
can simply ignore these kind of four
zero-force what happens eventually is
Google tries to crawl these pages a
number of times and then eventually it
will understand that these pages do not
exist forever they've gone forever and
then stop showing you these errors and
for the pages that you think our do
exist
right but Googlebot is still showing a
4:04 then you should check those and
then fix them and here's here's another
one Google's algorithms are way smarter
for me to do anything to help in
understand my images better meaning
Google's image algorithms are like very
very proficient efficient they can
understand all kinds of images and when
you put an image and that image in your
HTML document there is nothing else that
you need to do just provide the image
and Google will take care of it tell me
if you think this is true finally only
one hand Oh
two hands which is good news for me
because yes most of you think
this this is not true and of course this
is not true
while Google's algorithms are like yes
they're great they're brilliant they can
understand images of course a lot but
there are times that they cannot
understand images as well and they
cannot understand all types of images
for example you have been to an on a
holiday to enough obscure place and you
have taken this picture of this obscure
place when you put this picture up on an
HTML page Google may not necessarily
identify that place right or as simple
as it may not be able to differentiate
between a cup of a coffee and a cup of
tea when they're identical as simple as
that right so this kind of thing so what
can you do to help Google search
understand your images when they when
Google search is able to understand your
images then of course it is also able to
show it in the search results right so
it is important for you to help Google
understand these images so what can you
do to help do to help Google and the
Sanyo images make use of the alt tag in
your HTML right in the image tag you
have alt attribute try to use alt
attribute describe your images there
with a couple of key words right and you
can also provide the caption for images
wherever applicable on your webpages you
can also name your files instead of
naming at 0 0 1 or jpg you can maybe you
now give it a name proper name that
describes the image itself these are the
places where Google can take hints from
to understand your images better ok that
brings us to the next part of this
session which is common issues and
misconceptions around mobile-friendly
sites now these are some of the issues
that we come across mobile-friendly
sites when you try to crawl them index
them Google faces a lot of trouble and
may not be able to crawl and index these
sites one of the most prominent problems
is blogged resources meaning why a lot
of publishers allow their HTML pages to
be crawled and indexed sometimes say you
know knowingly or unknowingly they tend
to block the attached resources the
resources that are attached to this web
page like for example JavaScript CSS and
image files now why is it important for
you to make these resources available to
Googlebot as well why because google try
is how Google tries to understand your
content is it tries to basically render
your page exit
the JavaScript just how it happens in
your browsers it tried to do the same
thing with your pages to get all the
content in the context right to
understand them better so this is how it
tries to understand your pages and when
you bought for example your CSS and your
website is a responsive design Google
may not understand or know that your
website is a responsive web design
website right and it may not think that
your website is a mobile-friendly site
or if you like providing some content to
users using javascript that content may
be blogged with when you block your
JavaScript and Google may not be able to
get to that content and index that
content and of course may not be able to
show it so it becomes absolutely
important for you to make all these
resources is well available to Googlebot
unplayable content this is another issue
that we have seen on major websites as
well by the way you know when you use
plugins that are not supported by mobile
browsers for example this makes for a
very very bad experience for even your
users and it it makes it creates
problems for Google crawler as well when
Google tries to crawl for example if
you're using flash on your on your pages
Google may not be able to get to the
content that is where that is within the
flash component right it may not be able
to read through it right and your users
were accessing your webpages from the
mobile device may also be not be able to
access it so it makes for a bad user
experience so these are the things some
some things that can actually affect
your SEO as well interruptive
interstitials right I'm sure some of
some of us have experienced this when
you open a web page on your mobile
device you suddenly see a pop-up which
is like ant covering an entire page it
is blocking you from accessing the main
component or the main content of that
page or to do the desired action on that
page until you do something you close it
or you sign up you download something
and things like that right this is
against Google's policy guidelines
because this does not make for a good
user experience
what we suggest instead if you have to
show something then use smaller banners
without blocking the o main content of
your pages slow pages now this is again
more from the user experience
perspective I am 100% sure that each one
of us in this room have experienced this
right especially when you're on your
mobile devices on the go you try
to access some information and then that
page simply doesn't load in fact surveys
have shown that 53% these are the global
surveys 53% of the people tend to leave
your website if it takes just more than
3 seconds to load right you heard it
right 53 percent of the people tend to
leave your website if it takes more than
just 3 seconds to load unfortunately
surveys also show that 75% of the
websites that are rated a take more than
10 seconds that's ironic right so you
would definitely want to go back and
check how you can improve the speed and
when you're building your mobile pages
especially try to build them for flaky
connections interruptive connections and
mobile users now the last one here
faulty redirects this is again one of
the major problems that create problems
for Googlebot as well as users right so
what we have seen is especially this is
applicable especially when you take the
separate URL approach meaning you have
example.com as your desktop website and
MDOT example.com as your mobile website
and then you know when somebody's
accessing your mobile version or a or an
extra version for mobile phone or a
mobile version from a desktop you know
you need to redirect your users and
these redirects do not function properly
and if they do not function properly
they create a lot of problems for google
crawlers in understanding your content
crawling and indexing your content as
well as create a frustrating experience
for users in an idle scenario what
should happen is all your desktop pages
should redirect to the corresponding
mobile version of your pages right but
what we have seen is sometimes when you
do not have for example if there is a
page that is only available on the
desktop version of your site and that's
this particular page is not available on
your mobile version people tend to
redirect they're trying to access the
mobile version of this page to the
mobile home page or they just give a
4:04 right both of these practices are
not great because users do not
understand what a 4:04 is and they're
more confused when they are redirected
to the home page so they try to go back
and try to act
so that URL again so that creates for a
very very bad user experience right so
and when even when Google is trying to
crawl your pages if you're redirecting
it here and there and everywhere then
Google also get confused and it may have
difficulty in crawling and indexing your
pages so those were the things with the
with related to mobile-friendly sites
the common issues and here are some
basic tools that Google provides to make
sure that Google understand your
websites as mobile-friendly and to help
you make your websites mobile-friendly
as well right on on the Left you have
test my site you can access this through
GGO
test my site if you go to this link it's
a simple tool you enter a URL it gives
you a binary answer as to whether Google
considers your website mobile-friendly
or not sometimes you may think your
website is mobile-friendly you open it
on a mobile device it works fine but you
know at the back end maybe some of the
resources are blocked like JavaScript
and CSS and Google may not understand it
as a mobile-friendly site those kinds of
problems can also be highlighted using
this tool the other tool that we have is
the mobile usability report this
basically is accessible through search
console so if you don't have a search
console account you may not be able to
access this so you'll have to first sign
up for the search console account and
then this is this gives you a more
holistic view about your entire website
of the problems that Google encountered
while it was trying to understand crawl
your mobile-friendly site right okay and
there are more tools of course and time
does not permit us to I go through in
detail of each of these tools so I'll
leave you with the names of these tools
so that you can go back and explore and
I'm sure some of these tools were also
covered in some of the other sessions
that you may have attended they're like
chrome experience report lighthouse
PageSpeed insights chrome dev tools in
webtest
org these are some of the tools you
should definitely look for that can help
you increase your page speed make your
websites mobile-friendly and things like
that
and of course while talking about
mobile-friendly websites our discussion
I think is incomplete without mentioning
mobile first indexing now how many of
you heard about mobile first indexing
here very very few hands okay what is
mobile first indexing mobile first
indexing too so far Google considered
your desktop version of your websites as
primary version so it relied upon your
desktop version to get information like
the primary content of your web pages
the meta data and the structured data
right now this is changing Google is
going to consider the mobile version of
your pages as primary and it is
primarily going to rely on your mobile
version to get all this information
meaning if you do not provide this
information the full the full primary
content the metadata and the structured
data only the mobile version of your
site then Google may not get all the
information right and it may not be able
to show your pages as well as as it
could if you did provide so it becomes
now important for you to ensure that all
of these three things primary content
metadata and structured data are
equivalent between your mobile site and
your extrav site now of course if you're
using a responsive design for example
there is not much for you to worry about
or even a dynamic serving approach if
you have taken to Bill your
mobile-friendly website because what is
happening in responsive design for
example you're just changing the format
of the same content the content remains
the same you just change the content the
format of the content to serve to dick
stop users and to the mobile users right
content is not changing metadata is not
changing nothing is changing even the
structured mock-up that you have on
those pages remains the same so there is
a kind of nothing to worry about but if
you have taken the separate URL approach
then of course there is something to
worry about go back and check that your
mobile version is equivalent in terms of
these three things to your desktop
version okay now for websites which
provide their services or their content
in multiple languages like multilingual
websites when you're implementing the
rel eco rel equals H of langa lament now
you need to make sure that the different
language websites of the desktop version
link to each other and the different
language website of your desktop mobile
version link to each other meaning they
do not cross link right so a language
website
do not cross link using the href Lang
tag to the addiction shop website the
extra page is not linking to the mobile
site a mobile site is not linking to the
next table rather they are linking to
the desktop versions
different languages and mobile versions
of different languages for mobile and
for the as for the rel equals canonical
tag and rel alternate' which you use
when you use the separate URL approach
example.com and M dub example.com where
your example.com is the primary version
the canonical version and then the the
MDOT version is the alternate version so
you would have tags like your Dijkstra
version is pointed as canonical and this
has the alternate you can keep that tag
as it is there is no need to change that
tag okay now quiz time again now here
there are two statements here first one
reads google recommends responsive web
design how many of you think this is
true okay like 50% of you and assuming
50% of you don't think this is true how
many of you think responsive web design
is preferred by Google's ranking
algorithms meaning if you have a
responsive web design
Wow surprisingly more hands up there
okay let's see well while the first
statement is true the second is not
Google does recommend responsive web
design for various reasons right it does
recommend responsive web design but that
does not necessarily mean that Google
also prefers responsive web design while
ranking right what this means is
irrespective of what technology you are
using what methodology you're using what
approach you're using either your your
website has taken the responsibility
sign approach or the dynamic serving
approach or the separate URL approach we
treat them all the same when it comes to
ranking absolutely the same Google
algorithms do not look into the
background technology when they're
ranking pages they just look at the
content of your page and the 200-plus
factors that we have to rank your pages
and with the Ulf site is mobile-friendly
or not as far as your website is
mobile-friendly you're doing good no
matter what technology you're using okay
that brings us to the last part of this
session which is hiring an SEO now this
begins with
here's another statement it is better to
hire a Google certified SEO or SEO
agency and to check their certification
whole month to verify how many of you
think this is true not many hands okay
how many things this is not true okay if
some more hands which is which is kind
of great but for the people who think
this is true unfortunately this is not
there is nothing like a Google SEO
certification absolutely nothing if
somebody tells you that they are a
Google certified SEO turn your back and
run away right because they are the
absolute frauds we do not have anything
like Google SEO certification well you
may have other certifications Adwords
and things like that we we never had or
never will have I think Google SEO
certification now hiring an SEO is a big
decision you know it comes with pushing
potential advantages of course if you
hire a right SEO but if you hire a rogue
SEO then you can potentially have a lot
of damages you can even lose your
current ranking and money and a lot of
things you know so it's a big decision
so how can you determine an SEO is right
for you or an SEO agency is right for
you or not there are some useful
questions you can ask things like these
you know first of all ask them can you
show me some examples of your previous
work or they really established a SEOs
or a very new SEO s
right that are going to disappear in a
couple of months what happens with these
SEO is where genuine SEO s can work for
a longer period of times because they
are they are not violating any of the
search quality guidelines now they are
not deceptive you know so they're not
frauds so they longer they stay longer
in the business so if an SEO is staying
longer in the business and if they have
good reputation and good quality work to
showcase then they are something that
you can look forward to and move your
conversation on what also ask them if
they follow the Google search quality
guidelines if they say no then they are
not the people you should be hiring
because if they don't follow the Google
search quality guidelines then you know
with the Google search quality team may
even take a manual action on your
website which means they can remove your
websites website from Google's index
entirely or maybe push down your your
website in the result can also happen so
if they're not following Google search
quality guidelines they are not the
people you would want to work with the
other things you can also ask is like
what kind of experience do you have
beyond SEO in general marketing and
stuff like that because SEO is something
not standalone it can't be done
standalone it is a it is a it is a part
of the entire mix you know so if
somebody's doing SEO alone then you may
have you may want to be a little bit
vary and then go into the details as to
what they are doing and things like that
but if it's a marketing agency that
specializes in different types of
marketing things you know social media
marketing here and there and all sorts
of things including SEO then of course
you can you can proceed with them and
also one of the important questions you
should all you should also ask is like
what kind of results can I expect if I
hire you if they say ok we can bring you
with the number one position for this
keyword in two months again turn your
back run away because they are the
absolute frauds no one no one on the
face of this earth can guarantee you a
number-one position ever and ever
okay so if anybody promising that thing
to you know for sure that they are
frauds okay what kind of experience we
have in you in my industry you know you
know this is an important question as
well because this is to understand if
they understand your business your
business objective your business goals
and your users as well you know do they
understand them well or not if they do
not then probably they are not the
people you want to work with if they
understand all of those things well if
they have already have experience in
your industry then those are the people
that can potentially help you what kind
of experience do you have in developing
international sites this is especially
relevant for people who have
multilingual sites or sites that are
targeting multiple regions then if they
are the s you already has an experience
in there then probably you can hire them
and then what sort of techniques to you
use if they say no no the techniques say
that we use a top secret then again the
same formula Toni Oba
maybe decide and run okay because when
they're not transparent there is
something wrong there is definitely
something wrong a genuine SEO what can
be hundred percent transparent to you
they can share with you every single
thing that you're doing with the join
with your website and how long have you
been in business as I said earlier good
SEO tend to stay longer in the business
because they're not frauds so they tend
to be there and then finally can I
communicate with you are they really
open or they really transparent are they
going to share everything with you that
they're going to do with your website
right yes or no if they say no no we
can't say share some things we can share
only some things then probably those are
not the people's you may want to work
with okay so that's all I had for you if
you have any questions I'm available
there a couple of my colleagues are also
