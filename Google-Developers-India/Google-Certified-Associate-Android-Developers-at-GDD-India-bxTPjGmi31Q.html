meeting some of our certified alumni I'm
working how we doing with the program
we're doing really well we have nearly
300 Indian alumni here and it's been
really fun talking to all of them yeah
it's really great to hear the stories of
leadership people making connections
getting jobs promotions we're just
excited for everything that the alumni
do and more so I have attended like two
to three Google event in Mumbai but I
have never came to this a big event and
this event is very awesome it's my dream
actually to be part of this event and
all the meeting Google people and my
favorite part was being in the launch in
the open area where everything was being
demoed and I met other people near the
certification lines we have a huge
community of people who respond and
react to your questions and queries day
in day out other than that we have the
Google developers themselves from the
Google Groups who respond to queries our
largest group of alumni are from India
we have about 300 and it's constantly
growing so it's great to be here in
person and meet the biggest part of our
alumni group after getting my
certification the way people you know
interview candidate changed and they
were really interested in you know in
the person who has the certification
directly from Google and finally it
ended up me and the job that I wanted a
couple of offers and I get to choose
when the organizations here nowadays
asked if you were certified up ok come
forward and we'll have an interview with
you before this certification I was not
very confident about my skills and after
certification like then I came to know
about myself what is my level of coding
and I get confident about my developing
skills and Android states these
certifications are all based off of the
job task analysis
this means that we've gone out into the
field and we've talked with people who
have these jobs as careers or who are
currently hiring and basically asked
what is it that you are looking for when
you're hiring an associate level Android
developer so all of this combines really
creates a unique certification
experience and for my companies and I'm
getting more value at you because I'm 35
on Google we have been highly
appreciated and they said that this is a
good thing because it's not just a
personal achievement
it's a achievement for the company also
to say that we have not just developers
we have certified developers working
with us so I've been working for three
years as a back-end developer and now
I'm going to be a full-time Android
developer I'm gonna start from day after
tomorrow I have proof that I'm an
Android developer and Google has tested
my all skills and then I have this patch
