of 2017 and I now I have a mid Sanjeev
with me of the dating profiles busy but
a lot of interesting questions being
Manning the sandbox for architecture
components and we also have an officer
for battery performance so a lot of
interesting questions of a lot of
developers now as we mentioned battery
performance like I am also a user and I
have seen this battery performance
issues forth so for a developer in India
how can they improve on battery
performance so the number one thing that
I would say is go ahead and first
measure how much battery is getting
consumed by your application that
measurement is really really important
which gives you a baseline on which you
can improve upon the second thing as
weight loss management a stock wakelock
and actually great a lots more battery
than you think it would how network
operations are managed if you can
offload it to job dispatcher or the job
scheduler they will manage the job and
colace it batshit things like that will
happen and make it much better in terms
of battery consumption and the third one
would be in terms of long running
processes some of the applications do
use a lot of long-running process in the
background and those can be kind of
removed and eliminated so a combination
of these things kind of helps improve
metrics are there any links where they
can go and read all this things that you
mentioned under the bill for billions we
have a section for battery management of
the battery historian is an open source
project in github so you should
definitely take a look at that and set
that up it takes about five minutes to
set it up
you also mentioned about components so
what are they are you planning to do
something with those Google i/o has
released a set of components for
improving architecture of your app it
reduces boilerplate code avoids common
mistakes that developers usually have in
their application which leads to kind of
degraded performance more bugs and
crashes leaks in memory these things can
be avoided so a combination of these
components can be used in order to kind
of clean up your app make your app both
testable a very important easy to test
so these the architect Commons allow you
to do that and one thing I really want
to call out is all these architecture
components are not tightly coupled with
each other so you can mix and match what
you want to use and what works best for
you so it's quite interesting in
so what's next so I'm going to be going
ahead and talking to the engineers and
the PM's who are behind this component
and we'll get some first-hand
information from those guys watch out
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
