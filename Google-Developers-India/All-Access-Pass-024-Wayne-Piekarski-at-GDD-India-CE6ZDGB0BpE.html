VAIBHAVI DESAI:
Welcome, friends.
We are here at Google
Developer Days India.
And we have with us
today Wayne, who is
a developer advocate at Google.
Hi, Wayne.
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: How has been
your experience with GDD India?
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: It's
been a lot of fun.
I mean we've had
a great time here.
It's been really good to
see all the developers here.
We're really excited about
IoT, and Android Things,
and all that kind
of stuff that we do.
So it's been really cool to
sort of see the energy here.
It's been really exciting.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: Super nice.
For those who
missed your session,
can you give us a quick summary?
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Well,
I gave two talks.
I gave one summary
talk that sort
of talks about
everything Google's
doing to support
developers everywhere.
So we talked about IoT
devices, Internet of Things,
Android Things, Assistant,
the Assistant SDK, TensorFlow,
Firebase, how to
bring it all together.
Because we want to
encourage people to make
apps that sort of solve
all kinds of problems
in all kinds of
different places.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: What are some
cool use cases for IoT devices?
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: I
think IoT devices are
interesting because
we're going to be
able to embed into everything.
And so it's going to open up
all kinds of possibilities
to bring computing to
places where we've never
been able to do it before.
There are people out
there who don't know
how to read or write maybe.
They can't use a phone.
They can't use a laptop.
And so people are going
to be able to speak
to their computers
and listen to them.
And people who have
disabilities will
be able to interact
with computers as well.
So it's going to really
create new opportunities
for developers and solve really
important problems for people.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: So,
Wayne, for the developers
who want to get started
with Google Assistant, which
are some best resources
that you would recommend?
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So
our developer platform
for the Assistant is
called Actions on Google.
And the best way to get started
with that is using a tool
called Dialogue Flow.
You basically write a
bunch of example sentences
for your conversation.
And it uses machine
learning to help
process them to deal with
the conversations that
happen later.
Now, if you don't want to
do any programming at all,
you can actually use our Actions
templates where you simply
fill in a form.
And then you program in
the questions and answers
and different parts
of the conversation.
And it generates
all of it for you.
So there's many
different options
depending on what
you want to do.
And that's a really
great way to get
started getting things working
on the Google Assistant.
VAIBHAVI DESAI: Make
sure you check out
all of these resources.
Thanks a lot for
being with us, Wayne.
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hey, thanks.
It's my pleasure.
