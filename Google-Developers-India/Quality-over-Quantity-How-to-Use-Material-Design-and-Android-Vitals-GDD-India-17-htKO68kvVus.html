session of the day you from almost made
it we are almost at the after party um
thank you for coming along to talk my
name is Nick Fortescue I'm a software
engineer on Google Play and this is my
colleague designer working with Nick on
Google Play um so I've been working on
Google Play since well since it was
Android Market so quite a while now and
we're here to talk to you about why
quality matters in the app now AB
quality is a really important for us on
Google Play we want every Android user
when they open an app installed from
Play to open an amazing beautiful
wonderful app and but of course we don't
write the apps you guys do and so we
need you to help us so my aim today and
your hannises aim today is to persuade
you of how important quality is not just
for all those billions of Android users
out there but also for the for you as a
business so we're going to talk about in
detail I'm going to talk about why the
quality matters your harness is going to
talk about what you can do to improve
the technical excellence of the app and
how we can help you and then we'll just
give you some more beyond technical
excellence so first why is quality
important
well we're Google we're gonna give you
some hard numbers in this so you've seen
this slide before from Dan Galpin in the
keynote we in Google Play in London we
took some apps and we measured their
quality by a number of factors that
you're Hanus will tell you about later
and we split them into categories so we
had to make Slynt apps and some average
apps and then some bad apps and we just
looked at those categories and when we
went from an average app to a good app
those apps were earning six times as
much income now if you imagine what how
your company would be doing if it had
six times as much income from your app
it would be a big improvement and
similarly it got seven times as much
retention that means users coming came
back over and over again far more for
higher quality apps than low-quality
apps so hopefully I've grabbed you that
this is in
hortence but it's not just me it's also
our partners who are describing this so
here's one from Zalando one of the top
fashion houses in europe and they
decided to focus on quality they sat
down I thought like we're not gonna add
new features for a little bit we're just
gonna focus on reliability I'm going to
focus on performance they got their
start up time 30% faster to start and
they also reduced crashes by 90 percent
and that gave some real money but it's
interesting you say six percent monthly
install increase that doesn't sound too
much you've got to remember this install
increase isn't coming from the users who
are already using the app they got that
install increase by improving the app
itself which means better ratings were
happening more people remain
recommending it to their friends and
that gave a fit also gave a 15% increase
in revenue in lifetime value of each
user and that is real money for the
bottom line so spending that time going
let's focus on performance and quality
for a bit rather than just adding new
feature after new feature gives real
benefit and this pays off across we
looked across the ecosystem an apps with
a high crash rate had 30% more
uninstalls on the very first day than
apps with a low crash rate unsurprising
you might think but that's just the
first day that carries on down the tail
of the apps as time goes on and you
might know if you look hopefully you
look at your app reviews you hopefully
know that if you look at the one-star
reviews we ran some text analysis on it
and we found that 50% of those one-star
reviews mentioned crashes stability bugs
or this sort of thing where's the
five-star reviews they're mentioning
over half the time 60% of the time
they're mentioning speed they're
mentioning smooth design they're
mentioning usability so you really want
that quality increase happening so buzu
I don't know how many have used a
language app I've used it it's a really
great language app and it was a great
review school they were getting 4.1
stars on the Play Store I know lots of
developers would kill for a 4.1 star
rating
but they've decided to focus on
performance improvement and they got it
from 4.1 stars all the way up to 4.5
stars now those of you who are app
developers in play will know how hard
getting from 4.1 to 4.5 stars is so
maybe consider focusing on performance
the other thing is we said it's our top
priority to have these healthy excellent
apps in the ecosystems and we're going
to do that to help users find the best
apps so for example our ranking
algorithms in the Play Store they look
at these signals of is an app smooth is
it performant does it crash to decide
how to rank the app we do collections
promoting good apps we give awards and
these awards drive a lot of organic
traffic if you want your app featured if
you want all the publicity that comes
from a Google Play award you need to
meet these performance metrics and then
we'll all have great apps in the Android
ecosystem so you might be wondering well
how do you do that is it some speak
sequel no Yohannes is going to tell you
the measures we use to look at app
quality and you can see some apps which
do really well in this already if you
search for android excellence awards you
will find it we released it in i/o in
april and we've updated it twice and it
was last updated in october we're
planning on updating it quarterly and
you can see some apps in that that are
already excellent so maybe go and have a
look at that on your phone try some of
these apps and you'll see what a really
smooth really excellent usability
experiences it's engaging it's fast it's
got great design so your haniss tell the
developers how they can make their
upgrade great thanks a lot all right so
we have heard a lot about app quality
and why it actually met us let's now
take a look at how you can actually
achieve technical excellence with the
tools that we provided in the pear
console we first second look at android
vitals and this a program but support by
Google that really helps you understand
and improve the quality of your apps and
games and essentially it gives you
signal
run the app health of your data which is
directly connected to the performance of
your app so at Google i/o earlier this
year we launched the Android vitals in
the Play console and this tool allows
you to see aggregated performance data
of your app and also this data is
automatically collected by millions of
devices which means that it's a huge
source for data and the good thing is it
all comes for free so there's no need to
add another SDK you can go into the Play
console look at the at the vitals right
now and you will see data another cool
thing is that this data isn't for
engineers only anymore but everybody in
the company can now look at the data
understand the data analyze the data and
say KPI surround it for example if you
would like to reduce the crash rate you
said in and KPI that you can track
afterwards so it's measurably and so
let's take a look how it works there are
three main pillars for it first of all
you have the metrics we then have the
tools and afterwards the rewards so
let's go through it first of all it the
metrics is there where we provide bad
behaviors and bad behaviors are
essentially patterns or events that have
a direct impact a direct negative impact
on the user experience which is then for
example if your app is very crashing or
if it consumes lots of veteran we
provide you a set of two it's to help
you improve the quality of yap and we do
this throughout the entire lifecycle of
your app for example before release you
use the pre-launch report in order to
track crashes and security
vulnerabilities even before you launch
then at release you can see the release
dashboard and measure the effectiveness
of your current release and after
release you see the android vitals to
help you understand the technical
performance from the field and then last
but not least we have two rewards just
as Nick mentioned this is there to
really help you and to really celebrate
those could behavior
that we would like to see and as as play
all right
so we can't live report on three major
performance areas in the Android budget
which is stability battery and rendering
and for each of those we generate bad
behaviors so you see those metrics for
stability we look at the a in our raid
and the crash rate for battery we we
report if you experience if you have
experience starquake locks or excessive
wake-ups and for rendering we we report
on slow rendering of frozen friends so
we generate those bad behaviors around
these metrics and if something is wrong
with your app we directly notify your so
you're aware of it and you can fix them
all right so since I oh we have a
massive room Anton and more than 65% of
the top 1,000 apps in play have adopted
this feature and made use of it we work
closely with 50 partners and an average
they managed to release the crash rate
from a 3.5 to a 1.7 which is huge
so just to give you a sense for the
scale over the same time these partner
apps went so it's more than 1.5 million
times which results that means of users
worldwide have a measure Allah better
experience and therefore also leave a
better rating alright so for many
partners annual budget is now an active
part of the planning just like their
weather channel for example and by
focusing on air quality they absorb a
direct impact on the customer
satisfaction again all this relates
results in a better and higher rating of
your app all right so inspired by this
momentum we are continuing to scale this
program further and further and we are
really investing in it to make it even
more meaningful we have three main
things to announce which is we have an
expanded device coverage we also report
on five new bad behavior so more metrics
for you guys
and we overall improved the user
experience and yeah it will help you
really root cause and analyze their the
issues that you experience if you
experience something alright so in order
to expand the device coverage work with
several OMS to surface the performance
metrics and more data for you guys so
initially we've reported on Nexus
devices and pixel devices and now we
after talking to many many more OMS we
now have a spectrum across high-end
flagships to mid-range bestsellers and
low-end devices so all this will give
you a great overview about the entire
ecosystem of play by doing this we
increase the amount of user sessions
tracked by the program by 25 times more
data for you all right so we we added
two more metrics for the stability which
is the mochila rate and the multi crash
rate and especially those repeating
crash rates really cause big user of
frustration which then eventually leads
to higher an answer eight and a negative
rating because the app seems hope is
broken so by looking at this data you
can now track those issues earlier and
yeah fix them right away to prevent user
Charlie for battery we now introduce
three new metrics which is the excessive
Wi-Fi scans in the background the
excessive network usage in the
background and the stock background
weight loss and especially those
background those excessive background
activities really consume unnecessary
unnecessary battery from you users and
all this results in in frustration of
the user and then we significantly
revamped the play console user
experience for the Android violets to
help you understand and improve their
quality with this new overview page we
monitor all the different metrics that
we provide you to judge your app quality
and also straight up the top of the page
we now highlight any bad behavior that
was triggered in your app
for any APK any active APK so if you
upload it to iphone to beta or if it's
in production we give you those signals
right away and you can automatically or
immediately focus on the most important
actions also something that we now
introduce is that you can track the
performance of each matrix over time
after you drill down into the details
and you can see it in in comparison to
the bad behavior threshold so you can
see if you are crossing that line you
will then get the notification so
essentially you can measure the
effectiveness of the actions taken over
time we also help you to root cause the
origin of these bad behaviors and by
allowing you to filter the data slice
the data to see ya different options for
example if you slice the data by apk
version by device by OS version or over
time you can really start to see where
the root cause of that issue is and last
but not least we do provide you
benchmarks laws so to help you establish
a reference point and also to give you
some sense how the overall performance
of your entire of the entire ecosystem
us and then wherever possible we we give
you guidance on how to resolve an issue
so in this case when debugging and ANR
you receive guidance on are actually
what caused the application to freeze
and we identify several different cases
for example that locks this guy owes
network iOS and many more so go go check
it out it's life you can use it right
away
so thanks to all this partners are using
the Android budgets in the Play console
and more and more and they are
continuing to invest in their quality
and so do we
so we really love to hear from you guys
how you're using it and also how how we
can improve this product what was useful
for you what what can we do better we
over there in the sandbox
on the other side come and visit us
share your thoughts and have us
make a better product great some last
announcement for the pre-launch report
and so just to give you a quick summary
the pre-launch report is place solution
for automated test for the automated
testing of your app and all that happens
before production release so it
automatically crawls your apk on
physical devices and it looks for
crashes and it looks for security
vulnerabilities and it also generates a
whole bunch of screenshots that are then
across multiple form factors and also
multiple languages and yeah we're
continuing to improve that so first of
all there's no need to opt in to the
service anymore every apk that you
upload to I for beta gets automatically
tested and is ready to review then we
also rewrote the entire robot roller so
it now reaches even deeper into the app
and discovers more crashes which would
otherwise happen for real users on
production and last but not least we do
have performance data in in the
pre-launch report and it now reports on
CPU on memory on network and on
rendering and the cool thing is that it
you can see this data in direct relation
to a video that was recorded throughout
the cross so you can see directly where
they should occur and you can go and fix
it all right so this was a brief
overview about the technical experience
now back to Nick for product excellence
yeah thanks for your honish umm so
anyone can write an app that doesn't
crash right you just have a plain black
screen and it does nothing and you get
no crashes so you need this foundation
of technical excellence but you also
need a great product and so that's what
I'm going to talk to you about but I'm
not going to be able to say that much
here so I do encourage you there's loads
of amazing design sessions going on
behind me or if you're watching online
do you check out the videos afterwards
of some of the mobile design sessions
but the big thing you want is to fulfill
the users
in an excellent way and I'm gonna talk a
few ways about doing that and they want
consistency they want a memorable
experience but they also want a solution
which matches their needs so how are you
going to write features that users love
well you want the latest Android
features make it really easy for you to
give this to users and I'm going to tell
you a little bit about some of the tools
that we'll give you to get great design
into your app so first is material
design now if you're following Google
you've seen this already but it might be
new to you we've launched this a couple
of years ago but it's been getting so
much praise from not just the Android
community but just from independent
designers around the world and
developers around the world and Google
has so many materials but also
third-party sites of offering loads of
tutorials to help you understand not
just the code but all the concepts and
the vision behind this because you got
to remember just sticking in some
material design components doesn't make
your app a material app what makes it a
material app is having these smooth
tangible surface transitions with
meaningful motion do you read the docs
there's so good and explain what it's
all about the other thing you can do is
target the latest SDK now I know a lot
of developers might say but my users are
all on older phones
I want maximum compatibility why would I
target the latest SDK
well this doesn't mean you eliminate all
those old phones but by changing your
target SDK in your build you can give
those users who are on new phones the
best most modern most up-to-date
experience and you've got to remember
those users who are new phones and
remember christmas is coming up there's
an awful lot of phones going to be sold
in the next few months with new versions
of Android and they will have the best
experience and they will tell all their
friends about it and get them installing
your app and we don't just want you of
course there's other platforms in the
world besides Android and the more of
them you support the better it is for
your app quality so do features which
help users on whatever platform they're
on
use things like sign-in with Google this
lets users have one sign in whatever
device they're on and it just can makes
their life simpler another thing you can
do for a really excellent memorable
experience is do all the platforms now
Android isn't just phones have you ever
paused stop for a minute and think what
other platforms could my up support
because we're going all the way from
Android where phones tablets through to
VR TV even in cars nowadays as you saw
in the keynote could your app be there
now not every platform is right for
every app of course but if your fitness
app maybe you could be on the fur on a
watch so the user doesn't have to carry
their phone with them maybe your
education or entertainment would that
work well on a TV or maybe in VR what if
you're a travel app or a guidance app
could that work really well in a user's
car or how about a game would that work
well on a TV think about your apps and
think would these work on the other
platforms because the users with these
platforms it's going to give them a
magical time and they're going to tell
other users about your apps and this
sort of quality is the thing we really
want to imply and it will help you in
the Play Store now monetization is also
really important because with to be
honest without money coming in it's very
hard for you to fund the development on
your amazing app hopefully you've looked
at in-app products but also how many of
you consider using subscriptions so I'm
sure all of you have heard of Pandora
now they had their own subscription
model when they switch to using
subscriptions in Google Play their
revenue went up three hundred ninety
seven percent that's almost five times
as much money coming into their company
from switching to subscriptions in
Google Play New York Times of 125%
Evernote reduced the churn that's all
users when there's a subscription
expired leaving by using Google Play
subscriptions they reduced it 40 percent
this is all going to get you extra money
for your company and fun these excellent
apps now
I've been talking to a lot of you in the
sandbox and a lot of you have never
tried the a/b experiments in the
playlist thing now in the Google put in
the play console you can do things like
try which icon works better for installs
this one this one let's try on 1% of
traffic and do a proper experiment see
works better and people have had amazing
results people have used alpha beta
channels to get feedback from they're
really keen users and don't forget the
tools to respond to users comments and
we thought I had in developer in the
sandbox this morning come up to me and
saying users often leave comments that
like they just don't really make any
sense
how do I respond to them and by going
into the play console and saying thanks
for that I can help you
giving yours email address users will
see that and they'll go this developer
cares about their users and you will get
more installs from it so do your best to
respond friendly be friendly and helpful
to every comment and it will do wonders
to not only your star rating but also it
will give you loads of ideas for
improving out quality so just one
example don't just believe me I'm wall
apart they did some experiments so they
did a few things they tried their short
description and changed it then they did
another experiment with different
screenshots and then they even did
things like what order should we put the
screenshots on and they're listing and
by doing a few experiments like this one
after the other they got 17% improvement
and they are no way the highest in the
Play console we've seen developers get
30% conversion installs so this is
people who came to the outlets at
listening in play and get 30% more
installs by doing these experiments it
doesn't take very long you should
definitely try it but the real key to
this is you need a clear hypothesis
I think this icon will work better I
think
encouraging this type of user will work
better and you need some big design
variations don't just make I'll go from
light blue to dark blue make some really
bold designs because we're
you can limit the traffic change it goes
to so it only goes to 1% of users and
you can get some really amazing results
so let me recap your app quality affects
your business success this is going to
make real difference to the money you
have coming in so the number of users
you have installing to the users coming
back to your app again and again and
recommending it to your friends we
measure quality using the same signals
you get in Android vitals we're not
leaving you in the dark so if you care
about your recommendations in play and
you care about your users you should be
going to Android vitals on fixing the
bad behaviors the crash is the ANR's you
see there so every user in Android on
every app has an amazing thing and it's
not just technical excellence going and
adopting the latest phones and making
your app have a beautiful design with
things that really meets the user's
needs can really help you drive more
traffic to your app so thank you so much
for your time do come and find us we'll
be in the sandbox all day tomorrow and
we'll be at the launch party in a minute
we look forward to launching to you will
answer any questions you have about
Google Play Google Play console and look
forward to seeing you later but enjoy
the party thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
