Google i/o 2017 and I'm pretty excited
for what's more to come and right now
the seat can't miss me the seat is the
manager for Android Everest in a fee how
are you I'm great thank you
hope you had a great eye a while till
now yeah it was really amazing
so nothing there are a lot of developers
in India whole developing apps for
Android and a few questions that are
quite common they have not many of them
have machines that are having high
configuration though Android studio have
improved a lot in the past are there any
improvements to come yeah so with 3.03
v1 you know 16 significant improvement
in bill suite that they are we
constantly working on a very high
priority for us even otherwise we have
detailed instructions on our side to
configure studio for Lo and
configuration machines these are things
like don't go with your Mac team size
beyond 512 MB turn on the power save
mode remove the Lynch secretary don't
need and things of that kind if you are
on a Windows machine then try out check
out the 32-bit studio on a 32-bit 32-bit
JDK that really helps a lot with memory
in this i/o we announced to insert app
so even if you are not targeting is too
tough right away I would encourage you
to look at the reese refactor of your
app into modules we call future modules
so that helps in making the app look
more rocket actually a sane but at the
same time if you have module which are
not dependent on each other you can get
better incremental build speed the
second common problem that P developers
in India have a sprint work network in
India again sometimes get spikes like
even if or they're on a 4G or 3G network
it can act something really bad because
the number of users are more sore what
is your advice for people who are
developing for such networks yeah great
work yeah I think the biggest of first
recommendation I would give is don't a
view network in your app always assume
that network will be either bad or flaky
right for the cash flow basically write
your app with cash in mind try to read
data from cache so it's like read
through design where you read from the
cache first and only then
network connection or network call and
also try to prioritize your network
request so things like user is looking
at the app try to make the network calls
only for data that is relevant for that
screen if you have still things to do
you can differ them you the job
scheduler maybe think of that kind so
that would really help in getting a
better user experience in our if network
is really patchy you should also make
you the connectivity manager so make use
of that try to make sure that you know
the network condition when your app is
making network network also make use of
that differ the jobs that are not needed
right away using Java scheduler the job
info has some parameter where you can
schedule it where the network condition
is right for that request and what if I
am a newbie Android developer or I'm
just starting to the for Android which
are the resources if there are any that
are available online I should go to
videos or documents or like what is the
link that I should follow basically yeah
so developer.android.com is a great
place to start so start from there you
will also find lot of interesting
trainings the Udacity course that was
recently launched is also pretty recent
you should check this out you should
definitely start looking at Android oh
right away if you are beginning to
develop because there are things and
have changed in oh that will be relevant
going forward so also help in designing
the app right so look at that if you are
developing specifically for India market
or markets that are specific to those
there are there are guidelines to
designer up in such a way that is that
will be ready for for like you said
network conditions and low-end devices
so definitely think of that we have a
great checklist to look at I'll send you
the link for that the last question I
have is this developers or this Indian
developers have a lot of questions
sometimes where are the links or what
are the Twitter handles they can simply
go and tweet and ask this question sure
sure so we are we are very active on G+
Google+ they are also very active on
Twitter we have a
we have a Twitter account for Android
developers and studio we also have
Android developer community on Google+
so joining all of those check those out
post your questions there we are happy
to help thanks for all those answers
Nasir and thanks for joining us as well
today I know you were having a very
hectic schedule because of the i/o and
by the way do check out if you haven't
yet the scenes video and what's new in
Android oh for developers thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
