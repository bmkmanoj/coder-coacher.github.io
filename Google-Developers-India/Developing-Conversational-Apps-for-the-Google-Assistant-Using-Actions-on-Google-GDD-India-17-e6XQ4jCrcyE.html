sore throat but my name is Dan and I'm
advocate for dialogue flow and actions
on google and during the session we're
going to look at how you go about
building an app for the Google assistant
so let's start by introducing the
assistant platform at Google we believe
the future is AI first and we've been
investing heavily in the areas of
machine learning speech recognition and
language understanding so these things
all come together in the Google
assistant it basically allows you to
have a conversation with Google that
helps you get things done because of
these investments in AI the conversation
can be completely natural you just use
your voice asked in a natural way and
the assistant will help you so what does
this mean for a developer well the
assistant platform has three parts the
first part is the device being used to
interact with the assistant so it could
be the mobile phone Android wear watch a
Google home smart speaker or many other
devices and the Google assistant is the
conversation between the user and Google
they can get things done just by talking
with the assistant and there are many
things the user can do just by using the
assistant directly but the third part
which is actions on Google allows
developers to extend the assistant so a
developer can implement an assistant app
and this is what we're going to focus on
today by the way the assistant is
available in many different languages
we're launching new languages and
locales all the time so you can support
many users and different languages all
around the world and we actually just
announced support for Indian English so
how does an assistant app work well we
built an example around a personal chef
which is an app that suggests recipes
based on what you want first the user
needs to invoke your app so they say a
phrase like okay google talk to personal
chef and the assistant will introduce
your app from this point onwards the
user is now talking to your app your app
generates dialogue output which is in
spoken to the user the user then makes
requests your app processes it and
replies back again so the user has a
two-way dialogue until the conversation
is finished so I'm going to show you a
quick demo of this app called personal
chef's so you may have seen this video
before but we're going to dive into it a
little deeper today but this afternoon
okay Google let me talk to a personal
chef
sure here's personal chef hi I'm your
personal chef what are you in the mood
for well it's kind of cold outside so
I'd like something to warm me up like
hot soup and I want it fast all right
what protein would you like to use I
have some chicken and also some canned
tomatoes okay well I think you should
try the chicken tomato soup recipe I
found on example.com sounds good to me
all right so that demo conversation was
actually quite complex Wayne said cold
warm and hot all in the same sentence
but the app managed to capture the
correct one so could you imagine trying
to write a regular expression or a
parser to try and extract meaning out of
this there are so many difficult cases
that it's basically impossible for
anything that's not trivial so let's see
the various ways we could build this
interaction one option is to use the
conversation API and the actions SDK so
your assistant app receives a request
containing the spoken text from the user
as a string Google handles the speech
recognition for you and then you pass
the strings generates a response and
Google handles speaking this back to the
user however as we just mentioned
passing natural language can be really
difficult
fortunately we provide tools that make
this kind of thing really easy dialogue
flow is one of these and it's a platform
that makes it incredibly straightforward
to build conversational experiences you
might not even have to write any code so
we're going to give you an overview of
it today and it's what most of you
should use for implementing your own
assistant app so what is dialogue flow
basically it provides an intuitive user
interface for creating conversational
experiences you program in a few example
sentences of things that a user might
speak and you can specify which values
you want to get from the user it then
uses machine learning to understand the
sentences and manage the conversation so
the key part here is the
you no longer need to process raw
strings dialogue flow does this for you
you can see here where dialogue flow
fits in it handles the conversation
invocation and fulfilment like in the
earlier diagram dialogue flow handles
the conversation for you so once the
user is talking to your assistant app
they then start off with something that
we call the user says phrase like find
me a recipe foe homemade cannoli the
Google assistant and dialogue flow then
process this find the appropriate intent
to handle this phrase the phrase is
processed to extract entities which are
important pieces of information that
you're looking for and it then calls
your webhook with these entities and the
action name and the web hook can then do
something with it and generate a
response that is spoken back to the user
so let's see a quick demo of what
dialogue flow can do
all right so in dialogue flow we create
an intent to represent each thing the
user might want to do in this case we've
built an intent that covers the user
asking for a recipe so here you can see
how we've provided examples of different
ways the user might express their desire
for a recipe these examples are used to
train a machine learning model that can
recognize what the user wants so as we
had examples dialog flow will
automatically pick out important
concepts that are mentioned by the user
the system understands many concepts by
itself but you can add custom domain
specific information like in this case
recipe ingredients so I'm going to add a
couple of examples here so how about do
you have any ideas for chicken salad or
I want a quick starter we can also mark
this information as required
so our app will automatically ask the
user if they didn't mention it so I'm
going to save here and we're going to
give it a try so if I ask here I want
something with beef we mentioned beef
but the agent also wants to know a
vegetable and a dish type so it's
automatically asking for them so let's
add these here potato and it asks what
kind of dish do you prefer so let's say
main course
alright so now we could be suggested a
recipe if the server looked this up on
the back end so it's amazing to be able
to conduct a conversation dynamically on
the fly without knowing ahead of time
what the user will say once the intense
has captured all of this information it
becomes available for you to use on your
back end where you can make stuff happen
and generate a response
and once we're done it's only a fluke
few clicks to integrate the app with a
load of different platforms we want to
integrate with actions on Google so you
can just click here and load up the
simulator to test it out
so this tool allows us to try out our
action so I can say talk to my tester
and now we're talking to our actions so
I can say let's try a recipe with
chicken oops and I misspelled it and
we'll have potato and we want a main
course so it's the same app now
available in the actions on Google
platform with just one click so this is
the workflow for building an action it's
super fast and simple so you should
definitely give it a try alright so
that's the end of my demo so let's talk
a little bit more about the platform
alright so we've heard about how apps
with the Google assistants are built but
how do we make sure we build apps that
users will love Google Offers a ton of
tools and features that will help you
create a magical experience for your
users the most important thing to think
about is the design of your app voice
user interface design is a huge topic
and we don't have time to cover it in
this presentation but fortunately
Google's developer website has a ton of
content available that can teach you how
to think like a designer and build
experiences that feel natural and fun to
use this would be the first place you go
when you're designing a new app let's
talk about some of the platform features
you can use to delight your users your
app can support simple audio output on
both the Google home or other smart
speakers or a mobile handset on a mobile
device you can also craft special
responses that make the most of your
devices screen at the most basic you can
specify on-screen display text that is
distinct from the spoken response to
guide the user in responding you can
provide suggestion ships these supply
suggested answers to a question that can
be chosen with a single tap and then
basic cards allow you to display
substantial on-screen information in the
form
of images texts and a hyperlink the text
there doesn't have to be spoken out loud
you can also use lists and carousels to
provide a visual selection mechanism for
users
a carousel shows images titles and
descriptions for a small number of
options and a list has capacity for
substantially more but the images are a
lot smaller
you can also affect the way your app's
speech sounds
you can play sound effects alter the
rate pitch and volume of speech and
control how words and numbers are read
aloud you can even lay a background
music and sounds and you do all of this
through SS ml you might also have a
conversation that needs to know the
user's name or location so here's one
example of finding a local bookstore and
you need to know the zip code you can
use our SDK to request permissions for
name course location and precise
location and when you invoke this
function the assistant will ask the user
for permission
using your apps voice if you'd like to
link a user with their account on your
own service and you have an OAuth server
the Google assistant can prompt users to
link their account at this point the
requesting user receives a card at the
top of their Google home app on their
phone that provides a link to the login
page once the user has completed the
account linking flow on your web
application they can invoke your action
and your action can then authenticate
calls to your services it's worth noting
that the OAuth point needs to be one
that you own rather than a third party
service if your experience involves
shopping or payments we support rich
transactions and allow you to accept
user payments the really cool part is
that customers can use whatever payment
information they have on file with
Google so payments can be super easy
there's no need to fumble around with a
credit card or read numbers out loud
transactions also supports a shopping
cart delivery options order summary and
payments and the user can see a history
of all of their transactions the Google
assistant also supports home automation
via our smart home integration device
makers can easily in
to create their existing devices with
our home graph the home graph knows the
state of all connected devices so when
you ask to dim the lights a little bit
it knows how to do that so the user can
make all kinds of requests like make it
warmer turn off all the lights how many
lights are on the possibilities are
endless here we plan on adding many
different device types very soon we've
also announced the Google assistant SDK
which enables you to embed the Google
assistant into your own custom hardware
projects and we've created the aiy
projects kit from Google which provides
a cardboard housing with a button a
speaker and a microphone to wrap around
a Raspberry Pi which uses the Google
assistant SDK and at Google i/o this
year we demoed a mocktails mixer from
our partner deep Local which embeds the
Google assistant SDK as well so you can
walk up to the device tell it the kind
of drink you want and it will mix it up
for you so you can really mix the Google
assistant into pretty much anything so
you've built a great app now what how do
you get it in front of users the basic
way to access your app is invoking it by
name so when you submit your app you can
provide a set of trigger phrases that
the assistant will recognize as a
request to speak to your app as
mentioned earlier you can also support
deep links so users can ask for your app
for a particular ask your app for a
particular thing in the long term users
will be able to find your app based on
its specific capabilities if they ask to
play a game the assistant will offer
them a few options from the assistant
apps available we also have a directory
where users can explore the apps that
are on offer users don't have to install
or pay for anything
all the apps are available just by
asking for them by name
finally you can hyperlink to your app
from just about anywhere so you can
share it in social media promote it
through your site or apps or encourage
press to drive traffic to your assist in
that if a user clicks the link they'll
be taken to a screen where they can read
about your app and try out so hopefully
you're feeling excited about building
your first app for the Google assistant
but how do you get started
your first port of call should be the
Google Earth Google developers page for
actions on Google you'll find guides to
getting started with building your first
app with templates you can actually
build an app without writing any code so
you just fill out a spreadsheet with
questions and answers and you can create
your own trivia personality quiz or
flashcards game and on our code lab site
we provide a variety of tutorials that
will guide you through creating your
first app for the Google assistant using
dialogue flow we're also offering some
incentives through our developer
community program so when you create and
deploy your first app for the Google
assistant will thank you with a free
t-shirt plus $200 of Google cloud
credits every month for a year if you'd
like to dive deeper into the platform
there's a talk tomorrow on new features
and advanced topics so it'll show you
how to do things like layering audio and
sending push notifications to your users
I definitely recommend checking it out
and finally when you want to discuss
this with other developers we have the
actions on Google developer community on
Google+ we post regularly there to keep
you up to date with the latest news and
we answer questions from developers we
also have a great community on Stack
Overflow so if you have technical
questions definitely post them there and
we're active on Twitter too so our team
is going to be hanging out in the
sandbox area and we'd love for you to
stop by and chat with us about building
for the Google system and you should
definitely attend the talk tomorrow
which is called what's new with the
Google assistant so thank you for coming
and enjoy your time at GDD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
