is Wesley and I'm gonna show you a few
things you can do with the Google sheets
API I have the word new in the title and
even though we launched it at Google i/o
in 2016 it's still relatively new so
this is a great time to give it a look
if you're going to be developing
applications that use spreadsheets okay
a little bit by myself my main job is to
enable all of you to be successful using
our developer tools and api's some of
you may know that I host the G suite dev
show on YouTube and I'm also a frequent
contributor to our G suite developers
blog as well as on our Twitter a little
background about me I'm a software
engineer
I've been coding for many many years the
most well-known thing you probably
remember or you that you know about is
yahoo mail so I was one of the original
ten engineers that built that 20 years
ago and I've been doing Python ever
since and I'm very active in the Python
community but again my job here is to
make you guys successful using Google
developer tools and api's if you want to
watch some of the videos there's a link
right there in fact and we're gonna go
over some examples and each of the
examples has a video for each specific
use case so you can review those just in
case everything just flies through
because this is just a 30-minute session
then you can always watch the video to
kind of go back and take a deeper dive
in the code okay so what we're gonna do
is I'm gonna give you a little bit of
introduction to the sheets API version
four I'm gonna talk about what was in
the previous versions so you can get an
idea of like how it's changed since then
and then give you some sort of like use
cases as to why you would use the sheets
API and then we'll look at three very
different examples of using the API just
to show you kind of like the variety of
things that you can do with the sheets
API okay all right so a version four so
before we kind of like look at the
newest version let's take a little step
back before getting started so we know
that spreadsheets have been a computing
killer app for many many years for
decades right and it goes well beyond
the business world and for nearly as
long they've been programmable even you
know
Excel is programmable in VB right and so
you know it's no surprise that this was
one of Google's very first API it's like
ever alright and you can actually see if
you look at the if you can see the date
really carefully you can see that the
very first version of the Google sheets
API came out exactly
well almost exactly as a two days ago
exactly 11 years ago all right so that's
how old this API is ok and since then
we've obviously made a lot of
improvements to it and so I'm happy to
share those things with you guys today
all right so Version three what can you
do with this API so you can create new
sheets from existing spreadsheets you
can write new rows of data and of course
you can read data all right but
unfortunately that's all you could do
alright so though it's it's it's
restrictive in that way and so now with
v4 you know it's it seems that with just
the features that we saw in v3 it seems
kind of an incomplete API right because
we know that spreadsheets can do a lot
more than that and so I'm happy to share
with you some of the things that you
will find in v4 and you can actually
take a look at the blog post for when we
launched it from 2016 just to kind of
get an idea of how the product manager
describes the vision of the API and you
know why we made this improvements ok
but let's go over some of the the new
features that will find in the new
version ok so think of what you can do
if you were sitting at your desk in
front of Google sheets all the things
that you can do using your mouse and
your computer and your screen write an
API should allow you to do those things
too because you should be able to write
an application to the do the same things
that you can do while you're sitting in
front of the machine and that's really
the power of v4 so let's take a look we
know that v3 can do those things so
let's kind of like look what else you
can do now with version 4 you can create
brand-new spreadsheets you can set
frozen rows you can add cell formatting
you can adjust column sizes you can put
in formulas you can build pivot tables
you can create charts right all those
things that you guys know that you can
do from using the user interface right
now you can do that with your own
application so that's the really
exciting about thing
about v4 and by the way it still keeps
things simple for developers okay so
when you interact with the sheets API
you're going to use one of these three
method collections alright and from
which each of these collections the
first one is just manipulating
spreadsheets as a whole in general the
second group is for individual sheets
mostly just copying them and then the
third one is related to values okay the
ones that are in bold are typically the
ones are going to use all right if
you're going to be using the API because
you're going to either do a lot of
changes to an existing spreadsheet or
like for example formatting or you're
going to upload or change a lot of data
that's in the spreadsheet so that's why
the ones in bold or typically the
methods that you're going to be using
the most all right so what are some
reasons why you would consider using the
sheets API if you've never done so
before okay one of the main reasons is
you could have a lot of important data
inside a database but that's not really
visually appealing that's not something
that you may want to show your managers
because it doesn't really tell them
anything it's just a bunch of text that
they're looking at right it's not as
useful but what you can do is you can
take this data out of the database using
the API and now when you put it in a
spreadsheet all of a sudden you can
create charts and you know you can have
other types of visualizations and also
you know when you have a spreadsheet you
have a user interface that people can
actually go and manipulate the data with
right like you can create pivot tables
or you can somehow you know manipulate
in format the data and the spreadsheet
so it's more useful than just static
data that soon sits in a spreadsheet or
it sits in a database okay so that's one
use case of the sheets API another one
is well maybe you know you you have
information that is updated in the
database very often but you also want
that reflected in the spreadsheet that
you have that sort of matches the data
that's in the in the database right so
you can use the API to kind of like
refresh and update the spreadsheet
similarly if for example you're taking
data into the spreadsheet like maybe
from a Google Form or something like
that maybe you want to take that data
and update the database right so this is
a two-way communication so in this sense
you're kind of you
the spreadsheet sort of like a database
but it's more using it sort of as an end
to create like visualizations for you to
build look at that data and basically
take input for example again like I said
from from Google Forms so that's like
another use case that you would have a
category for why you would use a sheets
API okay so with that in mind let's take
a look at three different ways that we
can use the sheets API and I'm gonna
show you some code it's gonna be you
know it's in Python so you can kind of
consider that pseudocode if you don't do
Python right so the first case is bulk
loading values from a database so we're
going to look at a sequel database in
particular and let me kind of describe
it so for those of you who are new to
the sheets API you want to learn it
really well we have a nice code lab
where you build a nodejs app which is a
customized reporting tool based on you
know if you were a toy manufacturer and
your your customers are placing orders
for toys so that's the app that you're
going to build if you use the code lab
it's available to you at that short link
there but what we're gonna do is we're
going to reuse that database so for
example pretend you created this you
know you've done the code lab you
created the toy database and now you
want to move that information into a
spreadsheet ok so here's just a quick
schema to show you that I have this
database in a sequel Lite database
running on my machine and you can see it
has information like the customer name
the products how many toys they ordered
what the price was and things like that
so the sample data is pretty small I
think there's only five or six rows as
you can see here I'm just using the SQL
Lite interviews err interface to just
bring up this data so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to write some Python
code to import all this data and then
put it into the spreadsheet alright so
what does the source code look like if
you guys came to my code lab earlier
then you're familiar with all the
authorization that happens so that code
is like one through fifteen so you can't
see them here alright but assuming that
all the authorization goes through this
is the actual code that does exactly
what we said it was going to do which
is on lines 18 to 21
that creates a brand new spreadsheet
with toy orders from lines 23 to 28
that's where we read all of the data out
of the SQL database and then from lines
you know 30 to 36 is the rest of it
where what we're doing is we're taking
the data we're creating you know once
we've got the rows we're going to just
update this so if you look at like lines
31 and 32 what we're doing here is we're
saying start putting all the data
starting at the upper left-hand corner
which is cell a1 so you see that on line
32 and the data is all the rows that we
read from the database and in this
particular case I choose the value input
option of raw because I just want to
upload the data now you have another
option which is called user user entered
and what that means is it pretends that
you're sitting in front of the computer
on your spreadsheet and typing it in so
if your spreadsheet is formatted then
when you type in the numbers they're
going to be formatted to whatever
formatting exists in the database so you
have a couple of options here in this
particular case since I just want to
upload the data straight into the
database I'm just gonna use raw okay and
so that's why I use the spreadsheets dot
values that update call on line 31 that
was one of that was in the values
collection remember we looked at that
earlier okay and then just to prove that
the data got written the last couple of
lines 34 to 36 just reads those values
out of the database and just prints it
on the screen for the user to confirm
that the data from the database has been
sent to sent to the spreadsheet okay
pretty basic example I'd say you know
this is roughly about 18 lines of code
it's not too much but it does something
useful and something that you may have
to do for work but you know it's just an
example to help kind of get you started
all right I there is a video behind it
so if you want to actually watch this
thing as a video I think this is the
very first one for the API so so yeah so
it's the very first video that
introduces like one of the things that
you can do with it and since then I
think I've made a couple of other videos
after that okay so now let's move on to
the next subject which is in the past
you could not format
spreadsheet cells and to me I it's like
frustrating like why I have a
spreadsheet and I have data in it I want
to make it look pretty and I don't want
have to do it manually by hand every
time I want to write code for it so it
was disappointing for me to find out
that we weren't able to do this in the
previous versions of the API so I was
quite happy that this is one of the
things that we could do so we can do now
in v4 and I was very happy to like go
onto Stack Overflow and change all that
you know add new answers like can you
format cells with the Google sheets API
and the answer used to be no but I'm
very happy to say that we can do that
now okay so let's take a look at this
sheet now this is the same toy or deceit
the same data that we just uploaded okay
so these are all tied together right
doesn't look really boring
there's no formatting at all okay so
what can you do with it you can add all
the formatting so now hopefully it works
okay so now things look a little bit
better all right so we did a couple of
things like we froze the top row we
bolded the top row we formatted the
prices in column E so that their
financial value so if you go back and
look you see how it's kind of plain like
that and also like the 12.5 that doesn't
mean anything right so once we format it
you can see that it's now 1250 so it
actually looks like a financial amount
okay and then in the column F we made
fixed values and cell validations so
that at half the status has to be one of
these three options it's either pending
shipped or delivered all right so those
are the things that we were able to do
using the API so now let's start taking
a look at how you would code this okay
so obviously I should have been pressing
this all right so all these things you
could do alright so now let's look at
the code so how do you send commands to
the API the way you do that is first of
all you need to have the ID of a
spreadsheet so that's that's pretty easy
to do either you have an existing one or
you can go to using the Google Drive API
and do a query and search for the exact
father you're looking for and so what
happens is you're going to have a
JavaScript array of requests and these
requests can be individual commands that
could be the same command that could be
different commands it doesn't really
matter so you put all of your commands
inside this request array
all right in this example I just have
like updating of the properties of a
spreadsheet repeat this operation over
multiple cells set cell validation sort
this range add to chart lots of
different things there are many
different commands and once you have all
of the requests that you want to send to
the API you're gonna call spreadsheets
dot batch update because that is the
spreadsheets command or the method
collection for spreadsheets it's what
you're gonna use to make these
operations happen and remember how I had
a couple of the methods that are bolded
well batch update is definitely one of
them okay because what happens is you're
gonna have a whole bunch of commands and
you want to send them all to the API at
the same time now one of the reasons why
they chose this design is because you
know Google API are free generally right
and so what happens is that in order to
control resource usage we have certain
quota as to like how many things that
you can do and if you keep on calling
the API all the time just for like one
request API call another request another
API call then you're gonna slowly but
surely run out of run out of calls that
you can make to the API so the advantage
of putting all of your commands inside
this request array is that you only make
one call to the API and that way it'll
helps you minimize the number of calls
that you make overall and basically it
gives you the sense that you have more
quota than you really do okay so this is
generally the structure and if you end
up using the Google slides API it works
in the same way it also has a batch
update okay so these are two of the
newest api's that we have and this is
sort of like the the model that we're
going after now just to help you guys
extend your usage okay
so how do you freeze a robe so that's
the first thing that we're doing that is
a considered a sheet property so the
verb that you need to use is update
sheets property but what are you trying
to update all right you're trying to
update the frozen row count which is
part of grid properties which is part of
the overall properties all right and you
want to set that to one so that's the
same thing as if you went into the
spreadsheet UI and you drag down you
know the little thing on the left hand
side the slider so that the first row
stays the same when you scroll up the
first row still stays on the screen okay
so that's the frozen row and
Fields just confirms that the frozen row
count is the field that you want to
update now you may be thinking this is
repetitious you know why am I saying the
frozen row count wants to be you know
I'm gonna change the frozen road count
up there in grid properties but then I
have to say it again in fields all right
so I've made a separate video for to
describe why this is the case and the
reason is because with fields you can
reset other fields not just the frozen
row count generally when you make a
change there's a one-to-one matching
here all right but there's certain
things you may want to do to reset
something so the for example if you want
to change it so it's not bold or
something like that you would have a a
not bold property set but in your field
you would leave it blank all right so
anyway the main idea is fields controls
what the thing actually gets changed
okay so you can actually reset other
values to alright like I said I've made
a video on this just because it's
confusing so I have two separate two
separate videos on on just field masks
that's what these are just because my
goal again is to make you guys
successful and if there's something
confusing I got to make sure that you
guys are not confused so that's that's
part of my job duty alright now let's
talk about cell ranges first okay so a
cell range is made up of a sheet ID and
a bunch of indices that describes the
area of the spreadsheet that you want to
change okay so when you create a brand
new spreadsheet you get one sheet right
the empty one that one has a sheet ID
defaults to zero all right and so like
most programming languages when you're
looking at rows and columns this
counting starts at zero okay so even
though in the user interface
you've got Row one through six the index
numbers are actually zero through five
and the same thing goes for the column
numbers okay so keep that in mind also
ranges are exclusive of all end indexes
okay so that means they go up to but do
not include the end index value all
right and then we're look at look at
that in the next couple of slides and
then lastly if an index is zero you can
just leave it out all right so again
I'll show you that too okay all right so
again sheet ID and indices
the first sheet that's created as the
default idea of zero indexed starts
counting at zero
everything's exclusive and then you can
skip it depending on the scenario mostly
if it's a zero then you can skip it okay
all right quick quiz so what I want you
guys to do is look at the the four cells
that I have highlighted and what you're
gonna do is you're gonna help me fill in
this the grid range all right you guys
remember what the sheet ID is by default
it's zero good all right now the start
column index what is the starting column
index here okay 0 1 2 3 right 3 &amp;amp; 4 but
not 5 so we can't put 4 because it's
exclusive at the end index so that
should be 5 and then with row it's 0 1 2
up to 4 right 2 &amp;amp; 3 but not four okay so
there we go
and because like I said if the if it's 0
you can leave it out so that's why it's
kind of grayed out so you don't have to
put the sheet ID there but that's only
the first default sheet that's created
for you if you add more sheets or
somehow delete the first sheet all the
other sheet IDs are not 0 so you're
gonna have to put those in there ok so
just be aware of that but once you guys
know that it's 3 5 2 4 alright then you
know how to manipulate an entire range
okay so that's that's good now let's
let's use that knowledge and bold the
first row ok it's not considered as a
sheet property so we can't do the same
thing that we did with frozen rows we
actually have to specify to bold
individual columns okay an individual
cells so the command in this case is
repeat cell okay I have the sheet ID of
zero there but you can leave that out
the starting row index is zero but I
could leave that out okay the end row
index is one because I'm only gonna bold
the first row okay and then for the
column index I'm gonna start at zero
because I want to start at the very left
but zero is the default so I can leave
that index out however they in column
index I have to have because I want to
end a column five which means I need to
make the end column index sick
because it's exclusive of the final I'm
a final value right okay so that's the
first part and then the next part is
well what do we do with this sell so
remember the commander's repeat sell so
now we have the range of cells what is
the command that we're gonna do what do
we want to do to each individual cell
we're gonna go into the user entered
format that text format dot bold field
and we're gonna turn it on to true okay
and again we also have the equivalent
fields mask to say that's the only thing
I want to change leave everything else
alone don't reset anything okay so
that's it that's that's all you need to
actually make the row bold okay and so
if you wanted to see sort of an action
in Python it looks like this so we've
got the update sheets property it's the
same thing that we saw earlier we've got
the repeat sale to bold it that's the
same thing and you take those things you
throw it into the request array and then
you make one call the batch update and
then it's done you can actually see it
if you run this from the command line
you can act and look at your spreadsheet
you can actually watch it change in real
time so it's pretty pretty exciting okay
so that's a couple of things that you
can do what about the currency
formatting part like you know if I'm
using US dollars or even rupees or
whatever it doesn't really matter what I
want to do is in this case my grid range
is this is is gonna be different because
now I'm looking at column D alright so
all the numbers should be exactly what
they are in your mind if you remember
the spreadsheet okay and this time
instead of changing the the text format
bold flag we're going to change the
number format and set it to a specific
pattern and say that is a currency type
and then again with fields I confirmed
that the thing that the only thing I
want change is the number format and
it'll make those changes for you okay
everybody good so far
all right great and then the last part
is the sell validation I only want to
have these possible fields of pending
shipped and delivered for the status ok
so again I have to give another grid
range which is for column F this time
alright and then the the rule is that
okay notice the command this time is
called set data validation alright so
this is yet another command alright and
it does exactly what
you know what we want which is I only
want to let the user choose one of these
three values all right I'm gonna set my
values to strict which means they cannot
choose anything else other than these
three they cannot type something else
and otherwise they get an error from the
UI okay and then show custom UI just
means that I have a little menu thingy
so that they can pull down and select
the value that they want okay so that's
cell validation and so for example like
I said if somebody tries to enter an
invalid value they're gonna get an error
from the user interface okay it's pretty
basic and again I have a video on this
one if you want to learn specifically
focus on formatting cells which is
something I found that was very exciting
to me okay
yep also the other thing is that it will
also tell you it will give you a flag
even if you have the strict turned off
it will actually tell you this thing
violates the rule but I'm going to allow
it so either it's going to allow or not
allow it and you can choose which one
you want depending on how strict that
you want it to be okay all right so that
was column e column F and the rest of
the formatting so after you watch the
video and you take oaths study of the
code sample I challenge you to upgrade
it okay there's another column for total
cost all right so what I want you guys
to do is take this and modify that one
and make change it to the formula right
so you can copy the financial value
formatting column E but I want you to
take what is column D and column E and
calculate the value in column G all
right so that's the challenge I leave
for you at the end of the video okay
just in your head you can kind of like
think how you do it you just have to
research how do I enter a formula
instead of you know data into a
spreadsheet and you can look it up in
the documentation and be very easy to do
so that's my challenge to you okay
that's so that's one thing that you can
do with a spreadsheet now what's another
thing that you can do this is the last
thing that we're going to look at which
is generating presentations from
spreadsheet data why would you do this
you would do this because similarly to
why you would use the Shi
- API remember how I said you have out
all this data in a database but it
doesn't really look good it doesn't look
presentable to a manager but maybe if
it's in a spreadsheet and you have a
chart and stuff like that that makes it
easier for your managers to see you know
the data and and the value right because
you can have a lot of data but not a lot
of information and so using the
spreadsheet you can actually turn that
data into information furthermore maybe
you want to do something more than this
you maybe you want to create a slide
deck to present to your management right
so instead of just showing a spreadsheet
on the screen maybe you want to create a
slide deck and in this particular use
case I want to you know I have a
spreadsheet that has Toei order
information I created a pie chart but I
want to take this information I want to
build Google slides out of it okay so
that's what we're gonna do so this is
sort of like demoing the power of using
two Google API s at the same time okay
so here's my tour tour database again
and I ran the pre the previous example
where I've formatted everything I've got
the cell validation I've got the
financial currency formatting and I got
the frozen row I got the bold row and
then I went and created a chart you can
do this from the API but you can also do
it from the UI or you can use the
Explorer button if you guys have seen
that okay so we have this information we
want to create slides out of it okay
here's the one of the slides I want I
want to see a table in a slide that has
the same information as my toy orders
that I have there okay and secondly I
want to take that chart and I want to
make it its own slide so how did we do
that okay I'm not gonna show you the
whole code because it's a little bit
larger now but I'm gonna focus on sort
of like the major sections okay so the
major section is lines 20 to 28 we'll go
and fetch those values out of that out
of the spreadsheet okay and then the
second so that's 20 to 23 and then 25 to
28 I want to go and find that chart and
I want to get that chart ID because I
need that information to build a slide
presentation out of and the best part is
when I make a slide out of it if later
on I change the data in the database and
that chart changes there's a little
Update button in your slide presentation
when you press it'll refresh to the new
data and a new chart
alright so it's pretty exciting so you
can do that in the user interface or you
can actually use it through the through
the slides API you can request an update
of the data so either way is fine okay
so now the hard part is on the right
hand side so we're gonna create this
table we're gonna create slide so all
the stuff that's highlighted out or that
I grayed out it's like creating filling
in the the title slide and I'm gonna
create a blank slide I'm gonna add a
table so you can kind of see that I'm
adding a table but the most important
part is actually filling in the table so
I have like a double for loop down here
that'll loop through every column of
every row that I read out of the
spreadsheet from 20 to 23 and it writes
it into the table that's on my slide and
then similarly on line 76 to 91 92 I'm
gonna create a brand new chart give it
the chart ID and I have to give all this
information about what size I want on
the slide and everything but the main
idea is as long as it has a chart ID it
will make that slide for me okay and so
as a result what do we have oh by the
way there's a video for that too alright
so you can see this but anyway so in the
very end you will actually have these
two slides that is what that code
creates okay so that's it as far as the
demos that I want to show you guys okay
so let's kind of wrap up now so we know
that spreadsheets are a business
critical tool and even in the day you
know in today's world where we have so
much big data you can still use
spreadsheets right I can't imagine a
world without spreadsheets right now
it's a very flexible tool it's it's kind
of like having an application that does
numeric and and text manipulation on
your behalf it's an app that's already
been created and you can leverage it
okay so yeah so anyway so we now have a
brand new API it makes it more powerful
than previous versions which were
limited in in terms of what you can do
with it it's very flexible and you can
actually make it you know may power your
apps with it all right so this animation
just shows that
a spreadsheet is an organizer of data
it's sometimes it's used as a database
other times it helps you analyze because
you're creating charts and
visualizations right so it's just
basically like a Swiss Army knife in my
opinion and I think given the ability
for you to program it makes it even more
powerful than before ok so that's it I
hope to see you maybe later this week
maybe tomorrow if you're a Python user
I'm gonna give a talk of the Bangalore
Python users group and if you want to
join me the day after I'll be in
Singapore talking about Google Apps
Script all right but anyway thank you
guys for coming and I hope you enjoyed
the talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
