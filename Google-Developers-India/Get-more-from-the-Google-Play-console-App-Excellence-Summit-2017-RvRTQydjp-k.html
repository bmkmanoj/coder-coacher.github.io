Play console team will be sharing about
the new and existing tools to help you
understand your technique group
performances thank you so much I'm Olga
I'm a program manager in Google Play
hi and I'm Johannes user experience
designer also working on Google Play
great so we're super exciting to be here
great to see so many faces
hello everybody to the overflow room
Islam so today we're going to take some
time to see how the play console can
actually help you create amazing apps
that can really engage your users and
allow you to achieve a great user
experience and retention so in order to
do that we'll reveal ten secrets for you
to optimize your apps for estella user
retention all right so to do that we
first going to take a look at a
performance and that would be something
that also Dario and Jorge will tackle
right after this talk so there will be
more information rounded and we will
explain why it matters and why it
matters to you and your users we'll also
take a look at how you can achieve
better performance throughout the entire
lifecycle of yeah so we start with
before you launch while you're going
live and then once your life how to
understand the data that you get and how
to iterate upon the next version and
finally we will take a look at rewards
and look at how play is going to reward
you for focusing on excellence and
technical quality right so by focusing
on performance in the first place why is
technically quality is important and the
reason is quite simple there are over a
million apps out there if you look at
the whole ecosystem and some people say
there's an app for everything but the
truth is there isn't a great performing
it for everything and that can become a
great differentiator for you so if you
look at it Jesus
for an apps they install it and they
will stick to the one with the highest
quality the one that doesn't crash that
doesn't stutter that doesn't eat up all
your battery and that's precisely the
reason why bidding high-performing apps
is so critical for user retention so for
you as app developer app performance and
technical quality can become a big
differentiator against other apps that
may be offered similar some challenges
and we asked a couple of developers to
see what they actually achieved after
focusing on a performance and excellence
and we got this great quote from buzu
and buddhism is a fantastic language
learning the app with over 65 million
active users worldwide and they really
made a big investment in performance
quality and because they made it such an
integral part of their culture they
managed to bump up their average rating
from four point one to four point five
which is quite impressive on that scale
right so this was a brief overview about
technical performance I will now hand
over to Oregon and she will talk you
through how you can use the Play console
to optimize for performance thank you so
much you're famous
so before lunch I'm going to start with
pre-launch report provide support is
essentially a summary of issues that we
found with an app while testing on a
range of physical Android devices
the lignes / lines report at Google i/o
2016 so it's been live for slightly over
a year and we feel that it has been
helping multiple developers thousands of
developers make better apps
since you launched it behind the scenes
prevent report is powered by a firebase
test lab firebase test lab is our
real-world data center full of Android
devices which you can test your app
phone
provide support runs automatically if
you want to run your own custom tests
you can do that by integrating through
the Android studio or integrating with
fire
as part of your continuous build the
main purpose of reliance report is
measuring a stability of a given build
prevent report is the report of a robot
crawler testing your app over a certain
period of time on certain number of
Android devices as you can see here the
robot in this particular case has found
some crashes if you would click to
prevent report in your way developer
console you would see the stack trace
and you would be guilty the which
devices the crashes has been found on
and you would be able to process crash
and fix it and because prevent report
runs on all alpha and better apps
uploaded to your play console you can
find it under release management those
are the critical data insights that you
get before you push up to production and
because you can fix the crashes before
your app goes to production you users
once experienced the crash and won't
leave a one-star review earlier today
for my colleague Fergus has shown this
slide with some really impressive
numbers of the momentum that the
prevention Ford had seen since you
launched it in a year and a half ago but
there is a different number that I
wanted to share with you the number that
to me is even more impressive than these
numbers in 85% of cases when pre- report
has found a crash the deal was not
pushed to production which means that
the users had been spared a crash and
the reviews for the built it has been
pushed to production for not run stars
to me this is super impressive I hope
it's impressive to you as well
all right so we are constantly expanding
our real-world data centers of Android
devices firebase space lab those are the
devices that Leisha
and it's recently specifically I would
like to highlight something on the slide
which is a pixel which is running
Android or preview so if you use prevent
report you can see how your app performs
on Android all on a pixel and do ready
for Android or women launches later this
year so this was the first secret that I
wanted to share with you provide support
with Android oh let me move on to the
next success I would like to share with
you in addition to constantly beefing up
the size of our firebase lab data center
were also working on enhancing the
functionality of the prevent report when
we first launched it a Google i/o 2016
the immediately heard from developers
that they really wanted prevent report
to be able to bypass the login screen
because initially our robot was not able
to bypass the login screen
which meant that for certain number of
apps and for certain number of
developers provide support was not
really useful so if except just very
recently we have built the feature that
lets you submit test credentials so if
your app uses a login screen now you can
use prevent report and benefit from
client report finding any potential
crashes in Europe before it's it's
pushed to production
the next feature Fergus touched on it
earlier is new improved intelligent
screenshot clustering so we have put a
lot of work into clustering the
screenshots and videos that the robot
file went rolling your app in a way that
lets you see inconsistencies in the look
of your app at a glance and we support
multiple languages including changing
and finally
I'd like to tell you a little bit about
the feature of the pre-launch report
which is surfacing security
notifications to you about potential
privacy leaks and security
vulnerabilities over a year-and-a-half
since the line to prevent herb
since we are launched Brillouin report
we have added the detection
functionality for over 30 of emeritus
and potential privacy leaks obviously we
know that nobody wants to knowingly
introduce a vulnerability into the app
but if you are using a third-party
library that you don't really have
control over this can be a very good
security net as one of the developers
that is using prevents report have told
us it's good to have this sense of
security this knowledge of the Google
security team working for you so that
was the second secret that I wanted to
share with you guys new functionality in
the violence report with the key screens
and login support okay so let's say you
have run prevent report and you build
looks perfect it's ready for production
now you need to make a very very
important decision now you need to
decide which devices you're going to be
targeting when going live in the past
finding out which devices to target and
actually targeting those devices in Play
Developer console was a little bit of
work let's put it this way so and
visualize for many developers that
existing device catalog was not very
easy to use so we changed that we went
from a list of devices with checkbox to
a fully interactive very rich device
catalog that gives you a full device
back and we also group a similar similar
excuse that belong together under
under their the same entry but the
functionality of the new device catalog
that I like the best is search you can
search by a particular own you can
search by a particular device spec like
for example you can search for only
devices that have more than four gigs of
ram and when searching for devices that
only have a particular capability about
them that you're interested in you would
not only see the grouping of devices you
would also see all the critical metrics
of this particular group of devices you
would see how many crashes this group of
devices has contributed to so far you
would see what's revenue this group of
devices has contributed to so far you
would see ratings and reviews and more
importantly installs you can save your
search and more importantly you could
target you can target your search and
you not only allowing you to target your
search search as in particular group of
devices which you're interested in we're
also allowing you to sorry to apply
exclusion rules like for example if you
want to develop in a game and you're
only interested in devices that have
enough RAM to support your game
flawlessly you can apply an exclusion
rule to a group of devices that does not
have enough RAM to support your game and
not only can you do that because you
would see exactly what metrics the group
of devices that you are excluding is
contributing you would be able to make
this decision intelligently I'm going to
give you another example of when
exclusion rules are really great let's
say you have hard launch date you're
doing some last-minute tweaks and when
you run a pre- report on your alpha or
beta you have found a crash on the
particular type of devices but you have
to learn try so you can apply
an exclusion rule to a particular to the
devices that are currently crashing
launched 60 crash push to production
again without the exclusion rule applied
so in addition to developing this really
great I think a great new device catalog
these have also redesigned we have
integrated the new device catalog into
all aspects of the developer console so
you don't necessarily need to just like
look for it you can go to the device
catalog from pretty much any page from
reviews crashes prevent report and steps
so that was the third secret that I
wanted to share with you a very very
powerful interactive which device
catalog moving on let's say you have
lunched before it has been a little bit
tedious to wait for the updates of test
statistics on the Play Developer console
to see how your app is performing
following the launch our stats were
updating every 24 hours sometimes they
were updating slightly slower than that
and be sure it from multiple developers
that this particular aspect of working
with Play Developer console was not a
favor
so we changed that we have built a whole
new release dashboard which updates real
time they do have crashes ratings and
reviews from the release dashboard that
are coming in real time and we have
stats that are come in with a very very
slight delay it's around two hours which
is better than one thing 24 hours so by
using the release dashboard you can see
if things are going well within your
release and if for some reason there is
something that you need to trick you
would be able to see it very very fast
and do any fixes if you feel like you
need to do a fix
very fast
and hopefully not get in you and star
reviews I'm sure you're not going to
so that was their secret number for real
time powerful really that worked with
all the information which you need to
keep an eye on when religion in you bill
to production so now you have gone to
production you have released what do you
do now rest naturally the thing that a
lot of developers that we interact with
do once you release the production is
they try to look into what it is that
the users are telling them through their
views about their app and find things
that they can improve to make their apps
even better in 2016 at Google you in
2016 we have introduced what we call
reviews analysis which is a machine
learning from Google put to work to
analyze the reviews that she users are
giving you let's say if you are a
language learning app you would see
topics found by the machine learning
bubbling up topics such as the how well
your app works of life or whether users
are happy with the language offerings or
the the quality of the conversation we
have the functionality in English for a
year and then at i/o in May 2017 we
added two more languages we added
Spanish which is the second most widely
used previous language in Google Play
and they added Japanese which is a very
important language in this particular
market I'm going to tell you something
a secret that nobody knows outside my
immediate team but I want to share it
with you I want to tell you that this
coaches are working on adding two more
languages to reviews analysis and I
would like to invite you to guess which
which is reading does anybody have a
guess yes we reading gdm Korean and I'm
very happy and proud to be working with
the team in machine learning to make
this languages lunch in Play Developer
console and so that you can make use of
Google's machine learning next I want to
tell you a little bit about interacting
with users through reply to review
functionality in Google Play console
because for many developers that the
flow of the conversation that we have
offered it was not ideal because when
the user would update the review that
take abroad initially you as a developer
would lose this review and you wouldn't
know what it is that they were talking
about in the beginning of the
conversation so we have added full
review history so now you can have a
seamless conversation with your users if
you want to have a conversation with
them we actually do encourage you to
have your air conversations with your
users we do feel like investing in
interacting with the users is a good bet
and it's going to pay off for you and
now you can see exactly how much it does
pay off we have analyzed your views
corpus and we have added a chart which
we call rating uplift which shows you
exactly how much your ATM has changed
for the better
through interactions with users and
finally I want to tell you about a new
feature that we have just recently
rolled out to 100% of developers which
allows you to tell Google if you get a
view which is spam it was a distraction
intelligible available in consumer
facing Google Play Store but you didn't
have it in the console and
very happy to tell you that now if you
see a review which has made it through
our automatic spam filters and you see
it in your console console you can
report it and it's going to be reviewed
and removed from your console if it
doesn't match our posting policy so that
was the kief secrets that I wanted to
share with you
powerful reviews management and analysis
tools that we offer in your play console
and now back to your highness its logo
alright and so that is a slide you might
have seen earlier in the presentation
from Fergus he announced that already
and we are super excited about that but
just to recap earlier in the talk we we
said that at performance technical
quality app excellence is major a major
factor for a user retention and that's
exactly the reason why we're introducing
now the Android budget and that is an
initiative by Google to improve the
stability and performance of Android
devices and without further ado I will
show a video that we show exactly how
Android budgets work your apps
performance is crucial to your users
happiness and your app success an
internal study of reviews on Google Play
found that half of one star reviews
mentioned stability or crashes by
identifying in fixing issues and bad
behaviors you could see happier users
and better ratings which will also
improve your apps discoverability
introducing android vitals android
vitals in the play console gives you new
data so you can understand your apps
stability battery usage and render time
on real devices stability Android vitals
include two bad behaviors relating to
stability application not responding
errors or ANR's and crashes a and RS
occur when the application freezes and
stops responding to user input for more
than five seconds this is usually caused
by dead box
slowness in UI threads or background
processes when your app crashes it can
be a frustrating experience for the user
impacting retention and leading to bad
reviews the crash rate will show you the
percentage of users experiencing crashes
in your app one way to address stability
issues is to run pre-launch reports
which will test your alpha or beta app
on physical devices so you can identify
and fix issues before you launch battery
well-behaved apps don't consume battery
by keeping the device radio and CPU on
unnecessarily android vitals lets you
see the metrics for two common causes of
battery drain wake up's and wake locks
wake ups are caused by alarms performing
time-based operations that prevent an
idle device from sleeping wake locks are
when the app has your device working so
hard it won't allow it to sleep for
better battery life you can use job
scheduling api's to schedule
asynchronous tasks and specify
conditions to maximize efficiency this
is suitable for small tasks like
clearing a cache and for large ones like
syncing a database to the cloud render
time the speed at which your app renders
impacts use a perception of your app
performance slow render time or frozen
frames lead to bad reviews apps that
have a render time of 16 milliseconds or
reach 60 frames per second produce a
silky smooth experience for your users
this is the rate at which users can
perceive smooth motion within your app
there for android vitals lets you see
what percentage of users experienced
more than 50% of frames with a render
time of greater than 16 milliseconds so
you can provide a smooth experience
across all devices anything greater than
a render time of 700 milliseconds it's
considered a frozen frame and at this
rate users consider an app to be
unresponsive avoid slow render times or
frozen frames by using frame metrics
api's to measure per interaction frame
render times for devices during
production find out about other features
in the play console
and get tips to grow your app or game
business with the PlayBook app available
on Google Play so lots of exciting stuff
there also a lot of information dari and
George we talked about the and abideth
in more detail right after this talk so
there would be more information in or
more detailed information and to quickly
recap so the Android budget reports on
three major performance areas which is
will give you a deeper insights into
your usability of your help that means
you will learn more about NRS and
crashes and as well as how many users
are actually impacted by those the
second performance area is rendering and
you will be able to see and compare how
you perform or how your current app is
performing against previous apps apk
sorry and also how you perform across
multiple Android versions and also
compared across different devices and
then last but not least we do report on
the weight loss and the wake up in your
app which have a direct impact on the
users battery alright and the last
secret that we will talk about our
rewards and also how their your vitals
will impact with what and help you get
well better visibility in store so we
know today that by focusing on on
performance and technical quality you
will create a more delightful user
experience which will then lead to a
stronger user engagement and effort as a
better user retention so all this
related data in your app is defined as
the app quality which has a direct
impact on the presence and performance
in the store if we look at portability
of such loads for example that play
takes in various user signals to
determine
the apps promote ability for example if
in the app often crashes it may lead to
a negative reviews which may lead to a
lower average rating and a higher
uninstall rate and all this information
can have a negative impact on the
promote ability of your app so with
advisors you can now detect those issues
early you can see if crashes and see how
many are impacted fix it by the way and
that will help you to focus on a
performance which will then lead to a
better visibility in the store right the
same applies for to new and updated
future collection and getting features
is great for users because they can see
androids best apps plus for you
it's great because they it will boost
your acquisition of quality has always
been a key factor for these collections
and moving forward the Android biters
will have a direct impact on review
criteria for these collections right and
then finally we get the award the Google
Play award and these we celebrate the
achievements of our developer community
by recognizing the best absolute games
across 12 different categories and for
these awards we evaluate the app overall
design their quality and the user
experience and we now include the inner
budgets to inform whether an app has a
strong technical performances on all
right so to recap we we covered a lot
and there was lots of information we
looked at the pre-launch report and how
you can now preview Android all we
looked at the updates for the pre-launch
report with the key screens and the
custom logins you can now target devices
we are able to monitor your recent
release with the release dashboard and
you're able to really understand your
users in a better way with their
previous analysis plus we then learned
about the Android budget and how it can
monitor your stability your rendering
and the battery and finally we looked at
the at the playing centers and how the
annual budgets were impact those as one
so to recap by focusing using those 10
10 PI consult secrets you will be able
to really improve your voice operating
there will lead to better user
acquisition and you will be able to have
a stellar use of attention
