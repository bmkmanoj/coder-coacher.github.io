two dead San Francisco with a very
special guest James rambling James is
the co-founder of firebase and now works
as a product manager at Google San
Francisco hey Dean how are you I'm doing
well thank you for having me
firebase has greened a lot of traction
all over the globe after its launch and
many developers in India is rather
adopting it while there are developers
who are still getting started with it so
what are your recommendations for our
definian developers so for all
developers in India I'd recommend
checking out two products specifically
ones that help with poor connectivity
the first is the real-time database
which has something called offline mode
so when your application data is stored
it's on a local cache actually on the
phone so far i OS and android
applications when you lose connectivity
they still remain responsive we know web
developers want this to so stay tuned
the second is five-eighths Cloud
messaging and so we have great
deliverability and open statistics so
that you can actually tell when your
developers are getting their messages so
those would be the products I'd
recommend and so you can check out
firebase Google comm slash alpha and
sign up for our alpha program and get
access to the latest and the greatest
that will be releasing shortly there has
been a discussion since quite some time
of using firebase cloud messaging over
Google Cloud messaging which can you
highlight few advantage if they're using
FCM migrating over to FCM for GPM yeah
so FCM is kind of the next version of
GCM and it has some great new features
to come along with that so first of all
is platform support for iOS and the web
second of all is we have a great new
console so not only can you send
notifications from your code but you can
actually go into our console and you can
schedule notification or you can send
campaigns based on data inside Google
Analytics or firebase and so you can
essentially think of Sdn as the next
version of GCM and should definitely
upgrade to take advantage of all those
great new features so we have seen
firebase evolved a lot since it was
launched and a lot of details got added
to firebase so what
red blue sea fire B of gluing mix so the
futures of firebase is looking bright
we're going to continue to make life
easier for developers we'll be doing
this in a few ways first of all we're
going to continue to bring the best of
Google into the firebase SDKs
so taking features from Google cloud
platform pulling more of them into
firebase working more closely with
AdWords AdMob and the analytics team and
I think the second thing we will be
doing is really focusing on bringing
machine learning and artificial
intelligence into firebase so providing
developers with recommendations and
helping them do do the things they need
to do to grow their business and using
ml one interesting question that I have
and I believe a lot of our engine
developers also have Google recently
acquired fabric so what's going on with
fabric so it's been great to have fabric
on the team they joined in January we
announced last week at Google i/o two
big things first of all is firebase
authentication is the next evolution of
digits so we're taking digits which is
fabrics phone number authentication
solutions make it first-class citizen
inside five x authentication the second
thing that we announced is that
crashlytics which is fabric scratch
reporting tool is going to be the
default tool inside fire me so we'll be
moving it over to become firebase
crashlytics okay and so you know with
digits and crashlytics coming to
firebase you can kind of get a sense for
where we're going with the fabric and
firebase integration thanks for all
those answers James and the last
question that I have for the day is a
lot of developers in India are either
getting started the fibers are already
developing with firebase so what are few
great resources where our developers can
go and learn more so I'd recommend
starting with our documentation firebase
doc google.com slash Doc's I check out
the rest of our online presence
especially
Stack Overflow for technical questions
and our YouTube channel which has a lot
of great content and then finally we'll
be in India throughout the rest of this
year so there's the firebase app
brochure which is in for vent starting
in New Delhi in June and then we have
solved for India which is going to be in
13
these brats rest of the year thanks Dean
for taking all the time and answering
all of our questions we are very
thankful to you for that of course and
you heard him and the resources have you
mentioned do check it out and if you are
interested in attending any of the fall
for India event definitely check out bit
dot NY slash small for India well then
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
