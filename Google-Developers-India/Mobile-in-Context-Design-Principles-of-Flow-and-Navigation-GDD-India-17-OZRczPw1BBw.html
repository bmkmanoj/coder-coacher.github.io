honored to be here today to talk with
you about mobile design so I'm going to
start with telling a story about our two
mobile platforms the mobile web and
native apps setting what you're seeing
here at the conference in context and
then in looking at design patterns and
principles we're going to talk about the
flow and navigation we'll be looking at
system patterns and material design and
then we'll look at some of the mobile
principles that we have that are based
on user data and we'll end with some
pointers for user testing so the focus
of this conference is on the latest and
greatest technologies that you can learn
about and apply to your work as it
should be there be many topics such as
those that you see here in the word
cloud but in some cases you've gone into
real depth on that's included tools for
increasing performance exploring IOT and
Android things the Google assistant
conversational apps details of
progressive web apps and more you've
covered many technical issues so far and
tools and features that you as
developers need to be aware of I'm going
to be taking a different approach for
the first part of this user experience
talk we're going to take a look at a
short history just for fun of how the
tech media has characterized the mobile
web and apps so this is just going to be
a bit different you can come on me with
this with me on this journey and we're
gonna see how they've engaged with this
over the years taking us to the point
where we are now that native apps and
the mobile web both matter very much and
that there are use cases for each and
they're both are developing and really
interesting and important ways so let me
start by asking you a question
when was it that the web was first
declared to be dead
have a think about it any ideas you
could do a search for it which
ironically you'd probably use the web
but okay so I'll put your
misery it was in 1997 by Wired magazine
and they had an article which they
titled push kiss your browser goodbye
the radical future of media beyond the
browser so that was back in 1997 that
they were declaring the web to be dead
and then in 2010 Steve Jobs made this
statement that people aren't searching
on their mobile devices as they do on
desktop what's happening is that they're
spending all their time in apps that
same year wide published a piece with
with an hour much rift on title the web
is dead long live the internet and then
just a few short years later there were
headlines like this that mobile app
usage increases in 2014 as mobile web
surfing declines in fact there were a
succession of such quotes and headlines
so the web is dying and apps are killing
it the decline of the mobile web and
things like that
so why were there headlines like this
what was fueling it well it was because
of a study that was published by a
company called flurry and they found
that on mobile devices only 14% of the
time is spent on the mobile web while
86% of it is spent in apps and studies
by comScore and Nielsen found similar so
let's take a look at where the stats on
this lie today it's pretty similar today
we know that on mobile devices only 12%
of the time is spent on the mobile web
while 88% of it is spent in apps this is
a study by comScore and other research
companies have found similar but how
exactly ask people spending their time
with apps so the answer is that they're
spending their time in primarily and
social networking in music games
multimedia apps and more two thirds of
the time are spent using apps with
regards to entertainment or
communication so while it is indeed a
great deal of time that people spend
using apps it's not evenly distributed
across verticals so they found stats
like this back in 2014
- but when people started looking at
this more closely there were some
telltale signs
the mobile web had some great things
going for it too so when they started to
research more started looking at the
data they found that the mobile web
accounted for more traffic for many
verticals than mobile apps for example
this chart this was from a year later in
2015 it shows at retail and Finance and
travel and typically see 50% or higher
proportion of their visits from their
mobile web so data like this led people
to question some of those sort of more
simplistic stats that were put out that
seem to imply that native apps were
becoming the only important platform on
mobile so this kind of data provided
further details and that led to the
headline the web is dying wait how are
you reading this I love that one and so
then there were lots of u-turns let's
have a look not so fast on the death of
the mobile web that is the web dying no
mobile web might not be dead after all
long lived the mobile web and wired in
contradiction to their famous article of
2010 in 2014 claimed that the web is not
dead and then two years later the web is
not dead after all Google made sure of
that and that reported about the
advancement of activities that can be
done in the browser and the early
successes of progressive web apps the
article ended by saying the truth is
that app universe and the web are not
mutually exclusive we use both just
maybe the web is more alive than ever
now more recently the headlines have
shifted to focus on apps but they're
kind of more tempered now or positioned
to be taken a little bit more
tongue-in-cheek
learning lessons from the rounds of
headlines that came before that was
focus so assuredly on the death of the
web authors and editors now know that
the analysis is more complex and that
there were multiple changes happening
changes in the web and the app ecosystem
and opportunities with burgeoning
technologies like AR and VR virtual
reality augmented reality apps
themselves are also evolving
incorporating more activities and more
services in some cases increasing the
time that's spent within them so now we
get headlines like this very alarmist
right the app is dead long live the app
absolute dead it's all about channels in
2017 this one I think is the most
important you know mobile apps aren't
dead they're evolving all these things
that are evolving and isn't we're at a
very interesting juncture and we know
that there are some native apps are
doing very very well that broke into the
market very recently ride-sharing apps
and food ordering apps some more there
exists huge businesses such as Myntra
and make my trip a vote that have built
their businesses primarily on apps and
we all know of some business that our
app only and have been very successful
indeed our company Google have released
a number of app only products ourselves
so we have our trips app for planning
and booking travel we have REO our food
ordering and home services app for our
India market and we have pays our Indian
based payment app there are other
businesses that recognize themselves as
being mobile web focused or turning to
the web now Flipkart the large Indian
online retail store and interestingly
geo cinema here in India they recently
have gone to the web for the first time
with a progressive web app and then I
want to highlight West Elm they were
furniture store in the US and they've
never developed a mobile app mobile a
native mobile app that is their VP of
innovation Luc chatelaine explain this
clearly at a retail conference earlier
this year when he said that what people
just don't buy a couch on their phone
every day and another way of saying this
is you know make sure you understand
you'll use the behavior and do what's
right for your users for your business
in a way that really meets those users
needs
indeed his insight is very spot-on in a
study I conducted earlier this year
participants often explained that they
tend not to download apps unless they
decide they could really use them a lot
so it's all about frequency often
because of the download process and so
forth it you know adds something else to
their phone so some of them say adds
clutter to their phone and of course
apps take up storage on the phone in our
studies we found that this was a burden
for some of our participants in the US
and other studies a family in India 33
percent of users run out of storage
every day so we know from user research
that users like the convenience of
launching apps from the home screen if
it's something that they will turn to
regularly if you've been following the
PWA developments launching from the host
screen is no longer the domain of native
apps only but also can be available for
web apps as he seen here with this
example of the trivago app which is a
hotel booking app in all what's
happening is that we're making the user
experience across both platforms web and
app both we're making them both better
and kind of making up for the
deficiencies that each have and as part
of doing this we've created more tools
for developers that can help with user
experiences like polymer elements for
the web and material design for both web
and app and there's already availability
of tools to help with speed and
performance on the web which is so
critical for user experience and for
native apps as Android studio with all
the tools built into that and firebase
is a suite of tools so aid app
developers as can be seen here so here
we have things like test lab and
analytics and fire store which there's
been a talk about here at this
conference and a be testing and many
more tools so the two platforms mobile
web and app are now addressing the user
experiences that they have been
deficient in we're helping users
discover and experience native apps more
readily through encouraging developers
to create instant apps and you can see
an example here from jet comm and we're
helping developers create apps with
speedier downloads that take up less
storage on the device and on the web
we're encouraging developers to create
offline experience
so their experiences on the web stay
engaging and the progressive web app
technologies that enable ists this
serviceworker in the cache API not only
handle offline but also provide
resilience to network problems and we're
encouraging developers to re-engage
users through notifications as well as
you can see here in this example flight
app so these capabilities for engagement
and reengagement on the mobile web they
didn't exist before so we're really
trying hard to think about this so the
changes to both of these platforms are
really fantastic as I said it's evolving
as you've already heard at this
conference many sites are pushing these
modern features of the web from amp to
serviceworker to add to homescreen to
push notifications to sign in to better
payment systems these companies want to
deliver better mobile website
experiences and this is just a map of
some of the samples of brands that are
raising the bar globally and India has
been especially rapid in adopting this
technology it's leading the world in
many in many cases in terms of its
progressive web app development but in
addition to some of these cutting-edge
technologies at the fundamental level we
have to provide really great mobile
experiences great design we do this
through the provision of creating great
design and for this talk I've chosen to
review some elements of mobile
navigation because that's common no
matter what vertical you're working
within so this should be applicable to
many of you let's talk first about
Android system patterns so these
patterns can be used consistently for
creating strong navigation and flow so
we'll start with the UP button shown
here it takes the user upward in the
apps hierarchy until they get to the
home screen
taking users through all the previous
screens they viewed the back button that
works differently to the UP button
because whereas the UP button has users
remaining in your app the back button
navigates in reverse chronological order
through all the history of the recently
viewed screens whether or not that's in
same up the back button does other
things as well it dismisses floating
windows such as dialogues or pop-ups it
dismisses contextual action bars and
removes the highlight from selected
items and hides the on-screen keyboard
so you don't have to navigate back
through those things so those are some
of the main kind of like system patterns
for Android so let's now look at some
material design things that can happen
that help with navigation so there were
many different elements that can help
with navigation and flow in material
design both for the web and for apps
starting with top tabs this is likely to
be quite familiar to you is a very
useful navigation element and users can
switch between different categories of
content easily with top tabs so it's
good when you have not that many
categories of content few top-level
views it provides a very good mechanism
for promoting awareness as well as the
alternative views within your app so
this illustration shows some of the
different types of top tabs and we find
that using a label and an icon works by
best we'll talk more about that in a
little while
it's also possible of course to provide
a bottom navigation bar and as with top
tabs enables frequent switching between
views and promotes awareness of
alternate views on mobile devices the
bottom navigation is located in a very
ergonomic position and we see that young
people are more used to holding their
mobile devices on one hand and therefore
getting to these bottom navigation bars
very easily but what if your app has a
lot of categories of content in other
words ideally you'd have lots of these
you know different tabs but it's not
really functional well so then we can
use the navigation drawer it enables
quick navigation between views that
perhaps are unrelated in this case and
it also allows for a deep navigational
structure and it can reduce the
visibility of infrequently visited
destinations which is helpful in some
places this is nested navigation when we
have a hierarchy in the content we wish
to display is a deep navigational
structure with many different views and
this also enables very quick navigation
between unrelated views so it's an
advantage when you have these unrelated
views and what do you do if you have
this deep navigational hierarchy well
the navigation drawer also enables you
to expand that hierarchy the dropdowns
open up the hierarchy some apps start
off with that navigation expanded on the
perfu of mobile so people can see what's
there now this is embedded navigation
and when we talk about this we're
talking about a directly expandable
surface so this calculator in this
example it uses an accessible panel to
be a navigation aid to the Supplemental
view so this image has the navigation
panel expanded the function panel and it
overlays a standard keyboard in the
collapsed space state what you would see
is kind of a peak of that so that the
user knows that they can expand it
that's kind of the embedded portion so
it's not formally using tabs or bottom
navigation for example to label that
content is just directly expandable in
the surface that's another element of
material design floating action buttons
these allows users to to action the most
common or primary action on the screen
for that screen in the application and
the icon may be animated the floating
action button it animates onto the
screen as an expanded piece of material
by default so here we see a floating
action button used for sharing and use
to add something here to use to add a
note and perhaps for play or pause in
this application here and lastly of
these just your navigation it enables
users to navigate between content using
different gestures users can swipe to
navigate between sibling or P of use the
gestures include touching and dragging
the screen horizontally left and right
or vertically up and down and zooming
out so when do you use this well this is
recommended when you do have related
content right it's the sort of naturally
ordered relationships such as
pages representing consecutive calendar
days or views with very few siblings or
views of similar content types
so that gestural navigation so let's
recap these are the material design
navigation elements we've reviewed we
looked at top tabs bottom navigation bar
navigation draw the nested navigation
the expanded navigation drawer and we
looked at embedded navigation we also
looked at the floating action button and
expanded navigation so you can find out
more about these within the material
design guidelines online now over the
last few years we've completed many use
of research that is developed to develop
three sets of mobile design principles
that's seventy five design principles in
all that we've created and we did many
user tests for this and we wanted to do
user testing at this scale as Google
because we knew we'd be releasing these
principles to developers and designers
around the world and we wanted to be
really sure that these principles
released would be robust and based on
this kind of user knowledge that we've
done through these testing procedures so
our user studies took place in our
usability lamps um participants were
prompted to visit and perform a key
conversion task for six different apps
or sites during their session each
session that we bought uses in four
lasted an hour to an hour and a half per
person and we had participants bring in
their own smartphones to conduct the
task so that the phone that they had was
not unfamiliar to them and both iOS and
Android were used in the studies in
equal proportion so they worked through
tasks on the site or the app and the
method we used as traditional usability
testing with link allowed protocol so
that's when the facilitator asks a
question so in the case you see here the
facilitator is asking for them to order
dinner for tonight and the participant
speaks out loud as they're doing the
tasks and what this does it provides us
with insight into their understanding
and provides us with details about when
they get
chuckle lost we can very much see what
is happening and this is what makes it
different than collecting your logs data
or or survey work but you know about
attitudes and and not really about
observing behavior so for all for the
three studies we conducted around 250
usability sessions and we did this in
collaboration with a third-party company
called answer lamp they're a usability
company we tested a hundred mobile sites
for the app study we tested a hundred
apps and for a study specifically
focused on retail we tested apps and
sites with tested 50 of each and the
participants had longer sessions for the
latter we really wanted to get in depth
we had an hour and a half with each
participant so the sites or apps tested
ranged from large retailers through
information providers and service
providers and we looked at many
different types of services like travel
and e-commerce we looked at groceries
and purchasing groceries we looked at
news sites we looked at food ordering we
looked at the category of
home-and-garden transportation legion
services such as insurance and more so
those are just some examples of what we
looked at we wanted to keep it very
bored so you can get to all of the
principles that we resulted from these
studies so if you want to be able to get
to them I suggest you take out your
phones and take a picture of the links
and so this was further principles of
mobile web design the principles of
mobile app design and the principles for
retail which were based on studies as I
mentioned for both mobile web and app
and the reason we've got two links for
each of the the first two was because we
produced a second set but they're the
same principles but the second link for
each of the first two has developer
resources embedded in there so links to
api's and code snippets and so forth so
the first ones you can pass on to your
non coding colleagues they're nicely and
cleanly presented and then the second
ones have got these links in for
developers so let's pull from a few of
these principles in order to understand
a bit more about navigation so let's
start with talking about those users
expiry
that can really stop users in their
tracks they're really fundamental and so
when implemented incorrectly they stop
that navigation and flow and often lead
to users abandoning the experience so
this is when you see drop-off the first
one is allowing users to browse your
content before asking them for personal
information so before you ask them to
sign up or register or collect other
kinds of personal information from them
it's important to provide them with an
excellent experience so they can become
a real enthusiast about your product and
use those abandoned sites we find or our
apps when the the Prada asked them to
provide this personal information up
front unless and we've kind of seen this
in recent years there's some sort of
immediate payoff that users are really
clear about so things like the car
service or food delivery information
most users understand now that if I'm
going to ask for that and want that then
obviously they're going to need some
personal information from me in
particular apps go with a low brand
recognition and those where the value
proposition is unclear all those where
that personal information really isn't
needed you know they need to clear clear
a higher hurdle when they ask for people
to register so only as users to register
if it's essential so we can see here
that the users being asked to register
straight off that doesn't go down well
but here they can get into the
experience I'm sorry that's good that
one they can get next to experience and
they can register later on much later in
the flow so this one is similar it's all
about putting a barrier in in between
peoples experience and the guidance here
is like don't let promotions still the
show is often us that are more
interested in making that promotion to
users and not the users themselves
so specifically here we're showcasing
promotion lines such as instances that
word instance this yours or for apps on
your mobile website right recommending a
customer download your app so instead of
something that you see like this on the
left hand side a better option is to go
with a small banner that doesn't
interrupt the user experience that your
user is having on your site
however your best bet rather than even
this is to make a fantastic mobile web
experience particularly with progressive
Web Apps capabilities where users can
add to homescreen work offline and more
so just adding some data to this example
I can give you some data from google
plus a couple of years ago our Google
Plus team showed that including such an
experience with this kind of friction
led to 69% of users simply abandoning
the whole experience with Google Plus at
that point that's a huge drop-off right
so they knew about this principle of it
they kind of didn't believe it and they
wanted to look at the the data so that's
what they found and here it was this is
what it looked like and the team changed
to a much smaller less intrusive at
banner at the time that looked like this
and that resulted in a direct increase
of 1-day active users by 17% so that was
pretty significant and now they don't
have a banner at all on their site they
went with the idea of simply providing a
great experience on each platform no
matter what the user wanted to use
that's what the users come for so now we
have a great mobile web experience and
great app experience and then the third
of these that provide these barriers to
people is about permissions and I think
you've probably talked a little bit
about this at this conference already
it's really important to get this right
users can get stuck in a task when they
denying permissions that are integral to
the proper functioning of the app and
they often do this when permissions are
asked out of context so often we ask
permissions at the beginning of the
experience in the app and and users
don't know what they're asking for and
they often deny them so to mitigate this
app should ask for permissions in
context and also communicate the value
the access will provide to the user so
the user understands it and this is
possible in both iOS and Android and for
Android it was enabled back when Android
M was made available two years ago so
make that permission request directly
relevant for the task and the user will
be more likely to grant it so let's have
a look on the left you see that the user
is asked right up front when they open
this app this this
app they want to use a location it's a
poor experience often people say no
because they don't have the context for
it in this one they are in the app
they're using it and at this point they
want to search for a store so they click
this button and it's a much more obvious
to the user why they're being asked for
this permission at this time so that's
the last of those you know experiences
that really stop users in their tracks
now note that you might only get one
chance when you ask for permissions so
it's important to service them when
there's the best possibility of them
being accepted as very few users will
work out how to change their settings
once they've blocked a permission if we
look at chrome data some analysis there
has shown that users ignore or
temporarily dismiss permission ponts
more than 90% of the time so in Rome 63
permissions are going to become modal
this makes users 5 times more likely to
accept or deny requests rather than
temporarily dismissing or repeatedly
ignoring them so that's a change that's
going to be happening so you've heard
much of it's at this conference about
the importance of overloading the home
page and others pages fast we've talked
a lot about speed
well once that page is loaded they
better have really key calls to action
of course this is important for mobile
web and apps it's about figuring out the
primary purpose of your site or your app
for your users and in our studies we
tested some sites that we came across
that had similar calls to action like
this try it now
or learn more and I've still seen these
kind of things more recently but it's
just not clear enough it's just too
vague for the user and the user can't be
convinced of what they came for
so the design on the right here is a lot
more clear to the user if you're going
to a real estate site then you're likely
to be there for renting or buying or
selling so figure out those key tacky
calls to action for your product and
feature them really prominently and this
is something you can find out for user
testing too sometimes we're so embedded
in our prod
we can't recognize it ourselves so
secondary content and course of action
can be addressed either further down the
screen or behind menu icons and we
talked about the use of a navigation
drawer and other ways to search the
surface those navigational elements now
when we think of menus a lot of thought
has to be put into organizing and
labeling menu categories to be user
friendly so first of all menus should be
sure no user is going to want to really
scroll through long menus on mobile
right but in addition our studies have
shown that if we don't think really
carefully about those menu categories
then we don't reflect users men mental
model of those categories for your topic
area so this is where the user research
activity of doing a card sort can come
in so that we can get into the minds of
users and have them saw the topics in
the category and across a number of
users see how those fall out and it
might be quite differently than the way
that we would organize it it helps we
build the best structure for the
organization of our content so I give
the example here we saw things like this
in our studies where here the menu
categories have kind of muddled both the
product and the activities and so this
creates a conflict in users minds so if
they're looking for like men's hiking
boots is that in men's but we're always
it in hiking okay so think about your
categories like this on the right-hand
side we see that you know they've just
focused on the activities so much
cleaner and it doesn't give users this
kind of conflict in their minds now
providing text labels and visual keys to
clarify visual information is really
important
so let's take a look at this we have
some icons here and they're unlabeled so
just in your head think about what you
think they they might be for when you're
booking a flight just take a little
moment what would that plane before and
the check mark and the star and the
person have you labelled them all okay
all right so let's take a look at and
think to yourself whether this is what
you thought so the first one we've got
it strips the second one is book
the third one is club like the you know
the airline club and the third and the
fourth one is account some of you
probably got that one correct that's a
bit more standard but we really found
despite you know thinking that some of
these icons are super super common that
generally when we're testing them
without labels it isn't the case and so
it's surprising things that you think
would be common like icon super menu or
cart or account or even store locator
were quite often muddled by participants
and also labels for it's important to
label actions as well like filtering and
sorting and these weren't Universal you
might think they are but they're not
necessarily well understood across apps
so icons are labeled a much more likely
to be used appropriately and this can
help in navigation and then being
responsive with visual feedback is
important so that users know the results
of their action so when users add an
item to the cart or submit an order the
lack of feedback can cause them to
question whether their action has been
processed or not apps are provided
visual animation or another type of
visual eliminate the guesswork for the
user and you can see this here in the
positive example this is a negative
example here nothing happens basically
but we have a toast or a snack bar
element popping up to give the user this
information that an items been added and
then lastly we're going to look at
transitioning between apps and the
mobile web and where that's important
and you have to do it making
frictionless so here we see users
checking in for a flight in this app
they're moving them to the mobile web
but the experience really disjointed and
has a very different look and feel in
the good example the designer was really
thought about this the teams of work
together often it's different
development teams and the experience is
much cleaner again this is a
navigational thing it's best to try not
to move people from one platform for
another but when you really need to do
it make sure that it's speedy and the
benefit in contrast to any remaining
friction is worthwhile so just to recap
again remove the barriers registration
promos position
those are the things that can stop users
in their tracks brick great key calls to
action organize and label your menu
categories provide labels to clarify
visual information be responsive with
your visual feedback and make app to web
transitions frictionless alright so here
again if you didn't take a picture of it
last time at those mobile web principles
and remember the second of each of these
links have additional resources added
for you so that brings me to the end of
the principles we're going to talk
through let's talk about the benefits of
user research so your apps and your
sites need user testing your product is
an exception so if you haven't done it
so far I'm telling you you need to do
that because we always learn something
you can start small though start by
understanding the user journey this is
really important this this one is for
the process of buying coffee we're
looking at new customers and existing
customers and it's important to
understand that current process so you
can get into their mental model and
understand that and see how those
experiences might map or not map to your
experience and what they're going to get
meddled with so iterate on the designs
the content the navigation the flow in
the usability I want to give you an
example I have a use of researcher on my
team at Google who worked on this
product
Aereo is the food and home service are
ordering out that's launched here in
India and it's quite active here in in
Bangalore she did many studies of food
and home service or being in India as
the team iterated on their early concept
to get the act right the research that
she conducted helped the team understand
the experience they needed to build to
fit him with users lives
specifically we tested the one on the
Left this was not all release product it
exposed all the services that Aereo
offered she conducted usability studies
and found that people just could not get
a quick overview in their heads of
everything that was offered we felt that
they could like design-wise it feels
like that right but when we actually use
a tested it we couldn't do that users
couldn't do that so she also did a card
sort there helped with grouping it
helped with renaming some of the
categories and it helped with localizing
the category content and the service
provided and all that design work
resulted in the design you see today
because of the testing that was found to
work well for users and in addition the
research helped to identify where the
imagery needed to be localized things
like the within these drawn diagrams
here there was an inclusion of meat and
alcohol and and we decided to exclude
those in the end and we also decided to
make the color palette more vibrant so
if your app or site already exists it's
still important and helpful to
understand user journeys both with and
without your technology this really
helped for our REO products as well and
you also need to test your app on site
and while yes there's all sorts of
biases for testing with family and
friends it really is like a suitable
place to start if you've never got
started before and it can lead you to
that aha moment so say in your data
you're seeing a drop off this can often
be the aha moment you realize why you
know they don't understand the label
that's on the button or you have some
other insight and as your testing gets
more mature you can iron out some of
those biases in your testing if your
testing with family and friends and
start to do this more formally and with
proper screening procedures to get the
right participants in and to help you
get started in user testing we've got
some great resources again you might
want to take a vote of this link Google
Ventures the venture capital arm of
Google has done a lot of supporting
startups through doing use of research
and they have a lot of great resources
at this link so I want to sum up this
talk the story of mobile web and apps is
still evolving I think it's really
really exciting we're looking to see
where it's going to go next and we're
working to like make sure that the
experience on both platforms is really
as best as we can make it and making up
for those deficiencies that the
platform's have so they're getting to be
much more comparable comparable for
example both platforms can deliver a
speedy user experience the web service
workers and and the cache API and and
other that
technologies can provide a really
reliable experience whether that's on
stable 4G or poor sort of 3G networks
both platforms can support the
functionality to take photos for
instance and the use of location
services are more for both platforms
they're available on the mobile web as
well as apps the native apps there were
many ways in which these are becoming
more discoverable because that's been
the big issue for apps right from being
serviced on Google search and in our ad
formats on search now as well so both in
organic and unannounced as well as
obviously being in display ads and
through to the affordances and the
capabilities that we're having with
instant apps to have that instant
experience without needing to download
so the most important thing for
development teams to focus on though is
to create experiences that the best for
users whether that's web or native app
design and in this talk with reviewed
some of the best practices for mobile
design and provided links to more so
that you can follow these best practices
for your design and development work and
remember to conduct your user research
to improve the mobile experience you're
building start with understanding that
user journey and design with that in
mind and then iteratively use a test to
provide you and your team with the best
opportunity to create a really fantastic
the best experience in your vertical for
your users so that ends our look at user
experience design and navigation
patterns for today if you want to get in
touch I'm going to be around afterwards
in the mobile and web design area and
we're going to be offering one-on-one
feedback on your native app or your
mobile web app so you can come along to
that area and we can and we can chat and
you can contact me at any time on
twitter at journey LG and i want to
thank you so much for your time today
