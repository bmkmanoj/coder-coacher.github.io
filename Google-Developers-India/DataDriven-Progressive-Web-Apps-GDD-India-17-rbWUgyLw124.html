pwace which is to say a lot of what we
show in starter classes for the PWA
is how to cache all of your static
assets how to cache an entire webpage or
maybe even to cache a dynamic asset but
a dynamic page not data but the page
itself but what if you're building
something like Twitter where you need
user icons and tweets or you're building
a photo viewer where you need to pull
the photos in and cache them and you
want to make this data available offline
how do you do that you know if you're
building the next Flipkart Flipkart
doesn't cache every single product in
there they cache things dynamically as
you search so how do you do it and in
the classroom we do this pretty quickly
so we're going to spend some time taking
this apart going in at greater length
first off if you don't have no js'
installed find out who on your row has
one of the USB drives and there's images
of nodejs you can install from there
because some of the tooling we're going
to use runs on top of node the labs for
this entire class are also on those
thumb drives so you'll be passing them
around just to quickly copy things to
your machine there were like two on each
row in the fishballs
and people who came to previous sessions
may already have one so until we're done
we'll talk for a little bit and then
you'll do some code and we'll talk some
more and you'll write some more code and
at the end we'll have some questions so
it's pretty straightforward this is a
mixture of lecture and code lab but
slice together in about 10 minutes lysis
okay so what is a PW a basic definition
so very fast initial load you cache all
your static assets they're coming
locally from the device they don't need
the network at all it may have an app
shell the fact they fast loads
throughout the app that you have things
all loading up locally
a ploy Khmers of experience things like
fullscreen add to homescreen potentially
even push notifications make it look and
feel like a native application except
that anybody can install it whether or
not you have a Play Store available on
your machine and really they use very
very little memory so the manifest is
what enables that Add to Home screen to
full screen mode and the last one here
offline content is where we're going to
spend our time how do we do offline data
so things that you download using fetch
or using Ajax how do you store it for
offline use so let me do a quick rerun
through service workers and cache api's
who in here is a service worker expert
who in here is kind of sleepy after
lunch a few hands okay
so almost nobody is a service worker
expert except maybe drinky Jake
Archibald let's do a quick recap so the
basic idea is that the service worker is
a proxy it's a network proxy that sits
between your code your JavaScript and
the outside of the browser and so when
your browser your web app makes a
request like a get for hero dot PNG the
service worker intercepts that request
and it can do one of two things
depending on the code that you're
running inside the service worker it can
either go to the network and get the
file and return it or it can go to the
local cache and get the file and return
it so the service worker basically lets
you intercept any request to the network
and reroute it now if you're using an
exotic protocol like WebSocket then this
doesn't apply this is actually for HTTP
and HTTPS calls the cache API basically
says it's the serviceworker is sitting
here between your page and the cache and
so the serviceworker intercepts a
request goes to the cache API and says
hey does this file exist in the cache
and if it does just serves it up from
there so here's an example of what would
be in the cache
the air horner demo app which you've
probably seen a million times by now so
we'll have index.html air burner calm
slash index.html the home screen one
variation so all the variations of the
ways you can get to the root screen are
all in the cache and then this the
jeaious scripts the sounds and the
styles and so this is all in cash so air
burner runs completely offline
everything that it needs is stored in
this cache now this cache is not the
same as the regular browser cache the
regular browser cache if you're offline
it will not generally serve new files up
to you instead it's going to serve up an
error saying hey wait a minute you're
offline this file might be old this is a
secondary cache in addition to the
browser cache that it's one that you
control directly it's one that you use
JavaScript to say add a file remove a
file you have total control over this
cache and it will always be available
offline it can get removed if memory
fills up and it's basically a least
recently used kind of algorithm so any
apps that are really active this cache
will stay active apps that are older may
get pushed out of memory
if that happens they may stop working
offline the next time somebody goes on
online service work we'll see oh wait a
minute the cache is gone let me build a
new one the app shell pattern is
basically the way you build really
almost any good sized application you
put all the common materials into a
shell so all of the common navigation
the sidebars everything and then you
load views into it as you need to in
this case those views are HTML pages or
other content that you're rendering and
by the way how many people here use
react right a lot of people more than
half the room react works just fine in
here a lot of people say I can't use
react with serviceworker no you can use
react just fine
build your react application normally
and then all you have to do is write the
serviceworker code to cache the pieces
that need to be cached the HTML on the
JavaScript and the CSS so an example of
building that cache by hand yes you make
a list of all of the URLs in your
application all of your files
notice that we have both slash and
index.html because there's two different
ways to get to the index page you wait
now this code is inside the
serviceworker the serviceworker has
given an install event when the time is
ready to build the cache so on the
install event you call wait until
because otherwise this may return
immediately and your cache may not get
built so you're going to say wait until
I finish this job open the cache by name
so in this case will be cache - 1 and
then add everything to the cache how
many people don't know what this arrow
is please be honest everyone's got it ok
a couple of people don't let me tell you
really fast then that arrow is es6
notation for a function so you can use
es5 that you've been writing so i could
write a function in here or i and the
function would take a single parameter
cache or I could simply write the
parameter name the fat arrow and then
the body of the function so this is a
shortcut for writing a function now I
just showed you how to write that thing
by hand there's a problem with that
let's say you're working and you add a
file or you change a file you really
sure you're going to keep that whole
file constantly up to date probably not
so work box is a tool and we'll have a
whole session this afternoon on it that
automates writing most of the
serviceworker for you it takes a set of
references to where your static files
live including things like wild cards
which serviceworker doesn't normally do
and it goes and builds the exact list of
files and it calculates a hash for each
file it actually stores those hashes so
it can detect when a new version of the
files been uploaded so it writes all the
code for you you put it in your build
step whatever build tool you happen to
love it fits in there
so using work box we have to import the
work box script and import scripts is
actually a feature of the serviceworker
that says i'm running a script somebody
used a script to create me now the
serviceworker notes it needs to pull
some scripts into itself so it calls
import script you create a new work box
software object new work box
serviceworker I'm sorry and then you say
to that pre cache and you give it an
empty list okay well this isn't going to
do any good but this is a template just
like you use page templates you hand
this to work box as part of your build
notice this is in the source directory
and actually let me back up one here you
hand it to work box as part of the build
and what it's going to happen is work
box is going to fill in all of your
files into that empty list and generate
a new copy of the serviceworker that
will actually be your production copy
right pretty typical situation you've
got a source folder and a build folder
and you have to compile some things this
was just part of that compilation step
so you can do it from the command line
or NPM scripts using work box CLI or it
has built-in integrations for gulp
webpack grunt or if you'd like some
other tool you can roll it into there
it's really very straightforward so for
work box CLI you install work box in
your package JSON for NPM you basically
say work box generate serviceworker and
that's all it takes and then run that
command don't worry about memorizing
any of this everything is in the lab
that's coming up now how does it know
what files to pull in you build a file
called work box CLI config it's
JavaScript file
and you say everything's coming from
source directory at the top my global
patterns I want index age well you see
the files I don't have to read them to
you
you can include Global's there and it
will actually search and pull all the
files off the disk this is a huge
time-saver you tell it where the source
service worker is that little template
you say where you want to be written out
to at the end and you should ignore if
anybody's using Global's ignore the
following files so for example don't
cache this config file because it's not
actually a runtime file no ok sorry this
is the output code here so work box
software a pre cache had an empty list
now this is the built one with the
output and it's got the URL and it has a
hash for the file so that if a new
version of the file gets seen by the
service worker gets picked up this will
automatically replace it it'll keep your
cache current now that's static asset
caching for runtime caching for things
that very like the pictures and the text
in here that's runtime caching with
routes and so what you say is if it
comes from this URL this route here's
the caching strategy I want you to use
normally the cache strategy you use is
called cache first that's for all of
your static assets that means always get
it from the cache and if you can't get
it from the cache fallback and hit the
network in this case you'll pick a
caching strategy depending on what type
of data it is so we're going to say
inside of your source serviceworker j/s
we're gonna say register a route so any
image file ping gif or JPEG we're going
to say cache first which is try the
cache if it's not there get it from the
network put it in the cache we'll say
we'll call that the images cache and
we'll say it can take 50 entries total
that's all you have to do to cache those
dynamic images how much time did you
just save writing this code as opposed
to write and yell a couple of pages of
code and debugging it so we're going to
do a little quick lab break here you're
going
do follow these instructions you're
going to if you don't have no js'
installed pull it from the usb hopefully
most of you already do we told you
before
grab the lab code from this folder on
the USB open up the lab instructions
page now section 2 tells you to
basically download everything from the
network you can skip that section
because you're using a local USB if we
all try to hit the network here at once
you know we're kind of a rolling DDoS
attack and then stop before step 5 so
though I'm up to up through step 4 and
this will cache all of your static
assets and this will cache dynamic file
assets but no data yet ok let's go
what I'm going to do is talk through the
next section and then do whatever parts
of the lab you need to do we've built in
enough time that you can get most people
can get through all the parts and then
there's some optional stuff at the end
and we actually timed it for the
optionals so you should be able to make
it even with the extra time for the
installs but let's go ahead and move
forward okay so we sent you through the
lab now what do we do with pwace that
rely on data right what if it's really
very simple shell and everything's
coming in from Ajax or fetch so for
example here's a clothing shop or
Twitter right all of the information in
this page the jackets the prices the
pictures the tweets the user icons
that's all coming from the network those
are not files so you wouldn't store them
in the cache API so where are you going
to put them well some people might say
local storage but local storage is super
limited instead usually what we
recommend is putting them in a database
now this is kind of interesting because
I'm going to say work I'm gonna walk you
through indexdb because it's been around
and it's available pretty much anywhere
the Service Worker is available if I was
starting today and if I was setting this
workshop up today I would probably do
the first workshop using cloud firestore
we talked about this morning it's
essentially a document database built on
top of firebase because it will
automatically handle everything we're
talking about in here saving your data
when you're offline transmitting it to
the server when you're online
synchronizing the data it does all of
that and under the hood it uses index DB
so I'm going to teach you how basically
it was built and then you could choose
to use it or you can choose to build
your own whatever works for you so index
DB is a no sequel it's a no sequel
database technically it's an object
store it's not even a real database it
has
a table with multiple records in it the
records do not have to be identical
which is really confusing if you use
today kind of relational database or you
define what the table looks like and the
columns look like and they're all the
same and not strictly true here so you
have a row number you define some key if
you want in this case it's going to be
the value ID from the object so it's
copied in and then the actual value is
just an object now we're showing the
objects here in a sort of JSON format
but they are actually regular JavaScript
objects you can even drop a blob in here
so you could get an image or a video or
literally anything that could be stored
in a JSON be stuffed into index DB and
that index DB appears in the application
tab you can come in and open it up and
look at it and in this case I have two
objects don't I have an object store
called witters and I have an index on it
called by date and so this is this is
whitter this is Jake Archibald version
of Twitter so it's really ideal for
storing data you can do the usual crud
operations create remove create remove
update delete you can do transactions
which is actually really nice you can
string a bunch of operations together
and make sure they're either all going
to succeed together or fail because one
of the problems in a database if you
don't have transactions is what happens
if your your set of operations gets
interrupted in the middle maybe
something else tries to write to the
database when you do without
transactions you could have a corrupted
database with transactions you can be
sure that the data stays consistent it
has indexing so you can say sort by this
value and get them out in that order and
it's a cursor based database which means
it doesn't give you a table it gives you
a pointer to the data into the database
you get your result and then you ask for
the next field and the result in the
cursor moves
so in this case we'll show two object
stores we're going to show an object
store with some data in it
both of them have data this one also has
two different indices so each index is a
different way of sorting the data
actually it's a different way of
traversing the data in a sorted order so
we'll open a date we'll create a
function called open the database and
we'll say index DB dot open we'll give
it a name we'll give it a version number
one that version number every time you
change every time you add a new object
store inside the database or change in
index that's essentially changing the
schema and so you would bump the version
number up and then the last thing we
take optionally is a callback function
that callback gets called after its
Navin that optional once the database is
created and it says okay database has
been built
now do your work so we'll create an open
database function open it function
upgrade dB we'll see okay does the
object store name contain an object
store meaning do I have something called
object store in here if not I'll go
ahead and create it
notice that upgrade DB is an object
that's passed into this callback all of
the calls for manipulating the structure
of the database are in this object so
this is the only place you can get to it
it's the only way you can get to it this
code may look a little odd with lots of
callbacks and event handlers and you'll
see it gets worse that's because it was
actually designed about ten years ago
back when event handlers and callbacks
were super common before we had promises
now we're going to use an example here
of something called index DB promised
that Jake Archibald wrote that wraps
index DB in promises and makes it vastly
simpler to write but to get started to
do the creation you have to write at the
old fashioned way in this case we'll
also add an index on the object store
called price so we can sort by price and
this is what the database will get any
sample in the index of here's one key
the key path is called time so that's
one index and that's simply the time in
the object and then a second index key
path ID which is the ID field of the
object now to get the data
this is using index TV promised now call
open database that returns a promise
promise then resolves the promise pass
it a function remember we're using the
fat arrow here so this is a function
taking a single parameter called DB the
database start a transaction so on the
object store and it's going to be
read-only because you can have multiple
concurrent reads against the same object
store if that had been readwrite then
everything else would have been blocked
from accessing it until the transaction
was done because it's read-only you
could have multiple threads accessing it
all reading at the same time because
nobody's going to modify the database
we'll find the object store and then
we'll say store get all and what store
don't get all does is returns back it
next to be promised it returns a promise
in regular index DB call it triggers an
event that says here's some data and
then as a cursor and then you say give
me the next record so this will return
the first record of the set so we can do
ad get to get one we can do get all to
do essentially a query put or delete
kind of obvious so the story is to use
them together
anything that generally has a URL goes
in the cache
now some people cheat let's say you have
images like there's a app out there
that's a Pokemon index called pokedex
they actually use data URLs and stuff
actually they they sometimes stuff the
images in the cache or some disease and
xdb it depends but you could stuff
images in here you could turn something
URL and stuff it in here but if it's got
a URL normally it goes into cache
otherwise it goes in indexdb and the
code to tell the difference let work box
sort things in by route and store them
in the cache and for all your data just
go through index DB code so this is the
overall flow of the app so go to the
server and say fetch me some data or use
xml httprequest it's actually better to
use the fetch API by the way things have
been greatly modernized over xhr and
it's more reliable so get some server
data we'll get back a promise because
we're using fetch then we get the data
from the network in a function we put it
on the UI immediately this is actually
one of the first things do as soon as
you get the data put it in UI because
you want your UI to be responsive now
save the data locally in index DB and
that's all going to happen
asynchronously that's all promise based
so you update the screen stuff the data
in the database if an error happens
grab your local copy of the event data
so try to pick it up from the index
database and display it if you can
so this says try the network first and
then fall back on the database you could
actually write the reverse of this code
to go to the database first and then try
the network later so this is the local
save it's basically what you've seen
open the database create a transaction
open the object store put each object
into the store if anything fails call
abort now here's something I've seen how
many people in here program databases
before ok a small number
anybody use program to database here
does something seem to be missing I
started a transaction but what's missing
here I'm not committing the transaction
mi because index DB is weird it's very
strange
the model is here's the way to think
about it
so this happens in one chunk of code and
then somewhere down here at the end when
we're done running JavaScript the
browser goes into its idle loop where it
delivers events and all of that
basically that's all so we're all open
transactions are automatically committed
so if you don't call a board then the
next time you get to the idle loop that
transaction will be committed now in
some browsers like Chrome the commits
might happen even earlier but the the
model you need to think about is
whenever you're in the idle loop all the
open transactions will be closed and
committed for you but it's a little
strange if you're used to writing
databases and you look at that and go
wait a minute I didn't commit this you
know browser did it for you it's a
little too clever getting the local
event data is really simple open the
database create a transaction get called
the object store called get all no
transaction required here no transaction
required oh yeah creating transaction
read-only get everything call get all
you don't need to close the database or
anything else here because it will auto
closed for you on the next correct time
for the idle loop okay at lab breaks
times 5 6 &amp;amp; 7
just keep working for a while
now that everybody has one network
connectivity everywhere so it might be
you get into a cab and you get Wi-Fi or
you might walk into a train station to
get Wi-Fi but you want to do some work
before that have it saved and have it
sent to the server when you have a
network connection so here's how you do
it it's actually very simple you use
work box you have to create what's
called a queue plugin so work box will
automatically run a series of plugins
every time the network comes up to
synchronize with the database it'll even
track the synchronization of your
objects so all you have to do is say to
work box here's where my data is stored
and here's what has to go so in this
case we're going to write a callback
replay did succeed is an event that is a
callback that's called when we've
actually sent an object to the server
successfully so it gets a hash code and
the response and in this case we're just
going to go ahead and post a
notification we don't go through all the
details of background sync here on the
screen we do have them in the lab notes
and in the work box documentation but
this has made life so much easier this
used to take an hour to explain how to
do it now we say write the queue plug-in
so in this case what we're going to do
is we're going to say API add is where
so all of our data is going to go to
this endpoint so it's going to go to
whatever our URL is slushee API slash
out on the server so it's network only
we say here's the plug-in you should use
and you should use post to send the data
and then you just tell which database
it's coming from so those are optional
steps eight nine ten and eleven if you
get through step seven you're great if
you want to experiment at the background
sync you can do the rest of the steps
and I'm going to go ahead and
just comment what I said earlier which
is an easier way to do it nowadays this
cloud fire store because they built all
of this into fire store for you so again
