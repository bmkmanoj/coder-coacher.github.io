developer programs engineer at Google
and I will be talking to you about
writing battery efficient Android apps
that use location so a location-based
apps are absolutely everywhere
transportation apps geo apps navigation
apps fitness apps weather apps even
dating apps all use locations and yet we
have the sad spectacle that all too
often users simply turn off location on
their devices which means a lot of these
apps either don't work at all or they
work in a degraded manner and why do
users do this because fairly or not they
associate location with battery drain
and they think turning off location is
going to help preserve battery so this
is bad for developers who write all
these great apps it's bad for Android as
an ecosystem and of course it's terrible
for users so location is used a lot we
know that and the location API is
currently allow application developers
to request location at virtually any
time and make pretty aggressive location
requests with no barriers and when your
app is in the foreground when you have
an activity that you can see and it's
going to be only a short time it kind of
doesn't matter too much what you're
doing but when you go off in the
background well that's another story
completely background location has been
identified by us as a major contributor
to battery drain and power issues an
aggressive use of background location is
a major reason why people disable
location on their devices so in a
response to this and this has been a
persistent problem for many years now in
a response to this the Android team
starting with Android Oh for
place some fairly substantial limits on
the gathering of background location
basically the sort of TL DR is that apps
that are running on all devices have
background location gathering throttled
so it's basically location is made
available a few times an hour and that's
it and this applies to everything
running on O devices regardless of the
target SDK version and towards the end
of the talk I'll try to get into sort of
the nitty gritties of what this is this
really means but for now that's
basically it you just cannot go crazy in
the background and do whatever you want
there are some limits in place now what
about 300
the majority of devices that are out
there in the world are running Android N
or lower what about those devices and
for the foreseeable future that is going
to be the case this talk is
fundamentally about identifying best
practices that you could use now in your
Android apps when you write for when you
use location so that you're writing your
apps in a battery efficient manner all
right so let's let's dive into this I'm
gonna start off this exploration by
talking about location api's after that
we'll talk a little bit about sort of
what is the exact relationship between
location and battery drain battery loss
and then I'll sort of dive into common
use cases that every developer has to
address when they are adding location
apps and see if we can come up with some
best practices that you can all use in
your apps and we'll sort of end with a
discussion of the limits that have been
put in Android oh and we'll get into
some details on that okay so for
historical reasons there are two ways in
which you can get location when using
Android apps this framework location and
there is fused location so framework
location is the older one it's been
there since the beginning and it's
basically Android dot location dot
location manager and that gives you
kind of a wide API surface whereby you
as app developers can decide hey I want
to use GPS I want to use Wi-Fi I want to
use ell I want to use some sensor and
you can essentially get location as you
see fit this type of location is not
optimized for battery and we discourage
you to using this what we would like to
use instead is fused location provider
so this is available through GMS core
it's instead of android dot location you
have android dot GMs dot location and
fused location provider provides
actually a much narrower api surface and
it sits on top of platform components
and hardware components and the way this
works is you tell fused location
provider what kind of location you want
force location find location how
frequently you want it etc etc and it
sort of just figures out what underlying
technology is to do to use and how to do
this in the most battery efficient way
this location provider is highly
optimized for battery and we would like
you to use this so what is fused
location so there's a bunch of inputs
that go into fuse location I'll take a
couple of minutes and talk about those
there's GPS Wi-Fi cell accelerometer
gyroscope magnetometer and a host of
others but these are the big ones and I
want to talk about a few of these purely
in terms of what they mean for battery
usage so start with GPS GPS works great
outside it has some trouble with cities
with tall buildings but in clear skies
it works fantastically super accurate
location it's also really really
terrible for battery
so that's your trade-off fantastic
location great accuracy and really bad
for battery then you got Wi-Fi and the
coverage for Wi-Fi as you can imagine is
mostly indoors the accuracy is pretty
good you can tell using just Wi-Fi where
a person is in a building in what floor
they're on and the power consumption is
not as bad as it as it is for GPS but
Wi-Fi scans are still
fairly expensive so it's not free it
does cost something
and then there's sell of course this is
available indoors and outdoors it's
available almost everywhere the accuracy
unfortunately with cell is not so great
you're not going to get a location which
is accurate to within a few feet you're
going to get location which is accurate
to sort of a neighborhood level or a
city block etc but it's great for power
consumption it basically uses very very
little power so it's fantastic for that
and then you have these sensors which
play an extremely important role in
making fuse location provider do the
right thing and do the right thing for
battery so you have accelerometer which
measures changes in velocity and changes
in position you have the gyroscope which
measures changes in orientation of your
device and you have the magnetometer
which allows your device to be used as a
compass and this kind of varies a little
bit by hardware but by and large most of
these sensors have very very little
battery cost and fuse location provider
will use these sensors in conjunction
with GPS Wi-Fi etc to give you really
really good location as best as it can
with very minimal battery usage so for
instance if you were to request find
location location that is accurate to
within a few feet a few meters you would
use a few location would use GPS and
Wi-Fi but GPS and Wi-Fi while they work
very well work much better when you
combine them with sensors so for
instance I mentioned GPS is a little bit
jumpy when you are in environments with
tall buildings we imagine Hong Kong
Mumbai New York City where I live San
Francisco there those are challenging
environments with GPS so when GPS gets a
little flaky fuse location instead of
making expensive GPS scans will say oh
let me see what the sensor data tells me
what is the accelerometer telling me
about what the device is doing and it's
sort of pieces together a pretty good
sense of what it is that's
happening same with Wi-Fi Wi-Fi can be a
bit jumpy when it gets jumpy fused
location provider will not do excessive
Wi-Fi scans instead it will start
looking at the sensor data and try to
get a good sense of what the device
might be doing indoor maps sort of work
like that you know there was a time when
Google Maps would give you if you went
to a shopping mall it would say hey
you're in this shopping mall now it's
much better now it says you're in this
shopping mall and you're right here in
this shopping mall on the third floor
right it'll do things like that and a
lot of that is driven by sensors I mean
if you if if location was had to be
pulled constantly if the Wi-Fi scans had
to be constantly done that would be
terrible for battery but it doesn't have
to do that because once it gets a Wi-Fi
fixed it can then look at the sensor
data and figure out in a battery
efficient way what to do and where you
are are you turning are you moving etc
so that's that's basically what it is so
the sort of the summary of this is where
possible given a choice between frame
work location and fuse location you
should always use fuse location this is
our recommendation switching to fuse
location if you are currently using
frame work location in your apps is
probably the single best thing you can
do in terms of battery performance of
your apps when it comes to location so
please do this Hey so that's where ap is
are in terms of location gathering
there's one higher-level API that is
exposed
that's a geofencing API and that should
be sort of an important tool for any one
building location apps so what is
geofencing geofencing is a case where
you can take you can define a circular
region somewhere and you can say hey
whenever the device either enters this
region or leaves this region or sits in
this region for a certain number of
hours do something let me know and
that's basically how geofencing works
geofencing is built on top of fuse
location and it is highly optimized for
battery so the basically the way it
works is the API
it monitors device proximity to a
geofence the closer you are to the
geofence the more expensive it is and it
basically figures out what is your speed
are you in a car are you walking how far
are you from the geofence and it sort of
optimizes for battery in terms of
monitoring the geofence in the
background we'll talk more about
geofencing later all right so we've
talked a little bit about api's and I've
given you a little introduction to fuse
location provider now I'm going to talk
about sort of what is the underst what
is the relationship between battery
drain and location instead of a concrete
way I mentioned that with fused location
provider you have to essentially just
tell fused location provider what you
want you make a location request and it
sort of does the right thing and it
didn't right thing in a battery
efficient way so essentially what this
section is going to be in my talk is
going to be about what is a good
location request how do you tell fused
location provider what it should do so I
would say battery can be measured on
three points the discussion can be
anchored on these three points accuracy
frequency and latency and I'll talk
about all of these in quite well of
detail so accuracy is of course how
accurate is your location
how fine do you want it to be and so way
the way this works is that you can take
the location request object that you
create and define a priority and there's
a bunch of priorities that you can
choose from and depending on what you
choose few location will use different
technologies under the hood and give you
what you want so the most accurate you
know the state-of-the-art is priority
high accuracy so this will use GPS if
it's available and every time there is a
trade-off between accuracy and battery
battery will lose and accuracy will win
it's going to give you the most accurate
location it knows how to do
this is a good kind of a use case for
foreground when you have short-lived
activity that's in the foreground or
something this is a terrible idea for
background because it's going to be very
prohibitively expensive in terms of
battery relating to that is another
option which is priority balance power
accuracy this will very rarely use GPS
when it has GPS matching but mostly it
will not and it would rely on Wi-Fi so
it's somewhat less accurate but it's
actually much better in terms of battery
and I would recommend for you with your
riding location apps consider this as
something of a default it does give you
pretty good location without burning out
your battery the next level down is
priority low power and this is going to
be hitting cell network it's not going
to be using a lot of Wi-Fi it will not
use GPS and this will give you course
location so you're going to not be able
to say oh I'm a few feet here I'm a few
feet there but you will be able to say I
am in this part of Bangalore versus that
part of Bangalore so depending on your
use case this may be all you need in
which case you should never request more
expensive location updates than this and
the most interesting of all is a
priority no power which is saying give
me location updates but do not spend any
power so how does this map better magic
work in this case what you're saying to
fuse location provider is don't
calculate any location for me but if
another app running on this device is
computing location let me know those
results so that's what that priority no
power means and it's actually an
incredibly good tool to have if you're
writing location apps because it doesn't
cost your app anything so that's where
accuracy is okay let's talk about
frequency now again it's fairly simple
to understand what this means the more
frequent your update your location
consumption the more expensive it is for
battery but it's actually kind of a
little bit more than that
so frequency is used is defined by an
method called set interval and whatever
value you pass to set interval location
services is going to try to honor that
value if you say give me location
updates every two minutes it's gonna try
to do that if you say give me updates
every 15 seconds it will try to do that
generally speaking apps should pass the
largest possible value when using set
interval especially background apps
using intervals of a few seconds 15
seconds 30 seconds is really something
you should reserve for foreground use
cases location services will sort of
just do what you ask it to do it's up to
you to choose wisely now if you say
location updates set interval for two
minutes
there is a little sort of a caveat there
which is that's just a suggestion your
location updates may be a little slower
or a little faster and the way they can
happen a little faster is if another app
is requesting location at a faster rate
that will be brought to your app as well
because these this location data is
shared between apps so for that reason
we have another method that we could
call when building our location request
which is set fastest interval so what
you're saying is set interval says give
me location this many seconds or minutes
set fastest interval says give me
location even if it's coming from
another app no faster than what I'm
specifying here so here's here's a
little example so you create a location
request object and you set it interval
to be five minutes so at this point
every five minutes your app is going to
have location computed for it
but if you also set a fastest interval
which is in this case one minute any app
running out there that is requesting
location also that location will be made
available to you but no faster than one
minute this is a pretty good way of not
burning the battery yourself you're
relying on other applications to do the
and you get the location kind of for
free that they are doing it it's a
passive way of getting location and it's
a pretty powerful way of conserving
battery all right so that's frequency so
latency is really about when location
services has location to give you how
quickly do you need it how quickly do
you want location updates to be given to
you so we remember we talked about set
interval when you set interval of 30
seconds or two minutes
that's what location Services is going
to try to use as a as a as this the
interval width at which it gives you
location but there is also a method
called set max wait time which is a way
of having your location delivered in
batches after a few times that it's been
computed so let's go back set interval
is about how often is location computed
for you set max wait time is how often
location is delivered to you so let me
make this concrete with an example again
we create a location request and we set
the interval to five minutes what this
means is location is going to be
computed for you every five minutes and
if in that time when location is found
that a new location is fine and your app
will be woken up and that location will
be given to your app but if you set a
max wait time of one hour which is what
I've done here something different will
happen your location will still be
computed every five minutes but it will
be delivered to you in a batch every
hour and you will get 12 location data
points at least in theory so what this
means is instead of being woken up every
five minutes your app's going to be
woken up every hour which is
dramatically better for location concern
for battery consumption so batching is a
really really really good thing to use
especially for background cases where
you don't want your device to get woken
up a lot
okay and if you're using geofencing the
equivalent is set notification
responsiveness geofencing scans happen
every now and then if you don't need
your geofencing to be immediate you can
maybe have a little window to hold off
before a geofencing result is given to
your app you can set the responsiveness
period to something high and that is
also a very good thing for battering so
here's a classic case of how you build a
geofence you set a circular region you
set when it expires you set what kind of
transitions you want and you build it
but if to that you add a set
notification responsiveness and give it
a sufficiently large value that's going
to make your geofencing all the more
battery efficient so that's that's a
bunch of stuff to summarize it's a
fairly obviously the more frequent the
more accurate your updates and the lower
your latency the more expensive it is
for battery so in foreground news cases
you can have it all you can be frequent
you can be as accurate as you want you
can have as low latency as you want but
for everything else you're gonna have to
trade off on one of these or more than
one of these and that's where you get to
preserve battery okay so that's a lot of
looking at API is looking at API calls
you're probably wondering okay I have
practical problems to solve what's the
best way to solve so let's start with an
obvious one you want to know the
location of a device for example you're
a weather app you want to show the right
weather you need to know where the phone
is so here I would say you don't get
location updates use cached location
because every time location is obtained
for your device it is cached somewhere
and you can simply request that by using
a get last location method and this will
pretty much give you what you need in a
lot of cases
and the API also exposes ways of knowing
how steel this is or how fresh it is so
if this is not null and it doesn't look
to scale to you use it you don't need to
request location updates at all you save
a ton of battery that way all right
another use case you have user visible
foreground updates for example a mapping
app of some kind so here because it is
foreground it's okay to use high
accuracy high frequency and low latency
it's expensive but it's okay because in
the foreground this is pretty much tied
to your activities lifecycle and it will
end soon so typically what you would do
it in an activity you would inside the
onstart you would request location
updates and but you will also must do
the following which is that in unstop
you remove those location updates if you
don't remove those location updates
location gathering will keep happening
long after your activity is there which
is obviously a very very bad thing to do
ok another use case you want to start
location updates at a specific location
you want to start location updates when
you're near home when you're near work
near a cricket stadium whatever so here
it's a pretty good case of mixing
geofencing and location updates so
typically what will happen is imagine
you have defined a geofence around some
area of interest if a user enters or
exits a geofence location services will
let you know and at that point you can
say ah this is the trigger I was waiting
for I'm going to now request location
updates a common pattern for this is the
geofence gets triggered you get notified
you maybe show the user a notification
the user taps in the notification your
app opens up to some activity and at
that point location updates begin
something like that another common use
case where you want location updates but
you only want them tied to a specific
user pivoting maybe when the user is
riding a bike or driving in a car so
here we would use the
recognition API and we would then have
combined that with location updates it
would sort of work like the previous
example location sir let's say you were
tracking bicycling location services
would tell you when the user is likely
to be in a bicycle and you can take that
and then start location updates through
the same mechanism I talked about
started notification user taps in a
notification something comes into the
foreground and boom off you go
location updates so things can get
fairly complex you may be satisfied with
these sort of simple scenarios I have
mentioned but what if you want
geofencing and you want activity
recognition all of them to happen at the
same time and then sort of somehow
combine that with location updates we
realize that there are complex use cases
so for that reason we have an exposed
and awareness API and this is very
powerful way
so it basically senses and infers your
context and it manages system health for
you and it does so in a battery
efficient manner
if you're dealing with complex scenarios
awareness API may be exactly what you're
looking for so it tracks lots of things
what time of day is it what is the
location of the device what are the
places nearby are there coffee shops
nearby are there stadiums nearby houses
a worship what is the activity of the
other devices a person on a bike is it a
person on a car
are there beacons nearby it's a person
wearing headphones what's the weather
like and what you can do is take all of
these contexts and treat sort of a much
larger sense of offense basically you
can easily react to changes in multiple
aspects of a user's context and this
generalizes the idea of offense well
beyond conventional geo fences which of
course are just for location so here's
an example so you create a context fence
and it tracks three things you create an
activity fence which says tracked that
the user is driving it creates a
location fence and says track that this
geo fence may be a stadium geo fence or
something like that is being tracked and
then our time geo fans make sure it's
this time between this time and this
time when all of these things are true
your and your app is let's say even in
the background location services will
say uh all the conditions you specified
are true I'm letting you know you can
now do whatever and that whatever could
include location updates similarly there
is a snapshot API that is made possible
through awareness and again it's a
simple way to ask for multiple aspects
of a user's context from a city again an
example you find out what the current
places you find out what the current
activity is if the current place is a
shopping mall and the activity is
walking hey maybe it's time for you to
start location updates so that you can
tell the user as a user walks what the
stores are nearby or maybe some
discounts that you can offer excetera
etcetera etcetera the thing is your
multiple you're using multiple sense
multiple inputs and multiple contexts
and that can get pretty expensive for
battery because you're going to be
running a lot of different things if you
use awareness API you can minimize the
battery car costs because awareness API
is are actually pretty battery optimized
alright one more use case that I don't
want to spend at least a couple of
minutes on which is long running
background updates tied to specific
locations you want to find all the
Starbucks in Bangalore you want to find
all the ATMs all the metro stops in
every metropolitan area so here we get
into a solution that involves and a
makgeoli says location services makes a
requirement that you can only
100 geofences at one time there are of
course many more ATMs many more
Starbucks than just a hundred and also
maintaining 100 geofences
is actually pretty expensive that's a
lot of scanning that the location
services will have to do and that's
going to drain your battery so the
solution is dynamic geofences maybe put
a geofence around the city and when that
person enters when the device enters
that city dynamically registered
geofences in locations inside that city
so you have the outer geofences
dynamically you put energy offenses if
the person leaves the city you can
remove those dynamic energy offenses
that are inside because you don't need
them anymore and this is a way you can
actually in a very battery efficient way
get a lot of geofences get around 100g
offense limit and actually do really
pretty amazing things and now the the
problematic one you want long running
background updates with no visible app
component so basically think of an app
that passively tracks your location for
hours or days at a time so this is a
case that gives that keeps people up
this is the case that is inherently
problematic and this is a case where you
get into that problem that I initially
refer to that background location
gathering is a really really major drain
on battery but if you have to do it how
do you do it so let's talk about that
you could run a long-running service of
some kind and then request location
updates every now and then the problem
with that is if you plan to run your app
on an old device you can't have these
kind of long-running services in the
background anymore so this isn't really
anymore a good option for you the API
exposes a method for getting location
updates using a pending intent and
that's exactly what you should do
so you request location updates you give
it a location request you give it a
pending intent and GMs core location
services will wake up your app when an
update is found
so in cases like this what should the
location request look like like what are
you gonna do in the background that
doesn't burn battery so you use moderate
accuracy low frequency and high latency
let's just look at three of those things
right now you do not want accuracy which
is priority high accuracy for any
background use cases this is bad for
battery for frequency I think a good
pattern would be to request updates a
few times an hour
let's say every 15 minutes which is what
I have in this slide and certainly you
should try to get more update through
passive location gathering so that's why
it's a good idea to set fastest interval
to some small amount this way if others
are gathering location you get that
location for free doesn't cost you
anything and latency this is really
really really important again imagine
that you set your interval to 15-minute
sorry imagine if you set your interval
for 15 minutes if you set the max wait
time to 1 hour you will get location
updates every hour but you'll get 4
updates which are calculated every 15
minutes at a time that's pretty good for
background and that that will save
battery - and finally a very important
use case that I'm sure all of you have
dealt with what if you want frequent
updates while our user interacts with
other apps so imagine a fitness app or a
navigation app so in this kind of a case
you should use a foreground service this
is sort of the recommendation that we're
coming up with because we believe that
when potentially expensive work is being
done on behalf of the user that user
should be aware of the work a foreground
service as you know requires a
persistent notification the user will be
able to see ah stuff is being done for
me I like it I approve of this or
they'll say I don't like it and they'll
get rid of that but either way the user
is not having their battery burned in
some silent sinister
okay so I'm slightly over time and I'm
going to quickly go over location limits
so you can see that these location
limits are kind of a logical extension
of many of the best practices that we've
talked about in this talk so far so I
think starting with all the location
story in Android gets fantastic and it
gets fantastic because we throttle back
around location in a sensible way and
this happens on any app that's running
on an O device so the short of this is
the background apps can receive location
several times an hour and that's it your
location request may be something much
more ambitious than that but you're not
going to get that you're going to get
several times an hour
and this happens regardless of target
SDK version you can do batching but
again you will only get location several
times an hour not much more frequently
than that also Wi-Fi scans are much more
efficient in oh we figured that people
spend a lot of time at home 6 8 10 12 15
hours at a time and a lot of time at
work 6 8 10 hopefully not much more than
that
but either way you are inside a place
you connected to a Wi-Fi access point
and you're not moving so in Android all
scanning for Wi-Fi is much more
efficient there's also much smarter
geofencing in o so until o in N and lore
scans for geofencing default to every
few seconds in Android all it happens
every couple of minutes and we found
that in a lot of devices that can give
us 10x savings in terms of battery so
that's really great pre o devices where
there are no limits location is a very
busy thing even on a device that's
actually in the background not being
used in all with these location limits
in place things are much more serene
things are much more organized and your
battery of some consumption is much much
less I'm out of time I've actually gone
over by three or four minutes but I
would say
I hope you right location apps I hope
you right location apps that are
ambitious and I hope you take away from
this talk that it's possible to do that
and not sacrifice battery go ahead
goat it out thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
