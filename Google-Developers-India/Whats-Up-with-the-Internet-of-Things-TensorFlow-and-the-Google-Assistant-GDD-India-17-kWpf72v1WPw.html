is about what's up with the Internet of
Things tensorflow and the Google
assistant so I hope you're all excited
to see this so my name is Wayne
Piekarski and I'm a developer advocate
at Google and my job is to talk to
developers like you about all the cool
things that we're doing in this area so
this is a really new area with lots of
exciting possibilities and I really
think you're going to get a lot out of
this so there's a lot of different
things that we're talking about but
we're going to talk about a concept
today called ubiquitous computing and
computing is going to change and it's
gonna be all kinds of new and
interesting things that you're going to
be able to build and so I want to bring
you up to speed with everything that
Google's doing in this area and what you
can use to do your awesome projects and
so forth so let's get started so
computing has evolved over the years so
we started from mainframes we're into
desktops go into laptops and into phones
and every decade computers have gotten
smaller and smaller but clearly we can't
keep making them smaller forever
because then you wouldn't be able to
hold it in your hands if you had a
computer the size of a coin you couldn't
touch it or interact with it whatever so
there's clearly a limit to how small we
can make things go now over time what
has happened is that we've also moved
into different kinds of devices so most
people nowadays have a phone but we also
have computing devices in cars and on
TVs and on Android wear devices so
computers have gotten smaller form
factors like this but we're now using
them in different ways we're not using a
keyboard or a mouse like we would do
before so we use different devices
depending on what we're trying to do so
for example if you want to write an
email a laptops the best place to do
that if you want to watch videos you
should use a TV if you want to use
something while you're out and about use
a phone and then use a wearable while
you're walking or when you're not
sitting down so each of these devices
has a specific purpose and we use them
for those specific tasks we don't want
to use a watch to try to write an email
that just doesn't make any sense we're
now moving into a world now where
computing is going to disappear but it's
going to disappear in all our different
devices that we have so we're gonna have
thermostats and light bulbs that have
computers inside them and we're moving
to a world where computing is going to
be everywhere you're not going to have a
device to do something you're going to
just use computing everywhere you go and
we're gonna solve problems for people
that we didn't even know existed and
we're gonna look back on this and go wow
that was incredible when this certain
device came out and today I'm going to
enable you to build that really cool
device so I had someone ask me today
they're like ah you know this IOT thing
isn't going to go very far right I
predict it's going to be even crazier
than anything we've ever seen before
you know we sold hundreds of millions of
personal computers and then we sold
billions of smartphones and in the
future I think what's going to happen is
you're not just gonna have a couple IOT
devices you're going to have 20 or 30 or
50 devices and so you're going to have
this explosive growth in computing and
this is where your devices are going to
be and so we use the term ubiquitous
computing to describe where computers
every computing is everywhere it's
accessible wherever they are and
whatever they're doing and so today
we're going to talk about the platforms
that Google provides to enable you to
participate in this because IOT is going
to be bigger than anything you've seen
before so if your thoughts phones were
big this is the next thing so let's talk
about the kinds of things that Google
can offer you to help build your new
products so in the past we trained users
to install apps on their devices
you had one app for each kind of task
and you had an icon that you launched it
with and so forth but now we have
devices that don't even have screens so
we need to think differently about
computing we need to think about what it
means we need to think about the users
context what they're doing the time the
location and their physical activity and
that determines how we're going to go
about interacting with them and what
kind of computing they can do you need
to think of your app no longer as an app
but think of it as a view into a service
and your service is going to be
everywhere see your services of our
and wearables in the living room and a
car it's gonna be everywhere and that's
how you need to think about it you need
to have a seamless experience you don't
want to have to have the user use the
app and login on each platform you want
to make it really easy so that they can
get started without having to think
about the fact that there's different
devices so what do we have to offer you
that you can use to help make these
kinds of devices to support ubiquitous
computing firstly let's summarize what
we have as consumer platforms and we're
going to start off with talking about
Android devices so many of you here are
Android developers because it's GDD
India and we have many different Android
devices that you've probably seen before
so we have Android phones we have
Android tablets which are very common
and then Android wear and Android TV and
Android auto have also come out as new
experiences new platforms for people to
do Android on different kinds of devices
now the cool thing about all of these
platforms is that they're still based on
Android studio you write apks and you
can do all kinds of things you can write
apps games sensor processing you can do
3d graphics you can do audio and many of
you write apps for some of these
platforms already and the good news is
that if you're an Android phone or a
tablet developer you already know how to
write for Android wear or Android TV
it's literally the same thing they all
support networking they all support
Google Play and it's very easy to pull
it so if you've ever thought you know
what other platforms kind of get into
writing an Android wear or an Android TV
app is something that you might want to
consider Android auto is a little
different because you don't write apps
that run directly on the screen what you
do is you write templates for either
messaging or media apps and these run on
your phone and the way Android auto
works is your phone plugs in to the head
unit in the car and it projects the
video and the audio alternatively you
can run Android auto on your phone and
mount the phone on the dash of the car
so the nicely Mandarin audio is it
provides a simplified user experience to
allow people to listen to music and do
messaging while they're driving so we've
got lots of different form factors to
cover all of the different things that
your users might be doing and
two of them are appropriate at different
times while on the go or in your home in
the living room you also may have heard
about the Google assistant and so the
Google assistant and the Google home
devices are new ways of interacting with
customers as well and so each of these
platforms here are extended by the
Google assistant so we started off with
Google home devices but now you can use
the Google assistant on a phone you can
also use it on different platforms such
as Android TVs Google pixel books it's
coming soon to where an auto and it's
great because it's everywhere and users
can just talk to it or type to it to get
things done by talking with the Google
assistant so if you haven't tried it
before you definitely want to check out
the Google assistant to see how it feels
and you can have really awesome
conversations with it and it feels
really natural it's not like talking to
a robot and it's a very compelling
experience that makes really nice
conversations so as I said the Google
assistant works with both text and voice
based inputs and it has text and voice
base outputs and it works with the user
whatever they're doing and whatever
they're doing as well and the good news
is that we've launched the Google
assistant in all kinds of countries and
locales all around the world and
recently a couple weeks ago we launched
the Google assistant in India for
English languages and these are all the
different languages that we support so
you can see we've got a bunch of them
covered and we're always launching new
languages so more are coming soon so
stay tuned if you're interested in other
languages and so the nice thing is that
we have coverage for lots of different
users all around the world so those are
examples of the consumer platforms that
Google provides that consumers have in
their homes or in their cars or when
they're walking around so now we're
going to talk about what you as a
developer can use to participate in
these ecosystems to provide services and
interact allow users to interact with
your app because there are a bunch of
new options you're going to find
interesting and let's go through them so
the first thing is that at the end of
last year we announced Developer Preview
for Android things and Android things is
now Google's new platform to
support developers who want to build
their own IOT devices and one of the
coolest things about Android things is
it's based around this concept of a Sun
which is this board here so the board's
about two by two centimeters and it
contains the CPU the wireless chip
memory and all the important things that
makes a device do what it does and it's
on a common board with a common set of
software and you can buy these Psalms in
bulk and cheaply and you can plug them
into your own custom boards that are
manufactured really cheaply and the sump
contains all of the expensive harder
designed components and then you can
build a small board around it that has
your electronics for your application
and so we really want to try to
democratize hardware development to make
it really easy because in the past
hardware development has been limited to
big companies with large budgets but
with Android things you as an Android
developer who's experienced with Android
and all the tooling can now develop for
IOT as well and you can make your own
hardware and participate in the IOT
ecosystem that we mentioned is going to
be the next big thing so you start off
with a developer board so you can see at
the top we have a developer board there
and the salm plugs into it you take the
somme away and you've got this developer
board that breaks out all the different
connectors so it has things like USB
audio GPIO pins ice tutsi buses and so
forth you build your prototypes with
these boards so you plug things in test
it out and then when you're done you
then make your own custom board that
plugs into the salm and it allows you to
make things that are really tiny but you
can prototype on something bigger as
well and so my colleague Dave Smith he
actually built his own small little LED
candle it's kind of a basic example of
the simplest thing you could build with
Android things the code for it's on
github so check it out if you're
interested and basically he prototypes
it on the board on the left and on the
right you can see he manufactured his
own custom printed circuit board that
shows you how tiny you can make an IOT
device so it's literally this big and
it's everything it's got Wi-Fi Bluetooth
it can blink some lights it does Oh TA
updates and it's fully self-contained
and it's really easy to work with and
you can develop
Android studio so that is the really
cool thing about Android things is it
allows you to make your own custom IOT
devices and you don't need to have a
huge budget to do it and this is
something you can do yourself and all
the schematics and source code for this
are available online as well so what
makes Android things awesome is it's
based on the power of Android so you use
all of the existing Android API s that
you're familiar with and it's a variant
of Android just like where TV or auto so
it's supported by the Android ecosystem
and the Android team at Google and you
can use Android studio to write your
code use all the same libraries and
api's everything's included it's also a
real Android device so it includes
Google Play services designed for IOT
devices so it's a minimized version that
runs and it has everything that you've
used from Google Play services before as
I said before Androids to Android things
is based on a some architecture so the
modules are standardized and Google
supports them with what is called a
common boards support language a board
Support Package or B SP and this BSP is
provided by Google and it's supported by
us and we provide the Linux kernels we
port them over we maintain them and we
also provide all the necessary security
updates as well so our team at Google
that maintains the security updates for
Android phones we also provide the same
updates for Android things devices and
so when a security update needs to be
pushed out Google has the ability to
push them out to these IOT devices so
that you don't have to worry about that
yourself so you can focus on what makes
your IOT application great and Google
handles all the security updates and
drivers and all that kind of stuff like
that and we provide and over the update
mechanism that supports pushing the
updates so you don't have to write this
yourself if any of you have developed
IOT devices before you'll know that you
have to do your own kernels you have to
build your an OTA infrastructure and
this stuff is very time-consuming and
very expensive so it's something you
don't have to worry about so we see many
things that you can do with Android
things and a lot of people ask me Wayne
why should I use Android things compared
to a small microcontroller or something
like that
now microcontrollers are cool
because they're cheap and they do simple
things like turn on and off lights or
you know control a dial or something
like that but what you can't do with a
microcontroller is really powerful
things like computer vision audio
processing and machine learning these
are things that you can't do on a small
microcontroller but it's something that
you can do on an Android things device
and over time as computing gets cheaper
and cheaper as it always does
IOT devices are going to get so cheap
that it's going to be possible to do
machine learning and tensorflow and all
these things on super cheap devices in
the same way that we use
microcontrollers now and so one of these
great examples that we've put together
is running tensorflow on android things
and so the same tensorflow talks that
you've seen at this event and at Google
i/o previously all of those things you
can run on Android things devices as
well because we're just an Android
platform as well so we have a sample
here that it has a camera and it takes
pictures of dogs and you can see in this
example here that when it takes a
picture of my dog it correctly
identifies her breed now this is not
just saying dog or cat this actually
tells you the kind of dog specifically
with a percentage probability and so
tensorflow has this thing called the
Google inception model which is trained
with millions of photos that have been
put through the system and this model is
capable of analyzing images and telling
you what they are we can actually have
this demo actually set up in the sandbox
area you can try it out for yourself and
we also have the code on github so you
can try it out on your Android things or
on your phones as well so it's a very
simple example of how you can use
tensorflow
on an android things device so there's
all kinds of really cool applications
that you could use this for and we look
forward to seeing what you build with
that now we talked about the Google
assistant earlier it's also possible to
extend the Google assistant and you can
write your own apps for the Google
assistant using actions on Google which
is our platform that is for developers
to hook in their own conversations into
the Google assistant and we have a tool
called dialogue flow and dialogue flow
is a very simple to use user interface
towards web-based that you program your
conversations into and it makes it
really easy to make conversations and a
lot of people think well conversate
they're easy just process some strings
but those are only for simple things
like yes or no answers but if you want
to really converse with the computer you
want to have a natural conversation with
it and the Google assistant supports
natural conversations and in a minute
we'll show a video that shows how this
works so these conversations that you
develop they run in the cloud they're
based on like a web hook that you
develop using javascript and they
receive texts that's transcribed from
Google that has the conversation that
was spoken to the action it then gives
it to you you can then decide what the
reply will be and then you send it back
now you can do this yourself you can
process the strings manually but most
developers don't want to do that and so
we have the dialog flow tool that
provides it for you now what we're going
to do is I'm going to show you a little
video that demonstrates sort of a
conversation and what it would sound
like with the user interacting with it
okay Google let me talk to a personal
chef sure here's personal chef hi I'm
your personal chef what are you in the
mood for well it's kind of cold outside
so I'd like something to warm me up like
hot soup and I want it fast all right
what protein would you like to use I
have some chicken and also some canned
tomatoes okay well I think you should
try the chicken tomato soup recipe I
found on example.com sounds good to me
okay so let's look at what we just saw
in that video I was chatting to a Google
assistant then but that was very natural
I wasn't talking like a robot I was just
like yeah I want some chicken soup it's
kind of cold outside so I want something
to warm me up that was a very like very
normal conversation that you'd have with
a person and the sentences I spoke were
quite complicated too if you look at the
sentence I asked for a hot soup because
I wanted to be warmed up because it's
cold outside so I said the words warm
heart and cold all at the same sentence
and somehow the Google assistant was
able to extract the meaning out of that
and get it correctly now if you were
writing
simple regular expressions looking for
the words hot or cold you wouldn't have
got that right because I said too many
different words but it was all about
processing the sentence structure and so
trying to process this yourself is
really hard and so the dialogue flow
tool makes this really easy and the way
it does it is using machine learning so
the dialogue flow tool you type in
example sentences like you can see the
examples there chicken sounds good to me
I'd like a cold dessert you type in
different examples and then it trains a
machine learning model to understand
other sentences that a user might speak
and so we programmed in some examples
like that and then when we made that
video I spoke completely differently and
said different things but it still
understood what I was asking for
and so dialogue flow allows you to
implement these conversational
interfaces really easily the graphical
tool helps you to identify the entities
and that's it so it's definitely a tool
you should check out to learn about how
to build conversations for the Google
assistant because when I saw this tool I
was like wow this makes everything easy
and I don't have to worry about doing
the processing of the conversation
myself so definitely check that out so
with the Google assistant we also had
the ability to embed it into your own
custom devices so we talked about
Android things earlier you can run the
assistant SDK on an Android things
device and you can make your own custom
hardware devices that have the assistant
embedded into them so you could make
like toys or robots or whatever and you
can talk to them using the Google
assistant and dialogue flow and then you
can make them move around and do things
and you don't have to implement the
conversation yourself so once again
really easy and you can embed the
assistant SDK into any of your custom
devices and you may have seen that aiy
projects kit that works with the Google
assistant SDK and basically this kit is
just a speaker a microphone and a button
and then you've got a device and so in
the sandbox area you can see some
examples we have of the Google assistant
SDK running on a device and you can
embed the Google assistant into pretty
much anything so that's lots of
possibilities for people to try
different kinds of ideas and if you look
here this is the inside of what the
assistant Estoque it looks like very
simple and the other cool thing about
this is an SDK is it works on many
different platforms so we've got support
for Android things but we also have
support for just basic Linux machines
and it also works on top of many other
platforms because it's portable and it
uses what's called G RPC so I've seen
people run it on all kinds of platforms
that are not Linux and not Android based
there's a lot of options of what you can
use the Assistant SDK for so that's some
possibilities of different platforms
that we have Android Google assistant
actions on Google Assistant SDK but you
might want to connect these things up
because we mentioned before that it's
important to have an ecosystem of
platforms allow people to use your
service from many different places
depending on what they're doing so now
we're going to talk about connectivity
and how to bring them all together so
the Google assistant supports a new API
that we have called smart home and so
smart home allows device makers so let's
say you're a startup that's making IOT
based light bulbs or thermostats or air
conditioners or something like that
smart home is the API that you would use
to integrate those devices in with yours
with the Google assistant so we have
this concept called a home graph and it
has an API called smart home and you
implement the smart home API on your
service and then whenever the user says
something like dim the lights in the
room or turn the air conditioning up the
Google assistant processes that and it
then sends commands to your service
saying turn the temperature up five
degrees or turn the light bulbs up too
bright or something like that so you
implement the API for your devices and
the assistant can then control them and
so from a user's perspective it's great
because they can have devices made by
many different companies and they can
communicate with all of them at the same
time and the home graph brings them all
together and so it's definitely
something you want to look at if you're
building a ot based devices for common
household tasks and here's sort of a
diagram that shows you how it works you
don't write a full conversation like you
do with dialogue flow because the Google
assistant handles the conversational
part of it you just implement the API
for hooking your device into
our home graph and that's it and then
the user has the ability to speak these
commands and they make their light bulbs
and thermostats and these other things
change state finally many of you have
heard about firebase and you've
hopefully used it before so all the
firebase functionality works in Android
things and so it's nice because you can
use it on Android iOS Android things
devices and you can use firebase to
implement communications between all
these different platforms and firebase
cloud messaging is really important
because it allows you to build push
notifications to your devices so if you
look at badly implemented IOT devices
when someone adjusts the temperature on
their phone of a thermostat it'll take
five minutes sometimes for the
thermostat to adjust but firebase Cloud
messaging implements push notifications
so that those changes take effect
immediately without having to wait and
without having to do inefficient polling
so it's definitely something that you
should be using if you want to sync data
between devices and do it quickly and
efficiently firebase also provides a
real-time database and cloud storage
that you can use to synchronize data
store images and videos and so forth and
it's nice because once again it's
cross-platform but it also works on very
small microcontrollers as well so we
have some samples like for example
github comm firebase fibrous Arduino we
can actually implement firebase on
really really tiny microcontrollers so
not even Android things class devices
but something very small and so it
implements across all those platforms as
well and so definitely firebase is
something you want to check out because
you don't need to implement your own
cloud infrastructure yourself a lot of
developers try to build this stuff
themselves and it takes a lot of time
and it's important that you do it
securely because if you don't do it
securely then someone will hack into
your service and then all your data gets
compromised and so forth so firebase is
nice because it handles all the hard
aspects of what you're trying to build
so that you can focus on building your
application and then at Google i/o this
year we announced what's called Google
Cloud IOT core the cool thing about
Google Cloud IOT core is it's really
designed to scale up to like worldwide
IOT device
for structure most companies know how to
build something for a thousands of
devices or tens of thousands but Google
Cloud IOT core is designed to scale all
around the world and so it's something
that the cloud team themselves put
together and it's designed to scale to
millions of devices it has endpoints all
around the world so that it handles
dealing with traffic coming from
everywhere and you don't need to worry
about provisioning and it adds
redundancy to everything that you've
built as well now it uses standard
protocols like mqtt to get data from
devices and aggregate and store them
into the Google cloud infrastructure and
so it's great for enterprise use and we
have a lot of enterprise customers
who've asked for these kind of features
because they want to roll out millions
of devices and they want to have all the
infrastructure to handle data coming in
from millions of devices constantly all
day every day and trying to build that
yourself is quite tricky and then once
the data is in Google Cloud you can then
use cloud services such as bigquery to
go and query and analyze these massive
data sets to reduce them to something
that you can look at and learn more
about so one of my colleagues Gus class
is here and he's talking about cloud IT
in another session so definitely go
check that out if you want to learn
about building really big cloud IT
infrastructures and what's possible with
their software so that was a very big
whirlwind tour of all of googles
products to support ubiquitous computing
and the Internet of Things so we hope
that it's going to help you to make
really amazing devices that are powerful
and that are also secure because in the
past a lot of companies have built
devices that are not secure and then
consumers have their data stolen and
devices get broken into and it causes
problems for everyone and consumers want
to buy well-made devices they get
updates and that are maintained so they
can trust them and so Google's services
that we provide that I went through
today helped to provide many of the
pieces that you need so you can fit them
together to build the kinds of devices
and infrastructure that people want so
we have a sandbox area over in the main
area outside this building you should
definitely come by and check out some of
the demos that we have we have a variety
of different
things Android SDK and Google assistant
demos that you can try out and see how
they're built and so forth and also many
of my team members have actually come
out to talk to you because we want to
learn more about the kinds of things
that you want to build so while we're
here to teach you about things we also
want to learn more about what kinds of
really cool ideas you've got for things
you want to build and how we can help
enable them and if there's new features
that you want or something definitely
come and talk to me or my colleagues
because we want to hear about what they
are and what kinds of things you want so
what's next we have many different
resources for you to learn more and so
we have a bunch of communities on
Google+ we have one focused on IOT
developers so Android things cloud IOT
different things like that we have an
actions on Google community for
developing for the Google assistant we
then have an assistant SDK community for
people who are embedding the assistant
SDK into their own custom devices and so
these three communities are great places
to ask questions and share ideas also I
do a lot of posting on social media I'm
Google's developer advocate for IOT and
assistant and so forth so definitely
follow me on Twitter or Google+ if you
want to keep up to date with what's
going on I post a lot about the
different tools and new things that
we're doing and so definitely keep up to
date with that so that was a quick
little summary of what Google has to
offer you
and so I want you to take this away and
think about all the different
possibilities of things that we could
make and what kinds of devices that
would help benefit people so think of
people who are less fortunate or might
not be able to use a regular computer
they might have accessibility issues and
you know think about how they could
benefit from more computing in their
lives and what ubiquitous computing
could do to help them perform tasks they
can't currently perform or to help make
their lives better so think about this
and as I said before IOT is going to be
a huge thing it's going to be bigger
than computers and bigger than phones
it's gonna be way bigger than that and
so you definitely want to be a part of
it so come by our sandbox and say hello
and I'm really excited to see what you
build with this thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
