summit in Bangalore so with us we have
mr. Ganesh Neelam and mr. Anil Sinha
from Tata trust so we would like to hear
from you technology is is the key these
days I mean it's the enabler that can
really drive substantial benefits
especially in the rural areas and places
where we work so that's the key reason
why there are Tata trust is involved in
in technology we would like to know what
exactly do debates you we we need to do
what exactly that motivation is so that
we can inspire that saving our
participants and students right my
target was our focus is to make a
sustainable difference and that
sustainable difference can only be seen
when we work with the community directly
and see a change so for example a
smiling face with good level of
education a smiling face with an higher
income or a smiling face with health
services being at their doorsteps
actually encourages you to then keep on
working and it motivates what do you
suggest what should be the app on social
cause big area where apps and technology
can really help is education I'm not
going in but school formal education you
find out that some region nearby there
is a cholera outbreak how do you inform
the rest of the villages and you teach
them what things they have to take care
of so that it doesn't spread you know
those kind of things technology can be a
real enabler and we encourage myself for
example in the Tatras whenever we get
people to work with us we make them go
into the rural areas for a month stay
there we don't actually ask them to do
anything
we take them say in the village you feel
what the the villages are actually
feeling you get up in the morning do all
the chores and then accordingly where
there's a complete new phase of life if
you would yeah it's living there you go
to a rural area you get up in the
morning your phones are 20% and there's
no electricity what are you gonna do
right the whole challenge is different
with changes completely when you
actually go and live there but
that month there you get a completely
different view plus you have an app so I
put it on the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
