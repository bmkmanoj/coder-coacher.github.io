LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Hi, friends.
I have with me Raveesh Bhalla,
who is a Google Developer
Expert for UX.
So, Raveesh, tell us about your
journey to becoming an expert.
RAVEESH BHALLA: So it started
out pretty organically.
I started with a GDG
pretty much right
after I graduated from college.
Shrey, we used to run the GDG in
Delhi when we just started up.
And as soon as I graduated,
I ran it with him
for a couple of years.
The GDE program I just
started a bit afterwards.
And they started inducting
designers back in 2014.
Taylor Ling was
one of the first,
and I joined right after him.
So I was already doing
a lot of community work,
and it just made sense to
join this program as well.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
That's nice.
So what does UX mean to you?
RAVEESH BHALLA: UX, to me,
means literally everything
that a person does
with a product itself.
It means everything that
a person [INAUDIBLE],,
whether it's regarding
a particular product,
regarding the brand
around it itself--
everything regarding
the marketing
and the way that
people communicate
to you from a
marketing perspective,
to ultimately even customer
care and everything--
just a part of every
element of it, actually.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN: OK.
You've been lately spending a
lot of time on user research.
Can you tell us your
take on user research?
RAVEESH BHALLA: So user research
is my belief about this--
and a lot of designers have been
talking a lot more about this
recently-- is the fact that
design needs to be centered
around the users' needs.
And the only way you
can ever really do that
is by actually going
out and speaking
with the people [INAUDIBLE]
you're building for,
seeing their environments,
understanding
the context in which they are
using your product so that you
can build, keeping
that context in mind.
We do this in few
different ways.
So we create personas.
But the ideal way
is, while personas
are great for you to
have inside your offices
to keep you inspired in
that direction, a test
for [INAUDIBLE] users
so that you know,
is your product
having the impact you
want it to have or not itself?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN: Right.
User experience
is something that
is so critical to
every application.
And with teams like
[? SOL ?] for India,
what are your
thoughts or insights
for our audience in this space?
RAVEESH BHALLA: My
key insight would
be that you need to understand
that the Indian user is
very different from
everyone else, right?
A lot of us spend
our time trying
to design products
in a way that's
very inspired by the West.
And we try to think of our
products in that different way.
I very highly recommend
people to think
of the Indian context itself,
the users' context itself.
A great example of it is the
startup called FastFilmz.
I think they're, in fact, part
of a Launchpad program now.
They provide a
service which allows
movie streaming in
Tamil and Telegu
for a very small subscription.
They have designed their entire
navigation around the fact
that people are
big fans of actors.
So the entire idea is like,
OK, can we now-- like,
if people are following
actors, can we make it a case
that if I'm a Madhu fan, I'm
more likely to want to see just
his movies itself, right.
They've understood people
don't use Search that much.
They have difficulty
in putting into Search.
So they've decided, let's
just leave Search and navigate
around this itself.
Probably the most fun
thing that they've done,
actually, is the fact that
when you're playing a movie,
they have these two
buttons in the thing which
allow you to have a [INAUDIBLE]
play during the movie itself,
or have firecrackers
come across the screen,
just to mimic the, like,
experience of being
in a theater.
So that's an example of
taking the context off a very
Indian thing and bringing
it into a [INAUDIBLE] role
itself, right.
So can you figure out ways to
make that work for your users?
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
All right.
So thank you so much,
Raveesh, for taking time off.
RAVEESH BHALLA: Thanks.
LAKSHYA SIVARAMAKRISHNAN:
Fans, that was Raveesh Bhalla.
If you have any comments
or questions for him,
do drop in the Comments
section and we'll
try to get it answered.
You can also tweet to
us at @GoogleDevsIndia.
Thank you.
