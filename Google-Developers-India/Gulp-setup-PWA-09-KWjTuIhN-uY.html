you this is going to be total review but
it's going to be like five minutes for
some of you others it'll be new so when
you're web developer you wind up doing a
lot of work by hand
you know minifying files compacting them
processing images starting and stopping
web servers reloading pages there's a
bunch of stuff you do manually and it
gets really not only boring but
error-prone so the idea is can we
automate some of this and there's a
bunch of automation tools out there one
of the older ones it's called grunt some
of you remember old school make files
right from way back in the day the newer
tools are basically gulp and webpack
gulp is really the popular
general-purpose one so you know if
you're doing any of these things by hand
you really should be using a task runner
like gulp the way it works is let's say
I wanted to do an uglify pass which is
to say minifying my JavaScript and
combining yet I would create a new file
called gulp file dot Jes it's a plain
old JavaScript file I would load the
gulp plug-in notice this require keyword
this is not from standard JavaScript
this is actually something imported from
node this is no it's module system so
we're going to load the gulp module
we're going to load the gulp uglify
module and save these and then each of
these modules exposes a group of
functions so in gulp you define a task
and give it a name pass in a function
you can write this in es6 notation if
you have a preprocessor gulp source
looks up one or more files using a
wildcard pattern it then puts them all
into a stream it basically pipes them to
the next step
pipe so uglify takes all these files
compresses them puts them together
cleans out unused references it
basically tightens up your JavaScript
and
the end you have one or more files to
get piped into the destination very
simple model so source pipe it through
one or more things pipe it to the pipe
it to the output just just like that so
to set it up you need note in NPM which
come together
install the gulp CLI with gulp - CLI
create a project install your node
plugins write a gulp file and then you
can run gulp tasks from the command line
to do the install and pm'n it to grab
your existing plugins and then install
gulp and any other plugins you need
remember to save them as development
tools load any plugins you need in the
gulp file declare tasks by name you can
also see a list here usually of tasks an
array of task names those are
prerequisites testerman first and then
pipe them through the plugins and write
them to the destination and then you can
call tasks by name from the command line
I told you to be 5 minutes or less
very simple right in classes where
everybody's done gulp I just skip this
bit but you need this for the next bit
which is a lab using sw-toolbox and
sw-precache so let me do one more talk
which is this to be toolbox and precache
then will give you a lab and then it'll
be time purity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
