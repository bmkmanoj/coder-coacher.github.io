SPEAKER 1: How have you been?
RAMANKIT SINGH: Good.
SPEAKER 1: And,
here's your baggage.
He's JP.
JP SOUCHAK: Hello, Ramankit.
SPEAKER 1: So he's
the program manager
from Google certification in
all the way from Mountain View.
JP SOUCHAK: You're one of
our first certified associate
Android developers.
I just wanted to ask
you a few questions,
not too long so you
can carry on your day.
But do you mind?
Do you have a few
minutes that we can--
RAMANKIT SINGH:
Yes, yes, I have.
JP SOUCHAK: OK, great.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
JP SOUCHAK: First thing,
I guess, where did you
begin your development career?
How did it start?
RAMANKIT SINGH: In
my college, there
was not much exposure
towards the Android.
Two or three persons
who were there
only were developing
for Android.
So I started learning from
YouTube, watching tutorials.
There's also Google Developer
Channels, Google Android
Developers Channel.
That also teaches you like
basic concepts and other things,
what is happening in Android and
what are the new technologies.
In the meanwhile, I
started participating
in the hackathons.
The first hackathon I attended
was also sponsored by Google.
I also won that.
So it gave me a
biggest enthusiasm
to move forward and
learn new technologies,
and also keep on
developing for Android.
JP SOUCHAK: How important are
your parents in your life?
Were they supportive
of your schooling?
Are they supportive of your
desire to be a developer?
What do they mean
to you in that area?
RAMANKIT SINGH: Yes, yes.
Everyone's parents are
like a role model to them.
They support you.
They motivate you in any manner.
Like, because they
want you to do,
but they were not able to do.
And that is the biggest thing
I love about my parents,
because they never question
me, and they believe in.
JP SOUCHAK: You're
one of the first ones
to get a certification as an
associate Android developer.
I want to know, how did
you find out about it?
RAMANKIT SINGH: So
there was the news,
like, Google is going to
launch the certification
project in India.
So that was a biggest
opportunity to me.
Because I was finding
some kind of thing
that can Google-certify me
as an android developer,
so that I can proudly
say that I am certified
associate android developer.
JP SOUCHAK: It sounds like
you're very determined.
RAMANKIT SINGH:
Yes, I'm determined.
I don't want to
give up anywhere.
JP SOUCHAK: And I admire that.
That's great.
RAMANKIT SINGH:
Thank you so much.
JP SOUCHAK: Thank you
very much for your time.
RAMANKIT SINGH: I'm not
going to forget this moment.
Like, it is a very
big moment for me.
JP SOUCHAK: I'm
very honored to be
here and that you
would take some time
to speak with us today.
RAMANKIT SINGH: We'll
clap for the [INAUDIBLE]..
