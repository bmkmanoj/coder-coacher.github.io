head of marketing for dolphin browser
I'm not a developer so if you want to
ask me any coding questions just forget
about it because I I basically will be
the worst developer that you ever higher
but I actually started my career as a
developer more like PF sequel CC class
with just a long time ago the inclined
server stuff but definitely not no I'm
not the one that you want to hire so at
the same time if you do have specific
questions I love to write down give give
us your car will at least you'll always
get some sort of answers for any
question that you have but just not that
sort of question you can ask on
afterwards Oh Alice ender don't ask me
but having said I think you so much for
coming today particularly is really
about focusing on how once we have an
appt how do you actually acquire users
so the first question I have for
everyone how many of you actually have
and developed an app ok almost everybody
many of us are very passionate about
building a product we just love what
we're building but then at the same time
once you build it you realize well wait
a minute nobody know about my app I put
all these effort in creating something
that I just love but wait there's only a
few hundred people downloaded and on top
of that ones they downloaded they don't
come back what the hell right so it's
sort of like you build something
something happen and you expect Wow
magically profit but at the same time is
really about especially you know for
Android and iOS developer there's a lot
of interesting intricacy in marketing
and promoting an acquiring users so
today I want to share a little bit of
sort of our story how we got started why
we're doing all this
and some of the strategy and lesson
learned that you know we sort of
accumulate for the past two years or so
and there's definitely a lot of
different techniques and ways of growing
and getting more users and in terms of
strategy is quite different when you
first started versus that now you're in
a growing phase and now we're at a
different stage in terms of things that
we need to do so I will focus a little
bit more on launch because I think most
of most of us here have something with
just one more users so I will focus a
little bit more on that but more than
happy to share any other ideas after the
talks but if you can actually hold off
your questions till the end they'll
probably will be the best all right so
quickly with all this dolphin browser so
we have about 10 million download is one
of the most popular browser on both iOS
and Android we are the world first
gesture webzine and add-on enabled
browser what's that mean I will share
with you guys a little bit later on this
year we also selected as the number one
cnet top 100 most popular Android apps
and we've been very very lucky actually
when we first started for about a year
and a half there's a there's no
marketing doesn't even exist so I'm
actually showing earlier this year which
I'll tell you a little bit like what
what happened since I joined and what
are some of the things that we did
differently but at a very very early on
which I'll touch on that is press having
get the press know about your app it's
definitely very very important but I'll
tell you guys a little bit about how we
sort of position it because it's not
just about pitching it's really about
like the way building the relationship
with with different media all right so I
want to sort of break down our story
into three phases I actually have a tons
of one when I was preparing for this
presentation we found a lot of really
funny looking so this is a tiny little
baby dolphin first and foremost dolphin
why we named often is because to our
founders it is five of them they are
very hardcore engineers to about and
2009 they went to one of the Google
developer events and at a time they were
Android probably about eight months or
so fair fairly new and when we came up
with the idea of dolphin is only about
two or three thousand apps so pretty
pretty early on so we thought wow you
know obviously there is stock browser
that you can find on the phone but we
just felt like there's a lot more things
that we can improve so at the time we
thought well you know if you would just
pick any name which I absolutely think
having a good name is a really important
thing as part of marketing so often why
we picked off and obviously is really
cute but also to go along with browser
right you want it to be really fast so
dolphin swim really fast it's very smart
and more importantly because it's so
smart it learned a way that you want to
browse which which will explain we have
webzine we have add on once you sort of
install certain add-on is customized
browsing experience it's sort of like
dolphin it's sort of learned the way you
born the Browse does that's how we came
up with a name but really early on when
we first started it wasn't like oh great
we put this thing on the market and all
sudden there's millions of people no
there was nobody and in fact for
probably the first two first one or two
months we're like what happened but what
we did a lot was we really took time to
especially like our team here this joy
sitting over there she's in charge of
customer service every day like right
now we have two to three hundred email
every day and every single one of these
email we answer so very very early on a
lot of more technical community find out
about us and you know being technical
obviously sort of the same developer to
developer we get a lot of critical
critical comment but very early on we
really take our time and answer every
single one of them and go back to the
early adopters and say hey you know we
fix this so when when we first started
we still do it now is answer every
single email and a lot of time when we
early on we actually did a lot of public
beta so once we did an update we didn't
really
go to press first and say hey discover
our coo app and said we go to the users
and say hey now you know whatever that
you asked for is fixed please help us
give us feedback and test it so we did a
lot of them almost every every week
every two weeks we have a new release
and we go back to them say hey you know
now there's another release so we have a
lot of core core users that felt like
they are building the product with us
and that was very very important early
on then we got in about six months in or
so I know you guys probably seen it so
many times I love to use his starbucks
analogy which is well you want people
pay four bucks to buy starbucks coffee
if they can go to mcdonald's or dunkin
donuts and you'll pay a buck right so
our whole idea was that about six months
since we realized well we didn't want
our App really really heavy otherwise it
would be really slow so we started
thinking okay what can we do to allow to
dolphin way ray so you can customize the
way so let's say you want browser to
remember your password or you want the
whole browser to translate this page
from English to Chinese on Chinese how
do you do that so we didn't want to make
the feature so heavy within the browser
so we created something called so like
they add on so like like the desktop
they have pluck in for browser we have a
similar thing but for mobile so right
now we have about 70 AD on or so from
password manager to dolphin translate or
music player to like save like a web
page to PDF there's many many of these
add-on to make it as a star book about
starbucks like experience so I
absolutely love every time i go to
starbucks i order nonfat chai latte
that's like my drink and that's only
starbucks can do it that way if i go to
start and donuts they can't do the same
thing so i really have sort of felt like
this is my browser that nobody else can
replace and in fact this whole ad on
strategy will continue to build
so about six months or so between that
way for first couple of months very
little users and then we slowly realized
the early adopter really like us and
especially when we push that add on so
in about six months or so we hit our
first million users so from nothing to
first million and there's a lot of other
thing that we learned from that which i
will share a little bit more later on
then now we're sort of earlier this year
we decided we are fairly strong on
Android now so let's cross over and go
to the iOS I and for us was actually a
quite nervous experience because then it
was once again we start with nothing
like zero like we didn't know we didn't
even know like who are the bloggers that
rise about iOS like we have no idea so
from then on we have a completely
different new strategy in user
acquisition which is we sort of again
ask our user for help but this time is
not from product feedback but instead
with this some social media campaign to
ask them for help to tweet and talk
about us which i will share a little bit
more detail later on so that's sort of
sum up like our story starting from 2009
we launched add on about six months
later and in about probably nine months
about June we r 1 million and one year
later we hit a million and we just
actually announced I think last month
we're hit 10 million this year we also
launched something called webzine so the
idea webzine is basically instead of
mobile view desktop view for most of the
website we actually have something
called webzine view so you can look at
TechCrunch really nicely with one finger
and you can look at each of the article
they sort of trim down version of it but
it actually cached so even though you
have no 3g 4g network or no Wi-Fi is you
can still look at the content which is a
really really slick feature nobody else
is doing it and only the show we also
got really lucky sequoia we became the
first sequoia funded mobile browser
company and and then this should also in
august we
a first partnership with soft bang which
is a case like they like t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T
but for Japan so we did a partnership
there and then we also launched on an
iphone in august and then we were
selected as the most popular Android app
for cnet and also we just got another
award from from cnet for our Apple for
iOS version so with all these is a sort
of like our timeline but really let's go
back to so to sum of their lesson learn
so I actually bring it down to seven
lesson because you know seven highly
effective people so seven is a good
number so we're going to start with that
so first thing first who can tell what
is this phone okay first do you want
that's right so this was almost like the
first publicly launched Android phone
the t-mobile g1 and there what what I
actually put pic this film because I
think there's something to be said when
you are the first of something and
obviously now we're hitting about
300,000 android app on the market
there's a lot of app who are talking
about but still I think everything I
mean we definitely not the first browser
right there's tons of other browser this
stock browser which is the biggest
competitors how you compete with that
because you come with the phone but at
the same time I think everything we do
in that dish it doesn't matter is
browser or not whatever you guys are
building that got to be something like
one of your feature that is first in the
world of something and the reason I said
that is from sort of for creating a
brand and from a marketing angle if
you're saying oh we're a lot of people
in the valley always like to say hey you
know we're the school foursquare of food
or we're the twitter of for sports and
the first thing people will remember is
the Twitter and the Foursquare not your
app right so a lot of times that we all
need to think about what about your app
that is the first of everything so we
well so for us a when we first came out
okay we have better experience we
support multi tap and but all these is
not
new but gesture was new like you can
draw a little heart it go to mass comm
like that sort of thing is new but it's
funny enough our developer a development
team they actually didn't care that much
about gesture they're like both it was a
to them from a development effort it was
like oh it's just another feature I love
a hundred feature that we have but when
I saw it I thought wow this is so cool
but it was cool from a branding point of
view because sometimes I think all of us
are so passionate about everything we do
we sort of like stuff in everything but
we sort of lost focus they saw they're
like why do people buy i push ipod
shuffle there's only there's no button
there's only one choice to listen to
music so think about if you're adding
more feature to your app how can you add
one but take out five and more
importantly when you add another and
more and more which one that is not the
feature that is important to you but the
feature that's important and memorable
for the user so for us we were the first
browser that actually launched the whole
add-on concept so if you look at our
browser on the right hand side so we
have the right sidebar so you can see
things like Wikipedia that we
specifically created translate password
manager all these so once you download
it is stick on the right sidebar and you
stick with you the whole time you as a
dolphin bruh user and then if you want
more you can pick all these from from
the market as well so we created all
these four for the fact that wow we're
the first one ever supported this and on
top of that it helped us with
partnership which i will tell you guys a
little bit more in terms of strategy in
terms of user acquisition also we're the
first one as I mentioned earlier you can
pretty much customize any gesture you
want so let's say like the next time I
draw s and it will go to the San
Francisco android usergroup or let's say
if you draw it go to Facebook it can you
can create any gesture you want but
obviously we also have certain like
default things that's more usability so
we have like a little kind of arrow that
goes up it go to the top of the
page you go down it's just wrote another
arrow go down to the page so you don't
have to scroll so we are developer
there's some really creative things but
we thought is not really about us
because we can pre low so many of them
but it's really about the user which
emphasized the brand which is this the
customized is dolphin right so as you
can create on your own latte that's your
style sir is consistent so now so this
was lesson number one when we're
thinking about building the dolphin
brand so now the second thing is press
coverage I actually was asking the CEO
the other day if you can have anyone in
the world must say a million bucks lying
around and you want once book person to
speak on behalf of dolphin who would
that be and he actually picked some
actress you know which I'm like okay but
I actually found this photo who can tell
who is this guy Justin Bieber right well
obviously we're not going to have justin
bieber to be a spoke person but he
kisses you know the dolphin I'm like
yeah I'm totally using this but of
course he never tweeted about us it's
there's no associate what I need to do
disclaimer you know all right but at the
same time press is very important I gone
a little crazy with this slide this over
there is also a dolphin cloud if you
guys haven't seen it and so press
actually been very very important to us
and in fact I think the second month or
the third month after we launched on
android market we got a first press
coverage I think it was PC world was the
p0 so we didn't know like we didn't
really even know like who to contact
they actually somehow discovered us
didn't know but because of that one
piece of press coverage awesome we see a
huge spike in terms of download then we
realized wow press is very important
before we just sort of like oh let's
let's see what's going on we wanted you
sort of want to approach press you don't
know how to do it but this the first
press coverage by PC world it was
completely by by accident it was it was
not intentional so but we learn from
that one experience that now Wow
very important so let's do more of that
and then on there what we were really
really lucky which by the way like I
think for all of you guys doesn't matter
you do in photo app or maybe a game or
whatever it is it would be the homework
will be to find out whatever you working
on what are your competitors so like
what let's say they're writers all they
write about is productivity app that
probably will be the writer you should
go after right or this person is all
about Angry Birds so let's say if you do
like a bird like so the game may be like
this person want to write about it too
so there's definitely some really basic
sort of low-cost thing that you should
do research because people will sort of
realize you don't know what you're
talking about like you can't pitch like
a techcrunch person to go cover your app
because this person always write about
funding news and launch and all these
stuff so think about how you
strategically approach writer that right
about that day things that they care
about don't don't you know you you can't
like sell dog food to a cat owner right
you just have to think about like who
are your target audience not just your
user but really like the press who are
the influencers okay so lesson number
three is partner up with other app
developer this is not one of my absolute
favorite I don't know who took this or
Photoshop this we love to partners right
you can see that we have a lot of
add-ons and we partner with other
developer mainly el originally is about
user experience like we weren't thinking
about from a marketing side of things
but then we realized wait a second just
like this is actually something really
really popular with mobile games like
game developer a really good at cross
promoting they're really good at it in
fact for app developer that's more
productivities I realized where I should
not ask because you put there's a lot of
logic behind each of these it's not that
you want to promote other app anyway but
we realized through add-on we were able
to build a lot of partnerships with
other
app developer sometimes you don't
necessarily have to integrate
technically you can actually sort of use
each other marketing muscles so for
example my good friend here who's
sitting right here which is a squidoo
Megan Casey who runs squidoo she's
actually not an app developer but she
run a really really large user generated
content size so we recently just
launched this last week and so dolphin
now curate and pick like the hottest app
but is on on squidoo platform but they
already have thousands what they call
lends a small piece of article that
already talked about mobile app so for
us it's basically we are hosting it but
we also linked this squidoo page with
our Facebook fans so we're both growing
sort of Facebook followers and it's good
for both so this is another test that
we're doing in terms of partnership but
there's a lot of creative things that we
can do together there's another thing
we're actually going to launch a box a
box ton weight they not call box.net
anymore they just got box calm so box
but another ad on on dolphin so when we
do that they is actually technically the
two product don't necessary integrate as
much but we're absolutely cross
promoting on our blog on Twitter on
Facebook basically tell each of our
users hey you know now there's no
dolphin check out no box box add on and
you can actually save all your files to
your box account through dolphin and the
other way around the dot the box user
find out that oh wow cool i didn't know
that you know if i'm on android i can
save all these files directly and so is
good in terms of user acquisition for
both side hopefully that makes sense all
right and next thing is engaged users I
don't know if you guys can tell this is
a dolphin tattoo on the waist but if
it's so there's a lot of different way
of engaging users so let's say you know
you put in all these effort get all
these downloads but more importantly
there's
this whole concept about building
community your first 1000 user pretty
much set the tone of the rest of their
user base what that means is if your
first one doesn't user love you they
will continue want to support and really
become your evangelist for you to grow
further more so a few ways for us to
continue to engage because we realize
great you download it now how can we
continue to communicate it's hard to
like send emails and all that so this is
a one example that we did today in fact
we are please vote for us by the way
past midnight and for the TechCrunch
country award the best mobile browser so
we asked our user to go for us and it's
completely okay because we are human too
like we want to win so please help us to
win this award so sometimes we don't do
it every day but one because otherwise
we'll get annoying because you want the
user experience about the user is not
about you but sometimes like people will
get really excited just to be part of us
in this effort so in this case we
basically did about 12 hours or so hey
please vote for us please help us we
want to be the best mobile app for the
year and we got surprisingly just a lot
of feedback because it's basically a
tweet so they just said no a lot of
tweets which I'll show you a couple of
tweet that they did as well in another
example this is a Evernote example and a
lot of time you know this is actually
iOS I took the screenshot but you can do
push notification to encourage so you
can courage people to rate for you and
you have to definitely do this with care
because it can again it can get really
annoying but sometimes you think about
when now look for me every single time I
get any notification I take a screenshot
for every single app that I ever
download because then it gives me idea
and also think about so the frequency of
if you want to do this kind of thing how
often do you do it every I think every
apps or actually game like mobile game
do this all the time for people to come
back so you
to do it with elegance but it's
definitely a lot of that developer dude
do it alright at number five is social
media we are actually fairly good at it
but at the same time we run like two or
three campaigns every week just to try
out different things sometime if fails
sometimes nobody cares about it sometime
we actually get yell at and basically
say what the hell are you doing we do a
lot of different things but one of the
thing that was very successful that we
do do often and I actually sort of
recently learned from some of my friends
as well right now this is actually a
screenshot that you can't really see the
whole thing but anyway if you go to our
page we have about 33,000 facebook fans
now one of the statistic which is even
more important than the actual total
number of fans is the active sort of
activities active number how many people
actually come back and do things just
like you install an app that but if they
don't come back and interact with you is
waste of time right so Facebook actually
have that number as well today we're
about 3,000 the in terms of active user
means they comment that they like oh
they do something on our Facebook page
to about ten percent or so and that's
actually increased a lot because I think
last week was like 400 so there's
definitely that ratio as well but why do
we do this but the few things first we
want to be real people behind dolphin
browser soon we actually which is went
to Japan we did like a whole campaign
like localization is a complete
different story which I'm like there's a
lot of work which I love to share as
well but we went to Japan and we did
like this all these event and we have
these dolphins shirt like this one that
goes to some of the users we took a lot
of pictures we want to reengage the user
with real people so a lot of times what
we're testing a lot on a Facebook page
and why we do it because we don't want
to be just another dick bill another
very cool like whatever app we wanted
people to be part of the brand like to
feel like who we are more than just a
product itself so we're testing with
kind of real people face-to-face we're
actually doing a half
ala on Thursday we want to meet the user
we want to talk to them we want to not
just behind email or tweets or Facebook
we want to show real pictures so that's
one thing but a lot of times we also
want to be the evangelist for the
community so we pick a lot of articles
and we choose really similar thing as
well on Twitter and on Facebook and some
time will reference that back to in the
product itself and say hey you know
these are the most tweeted let's say
things that are most tweeted things on
through dolphin browser share about
dolphin browser and kind of feed it back
to the user so we can create not just
about the product but the content which
is really what the browser is a brown as
well it's the content that you consume
so we want to share back with the
community and another thing that we do a
lot I don't know if you guys used I use
tweetdeck and this is that I look at it
like every day which is not just people
tweet at us but also people that mention
but they didn't know know about our
handle but it just said dolphins I say
space browser or you should everyone
actually should have a Google Alert you
guys know Google Alert just have you get
an email every day to figure out who is
talking about you because maybe some
bloggers already write about your app
and you have no idea once you you once
you're aware you should definitely email
them and say thank you for writing about
us and build that relationship but with
this we basically do a couple things so
you see from from the top there people
starting to write in other languages I
have no idea what they're talking about
but let's say I just nominate dolphin
browser for the best mobile application
that's for the crunchy that's the
campaign that we're running right now
and some of the people absolutely help
with that but a lot of time couple other
things so we're running another campaign
we want to give out the t-shirt right so
we run a campaign I'm not on Facebook
how can I get the t-shirt so there is a
lot of conversation around that another
thing that we started doing recently is
that I'm learning from like Dell and
samples like this other non mobile brand
they actually start doing customer
service on Twitter as well so we
actually just opened a brand new
dolphin cares Twitter account so when
they when we go on and look at any sort
of user questions on Twitter because
maybe sometimes people just frustrated
hey how come like nothing work and then
we have to address it and say hey this
is how you actually use our product but
we want to separate the conversation one
is all about product announcement
marketing campaign and the other one is
all about answering product questions so
we actually have to now and now the
crazy thing is we started to get really
serious about other countries as well so
we are now official language we actually
have about 18 languages that all 18 of
these some of our core fans from like
Russia started translating for us and we
had no idea so we're very thankful for
that but at the same time to really
seriously market to other countries all
these we have to think about so we
launched recently in China Japan and
Korea now we're like shoot like we start
looking at these tweets in Japanese how
are we going to write back we can't even
do that so there's another sort of
headache that we have to think about
it's not just about translate by the way
there's tons of agency that do
translation app translation and
description translation very quickly and
get that done but that's not even the
point the point is how do you actually
do marketing afterwards how do you do
customer service how do you communicate
that's now we're facing a complete
different challenge now all right let's
so two more lessons really quick is it's
the transition from android/ios how many
of you actually have a ir s app okay a
few so we actually did it obvious
started in android so we decided you
know what maybe it's time we got a
little bit of funding so we decided you
know maybe we should invest which is you
know we had a hire new people is
completely different sets of skills and
so we have the team with Bill iOS which
is really maybe one tenth of the
functionality compared to that our
Android apps because andrew is a lot
more flexible to develop so when we get
a ir
it was interesting we again we start
with nothing we didn't know how to
market on iOS we don't know anything the
algorithm is different and which Don's
going to talk about all that I want to
learn that as well so the thinking we
have was okay we don't really know about
this new market but what we do know is
we have really really strong fans so
what we did was a really sort of fun
campaign we realized well we don't want
our use well it's all Android user that
we have we can't ask them to go download
iOS because they probably don't even
have the device so it wouldn't make any
sense but on the other hand what's
interesting is that we want to sort of
say ask for help to solar celebrate a
launch so what we did was a raffle
campaign so we actually did a giveaway
of the iphone 4 and we basically say the
way for you to enter this raffle is to
tweet so what we did was they have to be
like a particular sort of format
obviously hashtag dolphin iphone and
they have to explain to us why they love
dolphin so much so so this one literally
say i love dolphin browser the best
android browser even uninstalled a
default congrats to the iphone launch so
we sort of ask the user for help we
didn't ask them to download it but
instead we asked them to have to include
certain thing in that tweet to and
prevent five-day we actually generate
10,000 tweets with with this campaign
basically 10,000 I loved often tweet it
was awesome this is just a few of them
that i took out which I thought this so
cool but more importantly what I also
didn't realize for iOS is some some
other things I didn't know before
there's a lot of recommendation app on
iOS so if you get a lot of tweet even
without paying they will sort of like
put your app on the front page of these
recommendation am I making any sense so
if there's a lot of those at
recommendation that right so if it is
highly
tweeted is actually something that
people would see it anyway so it was
really useful for us but it was an
accident like we didn't know that we can
do this and now now obviously we want to
repeat it but the bad thing with
marketing is that once you use it once
you can do it again within such a short
time otherwise this user get get sick of
you right so you have to be very careful
when you pick and choose okay and have
to be really creative because people
were hey you're doing the same thing
these other guys it's doing so you have
to think about how do you kind of shape
it and word it correctly so that it
doesn't get negative effect we have
launched many other ones that sort of
like we thought it would be a huge deal
but compared to this which is a really
low cost basically no money I me it was
the money to buy the iphone that was
expensive but other than that it wasn't
like we tired or like did any special
thing like and behind the back it was
just a pure raffle campaign just like
you do on the radio last but not least
one thing that was really really useful
for us which I will show you its video
video actually doesn't have to be high
high cost so when we launched on iOS we
decided you know what so one thing
before I show all these why video one
other thing that we learn from sort of
our press experience was that press
actually love to include video of how
your app work in the blog post so even
though it doesn't have to look like this
like I'm just really anal so I like to
like be a specific way but it really is
about things that is visual because it
helped them to increase their readership
so if you have any video even though
it's not like perfectly done it's still
good to send along to include a video in
so your pitch emails and one off because
very likely they will include that in
their ila so this one was included at
least like 10 20 different blog posts
when we launched the iOS version
so reverse is a whole concept is that we
had a feature which is gesture to be the
highlight for a far-out and the
different way of how this is stuffing
translate you can translate in different
languages and this say like you can
SHINee shake you can change and just
check it to different tab and the way
how a webzine work and at the end you
have a little kid 10 even the kids can
do it so that's sort of like our
thinking so with this is really really
short about 30-40 seconds or so now like
I have a lot of friends doesn't matter
like a lot of app developer friends
pretty much every single one of them
will call me on and say hi I want to do
a video like what should we do in fact
another friend of mine going to launch
their app and I can't say it on Thursday
and I basically one of my friends
borrows our cats and have the cats to
play with that even the catch in there
but we're not going to do it for dolphin
obviously I love animals if you can't
tell but there's many many creative way
to sort of like express what you're
really what you really love and sort of
make fun of it I mean this one is
actually sort of serious but I think
sometimes if it's sort of like a funny
sort of a joke people want to watch it
even more so there's a lot of creative
ways it's going to bring out your app
and get people to watch it more with
that that's the end or sort of my
seventh it so thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
