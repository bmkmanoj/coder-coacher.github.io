I'm going to talk about the
web desktop that I have been building oh
yeah legal stuff I am NOT an apple
employee I do not represent Apple Apple
Macintosh mac OS x I believe pretty sure
are all trademarks of Apple incorporated
if does anybody here work at Apple Apple
legal department okay good actually it
would be kind of nice I'd love to talk
to them because I don't want to be sued
are you okay well there we go well I'll
talk to you about it later so basically
what i'm going to show you is i'm going
to show you a web desktop open source
been working on a part time for last two
years it is basically a bit of HTML CSS
and JavaScript that puts resizable
movable windows inside a web browser oh
oh I'm sorry um and the URL that I
flashed up at the beginning which I'll
also put up at the end has a reference
to this to the PDF of this presentation
/ I should have said that first okay
ready to go okay and so it's it's
basically all you know stock CSS html5
CSS to JavaScript nothing really fancy
the thing that I like about it is that
it allows me to relive the glory days of
Mac OS X from the good days it's really
cool because it creatively subverts your
browser security model one of the things
that's bad about it is that it
creatively subverts your browser model
your browser security model works on
WebKit if you can get it to work on
firefox more power to you anybody here
from Microsoft I'd love to talk to
somebody about ie figure out what the
heck's going on and ie yeah but the
thing that I really want to do one of
the reasons that I like to come to this
conference is that I keep thinking about
accessibility and desktop apps and I
think that this is replicating an
environment where we can do experiments
about accessibility in a kind of rapid
prototyping kind of environment and we
can apply that to to you know web desk
or to desktop apps I'm going to ask you
know towards the end I'm going to ask
for for help I just need people to you
know just look at it tell me what you
think yeah I've got some docs that I'm
going to push out to the repo over the
next week and i'm going to ask people to
you know please try and write a hello
world app tell me how my tutorial
doesn't you know really work and
actually let me just go ahead and show
you you know I've talked about it first
we're going to look at it in Chrome
assuming oh yeah I changed screen
resolution and
what I'm sorry I don't have a green
button oh that green button oh okay oh
yeah I'm not really i'm not actually a
mac OSX person I used next step back in
the day but what is your first into the
contraction or circling no it's the
Irish spelling of maize I so anyway oh
my god that's so offensive this is a web
page
so does anybody here remember the 1984
hello so we speak some Spanish in my
house so it's holla oh my god this is
the version where I demonstrate that I
don't know how to do exclamation points
in Spanish and oh yeah okay stills guts
and bugs and some there's some display
issues Oh what I'm trying to show is I'm
trying to okay
we have desktop accessories and I also
used to own an Amiga if anybody can
recognize this jumbled thing so there's
one thing that I wanted to point out
with a notepad so what you can do oops
well no you can't do that on this mac
because i don't have the that it's set
up correctly you know still doesn't do
it yeah well but if I reload it and
it'll lose context it's set up to lees
context on reload but it did actually
come back oh let's do the hot get back
here it so I'm making extensive use of
local storage and so basically what i've
done is i've got a mix of server-side
and client-side JavaScript of framework
to do you know quote unquote
applications and an application is
simply a bit of JavaScript code that is
inside a window boy that's this
shouldn't shock anyone it's designed to
work in this environment with this you
know with a menu at the top and a you
know a root window you can use it in
other environments where you don't have
a root window don't have them I mean you
if you wanted to have I have a friend
who use this this code to emulate a I
ryx desktop from you know 1994 or
something so if you wanted to relive the
the wonder of the Jurassic Park movie
you can do that and one of the things
that I wanted to show but contractually
I'm not allowed to is um
uh a company that I work with is
building appliances based on raspberry
PI's and we've included this as the
basis of their administrative interface
so instead of you know having having to
hook it up to the device up to a screen
you just turn it on plug it into a
network go to it remotely and it's got a
web interface and instead of a
traditional you know web app you have
something that looks like a traditional
web app inside one of these windows and
you also have like an environment where
you can you know have like a little
notepad off to the side or something
like that and so and this is basically
it and so and we're only 15 minutes into
it and at this point I kind of wanted to
ask people um you know how do I make
this accessible no seriously I'm I have
some ideas on on api's I've written a
couple api's to try to make to try to
interact or interface this with various
screen readers doesn't work I'm also
trying to recruit people to to you know
help me with this to maybe look at the
code you know give some opinions as to
how we could modify it it's just that my
experience with accessibility technology
is really pretty minimal oh there's
someone in the back I did some of that
and there's a branch on the there's a
branch on the on the repo that included
some of that and it failed miserably so
you know I may have to go back and and
reread about and do a little more
experimentation on how WebKit handles
tabbing because one of the things i have
noticed is that yes yes yes okay
but you know the thing is is that it's
it's it's not that much worse than
recent versions of ie or recent versions
of Firefox although fire I haven't
tried it with opera and there's probably
some opera guys here so i might try to
corner them yeah and I mean and this is
what something that I do like every day
all day and in fact what my desktop
looks like ninety-eight percent of the
time is this you know yeah yeah so it's
all uh like oh yeah okay so one of the
things yeah right so yeah the right yeah
the the menu bar yeah that is yeah
everything here is a everything here is
in a div just because I wanted to be
able to independently absolutely
position it and
okay right uh and haven't gotten there
yet it's well it's kind of interesting
the what people said that they really
wanted when I show or you know fifty
percent of the people who I know who
spent time with a classic Mac when they
see this they say oh do you have
hypercard and so that's actually going
to be my next project is getting a
hypercar to alike working on this you
know a hypercar desk web application
working in an environment like this that
you know compile something that looks
like hyper hyper talk into JavaScript
and makes a valiant effort to try to you
know add some form of application
security also I should also add that we
applied the web CSP the content I can't
even remember what CSP stands for it
didn't help CSP is unfortunately very
easy to its I mean it is sort of a
best-effort it's very easy to avoid to
do the wrong thing with CSP is
unfortunately and that's the other
there's two aspects of this that I'm
really trying to get my brain stem
around one is accessibility the other is
security and both of them are in modern
web browsers are you know okay i'm
almost at the point where instead of
continuing with a web browser i'm going
to build a node application that binds
to the sdl library is if everyone know
what sdl is it's called simple direct
layer and it's just a simple graphics
layer you can build node applications
that run on a client that draw things on
the screen so it's sort of like having a
canvas you know JavaScript canvas in a
web browser except that you don't have
the web browser
all you have is node so it's no directly
to the screen I'm almost at the point
where i'm going to give up on web
browsers and put all of this in to you
know sdl yeah well it it's yes but I
mean it's but I mean I might want to do
that just simply for experimental
reasons oh really really okay oh god I
will argue with you I I oh ok well known
oh well that's a good point that's a
good point it's like I have no problem
you know having a tree but not having it
be the dom because currently i think the
dom is overloaded in terms of what it
does well yep it's a good point that's a
very good point you could create yeah
yeah well yeah okay i suture oh right
and then yeah and is I ok so you create
something so you may not necessarily use
a native full Dom but you create enough
of the Dom fit all of that's ok ok ok
yeah ok all right well I'm I'm glad I
came here but yeah because the other
thing is it's actually as as nasty as
this stuff looks on the side for
whatever reason earlier in the day when
it was at a different resolution it
looked even nastier and that's partially
due to minor variations in the way
things render between platforms this and
there's one of the things I discovered
is that with chrome with the same
version of Chrome on two different
versions of Mac OS X you you get
different artifacts on the
screen which is really irritating
because I was trying to produce
something that's you know bit accurate
and another thing that you you know one
person could do is or that you could do
with this is just draw it into a canvas
and I've thought about that as well but
but then you but then you have the yeah
but that will know you could draw it
into but then exactly right right which
yeah yeah and you could write yeah and
however you render it yeah and yeah and
you can yeah you could have the model
yeah yeah you could have the model
actually be something you know different
like a JSON or object or a JavaScript
object and just render the Dom into the
canvas and then render yeah yeah okay
okay so yeah cool Yeah Yeah right and I
mean this is one of the right in the
right and this is kind of the problem
well the problem with the web right now
is is that on one side we have the
Semantic Web camp that says hey all of
your all of your markup should be
semantically a you know significant and
the other side you've got people that
have product managers that are coming at
them saying no I want that to be blue no
I want that five you know pixels left I
want and yeah oh yeah absolutely blink
tag blink tag I did not replicate the
blink tag anyway yes right now there is
no authentication these are public
remote files yeah yeah you could you
totally could but although web dev is
shut off on this server I did actually
start to work on a webdav thing and you
know how things are you you get
something that works you get fifty
percent of the way into the next project
and then you realize how you did the
last project wrong so you have to recut
everything and so that's like the that's
another one of the feature branches
that's in this this repo but yeah I'm
just really excited that I got the
windowing working right in the oh and
there's another every now and again
WebKit loses context about loses its you
know doesn't understand the CSS that's
supposed to apply to that div and yes um
well I made something that looked like a
chooser and then I started reading the
xerox vs apple the notes from the xerox
v apple and there was some commentary
about the chooser so i decided not to
proceed that although you can you can
actually print this through you know the
native print and it will produce
something that kind of looks
mostly looks like the page oh actually
hold up well okay it doesn't do it on
this one on my linux box it will
actually produce something yeah yeah
yeah yeah so whoops so there's there's
still definitely a lot of work to do
it's very early if this is the type of
thing that you find interesting you know
get in on the ground floor oh absolutely
this is a forward-looking statement and
I think I had one or two more slides you
know just did right and right this is
what I wanted to say about the future so
I did a bunch of other web projects
there's one that was a anybody here
familiar with voodoo pad for the
Macintosh it's a local wiki so you start
typing and you say oh I want this to be
a different page you highlight the text
and say link and it creates something
that a structure that's kind of like I
did one of those for the web so I want
to integrate that kind of thing into
this environment but in order to do that
I want to have you know better local
storage options and also to integrate
with get I have a friend who built some
JavaScript client libraries to treat
local storage as a local git repo and it
does the you know to get HTTP protocol
over you know to a git repo so you can
actually type it in your application
here locally you know say commit and it
will push it up to your git repo so
that's the something I'm gonna try to
get get working we already discussed you
know why use the browser and it sounds
like don't completely avoid the Dom
maybe create a maybe create a different
browser that's completely brain dead
except for how to maybe do some plugins
and you know export enough the Dom said
that a screen
reader can interface with it okay yeah
that's that's what I'm finding out you
know got some yeah and then yeah this is
the one that I was if anybody's from
Apple here is the one that's like as we
all know you can't you don't get to
claim IP protection on look and feel and
the other thing that I didn't want to
point out is if you wanted to use this
and you're kind of freaked out about you
know the the Apple look of it there's
it's actually old styled I've built uh
I've built an ir x theme or someone else
build the Irish theme and I built a kind
of Microsoft D windows ish kinda but not
enough that I think anybody would want
to see me and like I said it's like you
can use this to do windows in doesn't
have to be in this web page it should
work and it has worked I've tested it it
does work in just include the you know
JavaScript references you know call the
the code to initialize library and it
will you tell it you know what your
quote unquote route window is and it
will put a window web I this slide used
to say are you high and unfortunately i
live in santa cruz so people just
assumed I was yes I did not do the blink
tag and and this is another important
thing please you know if you have any
development chops at all or know anybody
that does please convince them to to
look at this and send me emails telling
me I'm stupid or you know because to
really figure
how stupid I really AM you have to
actually read the code and if i can get
you to read the code I've won and yeah
that's basically that's a so any
comments questions all right thanks and
also John's not here but I did want to I
did want to thank John for his support
over the the over the years mostly moral
support because I think this is fun and
cool and when I was sort of discouraged
John was now that stuff's cool so anyway
I've used several and actually the one
that really got me to think about this
one was carbon which was an independent
product for that went into alpha there
was a small community of users who were
alpha testers and then they got bought
by synology I think a company that did
like NASA Lucian's and they just
integrated the technology into their now
solution and it didn't become they
didn't open source it they didn't do
anything like that and I was waiting for
these carbon guys to publish so I could
build apps for it and then when they got
bought I was like oh man what am I gonna
do I did and they were like yeah no it's
like it's our we paid for the code it's
ours go away and and i think the
original guys were like um i think most
of them i don't know i don't want to I
don't want to speculate really but it
did not sound like it sounded like
rewriting it was going to be a lot
easier and Bill and I worked at a
company that did something not exactly
similar but kinda similar
javascript-based user interfaces but for
a mobile platform and obviously we
couldn't reuse that work although
actually call that we probably could've
now that i think about it but I don't
know
yeah yeah that stuff but oh you're
kidding oh I didn't realize that oh well
oh um so I use a chrome on linux chrome
on windows is probably the next best
renderer a chrome on mac OS x is
surprisingly you know i don't i don't
want to say bad things about it because
I understand what the constraints are
but it seems so well I'll say is is that
it seems like the rendering technology
underlying the mac OS x version of
chrome is different enough that the
stuff that I'm doing makes it look
suboptimal so what I need to do is I
need to spend a little bit more time
investigating that so I can figure out
how to change my code to make it look
not as bad on a safari on you know
Safari and chrome on mac OS x I'm
because surprisingly it's the operating
system that's I've tried firefox firefox
works everything on this works except
for the styled scroll bars because
firefox doesn't support that and they're
apparently never going to support it
because I was told I was stupid
ah yeah so there's um was it remote
desktop the are what are the Microsoft
has their remote desktop and then VNC
thank you yes are you talking more about
like doing X protocol or more like
screencasting like the well yeah yeah
well and that's ansari you know I do you
know I do a fair amount without I'm not
proud I mean especially cool yeah
especially considering the fact that
like I was like a security developer at
Mozilla and I'm not supposed to do that
I'm not supposed to encourage people to
do that yeah but yeah and that's how I
knew how to get around all of the
content protection but the so like the
next thing girl let me show you some of
the go over to oh yeah I'm sorry um and
that was what i was hoping to show but
at the last minute it's like the guys
who actually paid me to do that said
please don't show it but uh but the
reason they said that is is that the
thing that I was gonna show off had some
of their IP integrated with some stuff
that is already open sourced so we're
just going to have to split it up yeah
and you know I might be able to get away
with turning it on and giving a few
people who are interested the IP address
or something um hold on up up down down
left right left right a be um hold on
put it up up oh that's no that's my um
no no that's my uh this is my vanity
page and if you go to up and if you do
up up down down left right left right a
B it gives you yeah Mike the fun and
then so this is so this is the web
terminal that that I made and yeah and
so and this is the demo for the web
terminal and this is going to be the
next thing that I add but in theory
there and what I'm going to try to
demonstrate is is that they're in theory
there should be no reason that you
couldn't put a canvas in one of those
windows yeah yeah just an html5 canvas
yeah this is the this is actually html5
canvas i have another version that you
know goes directly to the dom and it's
has its own set of issues but um what
and then but once you do that once you
can do that there should be no reason
that you couldn't do through plugins do
V&amp;amp;C
because because this is what that's
where I want to go with this eventually
is that I one of the things that carbon
said that they were going to allow you
to do that I wanted to do with something
that I was able to do with x windows in
the early 90s which is have a virtual
desktop and connect an actual desktop to
that virtual desktop from multiple
different locations so when I'm at work
I have my context which is all of my
windows open I leave that desktop I go
home I VPN n and then attached to that
virtual desktop again now the problem
with doing that on X Windows is is that
x window is over a VPN over long
distance you know networks is you know
it will eventually make you want to
shoot yourself yeah it would solve a lot
of problems and so now it's like well
hey you know it's we're all about the
web right so let's do the server the web
and that was kind of where I was going
with this so that's kind of going to be
the next thing I do I'd love to make and
I'd love to make something that was
equivalent to GIMP on you know with
html5 just because I think that would be
really really cool I don't think I'm
necessarily qualified to do that but I'm
not an expert in you know graphics
applications well that's because I'm
yeah yo and that's because it's it's
really easy to put fonts into I mean
letters into into canvases so yeah yeah
constant way if it's it's beautiful so
oh god oh oh yeah that's kind of a good
point and but and then the other thing
is that I've I go back and forth as to
whether or not i prefer ssh or https but
it's really hard to do you ssh i need to
have to do like a connect or something
over or something like that and that's
yeah okay all right okay go ahead and
shut down and so I was able to talk for
45 minutes pretty not too bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
