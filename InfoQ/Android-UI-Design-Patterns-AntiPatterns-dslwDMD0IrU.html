here my name is John hammock and I'm
actually I'm a former software engineer
I say I tell everyone that I'm I'm a
recovering engineer I started my career
a long time ago at f-secure company in
Finland and then in the early 2000s I
moved over to Tallinn Estonia and I was
working for Skype and although my work
has never been I've never been in UI or
a UX designer as such one of the one of
the biggest sort of my proudest
accomplishments in my my days over in in
Eastern Europe and actually traveling
the world with Skype was building a UX
certification program around all of the
sixteen hundred or so devices that we
had integrating with a Skype ecosystem
circa 2005 2006 so it's it's been a
little while and it's been a it's been a
bumpy road for me I've been since then
I've been a software engineer over at
Nokia I moved back to the States and
from the states originally I moved back
here and in 2011 and I started to
discover that much better than being a
software engineer I'm an artist I'm a
digital artist and started to pick up
some exhibitions and get some general
interest in things and just when I was
thinking about exiting this whole
software thing altogether I got a call
from Mozilla and they wanted me to come
down and work with them on Firefox OS
and this was in 2011 and I started to
work with these web api's and then I
started to work actually QA and a bit of
evangelism
a teeny little bit of you Explorer or
Firefox OS and I was hoping that Sasha
wasn't gonna blow my cover
because I'm talking about Android today
but as it turns out a lot of Firefox OS
is actually built on Android I mean we
were using the same Android debug bridge
to debug the things we were using the
same a lot a lot of parts of the same
kernel and so forth so it wasn't that
much of a sort of a sort of a leap to go
from for example Firefox OS to Android
but when I started to get serious about
doing the art thing I realized that if I
if I want to eat I need somebody to buy
this stuff right and and so what I
started to do is I started to approach
like app developers and app designers to
sort of present this hey we can make
some great textures for you it could
make some great iconography for that
you're never done and so starting to
approach the market in this way I
realized that there was this enormous
gap between the understanding of
designers and developers they simply
weren't speaking the same language and
it's in a lot of companies that I went
to both before I started this push as an
artist approaching companies and after I
discovered that developers and designers
weren't even using the same language
when they talked about things whereas
Android developers were talking about
activities designers were talking about
screens and so forth I don't know what
your experience is but we discovered
that there was enough of a gap that the
guys at new circle approached me I guess
this must have been after Sasha defected
and said let's build a course around it
of course they're gonna say that they
build courses around everything right so
so here I am building a course and what
I'm gonna give you today is part of the
first module what we're talking about UI
design principles and resources of
Android and then we're going to dig down
a little bit and we're gonna look at
some anti patterns as well and an anti
whereas a pattern is something that you
want to be able to accomplish with a
design an anti-pattern is precisely
something that you don't want to
accomplish and I'm not too heavy on the
demos but I have one short demo that
we're gonna we're gonna look at briefly
and I'd like to get you guys involved as
well but let's let's see how we do in
terms of time and people falling asleep
in their chairs so let's talk a little
bit about the creative vision we'll talk
a little bit about Google's creative
vision we'll talk a little bit about the
design principles and then I'm gonna
give you some examples of anti-pattern
so let's just jump right in here so what
is Android creative vision I hope it's
not showing on my screen there but if it
is and somebody tell me what it is
please it boils down to three points
they are there we go okay so I mean this
is all kind of fuzzy stuff and it's not
it's not as straightforward as its
teaching code right because what the
heck does this does all this mean right
well obviously one one very important
thing to keep in mind is that this
really is about emotion and that's why
they're kind of referring to it in the
nature of the first person you see when
I experience something on my phone my
experience is indivisible from my
experience in real life that's why
there's been a big shift going from UI
to UX user interface as opposed to user
experience think about it if you're
talking about UI you're maybe talking
about this the screens or in the case of
Android you may be talking about the way
the activities are laid out on your
device when you're talking about UX are
talking about the whole experience so if
I have a pizza ordering out forever for
example then everything from whipping
out my phone to launching the pizza app
to getting to the first green room I'm
selecting orders to - making the payment
clicking send to getting the pizza
delivered in a timely way and hopefully
enjoying the pizza if it's not complete
crap
then that is the whole experience we're
talking about the entire experience so
it's not just the quality of the user
interface but it's the experience of
which the UI is part of it right and so
the creative vision is actually going to
that level it's going to that that level
of I don't want to say abstraction but
it's talking about the entire entirety
of the experience this incidentally is
something that I tried to achieve also
when I when I was developing the UX
certification program at Skype I wanted
to talk about the entire experience and
it seems like a few years later I mean I
guess they already got it but they're
really getting it now because we're
starting to see Android apps coming
together and in becoming more and more
tight of an experience although there
are some real stinkers out there and
we're gonna we're going to talk about a
few we know that the experience of
people is shaped by emotions so if I
have a bad day and you have a good day
and we walk together and we're we
encounter the same experience for
example that at a restaurant in town
here it's more likely that I'm gonna see
that it's that experience which is
completely unrelated as a bad experience
whereas the person who's walking with me
who's had a good day is going to see
that as a good experience so experience
of people is shaped by emotion what we
also know is that what they found in
their and their Android research is that
it takes three positive experiences to
offset a single negative experience so
when I have one bad experience in my app
it's going to take me three good
experiences to even break even and you
can you can kind of look into the
research there there's a big reference
to it at Google i/o 2013
we can look at that video later if you
want consider also the emotional
attachment
the people have to Apple I mean Steve
Jobs is one of those guys who sort of
understood the notion of experience in
the totality of experience and he was
obviously very aggressive about toward
his team about not shipping products
with even the most niggling or seemingly
trivial of bugs whereas a lot of
marketing managers would just say oh
it's good enough ship it God knows I've
seen that enough Steve Jobs was you know
one of those people who was
perfectionist not just to the point of
the product but of the point of the
products that they experienced embodied
that he was he was aiming for that and
arguably to to a variable degree he
certainly achieved that so let's look at
the actual principles here what what
does it mean so did I get the right
thing here I actually teach right off
the page in my class I hope you don't
mind so the Android design principles
enchant me let me hear it
delight me in surprising ways what are
the other ones please well okay right
let me make it mine so people love to UM
they love to UM add personal touches
they love to customize things they love
to take something out of the box and
make it theirs get to know me as another
one of these these main principles and
this is this is all about learning what
my preferences are learning how I use
the device and in kind of like a good
servant would you don't make those
options automatic what you present them
to me in a simple and easy enough way to
get simplify my life so for any words
you keep it brief pictures are faster
than words decide for me but let me have
the final say note the example that they
that they have here this is an example
of and
beam which is a version of NFC so when I
hold two phones together
I'm Attica Lee presented with this
option of do you want to beam this
picture it's not done for me
because that would be a bad thing
imagine if I was in a subway and I brush
up against somebody and then I pocket
beam all my dirty photos to this other
person I mean that would that would be a
bad although it would be sort of amusing
if it happened the other way right but
they're deciding for me but they're
they're letting me have the final say as
to what what I want another big part of
it is keeping it kind of simple right so
only show what I need when I need it
right so here we have the Google
Playstore and we have and of course they
popped up the overflow menu to kind of
show an example presumably in this main
activity let's let's pretend that this
this overflow menu is not there
it hasn't been activated yet and that
main activity is going to show you all
of the most important things that I can
do with that app in that activity right
you know by activity you know that I'm
talking about the app screen basically
right if I need to do more things that
are less or different things that are
for example less important to the app
but still need to be done then I call
this overflow menu right and this is a
way of not giving me too much
information at what process at once
giving me what I need when I need it so
related to that I should always know
where I am so if I'm navigating an app
if I have an email app and I open the
email app and I have an index of mails
there I should know that if I click one
of one of those mails in the index that
I'm going to be taken to a detailed view
of that email perhaps with the contents
of a message I can click sum or tap
somewhere else in there and I'm brought
to a place where I can do things like
reply and forward the email and so forth
and I know that if I if I hit this thing
that looks like a funny-looking arrow
there
then I'm gonna be taken back up to the
next the next highest activity and this
should work kind of universally across
the board I should always know where I
am
and the surprising thing is it's it's
gotten a lot better in the application
landscape lately but it's surprisingly
still how many people get this wrong
when they develop apps obviously never
lose my stuff right so if I took time to
create settings if I took time to make
personal touches I want to be able to
save that stuff if possible I want to be
able to duplicate it across all of my
devices right related to I should always
know where I am
is if obviously if it looks the same it
should act the same notice that those
spinner buttons are all the same in all
three cases what some application
developers do wrong is they will use
certain iconography in ways that it
isn't used universally so when for
example I've seen this in some banking
apps I remember I was using one banking
app I'm not going to say which one and I
hit something that looks like a spinner
and it did something completely
different and then I found myself in a
place in the app or I didn't actually
know where I was so it broke two of
these principles and you remember the
three to one rule now I had six points
going against me
and I needed to make at least that many
good things about the app which of
course never happened right to break
even so only interrupt me if it's
important so be very careful about
knowing what kind of notifications your
application is sending and when it's
sending them I don't want to break the
flow of my my concentration because I've
already invested like a certain amount
of time and energy into getting to know
this app and getting to know how it
flows from where I'm started to where my
goal is in the app if I break my
concentration then I'm losing that
investment in time when I have to invest
the time again to get back in the flow
way they have so it's very important and
obviously if you break the concentration
on another
or another person another thing as
somebody's doing then you're committing
even cardinal sin because you're kind of
infringing on somebody else there right
so make me amazing anybody want to call
these things out for me because I'm
feeling kind of lazy and my jaw hurts so
make me amazing what's the first one and
you're gonna know these so because
there's gonna be a question on them
later
apparently Sasha made me do it
so make me amazing give me tricks at
work everywhere wake up it's not your
fault it's not my fault either man don't
blame it on me it's not my fault means
it's we want to be general and how
gentle and how we're prompting people to
to make corrections or how to do things
if something's not obvious and we need
text to explain it we want to do this in
a way where people don't feel like
they're being blamed or accused we don't
want to make them feel stupid because
that's not a good thing right
what is the next one and what does that
mean how do you interpret that directive
sprinkle encouragement well if I have a
very complicated task I want to break it
down into simple tasks and I want to
provide some positive reinforcement
along the way and the positive
reinforcement could be simple something
as simple as showing a simple glow
around a button when I press that button
does that make sense so I know that the
button is pressed so I'm not sitting
there like why isn't this doing anything
right do the heavy lifting for me sorry
I was gonna have you do it but I did it
anyway
yeah so there if I want to make you feel
like an expert I want to make you feel
amazing I want to be able to to do
things that to empower you to do things
that you didn't know we're possible
before when you consider all of the
possible photo effects that there are I
mean everything from
and shading to sepia tones to the blur
effects and all of these different
things you can do with photos
it gets pretty confusing right but you
know that every every photographer or at
least most photographers out there are
doing working within a certain bucket of
tricks and coming up with a certain
range of effects I mean all you need to
do is look at most people's most amateur
photographers Facebook post and to know
that they do a lot of the same stuff so
why not combine all these effects to one
instead of making them for kind of
figure out everything and last but not
least we want to make important things
fast I know I said you were I was gonna
have you do this but I I'm getting into
it now and a camera what is the most
important control to have on the
mainactivity
it's a shutter button right that's the
most important thing taking a picture so
on the main activity of a camera and to
get a sense of how these how these
things are embodied you can just look at
most of the Google stock stock apps
because most if not all of them embody
these principles but I mean on the main
activity the main thing front and center
is the shutter button right does that
make sense
and there really isn't a whole lot else
there
so what I usually do at this point is I
have I kick it around I kick it back to
the audience and sort of ask you guys
about your good experiences and your bad
experiences in your huggly experiences
what I actually do is I have my students
form form up little teams but I don't
think we're going to do that tonight but
they form up little teams and instructor
gives them an app to explore and I have
this whole list of apps here and then
they kind of go through the apps and
they say well what are they doing right
what are they doing wrong and they kind
of come up with with a point system but
I thought we would just jump right into
the anti-patterns if that's okay how are
we doing on time by the way we're doing
good
this is still I'm sorry I should put
this in present mode one of the biggest
anti patterns that I see in it happen
and why would I why would it having an e
ola up front be an anti pattern anyone
can anyone offer me some insight into
that right it makes it makes us do work
without without any kind of rewarding
but you will UL is necessary right I
mean we're gonna engage in some kind of
a legal relationship with whoever made
this app so we have to have it don't we
or do we exactly so she said to have to
allow people to look around first and
then execute the EUL a later another end
another another way to sort of correct
this anti pattern I mean if it's if it's
for example the kind of thing that shows
up in a banking app I mean you're gonna
negotiate your relationship with the
bank upfront when you open the account
right why not sign the EUL a then if not
then why not do it for example at a
desktop computer but don't make the
person you know do it when they're
running around with a mobile device
trying to get on the subway because
that's that's ridiculously absurd and
how are people going to be able to do
this you can always with the application
you can always detect the state of the
EUL a when you open the app and you can
you can keep the welcome mat open right
let people explore and see what's
possible to do and then jump to this
this thing later
so another anti-pattern I call it the
contact us anti-pattern on the situation
is you're trying out an application
you're banging around and you you run
into some inevitable problem with this
where you need to get help and what
you're presented with is like some untap
Abul phone number right so you actually
need to put your phone down and write
down this
phone number if you're going to call
because you're not gonna remember it
between the time you go between the
application and the dialer right or else
there's going to be some long contact
form without any kind of preset so
you're expected to do some work and
actually when a customer is using your
app and they're using the help app do
you realize that they're actually
helping you the developer because
they're giving you feedback they're
saying I'm running into a problem here
so what you're actually making the
customer do is work even harder to give
you feedback I mean how fair is that I
would say not very so if your customers
are already flustered there's a good
chance or this gonna they're gonna say
to heck with it so I mean the obvious
antidote to that is to have like a tappa
balumbo and some kind of presets another
anti-pattern it's kind of related to the
ula one is I call it sign up or sign in
and this is where again almost every
banking app ever created does this
before you can even start you have to go
through sometimes in addition to an e
ula you have to go through a lengthy and
confusing sign up or login and there's a
way around that in some cases you can
you can enable a session token' or a
guest account and like she was saying
what's your name again hmm
like catherine was saying here in the
front row you can allow people to look
around and to use some limited
functionality of your app before you
give them the burden of elas if you
haven't done it already
and before you expect them to sign in I
mean there's certain things you can do
even if you're a banking app you can
show certain things upfront like we have
these great service and blah blah blah
obviously they have to log in and have
some kind of acceptable security if it's
really dealing with the account stuff
but there's certain ways you can engage
people before expecting them to do this
all up front so I'm going to show you
one example of an anti-pattern that I
kind of ran into if I can get my droid
screen to work here
so when I decided that I didn't want to
be a software engineer anymore and I
when I quit my job in May I went back to
one of my old loves and I joined a band
and the band was touring and we were
playing a lot of the wharfs around here
on San Francisco and see if my droid
adapt actually works oh yes it's asking
you for permission so let's go to the
Play Store and when you're traveling
around
oh yeah wonderful this is a great kind
of a shitty example but this is the kind
of thing you need when you're traveling
around with a band I think we need to
turn it upside down and it rotates in
exactly the wrong position oh hey that
works thanks for the tip Willy when
you're traveling around and you're
playing outside for 14 hours a day with
a band 10 to 14 hours a day I mean
you're in weird cities like Seattle or
San Francisco you obviously need to know
where where the bathroom is so you go
and you install this app and what is the
first thing gonna do so you're kind of
jumping around wondering like okay how
is this gonna work out and the very
first thing the app ask you to do is
your birthday so I don't even know who
these people are and they want to know
my birthday all right I mean what the
heck for this is obviously some kind of
marketing thing right so I'm gonna make
some I'm not really that that old I'm
older so if we're gonna do this and then
I'm not kidding look at this this is
what you get when you when you try so
you're looking for bathrooms right and
you have two okay right whatever
I accept oh come on it gives me this
this message here so I actually they
actually expect me before I look for the
bathroom to like read and agree to all
of this stuff hold harmless and
Indemnity okay what am I gonna sue you
for I mean come on right
this is just ridiculous I mean now it
used to show you is another screen to
tap before it actually gets you to the
good stuff
and I don't know if it's going to do but
what it usually does here is it shows
you a map of lick world the public
restrooms are and it's a crowdsource
thing so like once you log in you can
add bathrooms to it and it's it's handy
but if I hadn't gone through all that
and they hadn't tapped through this
extra screen I would have never gotten
the usefulness out of this app and I
would have wasted a lot of time and who
knows what else would have happened
right so these are these are an example
of some kind of some of the kind of anti
patterns that we see and then we're
going to go through just a few more of
these
so another anti pattern I call it the
extra page tutorials and this is if
you're going through something like a
game we're going through the flow of an
application obviously presenting the
information in a reasonable and timely
way is something that's that's very
important but what's problematic is when
you get an extra page it's actually out
of sync with the application flow for
your help text right and some games and
the reason this is a problem obviously
is because it's breaking the natural
flow of your application so I'm I'm
going through your app I'm getting I'm
playing a game I'm getting signed up
doing all of these other things and then
right in the middle there is a big chunk
of information that I need to know I
need to somehow memorize and know later
and there's an interesting way to work
around this and that's what some game
series do for example in the game loft
series and I should say that by the way
some of these examples I'm not getting
these all out of my head I'm getting
some of these from this wonderful
Android design patterns book by Greg
noodleman if you guys any any of you
guys familiar with this book or any of
you guys Greg noodleman
oh did he yeah I've seen him speak
so yeah I'm but a pale imitation of mr.
noodle Minh but anyway this is a great
book and he's got a lot of good examples
and a lot of examples that come out of
these examples too the woody pointed out
here is that the Nova series by Gameloft
that you have an artificial an AI
assistant who asks you to check your
guidance systems before you're starting
the game and this actually gives you a
chance to try out all of the hoops sorry
all of the game moves and various things
before you start the game and it's more
or less in in real time right so if at
any point in certain games you can you
can bring up a contextual dialogue a
contextual interactive thing where
you're actually again learning what you
need to do and if I'm not mistaken
Lumosity does this too they have the
same kind of pattern so you might be
trying some of the drills and you forget
what you're supposed to do and it's very
easy to find the help there but what
they don't do is they give you some page
of text that's it's out of sync with the
rest of the application that you're
supposed to memorize that information
and carry it with you to the place in
the application where you actually use
it so the next couple of anti-patterns I
have a related to search and refinement
so one of the problems you have is when
you're searching and I know Amazon used
to do this there's another app out there
that I need to try it's called the find
and this is where you have a separate
page for search and another page for
result refinement so imagine if you're
doing a search and you have one page
with a whole bunch of blank space on it
that could be used constructively but
one page one search control you type in
your search query and then you go to
another page to refine the search well
and then you you you get your sorted
results or your filter results and then
you discover that well the thing I'm
looking for isn't in the
results so I need to go back click click
I'm tapping twice to go back and I
changed my search term again and then I
tap next and then there's another place
to refine my search again and I go back
and forth obviously doing this enough
time is forcing me to lose my stream of
thought in my concentration and it
results in another anti pattern which
Greg Nudelman refers to as pogo stick
and we were actually jumping back and
forth between controls another one he
called this is crippled refinement and
this is where you have search options
that are basically dumbed down or
simplified versions and web equivalents
I mean if I have a web a web application
and I know Amazon again used to do this
if I have a web version of Amazon and I
get all of these different search
criteria that I can use and then I have
a mobile version and I have only a
limited set of those it sort of starts
to beg the question what use is this
mobile app I mean why don't I just wait
to get to the web version of it again
this is this is the kind of thing that
can result in pogo-sticking because now
that I have a limited sort of limited
range of things to choose from here I
may need to go back to the beginning
change my search query query again with
these dumb down equivalents or else go
back and forth between the mobile app
and the web app and then what's the
point right what's the point of having
the mobile app at all why don't I just
do everything in the web app and
obviously the last sort of anti-pattern
I have and the thing that I want to
close close you with is the whole thing
of pogo-sticking and this is where I'm
jumping back and forth between pages to
achieve a goal in the old version of
TripAdvisor they used to do this so I
opened my TripAdvisor and I have a list
of a list of basically trips but there's
not enough information on that main
activity
under each trip - tell me enough to make
a decision so I need to drill down
look at that thing in detail get the
information I need and then go back one
level up in the application - to
actually make my choice and then maybe
I've forgotten what I just saw in a
detailed view so I need to go back down
to the detail again or maybe I need to
do this several times for several
different options and you can see how
that just blows your concentration all
to hell so that's kind of what I have on
UI design and what I have on
anti-patterns right now normally when I
do this with the class it's a bit more
interactive because I have a bunch of
students that I can I can make do things
whereas I don't have all of you do you
have any uh any questions for me or
anything you want to ask me right now
before I ask you the final question
that's going to win you a seat at the
what con was it against Asha and DEF CON
yes so what questions you have for me
I've heard that also I've heard that
sort of brought up in addressing the
anti-pattern like why they do it
but they're actually able to do is not
just make fewer choices but NIC smarter
ones right so your search criteria and
then those search criteria actually
become the criteria in the real app as
well because they're smarter one so
they're not just knocking options away
but they're making smarter ones it maybe
cover some of the other possibilities
there are so that's that's one way to
address it I think when we were talking
about the anti pattern here that we're
just taking options away so and I guess
that's what you have to do when you're
on a time you know limited time and
limited budget anyway so who knows you
know thank you for having me today I'm
still learning my way through this and
it's it's a very exciting journey and
I'm learning so much from giving talks
like these so thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
