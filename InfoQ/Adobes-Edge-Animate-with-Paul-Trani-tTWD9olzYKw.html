thank you guys for hanging out with me
today or this afternoon I know it's been
a long day along couple days for a lot
of you so I just really appreciate it
I'm going to dive right into this
content I'm going to make it worth your
while as my plan obviously I'm going to
be talking about edge animate and
animating with a web standard CSS HTML
things like that who in here actually
has downloaded edge animate I assume you
guys a pretty educated audience so a
couple of you okay well cool you guys
are going to be asking me the hard
questions right since you've already
downloaded it that's awesome so I'm
going to go ahead and you know dive into
this in a second my name is Paul tranny
there's my email address even beyond
today if you guys have any questions let
me know
ptra and I added oh be calm I'd be happy
to help you out because it's my job
alright so by all means let me help you
and I guess I have a picture of me when
I was a kid because I still like to play
I'm like a designer at heart kind of a
developer by force of will more than
anything but I like to create things
okay and I will use whatever it takes to
create things and just to make cool
things happen I'm here to impress people
I guess I've low self-esteem
so I'm looking to impress people
apparently who knows why but nonetheless
I could imagine most people in here are
you know more developer oriented and you
know I don't want you to think the edge
animate is one just for designers and
two just for animation okay because it
can do more than that it's you know we
make tools that ultimately make your
life easier is our goal and if we're not
doing that if we're not making these
tools for you guys and not meeting your
needs we're not doing our job so let me
know even you know when it comes to
feedback on making this product better
because we just launched edge animate
1.0 probably about two weeks ago but
again you know I throw up the shirt it's
like which which are you designer you
developer you know it's like whichever
shirt you think is funnier is what
and kind of you know you might tend to
lean towards so anyways but it's for
both audiences everybody in the room but
it's interesting if you start to look at
HTML and I won't go into all the history
but I think you know for a lot of say
designers and people that were doing
high-end graphics you were working in
yeah I said flash you're working in
flash a couple years ago right you were
working in it whether you like to admit
it or not you were working in flash and
it was awesome let you do everything
obviously we're in a different world
these days but I still want to see my
content everywhere and I'll I'll speak
to that actually just by a show of hands
I could be totally wrong who in here
uses or has used flash in the past okay
good so like a majority of you have if
you've been in the industry longer than
shoot five years I think you're going to
be working in flash so you know you have
to face the blue square you have to
adjust you have to start to really dive
into code if you're a designer
definitely whether it's you know css3
html5 JavaScript and that's what that's
what you end up doing if you want to
make animations these days it's using
those technologies writing some code and
magically you get this nice little click
Me button you know and we can look at
these simple tasks and say you know how
can we make this make this easier for
you okay and that's what edge animate
does takes a lot of this writing of code
and refreshing content out of the way
okay so that's what edge animate does if
we take a look at it closer you know of
course since it's web standards it's
going to work seamlessly across modern
browsers it's going to allow you to
create accessible content which is grace
great it's intuitive it's easy to use it
won't take you guys long like I'm going
to show it to you and you should feel
empowered by the end of this be like
okay I can do this this is going to be
really straightforward and I think it is
you know and again it helps bridge that
gap whether you're wherever you're at in
the in the timeline from designer
developer allows you to work together
better this is just sign of some of the
the latest stuff and if I can talk a
little bit about
edge it once was called edge and now
it's edge animate but edge we've had
these certain previews over the past
like it feels like two years and you
know with the release of animate 1.0
we've had all these new developments
with symbols with web fonts all sorts of
things but I don't like showing you guys
these bullet points like bullet points
are boring I'd rather just show you what
it can do regardless of you know whether
you're designer or developer okay so
that's what I'm going to do I'm just
going to take this this this idea cut
like three projects that I'm going to
work on you know before I do that just
to kind of show you what it can do is
I'm just going to jump out here and you
know to show you a quick example of edge
animate what can be made with this so
this is Patrick Williams it's his
portfolio made with a you know an early
preview of edge animate but you can jump
in here you could start to filter this
say by Web Design and highlight those
products print design but you can see
how how this ultimately works it's even
zoom it down a little bit but you know
I'm basically highlighting that content
and you can click and watch it spin and
do all this fancy stuff you know this
looks again it looks like flash let's
face it
I'd like to create these compelling
experiences when I need to as well okay
and
I will get to this later as well but
edge animate is free edge animate 1.0 is
free so that's the one thing you need to
know you could go to creative cloud
right now if you had an internet
connection and it's kind of slow here
but if you add an internet connection
you can go to creative cloud comm our
site which is our our you know our
membership service so you pay 50 bucks a
month and you have access to everything
I'm not here to sell anything to you I'm
just saying you just go and you just
like you log into Vimeo or Facebook you
just log in with your email your
password and you can download edge
animate right there okay there's even
some other cool tools like Edge code
some other things but that's where you'd
get it you can jump in and download it
today okay so you were inspired you have
it downloaded it's on your desktop now
now let's go ahead and see how it works
as we open it up okay first of all we're
greeted by these in-app lessons which I
have never been particularly impressed
with but I like how we've done it here I
think we've executed it really well when
it comes to these quick lessons so I'm
just going to go through each one of
these no I'm not going to go through
each one of these guys no we don't need
to do that we're going to go to file new
because what are you going to do you're
going to forget those in-app lessons
you're going to create a new file and
say okay this is cool and you can start
to take a closer look you're like okay
what does that say that's an HTML file
that it creates doesn't create any sort
of binary file format it's actually HTML
page I will be editing okay and it's
going to allow me to create you know
HTML some animation using HTML CSS and
JavaScript so from there I can see that
it's called HTML I can save it out and
I'll just save it and call it index okay
and now I can start creating things in
here if I want to okay
so right up here at the top just like
you'd expect in any program you have
certain number of tools that you can use
you can use this rectangle tool so
you'll dive in here and you'll start to
draw you'll draw say a box and what this
is is this is a div that's being created
so we basically are animating
dibbs we can see it over here and we can
call it my header whatever we want
doesn't matter but I'm pointing out that
that's a div and that's what's being
created okay I can start to control it
visually again I like this being able to
control this visually its position and
size coming over here the properties
panel I can manipulate it as well over
here but this is the part I like because
I want my content to be flexible I just
I don't know as far as it being
responsive I want to make sure it always
fits on the screen just right within my
browser so I can come in here and say
hey you know what all these hard-coded
numbers not a fan let's go ahead and
make sure it is always 8% from the left
edge and also from the top make sure
it's 32% I can even come in here and
change the width and the height but
basically it's going to be scalable now
okay so I can also even make make sure
the canvas is is scalable but in general
what I've done is I made sure this is
this content scalable I can grab this
marker up at the top and I can see that
this content is scalable and flexible
okay and that's what I want but I still
want to be able to create in here I'm
creating more of a responsive design I
can change the color and do the obvious
okay you guys can figure this out if
you've worked with Photoshop or any of
these programs it's pretty easy to get
squared away coming down here you know
it's it's not cool these days unless you
round to the corners I can round the
corners as well and make that really
easy just like that okay I'm visually
manipulating these properties and that's
what I want to do in fact as I roll over
it
take a look says that CSS border top
left is you know top right it's giving
me all those CSS properties so when you
roll over these different items it'll
expose that code to you so you know
what's being written okay easy enough I
can I can draw that
I don't know that gorgeous rectangle I'm
bored to death this is not good I want
to liven this up some so what would you
normally do is you'd probably go grab
some graphics so I could come out here
and take any sort of web web graphic you
know ping file
a JPEG and drop it on in and start to
position this content so I'm visually
working right in here okay and you can
see it wraps these in a div so I have
control over them okay and you know
you'll start to know notice some issues
like such as this text is overlapping
the watch well you can control that in
your elements panel so I can say you
know what for this tech and trends this
title I'm going to move that down okay
now it's behind that watch okay all
right so this is my project I'm starting
to get it squared away I can import
graphics I'd say this is looking good I
need to bring this to life ultimately
I'm going to drop in some text in fact
let's come in here and add some text so
this projects about sort of the 1980s
if anybody have one of these watches by
the way I don't know if anybody did
right who still has one of those watch
go look down do you have it you better
not kidding it's actually cool because
it's it's kind of like the hipster thing
to have nowadays so it actually is kind
of kind of cool to have one of these
watches so nonetheless I can come in
here and you guys who raised their hand
we're actually on the cutting edge back
in the day for sure okay
nowadays it's the iPod Nano that that
has the watch band that sticks to your
wrist but nonetheless I dropped in a
font
you guys aren't impressed and neither am
i because we need to go beyond these
fonts as well and me as a designer I
want that full control so I want to add
a font okay so in here I can jump in and
add a font so I want to add a web font
now you guys are probably familiar with
this you know it can jump out and go to
Typekit or google fonts whatever the
case may be
use that embed code right here and place
it right in there and start to use or
have access to these fonts now so I have
the embed code that points to basically
these fonts I can pick a font from my
Typekit here I can take this kegger font
as you can see right here tells me how
to use it which is just says hey you
know what type this in and you'll have
it and that's exactly what I can do is
drop it right in there
and add that font okay and now you can
see what it does it not only shows me
first of all what was just added but the
the the system fonts and then the fonts
I've just added ok so visually being
able to see this okay
visually scaling this up I'm just doing
a click and drag to increase that font
and that's what I want to do is be able
to work you know visually just like that
and position everything accordingly
alright so so far so good I can start to
you know again make sure everything is
scaling just right which is what I'm
doing now like that alright there it is
alright this isn't going to win any
awards but it's a step in that direction
you know so as you can see I didn't
actually reestablish the position but
you can see how it scales all that
content okay pretty pretty easy pretty
pretty straightforward to do let's go
beyond this in fact you guys are
probably curious I did actually run it
in my browser let's run it in my browser
again let's actually fix that issue as
far as its position in size
all right so let's run that so that
that's working a little better and I can
always fix that if I want to let's open
up our developer tools just so you can
kind of see what's going on we can see
my content right there it's getting
scrunched a little bit and I can always
fix that but from there you can start to
see the code that's being generated
right down here you can see that this is
CSS I can start to take a look at all of
this content stepping through it here's
my header you know and you can see that
this is CSS that you could always change
if you want to all right so this gives
you a quick preview of what was
generated I can take a look again in the
folder that I was dealing with here's
the content that is generated okay I've
been working on this HTML this this file
don't let it like concern you at all
it's just a file that tells me where the
timeline marker is what color the
timelines are for those different items
it's all based on sort of edge animate
it's it's not really needed because in
the end in the end this HTML file is
what's being used all right guys I'm
going to open this up and I know you
guys are is anybody surprised that I
opened this up in Dreamweaver because
you know what I work for Adobe alright
in case you're wondering
but huh yeah I do have brackets I was
going to use brackets I know they showed
it off earlier I would love to write so
yes I can I can exactly I can use
brackets but overall I'm going to open
this up you can see yeah I could totally
use brackets but you can see the
different items right in here everything
from the the different Dom elements you
can see right in here JSON is what's
being used but if you take a look it
starts with this HTML file and it
creates basically all of the items based
on this preloader if I scroll down it's
going to load in this index edge and the
edge actions so all my content is going
to be in this edge
J's file and then my actions will appear
in here as I start adding interactivity
to it but if you start to look at it it
starts to you know seem pretty darn
straightforward you can see the
different items that are created
everything from my header the tech
trends graphic you know where it's
positioned you can see that that's
relative and I can control any of this
by and manipulating it accordingly but I
did mention that I wanted this content
to also be you know searchable as well
okay and that content is dynamically
being created by JavaScript in those
various Dom elements are being built but
I can actually make this actually static
if I want to insertable if I go into
publish settings okay so I can publish
this content as static HTML if I want
there's additional things I can do so I
can publish this for even older say IE
browsers using Google Chrome Frame is
what it will default to so it will play
that content and I can even load the say
jQuery frameworks by CDN if I want to
but with that checked I could just make
sure that's saved I can publish it out
and it puts all of those items in this
Web folder I feel like I have an extreme
echo but nonetheless it's created all of
these graphics right here and
from there
I can open up using brackets otherwise
known as edge code which you can
download so brackets is the open source
version edge code is our version where
we can do additional things when writing
code like we have a color picker web
fonts is another thing but since
somebody mentioned it I'm going to go
ahead and use it so jumping in here just
to show you what's being generated I
will open up that particular folder and
you can see right in here the different
divs that were dynamically being created
it actually just has them in this static
file so you can see how it says 1980s
techy for instance and then my other
items that are created so that's your
static HTML that's generated you know
pretty straightforward
you know overall that's what gets
generated and it all seems to make sense
to me so all right
again let's let's move beyond this
because you guys probably aren't
particularly impressed yet I know I'm
not I'd like to bring this to life a
little more I can start to add more
elements and create what I want like I'm
doing now
but I want to go beyond this content and
it being static I want to bring it to
life so in order to do that it's really
just a matter of selecting the item and
if you guys hear anything I say right
now you need to press this button right
here auto-keyframe mode if you don't
have this on it's not going to animate
but basically when I turn that on
whenever I move that object or change it
it's automatically going to add
keyframes okay so if we take a look say
for instance at this text which is 1980s
that's what's selected I can turn on
AutoKey frame mode
and now when I move it watch the
timeline it generates that keyframe so
if I start to move it and rescale it
whatever the case may be it starts
generating all those keyframes
automatically okay and that's what I
want generate these positions so I can
have it start maybe right here on top of
the watch and then I can scrub my
timeline in about one second and then
move it into position watch what happens
when I let go it creates that transition
as you can see right there from 36%
clear over to 12% as it gets closer to
the edge so you can see that slide out
just like that that's the only property
I have manipulated so now I can start to
have fun with this it's like okay well
have techie start in the middle make
sure that's turned on you know move it
accordingly you can see the keyframe the
initial keyframes created scrub in one
second and then move this into place
like that okay
you know notice how notice how it's a
little higher and I'd actually want that
lined up okay but I don't want it to
generate keyframes so again I'll just
turn off auto keyframe mode okay so I'm
turning that off and now I can move it
down so it's not going to automatically
add keyframes and screw up my animation
and now I can turn it back on but
nonetheless you can see that content
slide out let's do some more fun things
for instance this this watch I want it
to be on top I can move that to the top
I can start to animate it maybe it
starts out small I can manipulate you
know whether it's the size or position
or scaling but I can have it start small
like that and again auto-keyframe mode
is turned on I can make it small and
then I can go one second in and bring
this back to 100% okay so it starts
small and it comes out just like that
I'm hitting that spacebar and you can
see how that moves okay not not bad I
still need it to be much more slick
overall so if you guys could just watch
me as I work I could turn on AutoKey
frame mode for this maybe start with it
at 0% opaque and bring it up to about
100% and that can fade in okay
so you can see how that goes
and last thing I'm going to do for this
animation again this is your
introduction to animate is I don't like
how this linear easing is going on it's
a straight animation that transition and
it stops in the end so give me more
flavor like let this watch I want this
watch to kind of bounce in okay let it
do something fun well again for those
two transitions I can adjust the easing
so I can say hey you know what on the
ease out I can have it slow down
better yet on the ease out maybe it does
a bounce okay so we could try the bounce
for instance again visually being able
to see that and then running it okay it
bounces really straight forward and this
is where I start to have a lot of fun
because I can take these elements like
the text and I can make them ease out if
I want to nice and easy and have a
little more fun with how everything
moves alright pretty straightforward you
guys are I mean this is pretty
straightforward right I hopefully you
guys can like if you haven't downloaded
it you can dive right in and start to
manipulate anything in fact notice how
I'm still on that HTML file you could
take your own HTML content open it up in
edge and add animation to it okay so by
all means try it open it up we could
still take a look at the code but it's
it's going to be animating these various
transitions but let's go beyond this I
want to show you a couple other really
cool things because I need to get into
interactivity as well
okay so writing JavaScript and doing
different things so let me do one more
thing with this little guy right here
okay I can take him and I really want to
have all these little bursts since we're
talking about the 80s I want to create
this animation and I want to make it
reusable I could take any object and I
can convert it to a symbol okay so if I
convert it to a symbol what does it do
it actually gives me an independent
timeline just like those of you that
know flash like it would in flash so
here's my new symbol let's just call it
burst I'll click OK
so here he is now in fact if I
double-click on him I'm now inside of
stage inside of that burst symbol okay
so now I can have fun look at my
timeline oh it's nice and fresh I can do
whatever I want in here
in fact turning that on you know adding
some animation maybe it starts out at
ten really small and goes up to maybe
over the course of two seconds it goes
up to 100% like that in fact again let's
do the fun bounce or elastic how about
elastic let's see what elastic looks
like see that was that's nice and easy
and it slows down pretty fast when I
select that one okay so that's a symbol
or animation inside of a symbol in fact
if we take a look over here at my
library first of all here's the elements
that are actually going to be in my
images folder if I look on my desktop
that's where it will be but you can see
right there there's my symbols my bursts
okay even my fonts anything that I've
used will actually appear in this nice
library so I can take that burst say hey
you know what bring it in bring in that
burst bring in this burst right here and
start to have fun with it and again I'll
just move these to the background like
that in fact let's run this now oh
that's a scaling is horrible
there we go but again I'll just refresh
this you could see that nobody believes
that I got an art degree in here but I
did okay
let's face it I need to move past this
really but hey this is the 80s guys
let's just imagine we were back in 1985
you guys be like that is so awesome
right but you can see how all those
animations play and you can start to
control things at different times as
well okay so I'm going to I'm going to
get into this and I'm going to I'm going
to jump to my other project that I have
going on but you know this object I can
select it and say hey you know what I
don't want
to appear yet you're appearing way too
soon with everything else in fact you
know what don't you shouldn't always be
on in fact just turn on at this point in
time so if I look in my timeline I could
be about one second in for this object
and I can say you know what you happen
to be burst three I'm going to change
you to on so you're just going to turn
on at this point in time look at my
timeline says okay I'm off I'm off I'm
off and I'm on okay that's how that
works
I'm off and then I'm on there okay and
that's how that works so it's nice being
able to and this is huge understanding
how this works because otherwise you're
pushing things off the stage and it just
gets really messy so you need to know
how to turn things on when you need them
on and adjust those keyframes
accordingly so we have the first one
comes in the second one and that third
one but it's playback it's like always
playing okay so if you notice as I scrub
through even that second one that comes
right there
he's he's already been playing he's just
been turned off so I want to say hey for
you you know what your playback you need
help you need to play from the very
beginning okay so that's all I'll do
again this is the easiest way to do it
adding that in it's going to play it
from the very beginning right there okay
again for this guy right here this
bursts to doing the same thing play from
there okay
so I've actually just added some
JavaScript and you can see that bounce
all right a couple more things because
it does a I'm here to use edge animate
to bring something to life and it is to
brings it to life for the first second
and I want to have these bursts kind of
constantly going okay so in order to do
that what I'll do is I'll come in here
I'll say hey you know what for this
symbol I'll just double click on it so
I'm inside the burst symbol and I was
controlling the timeline a second ago
but you can add JavaScript to the
timeline as well so it automatically
plays it goes like that
and then it stops right here and what I
want it to do is play in Reverse and
then play again so you can add
JavaScript to your timeline by inserting
a trigger so right here let's insert
that trigger I've clicked there it opens
up this trigger panel and you can see
right in here maybe you know what to do
maybe you'd write help me I don't know
but we can get rid of that comment
altogether and you'll see some handy
code snippets right over here so I can
say hey you know what play in Reverse
clicking that perfect play in reverse on
the timeline it's that simple
if I take a look right down here those
you're familiar with flash you start to
see this resemblance like okay that's on
the timeline I see what's going on it's
going to play it in Reverse it's going
to come back over here so I'm just going
to add another basically another another
keyframe of code that just says play
okay so now it's going to bounce back
and forth that's what I want now if I
run this you can see they bounce in and
then they and then they go away at
different rates so now I have something
more fun and entertaining controlling
that timeline with JavaScript you saw
how I added a code snippet okay so so
that's your that's your crash course in
edge animate I'm going to take this to
the next level okay that will like blow
your mind
wait no go ahead what you got
the the only thing you have to do and
the reason mine's a little funky is
because I didn't turn on say for
instance these objects I can select them
and I can as far as its its width and
height it's a matter of hitting this
button right here actually take that
back I don't know let me just let me
just take a look here scrubbing in right
there
selecting this object I should be able
to control the width and height but
usually if I want to change anything to
be scalable or positioned dynamically
like how everything's kind of stretching
and stuff and contracting its flipping
this switch it says hey you know I won't
be 75 pixels from the side I'm going to
be 13% from the side oh yeah I did in
fact if you do want to see if I click
the the stage because this stage is just
one big div but right in here so see the
stage says it's at a hundred percent so
that's what I did earlier on I said hey
you're at a hundred percent now control
my items have them scale and move
depending on you know the the width of
the stage or height of the stage so ya
know those are good questions and I
would I would come in here and start you
know flipping the switch for all of
these as I say like that alright let's
go beyond this because again I feel like
we need to we need to take this up a
notch okay that's your intro that's fun
whatever it's like creates all this some
various JavaScript that we can look
about look at later let me open up a
more complex project that will hopefully
impress you a little more but I wanted
this to be kind of a easy transition
because now the rubbers meet in the road
we're like okay I've created this
project now again 40 years of technology
and trends okay and I've started create
like a div basically a symbol a symbol
for you know everywhere from the 80s to
the 90s to the 2000 to 2010
okay so this project got a lot more
complex but I'm inside of the 70s okay
so you can see it right in here and
again I can make sure these this
keyframe auto-keyframe is turned on and
I can start to move my objects but what
am i doing it's like I kind of I usually
start with all my content in its final
position you know that's how you end up
designing you're like okay here's the
final screen and everything kind of
comes together so what do you do you
import everything you put everything in
position and then your first keyframe
you got to push everything off and then
you go in two seconds and then you bring
everything back so you can see how
there's that duplicate work now this
this is going to blow your mind because
or I should say it's going to be hard to
wrap your mind around it because it's
not in any animation software that
exists today that I know of okay so it's
not in After Effects it wasn't in flash
it's like animating in Reverse and it
has to do with this pin tool this pin
tool will save your life as soon as you
understand it I just think it's really
really beneficial because again these
graphics I want them to animate up and
out okay but right now they're in their
final position okay so what I can what I
can do rather than going through that
whole process that I mentioned is I
could use this pin tool so I'm going to
turn on this pin clicking there and it
gives me this pin and what this pin does
is it says hey you know what I'm going
to pin the properties of this object to
wherever this pin is okay so wherever I
put that pin that's where I want its
size and position to be okay so again
you know I feel like I need to repeat
that a couple times but let's just show
you how it works I've turned on the
toggle pin tool I've animated or excuse
me move that pin out there one second
now watch what happens to this Polaroid
if I move it down
watch it generates basically two
keyframes it generated the start
position which I just moved it to but it
says hey you know what I did
overwrite the original position I just
moved it down here okay and that's what
it does just moved it it moved that
content down there so this makes it
really easy if I take this and I'm
saying hey you know what you know again
there's no keyframes here this image
move it on down again pin tool is
activated it generates those two
keyframes you know oh you want to rotate
it I can rotate it it generates that
rotate as well taking this object the
same thing I can just start to play with
this and it generates sort of all those
keyframes and I really like how that
looks
okay so let's ease out and add a little
back to it but again I just quickly
created that animation by using that pin
tool so explore it it kind of enables
you to animate in Reverse
and what you end up with again is
something a little more advanced as you
can see here that content slides out and
there's more things on that timeline
that bounce out as well and everything
is scalable okay so that's what I like
using the pin tool for just making
production of animations faster all
right okay so we've gone into sort of
your advanced animation and if we take a
look at this content now I want to go
into a little more depth with
interactivity because here I have this
this Polaroid well let's make this
Polaroid interactive okay so I want to
make this Polaroid when you click on it
it's going to play this timeline again
keeping this simple I can select any
object say hey you know what for this
object I want to give you basically an
action so I can right click on it I
convert it to symbol earlier but I want
to open up the actions for that Polaroid
here's my actions gives me all of these
actions
you know click double-click everything
you'd expect some jQuery mouse enter
Mouse leave stuff some touch events for
mobile and here I'm going to go ahead
and select just click ok so it says on
click insert your code here for mouse
click so I can still use these same code
snippets and just say play and I could
get more advanced if I want to but I'm
just adding play right there so when you
click on that Polaroid it's going to
play this timeline okay and remember
that I just used that code snippet it
really is just a blank canvas for me to
write whatever JavaScript I want but in
here as I roll over I click it plays
that timeline and plays that animation
since this is the 80s that's my attempt
at humor I you know since the debates
going on and this is the 80s there's
Barack Obama in like the 80s can you see
him that's awesome and I couldn't find
Mitt Romney so I just used Jon Lovitz is
that all right no offense to anybody who
loves don't get me wrong I just was
playing around making it relevant for
you so nonetheless you can see how that
content plays out you click it plays
that timeline that content just animates
out I have that sort of control ok and
you can go beyond that there's other fun
little things I might have a TV does
some things you click through that it's
all pretty straightforward even this
wheel check this out adding that custom
animation which I can show you in a
second that plays that timeline in
reverse and then animates out the next
sort of batch of content going into like
the 90s you can see that content you
know with flip phones you know Yahoo AOL
CD ROMs it's really interesting like
just kind of adding the assets for this
like how far we've come the past you
know 20 years I mean even the past 5
years it's just crazy so all of this was
done with with custom JavaScript which
you can add in fact if I take a look
rather than jumping around to these
different parts in your timeline or
on objects you can go to window code and
you can see the code available for this
project
in fact I'll click not only these
certain triggers I can see those
triggers for those objects but I can
click on full code right over here so I
get this is basically my my edge actions
JavaScript file okay and right in here I
can start to write any sort of anything
that I want I mean I can just write any
any sort of JavaScript but I have on
click date request which index which
these those are numbers that gets passed
into it you know in here it'll the date
info array will be you know 0 1 2 3 I
think and then will wrote ultimately
rotate rotate rotate the wheel rotate
the triangle to the right location and
then play that timeline that it's all
custom JavaScript that's written that
you can add in here is that does that
make sense ok one more thing I'm going
to show you cuz I think I only have like
10 minutes and actually a couple more
things but again writing JavaScript when
I want to using code snippets just to
get familiar with it
there's API is available that I can
extend I know there people are working
on CMS's that you can use with edge
animate if you want to just to make this
content even more flexible so you could
have it as a designer animating what you
want to and plug-in some of that you
know some of those images or whatever
could be a link to say CMS going beyond
that again let me just open up another
example as we start to explore this this
whole theme
well I think it has CSS for some of the
what oh okay gotcha why does it use
JavaScript and not CSS and I mean I
think it comes down to what's most
widely available
it's like CSS you know it does still
have some compatibility issues so it
uses it does use CSS like I pointed out
earlier so it uses CSS where it can
otherwise it's using javascript for a
lot of the animation so yeah
okay well they can be they can be
synchronized I guess I don't know we'll
have to talk more about that so
ultimately I mean the big issue was
compatibility making sure it works
across various browsers and we know we
reached some limitations with CSS and
that's where we had to kick in with
JavaScript
you know some of even like positioning
there's no you know there's there's
certain things of in fact as I start to
roll over some of these objects you can
see that this is actually a JavaScript
property that we're implementing you
know but if we start to take a look at
the drop shadow or you know clipping
different things like that that's going
to be CSS related so yeah yeah the best
way to do that is is using the clip
using clipping you know if I wanted to
have something pop up as if it's behind
a window it's that that here's my
visible box which is your your clipping
box if that makes sense yeah you can't
get into like advanced masking where I
can draw something and yeah it's more a
matter of turning on clipping right here
and adjusting see watch how I can make
part of it disappear so I can start to
animate this clipping if I want to but
this is starting to treat it like a mask
but it's it's not but it's it's
definitely what's available and will
work pretty well other properties I
didn't talk about obviously we have
shadow we can adjust the cursor yeah and
there's even in some accessibility
options
not not quiet but we are working on that
I don't know if I'm supposed to say that
publicly but we're definitely working on
I'm sorry thank you
can you animate on a path if you wanted
a leaf to fall like that can you draw a
path and animate it and there definitely
we're working on that internally
hopefully that's public knowledge but if
not it is now hey so that's that's
exactly what I want you know as a
designer is more firm fine fine fine
grained control so and even beyond that
if you've if you've used flash you're
used to this flexibility you might be
used to you know certain you know
frameworks or even you know tween
engines
you know I've used say greens green sock
back in the day in fact if I close out
some of these but a lot of these
frameworks that were being used in
ActionScript are getting ported over to
JavaScript you know and here's one where
it's just it's it's tweens I don't know
if you've heard of green sock but you
know using these tweening libraries so
here I have and it could be any one of
them but here is a you know say tween
lights where i can use tween max but in
here i can this is the the object i
click tween it'll animate to that and it
does it based on this X and what these x
and y properties so that's the way
people started to animate they started
to animate things that are more complex
with code you know it was ActionScript
back in the day now all these libraries
are getting converted to JavaScript and
I'm just pointing this out to say that
you can use these certain libraries any
JavaScript library in edge animate as
well so and that's what's going on here
if I take a look at this code you know
say for instance if you click on this
car when you click on that car it uses
tween max which is that green sock
library and it scales it up okay so it's
going to start scaling up that whole
board and moving it into position so
that that car is being highlighted so it
animates that board scales it up and
repositions it okay using that library
which is awfully nice you know and if
you click on the board to go back it's
going to scale it back down to 30% its
original size and reposition it back
into place but here I can use that
library I can run this again on my
desktop if I click on that car you can
see it animates to it I'll click back on
that board and it animates back so you
can see how and again this is a typical
thing that you start seeing I saw it a
lot in flash projects but being able to
navigate around a you know a document or
just creating a compelling experience
like this is what I really like and it's
what first drew me to flash and that's
all using that tween max library but
here's the cool thing as well guys let
me just show you this really fast
because I briefly mentioned mobile and
if we take a look at this even on my
iPad if it's still running in the
background here
okay so here's my iPad it's that same
page and I want to show you again using
some of these I wanted to show you
performance if I click on that car again
you can see how it animates up and it
might be kind of hard to tell on the
projector but overall the performance is
pretty darn good being able to sort of
create animation this way so again touch
events available as I start to navigate
through this content you can see how
that works so again I like this I like
creating this content I like having this
sort of control using the timeline when
I need it and when I need to get into
more of this interactive like space with
where maybe properties are dynamically
being generated based on position or
whatever I start to get into JavaScript
which at that point I can start writing
what I want and using libraries that I
want as well as you can see that I've
shown here so that really is sort of
your introduction to edge animate
everything going from your initial
creation of an object or objects as you
saw they're getting into some more
advanced animation with interactivity
and then showing you how to use some
various libraries as well again I think
it's pretty straightforward but you guys
tell me and I can go even beyond that
because it's HTML so it could be used
anywhere where hTML is being used okay
so again that's what I like is being
able to you know put it anywhere you
want you know I'm not selling anything
I'm just saying hey go buy it you can
excuse me go buy it go get it it's free
go buy it I'm not selling anything with
it you can go buy it no you couldn't you
couldn't but if you wanted us to give us
money we we couldn't take it it's free
it really is and it's the 1.0 version so
it's not like say Creative Cloud it's
like you sign up and then you have this
membership and if you stop your
membership and you no longer have the
access to that stuff that's not how this
is set up it's like you download 1.0
today and you can own it indefinitely
and it's really our gift to you guys
it's largely driven by the community
edge animate so yeah guys hopefully
makes your life easier at the very least
open up your own HTML file in there and
add some interactivity to it as well
again you can either go to that URL or
Creative Cloud com there's my email
address and also we're hiring probably
just like a lot of people have said
today you know hey we're hiring so
that's really good to hear that you know
in today's market you know it's cool to
hear hey you know what we're hiring it's
a great place to work alright so that's
all I have for you guys I'm done thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
