before we get started I just want to get
an idea who you guys are so can you tell
me a little bit about how many of you
are developers in here all right well
it's great how many are sales engineers
anybody got volumes no its Muslim
developers God and how many of you are
done any Android work like crazy and
hello world app or something like that
ok God ok so today's presentation is
about Android at work so basically I'm
exploring some of the concerns and
questions that typically enterprise
customers cab when it comes to to
Android and so that's what we're going
to talk about today so before we get
started I'll just tell you a little bit
about myself my name is Marco garganta
and I have been doing Android training
for a while as a matter of fact I was a
developer americanus Android boot camp
couple years ago and since then I've
probably done at boot camp training for
thousands of developers for a company
such as cisco motorola drd Qualcomm
sprint etc so I've been doing a lot of
Android training I'm also co-chair of
Android open conference which is a brand
new conference we just launched this
year how many of you have been to
Android Open anybody couple you ok so
it's an o'reilly conference that
basically the idea is to cover the
entire ecosystem of androids everything
from ad development to the actual
platform development to the business of
Android so I was I was responsible for
the content for the conference in
addition to that I wrote a book it's
called learning android it was published
by o'reilly earlier this year and since
then it's been translated into german
and chinese and i'm working on another
book called programming honeycomb which
is really so is supposed to focus on
programming the tablet android tablets
so intricacies that we deal with when it
comes to programming for the tablets i
frequently speak at conferences I've
been a task on three times this is
actually my second time it's a sprint
developer conference I was
also speaker at the end def con ACMI
tripoli and i'm a co-founder of a meetup
in San Francisco called SF Android which
is a group of San Francisco developers
that meet monthly and discuss my
basically issues that we're facing as
developers when it comes to android so
that's a little bit about myself what
I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you
a little bit about the history of
Android first how we got where we got a
gotcha and then we're going to look at
some of the concerns that were facing
when it comes to android development in
the enterprise so as you guys know
androids been growing fast it's it's
becoming one of the it is the dominant
platform when it comes to a smartphone
market but what's more interesting is
that it's been growing really fast in
the enterprise as well so just to give
you an idea this is this is what we're
looking at in terms of the growth for
the data point is only 2009-2010
comparison but the point is that we're
seeing humongous growth in the
enterprise adoption and that's what I
really want to focus on so there are
reasons why enter it is really good at
at the enterprise adoption so before we
get into the whole enterprise talk just
want to discuss a little bit about
versions so you guys know what you're
talking about so these are the various
versions of Android sounds like a lot of
you many of you developers so you
probably understand that I usually keep
telling people that this version number
is not that important that this nickname
is somewhat important and then comes to
development this is probably the most
important number that we care about and
as you guys know we just recently got
the ice cream sandwiches the latest
release which carries the API level 14
so that's that's what we're at in terms
of just a little bit about the history
of Android these are the versions
historically just think kind of
understand how quickly things change and
how quickly things get adopted so
currently as you can see Android 2.2 or
2x to be more precise is what's the
dominant platform is so this is all to
point X basically part of the pie
we have very little android 3x namely
tablet version of Android adopted yet so
we're looking at just couple of
percentage points and there's still some
one x versions lingering around so the
data points look like this so as you can
see we're still in a single digit a low
single-digit for the tablets so that's
the number that we're looking those are
the numbers that are looking here or
more specifically these numbers um over
time the adoption sort of happens but it
doesn't happen as quickly as you would
like we would like it to to partially
because the OEMs are slow in releasing
the latest drivers and versions of
Android so what that really means for us
is developers is that we're often stuck
with older versions as well so as you
can see 2.3 for example is rather
quickly getting adopted but we're still
at more than fifty percent of the older
versions out there as well and we still
have a certain number of 1x platforms
lingering around that partially gets to
do also with the fact that users tend to
stick to their phones for a couple of
years as just as a part of how it works
in the US with the carriers so in
addition to regular Android versions we
also care third-party add-ons it's it's
almost impossible to get a phone
nowadays that that is a vanilla Android
so when you get a phone you basically
have an add-on for one of the third
parties on HTC Samsung Motorola are all
predominant players in that and what
they do is they customize the platform
extensively so beyond just adding a
couple of you know graphics or apps they
actually end up doing a lot of deep deep
deep down work in the platform itself
just to give you an idea the HTC
development team is almost big as the
original Android team that works on the
core android project so it's a pretty
significant amount of manpower behind
these customizations and of course we
have with Google as a as an add-on there
so almost every consumer phone nowadays
has
the word Google label on it which really
means that the carriers have done a deal
with Google to license specific parts of
Android technology that are proprietary
so in addition to just having the
regular Android versions we also have
the proprietary Google stuff and that
usually includes things like Google Maps
unless you have NAFTA TeleNav of course
includes gtalk gmail and things of that
nature so the point of the about this is
that this is proprietary stuff so once
you kind of get into the consumer land
the Android versions tend to be more of
the stock to da to the Google
proprietary technology so in terms of
enterprise questions one of the
questions that I often see come up all
the time is how secure is Android well
you know what do we know about android
security and security means different
things to different people so I'm going
to first explore it from the App level
so um in android applications are
sandbox what that really means is that
each application lives in its own
isolated environment if to just to give
you an idea what that looks like is this
would be a typical Android app process
what I mean by that is that basically at
the bottom of it all we have linux
process that runs on top of the platform
and inside of that Linux process we have
the dalvik virtual machine that's the
virtual machine that runs all the
Android apps now on top of that virtual
machine we load any number of what I
call the main building blocks these are
the things that make up a nap and those
are activities services content
providers broadcast receivers and such
you may also have certain data such as
like native libraries custom databases
that a part of your project some files
that belong to your application and of
course resources which are all things
that are not code such as graphics
movies video clips sound clips etc XML
layouts and so on the point of this is
that each app is highly sandbox in its
own in its own
sort of Linux process so one application
cannot access anything in other
applications space so from that point of
view it's that model is fairly secure
there's nothing that can actually break
that now every once in a while you want
one application to talk to another
application so to do that we have the
permission system and basically the way
permission system works is if you have
two applications so application a i'll
put the application a so application a
is requesting to use certain is certain
permissions so it's asked at actually
asking the user to have the certain
permissions granted to it application b
is really exposing those permissions so
if this is the if what the user is
granted to use and what the application
is providing matches like a union and we
basically have the ability to have one
application then directly talk to
another application so this activity for
example could start this service so that
would be that that's a model that
basically allows us to grant certain
permissions to walk up to a specific
application now the permissions are are
fairly granular so you can basically
fine-tune them based on various things
and and user can but the user needs to
grant them so the downside of this model
is that basically user has to grant all
permissions or no no permission
whatsoever in which case the application
doesn't even get installed right so at
the end of the day the the weak link is
the user which brings us to the whole
topic of social engineering so although
Android is engineered from the ground up
to be a fairly secure platform the
problem is that the users are doing
clink right so we often download things
from the market from android market and
we're just looking for instant
gratification we just wanna we want to
play the tank rebirths game we were not
really concerned too much about why it
requires to read our SMS messages or
read our contact contacts or connect to
the internet those are two things often
those permissions
make a lot of sense to users and users
tend to grant the permissions to to to
the apps because they're looking to just
test the app out so that's the problem
with social engineering aspect of
android security and probably the
biggest sort of challenge that we have
in android community right now like i
said earlier android is based on linux
which means that we're in carrying a lot
of linux features linux power if you
will and and that's a good thing because
android unlike blackberry for example
doesn't trust security to the higher
level java space it actually outsources
it down to linux and linux security is
something that we know much more about
then it's something that we understand
very well Linux has been in harsh places
over the years has been tightened and so
we know quite a bit of about that so
that's that's it that's a very good
thing about linux now the problem with
all that is that users tend to some more
not sometimes root of jailbreak the
device so what that really means is that
the user is trying to install a
different version of the operating
system or modify the operating system to
better fit their their needs so usually
what using is as an example to explain
what routing really is is we all have
with most of us have company issued
laptops right and often those laptops
you don't have administrative access to
write you you basically have just a sort
of a limited user account and the
administrator of that laptop is usually
your IT department okay so it's a very
similar situation in the mobile space so
as users we have a device which we don't
have administrative access or root
access over and the entity that that
does get the emissive access over our
device is you know in this case our
carrier so sprint would be essentially
our IT department so they don't want to
give us full access to the device
because if we mess something up we're
going to call for support and so what
users usually try to do is they try to
pull the system and basically
jailbreak the device and get their
version of the operating system on it
that usually involves intercepting the
boot process and what that means is that
basically it's kind of like on a laptop
you would press f1 or f2 and get into
the bias and you could pop in your CD
and basically boot from from your CD so
it's a very similar process on on mobile
we basically try to intercept the boot
process pop in our CD in this case
phones don't get get CDs but you can
basically put some download something
and put it in SD card and it serves
essentially the same purpose right so
basically what we're trying to do to
protect this is make sure the bootloader
which is kind of like your CMOS on your
laptop is is ensuring the authenticity
of the operating system right so the
bootloader tends to be the weak link and
some more advanced enterprise-grade the
devices tend to get the bootloader sort
of check for the keys and and verify the
authenticity of an operating system and
those keys tend to not be kept in
software but even kept him hardware in
chips so that you can't easily just
figure out what the keys on so that's
the that's a little bit about
bootlegging or or basically stealing the
changing the operating system now from
google standpoint and although the focus
has been the consumer and will be the
consumer for very long time Google
considers that they've been doing quite
a bit in terms of enabling the
enterprise users of Android so this is a
slide from actually from google i/o from
the android at work talk that was given
by their end but their enterprise team
so basically if you look at various
versions what you're seeing is that Oh
from version to version there's been
certain enterprise features baked into
the platform so what we have here is in
for Eclair which is the 2x version we
basically had the secure Wi-Fi was added
to the picture VPN support which we'll
talk about later on he has been added to
the platform exchange and overlaid for
contacts in Froyo frozen yogurt
on the significant thing that we got was
the support for device policy management
which basically supports all these right
so i'll talk about device policy
management later on but with with device
policy management we can basically
provision devices and manager fleet to
devices and kendall the devices that are
lost or stolen etc so that's a pretty
significant new addition to froyo
gingerbread got this couple other things
which are don't really have a lot of
security features but do have some
enterprise features such as the ability
to support jim priority inbox if calling
NFC calendaring etc etc and honeycomb 3x
version of android actually brought
quite a few new features from security
standpoint most notably what we got is
the ability to encrypt the entire hard
drive so basically since honeycomb you
can now provide the full disk encryption
on the device it does take a while so it
takes hours to actually encrypt a device
and it does provide the significant
degradation in in speed so when you read
from a device or when your application
is reading data it's about five times
slower than when it's just writing the
data when its rating the data from an
unencrypted device so you do you do
trade security in exchange for speed of
our performance of your application but
that's something that's that is now
available and it's significantly
enterprise-grade so that's a little bit
about features that google's has been
baking into various platforms one thing
to keep in mind is these are mostly api
sand and so on so often as an enterprise
customer they're quite a bit of work
that you need to do to actually make a
use of this but the plumbing is there so
the actual infrastructure for a lot of
the secrecy so enterprise feature
features is is getting ended to that we
don't have on this picture Ice Cream
Sandwich as a the latest version but
there hasn't been anything really
significant in terms of the
enterprise features in the ice cream
sandwich so that's okay next we are
going to look at openness of of Android
so when you consider different platforms
one of the key differentiators for
android is that it's open so what does
that really mean and why would you care
so one thing that's the day often point
out to is is the vision for Android so
back in 2005 when google purchased the
low company in polanta called Android
Inc a lot of people thought Google was
going to get into the market for
building the device a lot of us
predicted gphone right and at that time
Eric Schmidt the the boss of elf and of
Google came out and he basically said
look our vision is not a single device
are our vision is to basically create a
platform that's going to run on many
many different devices so this statement
is important because it trickles down
into a lot of both business and
technical things that that subsequently
have been addressed to accommodate for
that so both from technical standpoint
and from business standpoint is really
important because it explains a lot of
decisions that they may subsequently so
when you look at openness of a platform
on it's important to understand
different licenses it's not just hey do
we have the opposite open source or is
it not open source and so open source
licenses there are many of them there
are hundreds of them there may be a
dozen or so that are sort of important
and out of all those that are sort of
important they boil down into two
buckets or at least that's how I kind of
broke it down so the quicker the key
question is does the derivative work
fall under the same license or not okay
so keep in mind that like I said before
the mission of divisional for android is
to create a platform that's going to run
on many many different devices well that
means that many many other companies and
developers are going to be involved in
developing this well that also means
that if other people are spending the
time and money expanding extending this
platform they want to make sure that
they want to they can keep their
intellectual property if they choose to
write so what that really means is that
you need a license that enables people
to make changes to derived work and keep
those changes all rights that's back to
the the visual / ended that's very
important to to enable companies like
Cisco motorola HTC Intel Qualcomm etc to
actually spend engineering hours or
invest engineering effort on the
platform itself so Android for that
reason chooses that bucket of appliances
which basically boils down to the
following licenses it's either Apache to
MIT or BSD those are sort of the main
representatives of that space of of an
open-source licenses so you'll see that
in Android we basically try to keep
everything in that realm as much as
possible again so that's that's
basically the goal the other set of
license is falls under GPL or lgpl type
of licenses and that beta everything
that's that is derived from those types
of code requires you to give you derive
work back to the community in other
words license is not in the same terms
and that doesn't work for enterprise
customers who want to keep their secret
sauce secret right so that's why we try
to limit the amount of work that we are
licensing under the GPL or Algeria
licenses so with that how does androids
stack up so this is basically the
Android stack this is the entire big
picture of the operating system right we
have apps at the top we have so these
are applications this is the frameworks
like native libraries in them linux in
luton and drivers so in terms of that
applications and framework are mostly
licensed under apache2 license meaning
it's all open source you can make
changes to it you get to keep your
changes you don't have to open it up to
anyone else
the bottom part of the stack tends to be
a mixed bag so the native libraries a
lot of stuff here has been mostly copy
pasted from other open source projects
okay now when they did the copy pasting
or boring from other open source
projects they try to also adhere to that
licensing of you know MIT bsd or apache2
so we're mostly seeing those types of
licenses in there um the dalvik virtual
machine is licensed under apache2 so
it's very friendly you can modify it you
can optimize it to whatever you want
with it and you get to keep those
changes now the biggest sort of issue or
challenge is the the bottom part of the
stack linux kernel linux space and
that's basically we have two extremes in
this space we have on one hand we have
proprietary drivers right things that
come from OEMs for example radio stack
from HTC or GPS tag from Qualcomm and so
on those things then tend to be very
proprietary and they tend to be very
close source so we do not have access to
that okay so that's sort of one extreme
the other extreme is Linux itself the
Linux kernel linux kernel is licensed
under GPL so which means any changes go
back to the community right so we have
basically in this bottom part of the
stack we have on one can overlay closed
source and then overlay open source
right whereas everything else is sort of
more of a middle ground so that's a
little bit about the licenses now that's
what android stack looks like what about
honeycomb honeycomb is so far not open
source we do not have what cuz open
source for it initially we were told
that well that the source code is going
to come that we just don't have it
because they're too busy and that was
the initial statement but a according to
andy rubin the boss of android project
you know nothing is really changing
nothing is really changed about the
philosophy of android so it it seems
like there's no there's no need for
being concerned but at the same time
although
they said that the source code is going
to become available later on the changes
that statement to it's never going to be
available so so kann ich komme seems to
be an exception more than a row when
it's all said and done when you talk
about being open one of the things that
it's important is the community
leadership right so when we think of
open source projects we don't think just
hey here's here's the source you can
actually see it but we also think in
terms of the community that drives what
gets built into the project next right
so usually open source projects are
people coming together saying hey these
are the features if you're looking for
and then essentially if things would get
done in terms of the you know and in
that in terms of that priority um
Android is different because Enric
doesn't really have a roadmap nobody
really asked you what you would like to
see in the next version you can you can
tell the Android team but then they do
have a list of feature requests but they
also have their own agenda and most of
us are not privy to that agenda we don't
really know what to expect until the big
turner now here's the new version comes
out right so it's it's a it's a
different beast when it comes to open
source the way we typically think about
it so no public road map and another
thing that also is kind of unique about
android project is the concept of bear
hugging basically picking the favorite
OEMs for each release so in the early
days it was HTC then after that it was
samsung then it was Motorola the word on
the street was that LG was going to be
next but we're seeing Samsung again so
basically the Android team picks a
favorite OEM for each release on it
wasn't so much of a big deal before
because all the all the members of the
Alliance which I'll talk about later on
had access to the same source code and
were able to innovate at the same time
on but with honeycomb he was sort of
different because Motorola basically had
some
thing like a six-month leads time when
it comes to developing for tablets and
that was the big deal for the tablet
manufacturers for OEMs um apparently
this is not going to happen anymore
according to Andy but at the same time
that said it was made before the
Google's proposed acquisition of
motorola mobility's so so we'll see what
happens with that so how does and will
compare to other platforms so if you
kind of stack it up against iOS or
blackberry so in terms of the the
adoption we're seeing that the the
market space for for the entities as we
most of us know he has really taken off
so we're right now in terms of the mark
is smartphone market so we're not we're
not counting the feature phones like you
know Kia's and so on Android has forty
three percent of that market so it's a
pretty significant chunk of the market
compared to iOS compared to blackberry
and some other ones Microsoft actually
has slid down from nine percent to seven
percent so we'll see how the call nokia
deal works out and if that if they
reverse that trend but in terms of the
enterprise space it looks like the black
blackberry has basically love the most
to the market share so as we know
android is open iOS is not there's some
fundamentals of fundamental differences
going forward in terms of features
they're going to be comparable we can
expect that but in terms of the
fundamental opportunities they're going
to be different just because iOS is a
closed box vertically integrated it's
always going to be more polished and
it's going to be a more of a complete
solution but when it comes to some
interesting enterprise features iOS is
not going to be as open as Android this
it's not going to allow for as much of a
customization as as android does so
close box vs open open system blackberry
is been
suffering like I said probably the most
and their strategy hasn't been quite
clear in terms of the that the tablet
space it this decayed the rocky start
there were a couple announcements about
supporting Android apps on playbook it's
unclear how that's exactly going to work
there's been mixed mixed sort of
announcements in terms of that in some
cases they're going to run it inside of
a sort of a virtual almost at virtual
environment in other cases they're going
to recreate the entire Android stack on
top of blackberry operating system and
the the third option was actually to
take Android apps run them through some
kind of process and create more of a
native blackberry app but technically
that's not very clear how that's going
to work in what the features behind that
are um what's interesting is that
enterprises side android has also been
something that the consumers are
starting to desire more than iOS so
traditionally what we had is we had the
iOS be the most desired operating system
but lately what we've seen is that enter
it actually is becoming something that
consumers actually want more than deny
phone now and it's not just that they
want a typhoon they can't afford it
because it wasn't on sprint for example
a network and now is but they actually
are desiring it for so this is a nielsen
study and as we can see Android went
from twenty-six percent to thirty-one
percent in terms of desireless whereas
iOS went from 33 to Tori so we're seeing
sort of the trend reverse the in terms
of in favor of Android so that's a good
thing so basically all this stuff that
we are baking into the platform is is
really good it provides for very solid
foundation but it's just that often it's
just a foundation so what that really
means is that a lot of other things
still are left for the community to
develop and by the community I mean
third-party developers or
companies that are sort of building
solutions on top of it so Google tends
to provide the infrastructure pieces for
the enterprise but we're expecting
third-party developers to actually
provide things on top of that so great
plumbing now another question that often
comes from the enterprise standpoint is
how do we how do i connect my android
devices onto the corporate network and
in the context for this before we get
started the context for this is that
that you're going to have consumers
bring their personal devices to the
corporation so basically the way it
works right now in corporate America
most of us have two phones right you
have a company issued blackberry often
and then you have your Android or iPhone
device right so most of us carry two
devices right one for business one for
personal use and often our personal
device is way better way more powerful
than the company issued one right in the
item IT department is pretty happy with
this because they control the company
should device you as a consumer are not
that happy because you would like to be
able to check your work email on your
iPhone or or your Android device
Google's vision for the enterprise and
it's a vision that not a lot of IT
managers agree with but their vision is
that there should be only one device and
it should be a personal device so
basically we're seeing that a lot of
development to make that possible and I
used to crisscross the country and talk
to sales engineers specifically for
sprint and in certain places there would
be like no way this is never going to
happen IT manager is never going to
allow a personal device on a corporate
network but in other parts of the
country corporate many IT departments
are seeing this as an opportunity
they're basically saying hey this is
kind of great like I don't need to
manage my own fleet of devices I can
just give 20 30 bucks to my employees
and they can you know subsidy I can
subsidize their own personal phone on on
our network so a lot of work has been
going into making this possible enabling
this so one of the
the big challenges of course is VPN
right so if you remember the slide about
features that have been baked into
Android over time well VPN is something
that was provided ever since Eclair so
ever since 2 point 0 Android provides
VPN support right so so that sounds
great however the problem is that it's
not any VPN that corporate America uses
right so corporate America tends to use
cisco or juniper or one of the main main
VPN providers android doesn't support
why not well the reason why we don't
have cisco in android is because this
girl is a licensed product right so if
you were going to put it into the
platform then that would violate or the
licensing and enter it would not be open
source and freely downloadable etc
setter so the way around that is to
basically not include proprietary stuff
but allow for an expansion slot
extension slot where somebody else can
actually licensed the technology plug it
in and ship it off right and that's
exactly what we're seeing happening with
carriers and OEMs so sprint and some
other carriers are starting to work with
their OEM partners like Motorola for
instance and are starting to license the
technology and basically plug it in and
make it available to to their enterprise
customers so so architectural e the
system is good and we're seeing the
enterprise customer the carriers in OEMs
take advantage of this for their
enterprise customers so that's basically
what's happening with the VPN support
there's also a sort of a unique feature
of android that they kind of want to
mention and that's a cloud to device
messaging or enterprise push which
basically allows for an enterprise app
server so if you have an application
that needs to send a message to a
particular device allows for an easy way
to do that so basically google has a
infrastructure that is a google
proprietary cloud solution
that you can use to notify your users or
so your application server can use to
notify the server now you may be
concerned about security here because
how are we going to what we're pushing
this sort of proprietors enterprise
sensitive data through a Google
proprietary server so that causes some
concerns but the point behind c2dm as
it's known cloth device messaging is to
only basically tickle your clients and
applications basically just to provide a
notification so as such you would never
really push sensitive data through it
but you would rather just use it as a
way to say hey there's something for you
to go and check so it's it's just a
notification system or a tickle more so
than the actual routing of sensitive
corporate data so it provides for an
enterprise push another question that
comes up is how do I manage a fleet of
devices I have all these devices out
there that my employees are using and
especially if we are allowing employees
to bring their personal devices to to
work so how do you manage this you know
it could be hundreds could be thousands
of devices so one thing that Android
does provide is since since froyo is a
device policy management API so it's
basically a new API that allows for
creation of applications that can
provide for secure administration of
devices so again this is just an API in
other words just plumbing that's prob a
kit into Android you still need to
develop applications on top of that oops
so a couple of things that that we have
as part of this as part of this
framework is that we can provide for
administration's such as enabling
enabling passwords so you as an IT
manager you can set quality of passwords
you can set the length of passwords you
can set how many times the password can
fail before the device gets notified to
either get wiped out or something
else you can prompt for a new password
you can remotely wipe out the entire
device basically returning back to the
factory reset mode and you can also lock
the device so that nobody can log into
the device and so as such it does
provide for quite a few features and
it's powerful but it's not extensive
there's still things missing in on top
of it so and you still need applications
that actually take advantage of that
Google provides one such application
it's called it's called google app
device policy manager and it's available
in the market you can download it the
problem is that it doesn't work on all
the devices or networks and so it's
really at this point a kitten mess if
this particular application is going to
work on a device on like I said a lot of
these things that we have our
third-party solutions are a lot of
things that Google provides our is the
plumbing and we still need third-party
solutions on top of that so here are
some some of those solutions in kind of
exploring what they look like so one of
them is a solution called 3 l.m or 3
loss of mobility 3 l.m is a company that
it was basically a spinoff from it had
to do with a PhD project at Stanford
that get them spun out into Google and
then spun out into its own project into
its own company tree ln they were
subsequently acquired by motorola and
with the whole acquisition water all i
may actually end up in google again so
where it started and but basically this
is one probably one of the strongest
companies out there that are dealing
with the enterprise great solution and
they're they're looking at things that
are needed everything from a full disk
encryption to securing the the
connectivity to the to the network to
providing all those device policy
management tools on top of your device
so remote wipe password enforcement
backup etc so so that's a little bit
about three aligning and what they
provide on this is just a in
the architecture model of sybase afaria
so sybase he has a pretty pretty mature
product they've developed it in a while
back before not specifically for Android
and what's interesting about it may not
be that well-known currently but what's
interesting about the far iya is that
with the Sapa acquisition of sybase on
this is going to become the enterprise
solution for SCP customers so that's why
it has some teeth to it it actually has
quite a bit of potential to become a
dominant platform for for Android in
terms of corporate and security as well
and then there's a there's a product
called good good mobile good for mobile
from good technology and it tends to be
more of a sort of secure island within
an unsecure system so basically what
we're seeing is that some some
third-party providers have this approach
to providing security by providing one
app or a sort of a Federation of apps
that provide a security so your device
may be untrusted but this particular app
and its connectivity to the enterprise
is trusted and that's what we're seeing
with good so basically they're saying
look if you want to get your corporate
email corporate calendar corporate
documents you gotta log in with in this
app within your personal unsecured
device so so that's that's another
approach to providing enterprise
solutions so what apps are there you
know their gazillion apps on the market
ultimately as an enterprise customer you
ultimately care about providing
productivity apps to make your users
product more productive that's that's
the goal of mobility in the enterprise
in the first place so what apps do we
have out there what's available so there
are many many business apps and it's
it's really hit or miss right now but if
you go to the android market there are
thousands of of applications and there
wyd everything from document management
0 to back up to you know accessing your
exchange to reading your documents in
the go etc setter so they're quite a few
applications but right now it's it's
really very much sort of a bizarre of
applications so it's a hit or miss on it
doesn't help that Google is not really
curating the marketplace dot dot wall so
it's really up to you as an energy to
kind of evaluate these applications
entrust the community in terms of what's
good what's up but per day the apps are
there in the number of apps is growing
there's some other enterprise solutions
like I mentioned that there more sort of
a buy from us and you get a suite of
apps and I'm we mentioned good for
mobile sybase afaria MobileIron is
another one and the Google itself is
actually doing a pretty good job so if
for those of you who are running your
businesses on google apps now solution
on the paid solution Google actually has
a pretty decent set of applications
everything from your gmail to your
corporate calendar to your Google Docs
corporate version so you can need your
documents an editor your documents on
the go on your tab and so on so so it's
it's a pretty good example of how
enterprise solutions for Android could
evolve so Google itself of course you
could build your own applications as
well so the often you're going to have
specific enterprise needs you need that
custom timesheet management or factoring
application or something like that so on
Android provide is a pretty good
solution for that the couple of reasons
for that is that it's fairly easy to
develop for android so it's java-based
there are a lot of Java developers out
there they can quickly get up to speed I
know the market right now is tight for
developers in its hard to find them but
the fundamentals are there to actually
have a decent supply of engineers who
can help you with the development so
we're going to
see this changing over time also there's
some solutions that enable easy
developmental applications even at the
level of an IT manager so Google has a
product called App Inventor which is
basically sort of like your WYSIWYG
drag-and-drop way of programming an
application sort of like you know the
foxpro of the is it wasn't atheist 90s
so it makes it really easy to develop an
application without actually having a
computer science degree at inventor came
speaking of opinion better it's been
recently shut down as a project at
Google and it's been open sourced and
the new home is actually MIT media labs
so it's got a new home right now so it's
kind of uncertain what the future of it
is but so for now it seems to be safe a
couple of other rapid application
development tools that I wanted to kind
of mention the fit sort of the same
category phonegap is one and titanium is
another they basically allow you to
build an app a relatively simple app in
something like Dreamweaver and so these
are two separate products phonegap more
notably gut acquired or the company Toby
that makes it recently got acquired by
Adobe so we're going to see phonegap
actually tightly integrated into Adobe
products such as the Dreamweaver so it's
going to become relatively easy for
third-party non-programmers to develop
custom simple custom apps for Android
platform and that's a good thing so you
develop apps you got your abs and these
are your enterprise apps how do you
distribute them to your custom to
customers you cut your customers it is
your workforce right so how do you get
these apps to your workforce take a
couple ways one of them is to put it on
the market so what you could do is you
could load it up on the market or one of
the other markets and in the past it
used to be that I could just talk about
this idea of multiple markets but only
really just point to one and that's the
Google's own android market so
that's really the google google runs its
own internal marketing that's probably
the best known out of all the markets
but as such it gets certain issues and
mainly Google doesn't really do a lot to
curate that market so it's really
anything goes in android market so you
basically you can download an app the
next second data app is available it
could be at all malware spyware virus
and that's okay it's going to go up
there and it's going to stay up there
until somebody reported and then you
need couple of those people to report it
to actually have anything happen to it
significantly so essentially what's
happening is Google is crowdsourcing
quality of its market or crowdsourcing
the curation of its parking and that
seems to be the the big problem in the
ecosystem it's given Android sort of a
bad name as the the platform with the
most viruses etc it's certainly not a
good thing when you talk about
enterprise customers and so on but
fundamentally Android isn't open
ecosystem so in other words you can have
many many different markets and for
years there wasn't really any big
traction until recently we have Amazon
is the big sort of force behind
providing other apps so that's a good
thing we're also seeing a lot of
boutique markets so a lot of companies
are starting to start create their own
well curated smaller shops right Cisco
for example has its own enterprise
market for its CS product and t-mobile
has its own market for its consumer
products or this verizon so this is more
from a consumer standpoint Sprint is
starting to curate ABS that are more
business specific as well so there's a
there's a sort of like a better version
of a market that gives you certain you
know confidence about the apps because
somebody actually went and checked them
out in namely Sprint or some other
carrier in addition to markets what you
can do is with the Android as you can
simply what's called side load and
application which basically means you
can put up an app that you created for
your workforce you can put it up on
your internet site and you can just send
a link to people or you can just email
it to your staff and they can just
download it and it's going to get
installed so in other words the
distribution of applications is not
limited to markets it could be just side
loading into devices as well so that's
that's a good thing in android one sort
of a stumbling block could be enabling
the unknown sources on the device so you
have to basically allow for unknown
sources to be enabled on a device for
this to work you can also create a full
fledge Enterprise directory what that
means is that you as opposed to just
side loading an application from an
internet site you could create something
like in android market it's just it's
private right so it's just for your
enterprise and we're seeing this
happening with larger organizations
there's their IT departments that are a
little more sophisticated and the
tooling to enable something like this is
actually becoming more widespread so
it's relatively easy or to create the
market put your apps up and point to
your work of workforce to the particular
market space so that's a good thing as
well so another question that I also
hear frequently from IT staff is how do
i log down otherwise so I have my
devices but I don't really want users to
be able to just you know access the
marketplace at all I want to control
this device much tighter and so forth
and when I talk about a lot of locking
down a device this is beyond just
provisioning a device with the device
policy manager API that we talked about
earlier right so the clean way of doing
this would be to provide for policy
management so in other words user can do
anything can download of you know Angry
Birds or facebook for android but when
it comes to the enterprise things the IT
controls the strength of a password the
lock internal divides the remote backup
wipe etc so that's that sort of the
device false management API approach
what I'm talking about here is more of a
rigorous log down of a device often
involves creating a custom image for
your device so speaking of the custom
image one approach that is that you can
do an Android and and you can't really
do on any other operating system is you
can create a custom rom and this is sort
of a big deal for a lot of enterprise
customers right typically I just to draw
analogy with the VC world your IT
department doesn't just install windows
on your own you're on your laptop what
they do is they create a custom version
of Windows installation it may be
preloaded with microsoft office he may
be preset with certain company
applications and so on and so forth and
so forth and they create sort of a gold
master right to CD and then the pop that
CD into every single laptop and that's
called a is called same image on every
single laptop in the organization well
with the Android you can do the same
thing you can basically create a custom
rom custom version of that Android
operating system and because Android is
an open-source platform so in theory
this sounds great there are couple of
problems with this one of the problems
is that it often requires special skills
not a lot of people have those skills
and so right now the tools to do this
are not available but this is something
that we're expecting is going to change
in a near future the other problem is
when it comes to devices remember the
bottom layer of the stack tends to have
some proprietary stuff right so the
drivers for instance of proprietor so
although yes you can relatively easily
create a custom image for Android in it
own it own your own appear to get it
custom image to run on a particular
device like evo for example on that
requires to have some stuff from HTC
that you may not be privy to right so
that's why working with a carrier or
but often with the carrier tends to be
you know the way to go because they they
have those relationships and they can
get that source code or those pieces
that are missing at the very low level
most of the drivers that's a that's a
that's one extreme that gives you sort
of godly powers over the device creating
a customer the other extreme is third
party apps so you could just download an
app and call it a day and that
application could provide things like
you know relative security and now apps
by themselves are limited because
because remember we said earlier apps
tend to live in their own sandbox right
so they can only do so much so that they
cannot damage the device or lick the
data so things like lookout or norton
antivirus and so on they basically are
more of a something that sits on top of
your device and it's a watchdog it wanna
ters what's going on so based on that it
may do different things so those
third-party applications tend to be more
of a just watchdog type of applications
in them as such they don't have a lot of
teeth to them but could be useful and
are definitely much easier to just
slices installing call it today
basically that one question that also
often comes up when it comes to the
enterprise deployment is what about the
fragmentation of the marketplace this is
not as a bad word now and then as it
used to be but it's still pretty
significant it's probably one of the top
ten questions that I I see come up so
what about the fragmentation of
different devices that we have on the
market one solution to that is sunny
cold compatibility test suite so Android
has scattered this thing ever since the
get-go ever since day one we basically
have a compatibility test suite and not
a lot of people knew about it not a lot
of people cared about it so basically if
you want to be on a good terms with
Google you would make sure that you
device adheres to compatibility test
compatibility test is something that om
and carriers care about a lot so
basically sprint and HTC would need to
run their device through this to make
sure that here's to what an Android
device would look like but then Android
if you put android and certain other
things that are not phone and don't
really have anything to do with google
proprietary stuff you may not care about
this we're taught there's a lot to talk
about m2m machine-to-machine
communication I've certainly worked on
projects when we put android and
everything from home automation systems
to cars to set up boxes to satellites
things of that nature even barges up in
the North Pole right so those devices
are proprietary embedded devices they're
not Android but the makers of those
device don't care about you know passing
any CTS and that's totally fine okay
they're just not going to be able to run
android market and are going to have
certain other limitations ah but what
we're seeing recently in is that Google
is basically using this tool CTS as a
sort of as a to quote one of the higher
up employees Google as a bat to hit the
do ms on the head and kind of force them
in a certain behavior and as such it's
getting a little more teeth to it than
it used to used to have and for us as
developers in and consumers and so forth
CTS is interesting because it usually is
a way to predict the future like I said
before we don't know what's coming out
in the next version of android it's
we're not privy to that right it's a
private road map however to enable
something they have to hear the devices
capable of that so CTS is usually going
to require OEMs to build some features
well ahead of time right then it's
needed so on NFC Near Field
Communication was one such example right
near field communication and over NFC as
you guys may not know may know about the
google wallet which is the sprint of
prosperity is a partner in that
project it's a it's a solution where you
can basically tap to pay at your
starbucks with your phone zero friction
you just tap and it's all processed
behind the scenes there's no pairing
there's no finding your network there's
no typing in a code there's no barcode
scanning none of that it's a very low
friction you tap and you pay right so
that's what NFC or near field
communication allows for well NFC is an
all technology it's been around 57 years
something like that but never really got
anywhere it didn't really get any
traction and what we're seeing is Google
stepping in using CTS as a way to
basically force OEMs to build that chip
into the device now om's prior to that
didn't really care about having NFC chip
because consumers didn't care about NFC
chip because nobody was taking the
payments via NFC so it's kind of like a
catch-22 nobody really wanted to support
it because there was no users for it so
we're seeing google basically break the
catch-22 by using this tool as a muscle
to muscle OEMs into certain behavior i
pulling the NFC chip into the devices
and suddenly driving that adoption so we
went from zero devices to like 16
devices or so on the market with NFC
capabilities so hopefully once we have
the chip we're going to have the apps
and then we're going to have the vendors
adopt the google wallet or similar
solutions and we're going to see this
this technology actually be useful for
consumers so what are some other
concerns that that we have in the
enterprise so these are some other
things that I'm seeing come up one of
the concerns are legal issues so we're
basically seeing you know the legal
landscape for Android be interesting to
say the least and within that you guys
might have seen this picture before but
this is essentially who is suing whom so
so the the arrow points to the defendant
and so basically if we take some of the
more notable ones so we can see that
Apple is suing a lot of people so is
suing for example motorola Motorola's
countersuing motorola microsoft account
the piano string each other HTC is being
sued by apple google is being sued by
some small company that i've never heard
of and by oracle / Java which we already
knew about this is the dotted line is
that it's been recently settled so
qualcomm nokia lawsuits been recently
settled we're seeing nokia be originated
of a lot of lawsuits it appears they
don't have a lot i was going on for them
so so we're seeing that we're also
seeing kodak interestingly enough being
you know suing a lot of people and then
companies in in a gray these are not
real companies these are basically
patent holders right so smart phone
technologies is one nobody's doing them
they're just doing others Sinclair IPC
acacia research and so on so these
companies are merely patent troll it
rolls right so they're basically just
showing other people over or adding
infringement so um you you may have seen
picture like that and a couple of them
are going around but that's basically
what's going on and that's one of the
concerns in the Android ecosystem
probably the best-known one is the
Oracle versus Google lawsuit so
basically what happen is back in the
discuss to do with Java so back in the
days of Sun or creating Java google
decided or and Google decided to use
Java 400 and but but it didn't use Sam's
job it basically used Apache Harmony
Project which is an open-source apache2
license friendly open jaw right in
addition to that Java is the language is
free and the tools are free in a lot of
other things
in java space or free but one thing
that's not is the virtual machine itself
so Andrew doesn't use the Java Virtual
Machine it created its own created a
virtual machine called dalvik now it
didn't originally create a dalek because
it 20 to bypass some kind of lawsuit or
orb licensing or you know skip skip the
money trap but Dalek was more created
because they felt that they can optimize
Java for mobile experience much more
than Java was so Java sort of
one-size-fits-all virtual machine right
it transformed anything from panel
computers like your blackberries to all
the way to the super computers like big
massive web servers and web server files
so such a Java has been sort of over the
years been more optimized over the web
app development because that's where
most of the Java deployment has been and
when Google team or Android team started
the project they felt that if they just
focus on mobile they can do a better job
and so they developed dalvik to be a
open source but be to be very well
optimized for the ships that go into
mobile devices so as you know most of
our mobile phones run arm-based chips
which tend to be much cooler in other
words run on a lower temperature than
intel so as such useless power so much
better than battery and battery is a big
concern for mobile because batteries are
not getting there getting better but
we're not we're seeing an evolution not
revolution in battles right you're not
going to have a nuclear fusion in your
phone anytime soon unfortunately so so
Daleks been sort of optimized to to
adhere to the small form factor with
batteries and so forth so such it's
using its basically registry-based vm
versus a stack-based vm and so forth so
so everythings be nice you know
everything's been nice and dandy in
Sunday's but then Google Oracle
purchased son is in with that Java and
basically went up to deep pockets which
is google in this case
and this day student for infringing on
copyright laws actually over the api's
in Java most recently judge has
dismissed about ninety-eight percent of
those claims but the lawsuit is still
going and it seems like it's a concern
but it doesn't seem to be a huge concern
so it's just something that I wanted to
kind of measure and of course we can
Apple suing a lot of other people as
well over H no Android patents so that
does it the legal issues another issue
that is sort of emerging is the whole
merger of Google and Motorola it's a lot
of people are not quite sure what
expected it right OEMs are certainly on
uneasy about the whole merger so it's
probably good it's going to be it's kind
of questionable why Google is doing this
on one hand it could be patents but does
it really make sense to be paying
something like thirty eight thousand
dollars per packing a lot of these
patents they don't care about they
really only care about about 18 out of
thousands of patents so it so that's one
one question the other question is you
know it's probably good for Google
because it's going to create a reference
device right so right now we kind of
kept the somewhat fragmented market with
many many different manufacturers this
may create a reference device easier and
create more of a sort of Apple
vertically integrated ecosystem as
opposed to you know your windows there
Intel sort of decoupled Louis lose the
integrated system ecosystem so it's
probably going to be good for consumers
and it's probably going to be good for
Google + and so on you know the question
is OMS there like I said feeling uneasy
about this they don't know if it's going
to be unfair advantage to Motorola or
not google says taking around the unit
independently so we'll see our concern
is also the open handset alliance so
Google bought and red ink in 2005 but in
2007 they created in a
Lyons called open handset alliance and
basically gave Android project to the
Alliance the Alliance really owns the
project it's print and Google and
companies like that are members of this
alliance now the Alliance although it it
has the power over android it's still
very young sort of organization so it
doesn't have a lot of governing statues
and so on so it doesn't have a lot of
power yet members are still kind of work
learning to work together with one
another so that's something to keep an
eye on on and and and so forth basically
it seems like that the source could
becomes available to members of the
Alliance much earlier than anyone else
so there are some advantages to being a
member but what it entails being a
member is unclear and it seems that
different companies get different
treatment so there was a the documents
were leaked in one of the lawsuits that
was unrelated to Android have to do with
the Wi-Fi scanning in Massachusetts and
in some of those documents we basically
got to see that samsung and motorola
basically had different terms for the
same membership rolls in the Alliance so
that's kind of how we get to know a
little bit about what's going on behind
the scenes so the question is what's
really the motivation for Google to to
do all this to create android and to you
know pay the bills of all of these
engineers thousands of them working on
the next versions and so on so forth so
initially in 2005 google so mobile
mobile as something that's going to
explode and at the same time they saw
mobile as a place where it's not really
a level playing field Google's was
successful in the web where you sort of
have you know its web is pretty open
based on open standards and everyone can
compete fairly but mobile is not like
that you have carriers and you can't
om's that are all all in the way so you
can't just do things your way you have
to play nicely with you know sprint or
verizon or t mobile as well as its HTC
and samsung and so on and to kind of you
know by an insurance
see for the future Google started
another project to basically give away
this technology this platform hoping
that it becomes an open standard for
mobile right and it's been very
successful at it overly successful and
since then its kind of changed also into
making money out of it by licensing
technology and by by doing different
things such as mobile advertising a song
so that's one way of where it started
when I was doing the research on you
know kind of motivation for Google came
across a document or blog post by Bill
girly he's a venture capitalist here in
the valley and he basically quoted
Warren Buffett saying you know Buffett
basically says when when I when I look
for a business I look for a business
with the strong economic castles that
that are surrounded with with
unbreachable modes and in other words
you want something that makes money and
you want barriers to enter so nobody
else can really compete with you on that
Google still makes 95% plus of its
revenue from a single product and that's
search right so that's the castle for
Google and the mode is anything that
comes in between the actual users doing
research in the air show Google servers
it provides a search right so in the on
the web that will the browser right but
when you look at the mobile well you
have the carrier and you kept the OEM
they can all decide against Google for
example right so that's one of the other
reasons for android project in the whole
support for that so that's another way
to kind of understand why they're doing
what they're doing so um so with that
that's basically all I had in terms of
the you know the the official stuff so
from the enterprise standpoint android
is a solid enterprise platform so it
does it does provide for Parata features
that that we need to roll out enterprise
solutions and
but a lot of stuff is missing so again
it's really the plumbing that we have
and we now need to build things on top
of that plumbing to enable the actual
applications that we need to be
introduced so with that we have plenty
of time for questions and I can only to
open up to see what you guys are dealing
with and what kind of questions comments
concerns you have yeah so is there a way
to add custom driver and expose it to to
enable Google Isis clinic good yeah yeah
so to kind of a to kind of bring up the
we had a picture of the stack before and
basically what you're looking at is
adding something to the lower level here
and yes you can do that and that doesn't
mean that you're going to break a cts
you're you're quite welcome to extend or
expand the platform you may have set a
new feature maybe support for hdmi
interface or support for a second
screener God does wallet right so that's
totally fine yes you can add a feature
you can also provide so if you're
typically if you provide a driver here
you would want to provide a library to
support that because in android the
driver model is actually based on
loading a shared object and as so so
it's not based on typical linux feeling
from a / dev device driver and so you
would want to provide an Esso library
here then you would also want to wrap
that elegantly into an java api so we
would basically provide the Java API to
that so at this point you would have
something here so that your applications
cannot access that so yes you can
absolutely do that there's a there's a
right way to do that and to basically
provided as an add-on an extension to
doing that on google maps would be an
example
that so it doesn't really use a driver
but it's an entire vertical slice so
everything from providing the
application framework piece to providing
native libraries piece and in this case
doesn't provide the drivers but a lot of
other solutions do do do that yeah so
absolutely possible in dual questions
yeah yes yeah so the question is about
custom permissions yes you can easily
create your custom permissions you can
bake them into the ROM so you can
actually make them available as part of
the platform you can also provide
enforcement of those permissions so
there's a place on them if you're
actually baking it into a rom it needs
to go into slush system / permissions in
it's an xml file that defines of the
permission is usually like I said before
in Android the permissions map to the
low-level Linux uid S&amp;amp;G IDs so you need
to this doggy there's a foul there's a
dot H file that specifies that so you
need to actually provide the mapping
from a high-level permission in android
to the low-level linux GID because
ultimately the way it's enforced the
permission surrender their enforced by
colonel so the colonel basically checks
does this app belong to a certain group
it's a standard Linux way of checking
stuff right and that's good because
that's very simple and it's very sturdy
we know a lot about it so now just the
question is called do you assign a GID
to a nap and that works to Android
permission so the permission that is
user grants to an application is then
mapped to the GID does that answer it
either way
yes there is a way we I actually have
that all spelled out in a document how
to do it ought to build custom custom
dimensions so if you want a simulator
and I'll provide you with that but but
there is exactly the way we have an
example we do this Android internals
class and basically what we do in the
class is we build one of those vertical
slices all the way from a top-level
application to the middle layer to the
library layer down to the colonel system
calls right so we build one of those
custom things and as part of that we
also built custom you IDs and g IDs and
assign custom permissions so we we have
sort of the recipe how to do exactly
that so all we have to share that with
you yeah it's it's more it's very
technical so yeah yeah yeah
so if an enterprise won't disable so if
an enterprise want to disable a camera
or something like that and so back to
the the device policy management device
policy management is somewhat limited it
can only do certain things such as
enable path it's got about six things it
can do like a length of password age of
password you know if you require
blocking screen locking wiping device
and so on so it's got only like half a
dozen or so policies on you may want
other policies like disabling a camera
and that's a pretty common one in the
enterprise you just don't want camera to
be enabled on a device sometimes it's
camera or network sometimes for whatever
reasons on and that's only that is not
provided by the device policy management
now why isn't it provided why isn't it
why is there's just a half a dozen
policies policies unlike permissions I
need to be enforced very low level into
the code so just coming up at the policy
is easy you can come up with a policy
camera or not allowed that's easy
enforcing that policy requires a surgery
to the operating system okay so that's
carter now with a custom rom you can
certainly do this sort of stuff and it
doesn't have to be it's not a hard
customization vairam there is actually a
ini file that specifies specifically for
camera is it allowed or disallowed so in
other words you know it's it's a fairly
straightforward change to the source
tree to turn that flag on or off but it
requires creating customer on flashing a
device blah blah and that that could be
a hard one to do keep in mind you know
Google's vision for the enterprise is
really to to keep users doing what users
do so they don't want you to
disabled users camera right so that's
that's not really within their vision
but they want to enable user to securely
access the enterprise it's still going
to be sort of like a user device with an
enterprise mobility inside of it versus
the other way around enterprise taking
over the device and that's why it's a
little tougher on the camera but having
said all that you could create a custom
rom and then your God you can do
whatever you want but that's a lot
possible lot a lot to work possible yeah
so hopefully that answers do then what
does three lime expanded capabilities on
not that I know about camera I'm not
kind of percent sure about camera yeah
so clear lens as far as i know is still
built on top of the standard AP ice so
they provide they basically provide the
actual solutions on top of that plumbing
so but they had a lot to do with the
bombing itself so they understand it
very well yeah
so so the question is it basically to
work with the turtle to work with the
oems to support the the enterprise
features right like Sam Sam Soon and
Motorola and so on right yes yeah so
what we're seeing is the question is
really about the extensions that that
you know OEMs provide and what we're
seeing is that certain OEMs are starting
to kind of focus on certain aspects so
everyone so everyone's basically with
the Android everyone is starting at a
much higher level so in the past you
know HTC would have to build their own
OS or something right now everyone's
start kind of starting with the Android
right so what that means is that the
innovation is now happening at a much
higher level and what we're seeing is
that each om wants to provide something
extra make their platform be interesting
unique different and so on and HTC
focuses on consumers so there the whole
thing is to focus on in making
everything look sexier nicer on Android
and they're very good at that on
motorola traditionally get it focus as
well was all about the consumer social
aspects of and both of usage but lately
what we're seeing is that Motorola is
actually taking the lead in the
enterprise adoption what that means is
there now enabling certain features like
expanding their platform with cisco VPN
things of that nature right and so
that's that's that's certainly happening
they usually provide you with the API so
that you as a developer can develop apps
that will now only
art on motor oil devices so so that's
that's a good thing because it doesn't
really require you to do anything with
them you just need to buy their phone
and you know develop an app for it and
you can take advantage of those api's
when it comes to you want something to
do something different and get them to
change how their API works you need to
be really big to get their interest so
typically you know 10,000 units plus at
minimum 2 to even like start talking to
you then again it really depends on a
carrier and so on motorola has motorola
solutions which is a little easier than
mobility when it comes to come custom
stuff but it's still very very custom
HTC or samsung they're like looking at
much larger orders to even cool you know
even consider making any specific
changes so does that answer your
question a little bit yeah
so developing an app so the questions
about developing an app that runs on a
sim card
yeah I'm not sure about that I don't
know about that particular so so I yeah
I don't know what what their approach is
going to be about you know requiring the
specific sim cards or Java running on
them at all my understanding was that
it's it's pretty open that you don't
really it doesn't really quite anything
other than NFC capability on a device
yeah well but so what aspect of a secure
element is there because
ok so it's outside of the Android space
in that case right yeah yeah I don't
yeah I don't really know much about that
but that double before their reader for
the audit for the device that the
consumers interacting with not for the
phone itself yeah I know much better are
the questions questions comments okay
well thank you guys um hopefully learned
something new about enterprise users
Android and if you have any questions
I'll stick around so just ask me awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
