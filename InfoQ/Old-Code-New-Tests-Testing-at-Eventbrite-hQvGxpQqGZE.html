this evening is unit tests and testing
at eventbrite and how we've taken this
code base that's been around for quite a
while and actually build a culture of
testing around it so the background of
this is that historically we started in
2007 there's no testing culture to speak
of and we started writing tests as we
started adopting Django because we had
they we they we had to it is impossible
to change your framework without
breaking something and we need to know
what broke in 2011 when I joined the
company we were still doing weekly
releases but it was not uncommon for
them to slip to the next week and end up
being bi weekly because we had in
reasonably high levels of regressions
and this is in contrast to today where
we have a bigger team we build on a more
complex architecture that involved
services as opposed to a monolithic app
we have a very robust test suite and
there are far fewer regressions it is by
far the exception these days when we
actually have to slip a release by a day
let alone a week because something
happens and this is I think this is
purely because of the testing culture
we've developed and we the great the
thing is most gratifying to me is that
there seems to be an attitude that tests
matter so what I want to talk about for
the next 13 minutes in 26 25 seconds is
how we got there and sort of what what
the decisions and what we had to do to
get there so what do we tell what do we
test there are basically three classes
of tests we have your it eventbrite and
I think this is pretty common so I'm
just going to go through this pretty
quickly there are the unit tests that
are supposed to test a discrete unit I
think these is critical django style
meaning that we draw a box around that
unit that we're testing and our test
database inclusive so we don't try to
mock out the test database we mock out
services you might call we mock out
third-party things but we don't muck out
the database and these are actually
isolated from one another in the
database so my test won't affect Simon's
won't affect Andrews as they run and
these are ideally fast enough and they
can be fast enough to do real TDD with
we all saw this integration test suite
which is similar to the unit test suite
it's almost indistinguishable if you
squint but this is what we use to test
whether how we're integrating our
services with one another so we have an
authentication service rebuilding we
have a payment service these all need to
integrate with each other and with the
core application and so they have their
own test Suites we also want to make
sure they're still operating together so
that when we deploy a release that has a
particular version of the payment
service particular version of the core
we're going to get something that
actually works together and finally
there's these functional tests that we
built this is kind of the third thing we
usually build with building a building a
new feature so these run with selenium
webdriver test that we run in sauce labs
and these tests the end-to-end
functionality of the site so can I make
an event can i register for it can i buy
a ticket can i use paypal the all these
different questions we that are really
critical features on the site that we
want to make sure under no circumstances
do we stop stop being you know having
this functionality and the and in the
another key difference here is that the
databases we set between runs so they're
not as isolated this means that they're
slightly more fragile they can one
failing test can impact a whole bunch of
other ones and so it's just important to
keep that in mind so how do you take
this existing code base that I think was
about three hundred thousand lines of
Python when we started this process and
and start testing it the issues that we
really saw here are as I always look
back to the last couple years when
you're writing tests and you're doing
tester development those tests guide how
you write your code if you're going to
if you're committed to writing tests for
it you're going to write your code in a
certain way you're going to
views that just handle the view you're
going to remove things in the methods
because it is easily testable but when
you untested hmmm says Dakota often
grows organically and so it's hard to
understand what that behavior what the
intended behavior actually is so what we
found really work for us was working
backwards we started with these these
very high-level end-to-end front
functional tests and these are sort of
our canary in the coal mine as we as we
started developing a culture of testing
so these are the things that would let
us know have we done something that's
going to make it impossible for somebody
to register of our paypal event have we
done something that breaks the site for
people in French that sort of thing
these are sort of the least valuable
overall in some ways but they they're
the by far the most reasonable to write
when you're starting from scratch and
you have a whole lot of code already we
also set the expectation that when you
wrote new code it was going to be tested
so this gay people not only practice in
composing tests but gave them help build
necessary skills for the team before we
can really fact tackle refactorings and
finally we really celebrate these slurs
small wins so when somebody took like a
five lines out of a 900 line function
and made it its own tested thing that's
great that's like that's a huge success
for us you know three years ago because
it meant that we were on the on track to
to a culture of testing so what gets in
the way environmental in sort of the
environmental differences is something
we found that was really we ready to
address early on and the way we
addressed this this is like differences
your environment between testing and
development and production is we i mean
i think a lot people do this we use it
we have CI system jenkins in our case
and the thing i want to point out here
is there's a whole bunch of different
jobs that run here but the this eb corp
you probably can't see this this eb core
build job is the one that we run first
when you make a change and the artifact
from that is a tarball with all the code
all the dependencies and that's the
exact same artifact that we're going to
test that we're going to deploy and that
we're going to end up
bring to our production servers so this
is a change we made that let make sure
that we can um that we're testing the
same thing we're going to deploy right
it also there those functional tests are
slow and so this helps mitigate that a
little bit that we're running in a
central place we also found that we had
code that would change settings under
the hood that's not so great and that
made that made test pass an isolation
but wind up failing when we ran the
entire suite which is to it which time a
bummer and also because you know I might
commit some code that seems like it
works just fine but you know somebody
else's test or somebody else's code that
I'm calling change the setting and so
what we did or what I did was I wrote
and nose plug in for this we use nose to
drive our test runs here call
settingsgaard and we're going to put
this up and i jist because it's really
simple but this is a sort of a condensed
version of it basically all does is it
stores a bunch of initial states and
then does a bunch of a cert equals at
the end and this is make sure that if a
test is mutating something it gets
caught the test fails you can't write it
so this made it impossible for people to
write tests that called code that was
going to mutate settings it doesn't make
it impossible to write that code but
with sort of combined with a culture of
writing tests as we write new code this
was actually very very effective there
were times I'll is also uncovered things
or people like start testing code that
hasn't been tested in the past and so
they realize that it does have some
pathological behavior the other sort of
barrier that we hadn't started doing
this testing was that we were we have
multiple languages like most places
there's Python and JavaScript here and
we wanted to start writing tests for our
JavaScript code as well but give
engineers a single command they could
run to sort of do the entire suite so
what we end up with here is a region
jasmine for our JavaScript tests and we
have a jasmine test case that uses knows
parameterised to to blow this up and run
up basically it does a subprocess of a
phantom j/s and then searches for the
failures and raises them inside of knows
this is a total hack but it makes it
really easy for people to run
the test suite and make sure they have
broken anything finally there's this
issue about performance when you have a
code bases large as ours and the tests
we've written for the older code in
particular can be tend to be slow we
need to figure out how we can let
engineers go faster than they might be
able to otherwise so another member of
the team al wrote this plug-in called
nose nose and basically we run this
nightly on our innovation server it
records what code every test touches and
then you give it use that file and you
can basically say hey I changed the
sequel utils checkpoints file run every
test that's going to touch that for me
and so this is a way you can do more
than just run the test for a particular
package you can run all the tests that
touch something really easily and this
is available on github so it's never too
late to start testing it's important
that you can you add tests in Reverse as
if you're going to if you're going to
start doing this starting with the
functional tests and figure out what's
stopping engineers from testing these
are the things that you can actually
address and help build a culture of
testing around bound you around an
existing code base thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
