Android flash development this is
probably a little bit of a different
topic than what you guys are usually
used to seeing an android usergroup
but flash actually is a very valuable
platform for developing plot
applications for flash and we're going
to show you examples of that
actually running on some Android devices
and have a little bit of fun hopefully
so my name is Steven Chen I work for a
company called GXS I'm their chief agile
methodologies that's my day job evenings
weekends I tinker with technologies
probably best known for writing the pro
job FX book now if you take Java FX and
you put it together with web
fundamentals this is my co-presenter
Ozwald campus ed o he wrote the web to a
fundamentals book very active in the
user group community as well so you guys
have probably seen him around and when
you merge these two things together
obviously you get a pro Android flash
book right obviously so this is our
upcoming book with a press we're
shooting for a May issue released you
can actually already pre-order it on
Amazon you might see some of the
examples we show tonight appearing in
that book but there's a whole lot more
stuff that we're not going to cover
which we're gonna go into more detail in
the book so this is kind of the
beginning flash development presentation
we're going to give you guys tonight so
slight disclaimer this is all bleeding
edge development we are not Adobe
employees neither oswald nor i we do not
reflect the opinions of Adobe product
statements etc etc we're also not
responsible for outbreaks of spontaneous
Android flash hacking so if you guys go
home and scare your co-workers by doing
flash developments we're not responsible
so hack responsibly
alright so the two technologies which
serve as deployment mediums for flash
applications are basically you have the
choice of the flash player this is going
to be in your you know mobile browser
you this is what you typically see
inside of a browser application if you
had advertisements or games running in
the browser and this is available on
Android phones today the Motorola Droid
was the first phone which shipped with
flash within the browser by default but
most other Android devices are catching
up quickly and also supporting flash out
of the get-go you need to have let me
see if I got this right
for REO support to to to run this so if
your device is not to 2 enabled you
probably don't have flash support but
once you get upgrade 2 to 2 you will get
this your with the flash Browser your
kind of restricted to kind of sandbox
restrictions in the browser so you're
not gonna be able to do everything you'd
like to with device api's you know
accessing the file system anything which
would violate security is not going to
be allowed and it will run on most
smartphones but not the iPhone this is
Steve Jobs thing he doesn't like flash
it doesn't run the iPhone but there is a
way to get flash on your iPhone and
that's with Adobe AIR so Adobe AIR is
the kind of the desktop or the the
installed version of the flash runtime
it actually has a bigger footprint
supports more api's you can actually get
full access to a lot of native
capabilities by using Adobe AIR
also by using the iPhone packager you
can package up kind of the necessary air
bits with your application and deploy
that to the iPhone store and actually
ship your Flash application for an Apple
device via the storefront so
conveniently there is a way to get
around the restriction of not running
our contents in the browser
most other devices so Android has air
support blackberry I don't know if you
guys have been following the latest news
on tablets I don't
want to steal too much of Oswald's
thunder here but blackberry also is
firmly committed to supporting flash and
air on their devices and I can't speak
for Adobe and all their partnerships but
they have a whole kind of Open Screen
project where they're working with you
know palm and all the other major phone
vendors to make sure that flash is on
different devices and is available
everywhere where you normally run
applications or up content for consumers
so one of the advantages and this is
this is the reason why this is a really
interesting technology is Adobe kind of
focused in on Android as the first
platform which they're fully supporting
and putting a lot of effort behind
making sure that it's has the full
capabilities and allows you to build
full-featured applications but the same
application you develop on Android is
going to run on other platforms that
they support in the near future so it
gives you some ability to write the
application once and then get multiple
different devices that you can run it
against so latest version of Adobe AIR
right now is 251 most of this stuff
we're talking about will actually run on
a slightly newer release of air once
that actually comes out and gets pushed
on to production and this is all
bleeding edge stuff so a lot of the
stuff we're gonna talk about right now
like all these products don't actually
exist yet I'll talk a little bit about
where you can get beta versions of these
and actually start with the technology
now we don't work for Adobe we can't
commit to release time frames or give
anything other than the general
statements taken about when they want to
target these technologies the general
statements on all these technologies CS
5.5 Adobe Flash Builder 4.5 is spring
time frame is when they're targeting
there's a number of different tools the
the basically the model adobe has for
how they you know actually support the
technology is the runtimes free and the
applications you can freely deploy they
don't charge royalties or anything like
that but a lot of the tooling which they
provide is not free so you know they
have their whole Creative Suite Creative
Suite 5 5 Flash professionals a part of
that Creative Suite and that's actually
one of the
mechanisms you can create applications
and deploy them to the to the Adobe AIR
runtime another one is the Adobe Flash
Builder and this is an eclipse-based
plug-in and it's numbered slightly
differently than the Creative Suite line
because it was previously released
separately but really it is it has
become an integral part of their overall
product suite and this allows you to
build applications within an actual
full-featured IDE you can use Eclipse
build large complex applications and
integrates well with their Flex
libraries which is the next one and what
flex is is if you think about so I'm
going to back up for a sec for folks who
aren't familiar with flash and flex so
Adobe Flash Professional has been around
for quite a while so what's really
targeted at is you know allowing
graphics professionals or folks who want
to build content rich content it
provides you know timelines and then
drag-and-drop object creation and you
can draw graphics and create reasonably
complex graphic with writing very little
code you can dig down and do
full-featured code in ActionScript which
is essentially JavaScript but it gives
you quite a bit of graphics capabilities
out of the box Flash Builder and flexing
their hand or focused more on your
typical application developer or
somebody who wants a full widget toolkit
buttons and skins and graphics
out-of-the-box layouts and controls and
things to quickly build business
professional applications so if you're
somebody building you know enterprise
business applications you definitely
fall down here on the you know flex side
and probably be more interested in the
Flash Builder side of things if you're
you know doing design or you're doing
game development you probably fall more
on the Flash Professional side of things
I'll show examples of both tools and
since action scripts the underlying
language in both tools you can pretty
much portably move between the two you
can open your Flash professional project
files and flash builder edit them
seamlessly go back and forth between the
tools so it's fairly seamless okay so
next guy down here is flash catalyst and
this is integrates well flash builder
lets you do some things like you know
creating skinnable buttons and things
via graphical user interface and this is
a fairly new product which is why it's
version 1.5 they're also targeting
mobile support for this but I'm not
going to show any examples of this
tonight so this is more informative and
then likewise device central is kind of
a a suite application which lets you
browse different mobile applications
mobile profiles have some emulation
capabilities so you can emulate devices
and rotate them or do touch gestures
within the user interface
I'm also not going to show examples of
this because we have real phones but
that's also something which when it
finally gets released it'll probably be
a valuable debugging tool and also
testing on different devices cs5 is the
current market version of Flash Creative
Suite Adobe Flash Builder 4 is the
current market version of the Flash
Builder line neither of those support
mobile development out of the box at the
end I'll point you guys to some
pre-release programs going on the
pre-release for adobe flash cs5 actually
is you need a copy of cs5 but then you
install a plugin which gives you the
mobile capabilities and that will be
equivalent to what CS 5.5 has when it
comes out alright so we probably done
enough talking so we're going to show
some examples of what you can do quickly
to build applications so the first
application I'm going to show is
basically a little capability Explorer
written inside flash and the goal here
was to have the minimal code to give
some features and then some information
about your device so this is the Flash
Professional UI which I'll bring up in a
sec this is all the code which we're
going to use I think I have a few extra
properties mixed in here but basically
is a big string statement it's a big
concatenated string and we're just
checking static properties so
capabilities dot manufacture who made
the phone capabilities dot OS what
operating system the phone is running on
so this this is really not complicated
coding but you can do quite a bit but
using the design tool with flash and
then mixing in a little bit of
ActionScript alright so this is this is
the Flash Builder UI and basically you
know I just this this didn't take very
long but I I mocked up some graphics
here so you know popped in a big text
area here so you got a little text area
component and then we've given it's a
movie clip it's an instance of color
that's not the text guy where's the text
guy here's the text guy so there's a
movie clip and you probably can't read
it but the tight the idea this is
capability scroller so from within the
ActionScript we can there we can access
the capability scroller object and then
set properties on it so we're just going
to set the text and then the actual
movie itself is simply going to slowly
roll this up so it's a timeline which
over a a minute or two slowly rolls the
text up so has a little backdrop has a
big text field we're going to populate
and then it just Scrolls it up the
screen so it's pretty trivial stuff the
actual code and I tried to make this as
massive as possible so we'll see how
this works out
all right
alright so there's the same code I show
them this a little bit better pretty
printed and it you can see it just
concatenates a whole bunch of properties
and assigns it to the capability
scroller here so we're just assigning it
to the capability scroller and then I
did some funky thing with a color mask
thing because I wanted to fade the text
of the top and bottom so it would like
fade in and out so I used that blue and
black rectangle in the background as
kind of a mask to do a fading effect and
that was about it and I'm by no means a
flash professional expert so I'm more of
a Flash Builder guy personally alright
so if we run this on the local
environments we can see that it runs
beautifully and we have what do we have
here
mp3 hardware disable playback debugger
true okay there's an Adobe Macintosh Mac
OS 10 65 pixel aspect ratios one desktop
player color 72 dpi 1152 byte 70 no
touch screen so that's if you run it
locally I mean the same flash
application you can deploy it to desktop
you can deploy it to mobile
so let's instead of running it locally
let's deploy it to this guy anyone
recognize this phone
you guys are Android expertise you know
this alright yeah it's a Google Nexus
One I'm very thankful for the Google
folks for further prep their generous
loan of a phone to do testing on and we
will publish
the application to the phone now it's
because you guys can't see it easily I
have a little Android screencast running
so it's exactly the same thing on the
phone with a horrendous refresh rate but
it shows up on screen so it's fairly
easy to see okay so same application
this is actually running on the device
now and when we actually get to some
interesting properties our
english-language Android Linux as the
manufacturer OS is Linux kernel to 6:30
to 9 - 27 to 40 screen dpi is 254 did
anyone know that's the Nexus 1 screen
resolution resolutions 480 by 800 touch
type is finger and then it supports
gesture events and two touch points so
pretty simple example running on the
phone you gets any idea of what you can
do very very quickly to build an
application deploy to the phone in the
same application which was deployed to
the desktop is running flawlessly on our
phone device yeah it's running within
the air runtime I can actually show you
guys the air application which is
sitting on the phone the way it works
it's it's a dependent application so
your application you deploy it to the
store will depend on the air to 5/1
runtime and then when a user downloads
it it'll automatically grab air 2 5 1
and install that as well for diploma
development purposes whenever you deploy
to the phone it checks the current
version of air to make sure it's up to
date if it's not all prompt you and say
do you want to update your version of
air or install it and then it'll take
care of it for you so it's it's fairly
smart about that sort of stuff
yeah it just comes up you launch the
application it's seamless but in the
background it's running the air runtime
yeah so for as a developer the first
time you deploy your application to the
phone it will install the air runtime
for you or upgraded it and that will
install your app
and launched it for the end-user
somebody who's actually going to pull
your app from the App Store they'll find
your application to run it it'll have a
dependency against the air application
which is also in the Google market and
then when they install that application
it will install it will ask them and it
will install the Adobe AIR runtime the
FIR for the first time the next
application which depends on air they
just have to download their application
and it already has the air runtime
installed all right so let me go back to
my slides and one of their screen which
I didn't show you but is nicely
representing the slides here is the
publish dialog so one of the dialogues
which you can use to configure air is
this publication dialog and I click the
publish commands if you hadn't
configured air they would pop this
dialog up for the first time and
basically it asks you for your app ID
portrait landscape mode you can set full
screen you can set auto rotation so
there's quite a few properties here that
you can use to affect your application
these are things you typically put in
like your Android XML file for your
application descriptor you can actually
create an application descriptor and
include that in your project instead of
specifying them here so this is the GUI
form of doing the same thing and they
also have a second page which does
certificates and all that good stuff
alright so I'm going to talk a little
about devices since you guys are Android
experts there will be a question coming
up which I'm going to depend upon you
guys to answer for me alright so one of
the one of the features of Android
unlike iPhone or some other platforms
where they've kind of standardized on
the hardware and the screen size and all
the things androids gone the opposite
route they've said everybody can use our
you know we have a platform it's open
source everybody can
to build applications that this will run
on build devices this will run on but as
a result you have a huge variety in
different resolutions so this is just a
smattering of different random Android
devices also different screen sizes
physical sizes the screen and densities
of the screen so as a result when you're
building an application you have to take
more care and making sure that you have
different graphics assets for different
sizes you handle different layouts for
you know different aspects screens so
there's there's more work as an
application developer you have to do but
if you do it correctly for the end user
it's actually a better experience
because whatever device they run it on
it's going to run smoothly even if they
get a higher resolution display or they
have different devices they upgrade to
so that's all good stuff this is a
comparison of the screen resolution
versus the physical size so the outer
guy here is a Google Nexus One which is
800 by 480 pixels and 3.7 inches
compared to the HTC hero but it's 480 by
320 pixels but the screen size is fairly
big it's actually 3.2 inches so you can
see that the physical dimensions and
then the screen size vary quite a bit
and the last one here is an Xperia Mini
x10 and that's 240 by 320 but again it's
2.5 5 inches so it's fairly large so if
you were designing a user interface for
a touch point this thumb size here is I
think it's about 0.8 0.9
of an inch which is the minimum size
they did a study at one of the
universities for the minimum size people
can manipulate screens with their thumbs
accurately so this is the smallest you'd
want to have a physical touch point in
the device if you look at it from a
resolution standpoint well it's from a
screen size standpoint it's all the same
right because the physical size of the
screen has to match their thumb in terms
of the minimum device but the actual
screen resolution so on the mini you can
have a fairly small graphic and
hittable because the density is low on
the google nexus one you have to have a
massive graphic otherwise the user can't
physically manipulate it so this gives
you an example of why it's so important
to actually care about density of the
device so Google Android defines four
different density levels for the air
api's they left off one so they just did
medium high density and the new extra
high density which is the latest version
of Android now as far as I know the
closest device to extra high density is
the new Motorola H Atrix atria the one
they just announced at CES what matrix
but it's actually slightly below the
threshold so the threshold and air is it
has to be above 280 for it to be
considered high density and I think it's
like 278 so it's like 2 2 below so as
far as I know there aren't actually any
devices which qualify at least by the
air definition for extra high density
but I think the reason they put this in
is for the future as you get higher
density devices like the B the new
iPhone forest would definitely qualify
for extra high density because they have
so many pixels you can actually use them
so just to give you a guy DEA's of how
density works and how you use it within
the air API is I create a little sample
application called the density Explorer
and basically what this does is you can
choose an author density so in a in a
flex application your author density is
the density for which your application
was targeted at so you can say my
application is designed for a 240 pixel
per inch screen and it's going to scale
it based upon the target device the
second thing is it has a little slider
here so you can choose a device dpi for
different devices and has a little
picture here which will update as you
slide so you can see different phone
pictures which are close and at the
bottom here it tells you the adjusted
device density which
in this chart here it would be if you're
in this range below 200 it'd be 160 if
you're 200 to 280 be too forward if
you're above 280 to be 320 and it also
tells you the scale factor which is what
it's going to scale and just like
Android does for their density
implementation it scales in reasonable
multiples so that you don't get weird
pixel aliasing or things if you don't
have exactly the right graphics so
there's a few thresholds it scales up
and this is also a good example of Flash
Builder so this is the second tool you
can use to build flash applications and
it's my choice okay so this is a really
simple application now I'm not going to
go into too much detail on this first
one but when I mentioned you can go in
and directly modify your application
descriptor this is the file you could
basically put whatever you want in for
your deployment so you're you know
application words can be deployed
namespaces version whether you auto
orient a whole bunch of other properties
I haven't implemented buttons icons
Android permissions so they have this
commented nicely seeking idea of the
different capabilities but I didn't make
any changes to this for this application
the main application consists of two
files oh thank you how's that
the main application consists of two
files so there's a main file here which
is a view navigator application
basically what this is saying is I want
to create an application which is going
to have a menu at the top to navigate
between different sub views and the
first sub view I would like to be main
home view which is the other file this
is also where you specify your author
density so when you deploy the
application you can choose what density
you want to have it work with in this
case I choose chose 240 PPI just for
kicks because I like doing things which
possibly cause demo risk
we're gonna change it to 320 on the fly
this way you guys know it's real and it
wasn't all canned demo all right and the
other thing the other file is the actual
view itself now basically this adds a
bunch of components so here's all
different devices the pic different
pictures I've embedded in here
and the main application layout and this
is the EM XML format for defining your
graphic so it's a declarative format is
it basically adds a border container
with some properties for color and size
sets it to a vertical layout and then
adds in some labels and some other items
to this so it's fairly straightforward
code this is the entire user interface
down here and there's a little bit of
scripting code up here which actually
deals with orientation change events so
it can change the layout when it's
horizontal and vertical alright so I'm
going to go ahead and run this
application alright so this is a
Motorola Droid 2 it has pretty similar
hardware to the Nexus One slightly
taller screen it does the full wide VGA
FW VGA or something like that and for
Flash Builder you can run applications
simply by clicking run here you can also
debug applications and it will
automatically do USB debugging with your
device and then give you back print line
statements allow you to step through
different lines so it's actually pretty
well integrated
so it's a question yes I'm using I'm
using the i5 build which is one version
higher than what you can get in the
pre-release I'm going to mention at the
end the only difference and I've tries
to try these applications on the current
available pre-release the current
available beta and then the pre-release
version I'm using here is when I write
view navigator application in your
application you have to write mobile
application but what I've shown the
slides is closer to what will be the
final released version okay so this is
the application I can't do it there I
stood here alright so we can drag here
and it fades in and out it's really hard
to see on the screen there but once I
pass around the device you'll see it
says better you can choose different
auto densities and it tells you at the
bottom it's a little hard to see but the
scale factor here is going to be 2/3 so
if we start with a 240 PPI application
and then our device dpi is 170 then it's
gonna scale it down like that's right
and the other thing this application
does is this is a preview for the next
thing we're going to do is it
automatically adjust the layout when you
turn on side so you notice the graphics
moves to the other edge and then you
move it back it changes the layout so
you can hook into the landscape portrait
events and then modify your layout
dynamically based upon the orientation
of the device now here is a visual
example of different author densities
and how it affects your application so I
took these screenshots with different
settings for the author density of the
application author densities you is read
exactly once on startup the application
so you can't change it dynamically it
makes sense because you probably if
you're setting an author density that's
because you've designed your application
to be 240 PPI so you don't need to be
dynamically changing it
but you can see here on the left 160 PPI
for author density and it actually
doesn't quite work because it scales it
so much that actually gets cropped my
application wasn't designed for a screen
this for a density this low so if I was
going to design for 160 PPI I would
probably move the controls around and
lay them out differently if I had an
author density of 240 PPI you can see
it's actually perfectly aligned and
that's actually the density I started
with when I was developing the
application if you took this to a
different device like if you took this
to a little Xperia Mini then what it
would do is it would shrink everything
down by a scale factor of whatever it
was like 0.5 or 0.6 and then if you took
it to a large higher density device an
extra high density device it would scale
the graphics up so your it's going to
keep the ratio and the size about the
same and that if you said to 320 PPI
which is what I just made the code
change to do on this device you'll
notice that there's quite a bit of white
real estate left over so I could design
an application for 320 PPI extremely
high density if I then ran it on a lower
density device it would scale the
graphics down so you'd have the same
equivalent ratio of white space to
components so this is pretty similar to
how Android deals with density one of
the differences is since there's a lot
of vector graphics going on they can do
quite a bit to automatically scale your
application using flex and flash but a
lot of the same concepts apply and
something which I've heard that they're
working on but I don't think the answer
is quite out there yet is they're gonna
do something similar with two graphics
so you can have different bitmap
graphics versions for different
densities as well same thing with
resources in android today the three
topics we're gonna go in a little more
detail on is I'm gonna talk a little
about multi-touch a little bit about
rotation of the device and Oswald's
gonna go in a Hall detail about
different types of app devices like
tablets and TVs and other aspect devices
and then the rest of these are all a
different error api's which are
supported I'm not going to go into
detail on these but
you know read the book I'm supposed to
put my book here so I get to say that
occasionally okay so screen orientation
I showed how it worked in a flex
application shortly the actual mechanism
and ActionScript hookup events is you
add an event listener that's going to
listen to the screen orientation change
event you can do this from flash
applications or from your flex code and
then you create a callback function and
then the callback function will get an
event handler which has one of these
values for the screen orientation
whether it's left or right or up or
upside and pretty standard stuff this is
a really simple code snippet which it
sets a screen orientation change
listener which simply plays a movie and
this is again a super simple code sample
of what you can do in flash to do screen
orientation changes on a device so we're
gonna go back to the flash now okay so
we're gonna do our rotating smile
example now this guy looks pretty happy
right that's it this is about the extent
of my artistic skills I apologize all
right and we're gonna make him slightly
less happy so all I did is I added
another frame here with a slightly less
happy smiley guy and I did a bunch of
shape morphs on the different layers so
you get a little animation effect the
clouds roll in and you know this is all
stuff which if you guys had a designer
they'd actually create something which
was professional and like looked good as
opposed to a little sample application
but you get the idea yeah so if you use
any of the drawing tools inside of Flash
Professional it's all vector graphics
you can also import from Illustrator or
other tools which do vector graphics and
that's going to give you the best
scaling on different device sizes bitmap
graphics you might want to use for
complicated portions of the UI where
you'd have lots of fine details so you
don't bog down the processor but so far
I've had pretty good success with vector
ground
fix on performance so the code for this
application is very simple
so same thing I showed in the slides but
it basically adds an event listener and
plays the clip plays the clip every time
you rotate so it couldn't couldn't be
simpler I again I'm going to start up
the got here alright we're screencasting
again
okay and we'll do a little publish here
so here's the publish settings dialog I
didn't show last time and you can also
set certificates and deployment types
where they're deploying the device or
emulator all this great stuff but we're
just going to publish okay so I got my
device up so you're gonna you're gonna
validate that this is real as opposed to
being faked by a movie clip or something
I loaded okay so we got a we got a happy
smiley let's rotate him alright not very
happy that's happy you got alright so
you guys are probably seeing these
pictures before I am these are courtesy
of our friends at gesture works and
these are the five basic gestures that
flash supports out-of-the-box so you can
do two finger taps rotation zoom you can
pan with two fingers so put two fingers
and drag to pan an object and you can
also do swipe gestures on the phone
single finger swipes so I mean pretty
standard stuff you've probably seen lots
of mobile applications which use these
one of the nice things is it's kind of
out of the box if you turn gesture
support on it's going to automatically
recognize these and fire these events
for you and your application which makes
it fairly simple to use very similar
mechanism to hook up the listeners so
you call add event listener in bold give
it a rotate listener which is a function
and then that function can take some
action so it's fairly straightforward
and it gets passed in a get past an
event object which has information like
for a rotation event it tells you the
delta rotation since the last event call
so in this case I'm simply doing a plus
equals on the object rotation so each
time the event gets called it's going to
rotate the object similarly like a
translated
or app and event gets called for every
incremental movement so you can animate
objects across the screen as the user
gesture occurs swipes are single
dispatch at the end of the gesture so at
the end of the swipe you get a single
call which tells you the direction of
the swipe whether it was up-down
left-right
etc here's an example of swiping so
you'll notice here that the syntax I'm
using on this slide for hooking up the
event is a little bit different a little
bit more concise so this is the mxml
syntax it's an XML declarative syntax
for defining your flex applications they
define events for each of the different
gesture types again these are on the
interactive object class which
everything extends you can basically do
this on anything which appears on the
screen and you can hook it up to a
function here and then have it directly
call this so this gets rid of the need
to in some place added this add event
handler code with the big constant and
then the function you're going to hook
it up to you can simply edit an into
your M XML code like this which is
usually much terse and easier to write
if you're coding but it has exactly the
same effect question I guess the
question is how you can handle an
application which does both Mouse and
touch events so in the when you there's
an input mode setting for for flash and
there's three different input modes you
can choose you can choose gesture input
mode and when you're in gesture input
mode you'll get gesture events and
you'll also get Mouse events you can
choose touch touch points touch point I
think it's touch point touch point mode
and when you're in touch point mode it
will generate like touch begin touch
ends for possibly multiple fingers and
that's the low level API if you want to
directly access it and it will also
dispatch Mouse events at the same time
and the third thing is you can set
gesture handling off you can set it to
none input mode none in that case you
just get Mouse events so if you want
your application to be have the most
compatibility you can process Mouse
events so
mouse clicks mouse presses Mouse
rollover all those events will be
dispatched for touch displays the way
you'd expect them to and if you use
those instead of the equivalent touch
event then your application is portable
to desktop if you do use any of the
gestures which are not going to be
available for a non touchscreen UI what
you probably want to do with your
application
assuming that you can't enforce a
particular type of device or a
particular support in terms of number of
touch points or gesture support is you
probably want to provide menus or other
mechanisms to accomplish the same thing
which might be more tedious or
cumbersome for the end-user but would
give them equivalent functionality so
that it's your question okay so example
time again all right back to Flash
Builder you know it's a pattern here
we're going back and forth and we've got
our mobile picture book application so
basically what this application is going
to do and there's a little bit more code
involved in this but the samples I
showed for swipe events were from this
application and the sample I showed for
rotation and zooming was also for this
application what this application does
is it shows a few images on screen and
allows you to manipulate them so this is
the multi-touch image class it's
basically a wrapper around the normal
Flex image and then what it does is it
adds a bunch of event listeners for
resizing and transforming if you notice
to rotate zoom okay there's another guy
which I'll show you in a sec but it adds
the listeners here and it just adds the
rotation of the scale similar to what I
showed on the screen for dragging rather
than using the touch events for dragging
what makes more sense to do and this
makes your application more portable to
a non gesture enabled UI is to simply
grab the
normal drag events so in this case I do
Mouse down mouse up events do a normal
drag and this works equally well on a
touchscreen or a desktop screen so this
gives you drag ability support for
dragging the icons around and then
swiping is in the ActionScript classes
the XML or DM XML class is rather it's
an example of that would be and I'm in
the wrong spot here scrapbook page
all right so this guy sets up an event
handler two finger taps oops so it adds
a bunch of two finger tap event handlers
so with this if you want you try this
application if you click with two
fingers on one of the images that will
zoom in on the image and open up in a
full-screen view and if you press the
back button or press two fingers on
again will go back to the previous view
so that let me run the application and
then I could show you gets guys this in
action okay you got our screen cast up
okay so this is the basic application I
have on screen so you guys will get a
chance to try this
you can drag pictures around you can
zoom on pictures you can rotate pictures
rotate rotate my fingers are all sticky
so all right you get the idea now if you
take a picture and you click with two
fingers on it ah all right there we go
all right so that was a two finger tap
and then you can either two finger tap
on it again or click the Android back
button to go back again and the other
thing for swiping is on the flash
scrapbook title if you swipe it it will
change the set of pictures showing to a
few different sets of pictures
all right so we got one more example
application I'm going to turn over to
Oswald so I mentioned a little bit about
the touch point API for getting
low-level events so you can actually do
your own gestures or complicated stuff
with touch events and it's there's a lot
more events that get fired this is the
full list you get a lot more of these
fired because every time the user moves
or touches or does anything you're
getting like a bajillion events but it's
extremely powerful and what you can do
because you can actually have things
which track mouse cursor is around the
screen or you can do things with the
pressure applied to the screen so it
gives you quite a bit more flexibility
in terms of what you do with your touch
API for this example I'm simply going to
use begin and move to track the mouse
cursor moving around the screen and the
touch tap event which is a single kind
of tap event on the screen and this is
kind of a proxy event it's something
which is getting generated based on
other events underlying the system but
it's convenient in that it'll fire a
single event like a mouse click when the
user taps on an object all right so I'm
not gonna go to too much detail on these
if you guys are interested I'll have all
the slides posted to my blog post
presentation and I'm also gonna put the
samples you guys saw on my blog probably
not all at once but I'll get at least
one initially and then continue posting
over the next couple of weeks but here
is our next application snake
application this may look complicated
but there's actually little brush which
draws flowers for you so this is really
simple it's a yellow background with
like a quick brush stroke across I added
a few symbols here so the backgrounds a
blue ball it's just a blue sphere with a
gradient on it a green ball and this you
know it's a green sphere and then the
red ball and the red ball I put a few
faces on just for kicks so
this is what happens when you're up to
like four e/m coding writing your book
you come up with quirky ideas what your
you readers might not actually
appreciate but I got my happy happy
smiley and my oh you guys can't see this
again yeah alright I'll show it on I'll
let you guys see it on the device but
there's a few different faces okay and
the actual code for this is super
trivial
okay so basically same deal at the top
here add a bunch of event listeners
begin move and I added a key down
listener key down listeners are actually
the way you handle these buttons at the
bottom there there's a special constant
for each of the Android buttons so if
you click the menu button on the
application be careful not to click back
because that'll exit the application if
you click the menu button it will clear
out all of the all little snakes which
you've drawn so far and you're gonna
want to do that because if you get too
many sprites on the screen at once it
does kill your performance so there's
also an effective way to test how high
performance your application your
devices and then you know the key
listener does clears out all the stuff
there's a little change face guy here
which just plays that movie to change
the face so if you tap on any of the
snake faces it'll change the face and
then begin an ends listener here which
basically as you're moving around the
screen is just gonna dump sprites up on
screen the first touch point the primary
touch point there's a variable you can
check prime is primary touch point and
we set that to a green ball and then any
other touch points there is only two on
this device but if you had multiple
they're all going to be blue if you have
multiple fingers so if you do two
fingers sneaking then you can get blue
and green snakes all right and again our
last time we'll need to do this reboot
the Android screencast and we have it
running up here so actually I need a
volunteer would you like to volunteer
sir
so why don't you stand here on the side
so we don't block the screen but I mean
this is there's one of the applications
which is kind of fun to play mess around
with so just touch the screen and see
what you can do
okay try dragging her
all right we got something blue we got
the blue balls click on one of the faces
to that also all right so it's a little
hard to see the faces on screen but
they're they're getting there look
pretty sad now so when you pass it to
the next person hit the menu button the
second one here and then I'll flush it
so the next person can start over
and then one of the eccentricities I
noticed pressure is device sensitive so
every Android device has possibly no
implementation and pressure support at
all where you'll constantly get like a
single constant pressure value or it has
a different threshold range so I noticed
on the Nexus One when you run this
application like a little bit of
pressure it gives you high values close
to one on the motorola droid 2 a little
bit of pressure it gives you almost
nothing close to zero so getting the
right constant value adjustment for
pressure for an application like this is
actually pretty tricky it's device
specific so it's actually quite hard to
do the right thing all right so we are
done with that one and I'm going to turn
it over to my co-presenter to talk a
little bit I'm gonna essentially wrap up
pretty fast with the high-level view
about some tablets and TV how many
people work on Android applications ok
great
you may be wondering in terms of
functionality there are some things you
can do native Android it's not supported
by Adobe AIR for mobile however you can
create native Android applications and
then essentially splice that in with
your Adobe AIR application repackages
there's sort of sequence of steps that
you follow so that you can get that
functionality that's available natively
and Android that's not available in
Adobe AIR excuse me for example
widgets alarms notifications that's
basically doable
in case you're concerned as Adobe AIR
evolves it handles more things of course
recently a web
he was added in version 2 51 which
wasn't available in 2/5 so the only
thing is that that process of the manual
steps is not officially supported by
Adobe however it does exist in case you
want to do that so anyway back to the
tablets and TV as you probably have
heard there's lots of predictions going
on 2011 is the year of the tablet there
are at least a hundred tablets available
some I think were discontinued or pulled
because they didn't I guess couldn't
compete with some of the better high-end
models most of the the many of the
tablets I should say will support Adobe
AIR the ones that don't of course the
iPad if you have Android 2.2 or higher
you'll be able to deploy your Adobe AIR
applications on tablets there's also the
PlayBook from rim which uses Q and X
however they have built-in support now
available through working with Adobe so
you can run your applications there as
well
and let me just very good
so just some of the information about
the PlayBook and essentially one of the
nice features I think is the support for
front and rear cameras a little bit
about the dimensions html5 css3 I'm not
sure how much of that it will support
basically some of the basic
functionality I think is is all that
you'll get for now but not how to
percent sure on that and available
sometime q1 q2 we're actually looking
forward to that so that we can write
some code to run on a playbook which we
can also include in the chapter in the
book a couple of other devices Cisco
which is an enterprise device and
Samsung Galaxy Tab another device that
we're looking at the Toshiba and
in case you were wondering Windows Phone
7 tablets based tablets rather there are
at least eight or so these are recent at
the CES conference I believe they were
announced and Google TV we have been
working a little bit with that there's
really not much that we can do right now
not sure what we can mention since we're
under NDA essentially it's a browser
Chrome browser running on your TV so you
can navigate you can't download anything
so zip files and so forth essentially go
to your whatever URL you want to go to
just as you would in your desktop there
is a people of lava Android TV from
Sweden which came out a couple of months
ago they claimed to be the first Android
based TV and of course there's Adobe TV
here's a little bit of information about
Google TV there are 12 bundled
applications so far we don't have
information about how to add new
applications to that we're working on
that and as I mentioned before no file
download capability also you can't take
any screenshots otherwise we would have
done so in our presentation
what's the availability of the boxes
they're on sale this is actually my
favorite
last year available in China only I
really want this car so I guess I have
to go over there get the visa some it's
between 10 and 20 K Android 2.1 actually
I'm not sure how safe it is to drive
because you know if you can do all this
stuff while you're driving well take
your chances but it's kind of
interesting how it came out over there
and you can there's the video of the
link at YouTube you can watch it's kind
of interesting actually and this will be
posted so if you want you can take a
look at it the links I would very very
highly recommend that you go through
these
get your stuff start doing your
application development and if you get
stock I would recommend these even more
starting with Steven but James Ward
who's an evangelist at Adobe Duane
nickel likewise all these guys lots of
code lots of updates lots of information
so and if you can't find it through them
there's forums available or will be
available at some point so like I
mentioned that's my blog URL Steve on
Java comm if you put the flash dot in
front of it that ensures you only get
the flash oriented articles not my agile
methodologies stuff which I do for my
day job or my Java effects stuff which I
do for you know Oracle folks so it's
kind of tailored content just for what
you've seen here if you want the whole
thing you can just take the flash off
and just go to Steve on job and I'll
come alright thank you very much you've
been a great audience
