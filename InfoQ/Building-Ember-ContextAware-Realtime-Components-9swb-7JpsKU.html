been working with ember for like two
years so I guess I'm kind of like a very
senior in this so i've been i've been
using it since well before one point oh
so it's pretty exciting to kind of just
see it grow and i'm pretty excited to
get to talk about the newest project I'm
working on so yeah so I want to talk
today about building ember context-aware
real-time components which is quite a
mouthful when I try to decide it like
kind of how to go around discussing this
thing it kind of stem from where our
project was a year ago to where it is
now and so these pieces kind of came
into being just out of necessity so a
little background first washio is an
on-demand laundry and dry cleaning
company so I'm CTO we're in Los Angeles
or we're los angeles-based but we're
currently in San Francisco LA and DC so
our system has about 100 drivers on the
road on any given day so there's a lot
of logistical and operational needs for
the system so one being that we have
drivers so we're getting statuses of
orders and things like that coming from
drivers but also then just the logistics
of running our distribution centers and
working with our cleaning vendors so the
first thing we have is and this I just
want to kind of give a prelim about what
we're doing so the iOS and Android
customer apps communicate with our
driver apps or drivers are able to go on
the road
and update statuses of orders and add
images and add notes and then our
cleaners are also able to add images for
items and then do things like report
discrepancies or rejections or delays
and then this is just kind of a cool
picture of our supply chain management
so this is our distribution center in
san francisco this is actually our old
distributions on there but you can kind
of see it just moving in out so the crux
of our system is our backend which is
built on node and ember and we're using
coffeescript but most of the core of it
is an ember app so and actually our
client app as well for web is ember and
our first incarnation of the ios and
android apps were web wrapped amber apps
which is kind of cool and kind of not
cool but we're native now so it's a much
better world so the first need with our
system was a dashboard within a
dashboard so we built the system and we
had all these orders and you could you
know change statuses of orders and you
could view who the pickup driver is and
drop off driver is but what would happen
is you know you'd be on the orders page
and then you click on a go to a new page
and even though it's amber it was still
like a slow time consuming thing so what
started materializing is kind of a
sidebar that was basically a widget that
was context-aware so if you clicked on a
different order you would see that order
and then the widget actually would then
control sub widgets so it will have well
I'll kind of show you in a second what
that means and then yeah it can be
extended to add new needs so if we take
a look
at what it is
so this is pretty small okay so on the
left side we have here's like a live
shift so this is our staging server so
we have an order and then we can
actually see the order here so this is
kind of the widget down talk about an
ember that has the current order and
then within it there's the times of
pickup and times of drop off and then
preferences notes cleaner issues images
the status history and so these are all
sub widgets and it kind of so this I
started building this kind of before I
learned about let's about amber
components so this is sort of an ember
component but not exactly so the only
thing I'm doing really is i'm doing a
render widget and then the the
difference with components in ember is
that you're not really using a route so
normally you have a route that sets up
your model and in your controller and
you know you're on your way and you're
seeing your page this is a little
different because you have your route
here and you have your view of you like
maybe a hundred orders and when you're
clicking on any of them you're really
just setting a component over here and
then that component is in charge of
setting all its sub components so if we
go back here we can see the current
order and then also the current customer
so this these five areas are kind of
separate widgets in and of themselves so
when you go to a current order it will
actually get loaded into the orders list
as well which then this will carry over
if the page is refreshed so it's a way
for them to get back to in order that
they were on and so a little bit of code
on this so this is at the actual sidebar
widget so you can see the scrub brush
and then recent
and search and live events and let's see
so what's nice is that like for instance
notes we have these different tabs that
you can have that actually are tied to a
sub controller so here you have like
issues and this will actually show the
count of the issues talking to that and
then inside of I believe this is yeah so
this is the main like widget controller
which has kind of grown into like a
fairly massive thing but it's not too
bad it so you can have like a set order
right so when a order on the left side
there might be a hundred orders when you
click on any one of those it's just
going to pass that order object to the
set order which will display the order
and then what it will do it was it will
call all these sub widgets so you can
see like the operation widget order
status history this will actually do a
get then to our API and get the status
history and display it which is kind of
nice because some of these could take
long so on the customer page for example
our API is pretty slow in the
summarization of these orders so this
the first incarnation of this everything
was loading in that one component and
this would take you know ten seconds
when really we have the order object
ready so that's kind of helped as far as
as far as like making it responsive for
our ops associates because one of the
main things when you're dealing in the
very customer centric space is that
people are calling on the phone yelling
at you and so like the faster that they
can at least get the order up to help
them the better and you kind of as we
were growing we were you know all the
ops team was in with the engineers which
makes it pretty interesting because
you're actually hearing people complain
about your product in real time
or people yelling at them and then them
yelling at you yeah it would not be that
hard there's in the this is using a
slightly older version of ember and in
the newer versions they do have a more
sophisticated URL routing and it just
that is actually pretty high on our list
to make not only the page that you're on
but then the page you're on plus what
search results you're doing on there and
then also what is currently displaying
on the sidebar yeah so it's yeah it's
very high on my list but it's not done
yet so the second need of this system is
making it real time so we're when we're
running the system we're dealing with
drivers on the road updating statuses so
an order will move you know from picked
up to or from placed to an hour before
the ten minutes before to picked up and
kind of move through that whole chain
and so obstacles dates are monitoring
this so if an order is from between five
and six or five and five-thirty and it
hasn't changed status to ten minutes
before and it's like 525 a ops associate
can kind of reach out to a driver by
texting them and kind of figure out
what's going on so there's kind of been
this need of how do we get how do you
know you make sure you're delivering
everything and a half hour time window
so it's for and it's also use been for
tracking drivers so we can see drivers
on the map and things like that so what
we're using for that is firebase which
is basically a kind of Redis system that
also allows for pub
sub so you can subscribe to a particular
collection of data and then anytime that
data is updated or it's a new item is
added then you'll get a notification for
it so over on the right side you can see
like drop the cleaners I'm going to kind
of get into how this changes but we'll
be able to change things in real time
and actually see them in the system okay
so the first example and so I'll just
pull up the driver app on my phone and
then if I change it to 10 minutes before
pickup you'll actually see a change here
and here and then like a text message
gets sent out to the customer saying
that we're 10 minutes before pick up the
same thing then also is you can see the
green circle around Ice Cube so that
means he's checked in so if he does if
he checks out then he'll be checked out
and go white and then back to green so
you can kind of see that that's been
really helpful because you know
obstacles will have you know maybe 50
orders or something in the five o'clock
slot and as they move along so if we
move this to order picked up you can
kind of see that now this goes into gray
meaning that that order is done for the
day so they'll see a list and those will
you can kind of tell it's great yeah so
they can kind of like visually see that
these eight orders are done in these two
they have to like kind of keep tabs on
let's see
ok so the firebase set up so yeah like I
said we have a node server running so
there's a fire based service that I
built that basically handles sending all
requests to firebase and these will be
called from different places so these
will be called anytime an order status
is updated anytime an order is created
and these are just simple Ajax post
calls and then drive our location so
when we're sending out driver locations
so currently driver location is the
phone is just sending a post to our API
I'm working on those um there's
something in firebase called geo fire so
we're kind of working through building
out that aspect of it where this will
actually just talk directly to firebase
which has like good and bad qualities
but one of the nice features of geo fire
is that pretty soon what we'll be doing
is when your driver is in some geofence
location around your house it will
actually switch to you seeing them on a
map coming like kind of uber style and
then yeah it's so firebase is just
storing a JSON object on the client side
we have a firebase service that's kind
of separate from the Ember app but it's
basically just receiving new messages
and then throwing them into an array
inside the app and then different
controllers can choose to listen to
those new firebase messages so when I
was showing the previous piece here both
this controller of the live shift and
then the controller of the current order
are both listening for new messages this
is going to be refactored a little
further and I've actually been talking
firebase about kind of good practices
with with how we're going to like
structure our data but you can kind of
see what it looks like right now so this
is firebase and we have a live event so
this live event just came
and I should be able to get a new one
that popped in here and so you can see
that highlight when they die changes
status so a new event comes in and you
can see here's like the actual object
that comes in and then
then let's see okay so yeah so I'm the
note on the server side here's basically
our firebase service that will actually
connect to firebase and then push data
to firebase so we have the ability to
turn it on and off using socket i/o or
are setting for socket i/o so like I've
done a lot of chat servers and different
things with socket i/o and it's really
not as simple as just to start it up and
have it going and it'd be consistently
not hanging up your web server and
consistently getting messages through
I'm sure some of you can do it really
expertly but firebase kind of takes a
lot of that out of the equation so
basically this is just pushing a message
to firebase and then on the client side
we have this little service which right
now it's just tying to live events and
anytime a new item is to add to live
events it throws it into a into an array
right here in inside of the actual amber
application and then what will happen is
our order controller will simply bind to
yeah so it will simply bind to the app
that socket messages and anytime a new
message comes in is just grabbing it off
the stack and then handling it so if
this for an order all we really care
about is if the status changed so if the
status changed and it's a current order
then we're going to update the status
and that's where you see the status
change it's going to get some
refactoring so there's actually on fire
bases documents there's a really good
discussion about like properly
structuring their database so the way
that I'm doing it right now is not
necessarily ideal what I'm going to do
going forward is this actual controller
will bind to the firebase order object
and then if that ever changes it will
just get the message for this one so
this will scale a little poorly as far
as this control is receiving every
message out there in the system for
every order and then doing this check
but this is v1
okay the third need that we kind of kept
seeing with this application was it
being very necessary to have really
strong customer service it just so
happens that we're at zendesk is not a
plug for zendesk but we are using
Zendesk which has been amazing so one
thing is just it's a really amazing
product in general I don't have a ton of
experience with these things but as far
as it it works really well and
everybody's really happy with it but the
second aspect of it is that it's what I
consider the top echelon of ember apps
so a lot of the cues for our App I do
take from ember and how amber is doing
things so like one feature that we
really want to get in it so they have a
really good query string system going on
in there for all their data the other
thing they have is the tab system which
is really amazing and then the aspect
that was really helpful for us is this
two-way communication between our system
and their system so we have you know our
scrub brush which has our user and all
the order information and then the
current order and things like that but
our office associates aren't always in
there they're in our system but they're
also in Zendesk ilan because a new email
comes in they get a new ticket assigned
to them and they're going into a ticket
okay so I think I'll like I'll show it a
little bit before I explain that part
but okay so basically here we have a
ticket so this is a ticket that i
created and over here you can see our
system has loaded up so if we refresh
this page it will take a little bit of
time but that's alright so this is then
this is a a mini amber app and actually
the mailchimp one is as well but this is
a little ember app that we created that
just calls our API and gets all the
information about the user so you open
something in here and its context
sensitive and you now have access to the
user and to all their orders so somebody
calls and you can grab their order and
these are actually in the it's in random
order which is not great so you can
actually then go directly to our system
and view the customer which is really
helpful and then we can go back to
zendesk as well so we can go into here
and see all the zendesk tickets and go
back to them so if you are in a very
customer service heavy organization this
kind of thing is really beneficial so
how is it all set up
so on the node side just using the node
Zendesk NPM which basically lets you
retrieve data from zendesk for a
particular user and then there's just as
n does rallies and this controller on
the API side that lets us get data back
to the Ember component and then there's
a user route that we're able to query
for both the scrub brush and present us
to get user information and then on the
Ember side there's another one these
widgets that will actually load the
zendesk tickets and on the zendesk app
side there's kind of a mini ember app
that actually does the look up to our
API as well so let's see
you know so the zendesk controller is
just called through the user this
current user current customer which will
then just call Zendesk and have it look
up the user and do a simple get of that
and then this will actually do the
search on Zendesk and let's say and so
that's basically just returning the data
back and then on the zendesk side
Oh
okay so I haven't looked at this for a
little bit so I might be a little rusty
on it but um there's basically this app
duh j/s file that will actually do the
get and then return the data back and
actually just render it so it's a really
straightforward where the setup is kind
of funky as far as like learning how
they're doing their ember type of layout
but there's this like request user info
piece and this is kind of where it is a
little funky so there's a couple
different pieces of Zenda so there's
like a ticket sidebar and there's a user
sidebar and you can kind of see where
you have to actually query the current
page to get the user that you're looking
up and then the template basically is
just showing the user and you can then
link to the users information on our
system and then you know the
summarization of all their orders right
there and within zendesk it's pretty
cool that you can basically just go I
have this one open you can actually just
go in here and they actually have a ton
of different so there was this there was
that one the mailchimp one but there's a
whole marketplace of these apps so it's
kind of cool to say because there's just
a lot of people I guess building and
perhaps for Zendesk and so you can
basically bring in your own private app
and then connect to other ones so
there's ones like that might give you
like more information about a user or
for mailchimp we can actually see all of
our users history of email sent out to
them and things like that
and let's see I think
yeah that's kind of yeah so if you want
to email me for anything feel free
that's it any questions yeah we're so
yeah that's like the main reason why
we're going to kind of continue
expanding it so one of the things that
we're building out is a chat system so
that we'll be able to have customers
talk to ninjas and obstacles days and
all that kind of thing and so firebase
was kind of spawned off building chat
and it works really well for that but
the other aspect is we're going to start
using it for a few other things like
right now when you look at say the live
shift view in our system for Los Angeles
for today we're you know hitting our
server and queering our data and
bringing it back and so I'm kind of
looking into ways to kind of have that
in in firebase so that we can just have
that page connect directly to that
collection and see the orders for that
day so it's kind of like a way to like
redundantly store your data I mean we're
also using Redis on our server but
there's kind of its like the delicate
balance of how much you're using this
like kind of just a different way to
store the data versus how much you're
using just your traditional API to serve
up the data
oh I hate that thing I mean that's like
our loading indicator of death because
if any error happens and that just yeah
the washing machine yeah so after seeing
it like 10,000 times you'd get sick of
it but yeah thank you well so we're
actually not using ember data right now
so it has kind of been because of that
but we're also so amber fire but then
there's also like geo fire which they've
just built which that one kind of
interests me a lot because they have a
pretty cool demo of like just being able
to move within a geofence to see their
demo is all buses across the entire
country and you move the circle anywhere
and you'll see the actual live buses
moving around and so that like works
really well with what we're doing the
the app yeah kinda started before I've
just had some issues with ember data and
have decided not to use it and so
unfortunately ember fire kind of gets
thrown out with it but yeah I mean they
have kind of their building pretty cool
like offshoots in firebase for these
kinds of things so I think Gio fire is
going to be the next thing that we
implement from them yeah
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
