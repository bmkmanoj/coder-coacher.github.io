microphone rights to html5 and the next
evolutionary step in web data so before
i get into the content of the
presentation i want to let you all know
that all the the text and code and
everything in my presentation is crave

you find any of it useful and want to
quote it copied or reuse it your own

second thing I've set up is an etherpad
so if any of you have questions or
thoughts you think up or just want to
like scribble down some notes maybe even
collaborate note-taking feel free to go
to etherpad mozilla org slash html5
microformats hopefully that's memorable
enough to type in and go ahead and start
typing I've got some boilerplate in
there go ahead and add yourself in if
the Wi-Fi is working is Wi-Fi working
for folks excellent okay great so I'm
going to talk about three general areas
in this presentation the first is where
are we microformats today so
microformats have been around since 2005
and there's a lot that they've come come
pretty far what challenges and lessons
have we learned over the past eight
years it's been it's been quite the ride
in web data in general actually and then
where are we today what's the latest and
greatest things you can use today with
both microformats to an html5 and in
combination which is even more powerful
so microformats today how many of you
publish microformats on your websites
today that you know show of hands okay
looks like about the quarter 30 of you
out there great well there's a there's a
site called a web data Commons and what
they've done is they keep crawling the
web and looking for different pieces of
structured data of the sites that they
have found that has structured data
seventy percent of those have
microformats this is from their 2012
crawl they haven't done a 2013 crawl yet
as far as i know but that's but that's
quite a bit so if you look at this pie
chart like this upper right-hand corner
they're kind of calling quote unquote
rdfa most of that is facebook open graph
protocol structure
and then you've got a lot of
microformats that's sort of like the
majority of the dark orange area and a
little slice of micro data up here but
the vast majority of structured data on
the web is microformats today and we'll
go into some of the reasons for that
actually two of the big reasons for it I
think and these are principles of
simplicity and openness so the simpler
you make something to use the more
people are going to use it that's a
fundamental use of usability axiom and
the more open you make it more people
will use it anyone here that works with
open source creates open source shares
open source knows that as well and these
are really if you look at her like the
foundation of the web the web started
because of these two right Tim
berners-lee did not set out to design
the ultimate markup language for all
possible problems and solutions and
everything no he created HTML he made it
really simple and he also put it out
there for free so there were no patents
attached to it he put it out there with
a free license anyone could use it so
we've done the same thing with
microformats and as a result we've
actually built up quite a big community
every single contribution to the site is
contributed under public domain which
means that you know where the biggest
standards community and long-standing
standards community organization that
literally decides to put all of its work
all of our research all of our
specifications everything into the
public domain which means that anyone
can take it and fork it potentially
anyone can include it in a book they
want to publish they don't even have to
ask us permission to do so we think
that's really powerful one of the side
effects you get of that is that when
people know that what they're
contributing is the public domain that's
not going to be taken over by someone
you get a lot of contributions in fact
you get a lot of contributions worldwide
so we're up to 18 different translations
in various states of progress on the
microformats wiki and so you can you can
see this today and a few of those were
just happened last year so i'm pretty
pretty happy with that you know if
there's a it's you speak a language it's
not listed there feel free to go ahead
and start anyone can create an account
in the wiki anyone can contribute it's
very much sort of a github style but
more accessible because mediawiki is a
little bit easier than github
way of doing standards and community so
but let's there's a lot going on in
html5 my goodness there's eight
simultaneous tracks and you guys chose
to come to this one so thank you I
appreciate it however there's so many
things if you're trying to build a web
app today how many different things you
have to learn and implement right if you
saw Christians keynote this morning all
those different web api's there's all
the different pieces of CSS three
different CSS three modules so many
different features in html5 so why web
data and microformats why is it
something that you know you guys are all
here for a reason and I want to just
give you a few of the I think the key
reasons the first is just simple you
know making your life easier so with
microformats if you're structuring your
page giving a set of class into already
say what the different structures are
takes care of designing those for you
but more to the point you want to do
things that actually affect the user so
you can do really simple things as
microformats quickly that are useful
like add context to your address book or
add you know the events to the user's
calendar third almost every single site
out there is worthy of having an API
okay at least a read-only API and with
microformats it's the fastest way to
actually put your data on the web
accessible via JSON to consumers of data
and that's really powerful and it's a
lot less work than coming up with
another XML file the other XML format
another URL all of that know if you're a
web designer you can add microformats
and all of a sudden you've got data on
your site but what happened three almost
four years ago now is that Google
started actually displaying data from
microformats and their search results
and that's that's a pretty big deal
because all of a sudden everyone's
worried about you know what your search
results look like now that they've been
doing that for several years that's been
a lot of uptake of microformats to do
that as well and actually Bing and Yahoo
and Yandex are now also supporting
microformats and there's display search
results so that's another solid reason
to look just put them in there and
lastly there's this growing long tail of
sites that are consuming what
microformats member i said it's like a
cheap draw api turns out if you publish
information as an API as data that
anyone can build
upon people do build upon it right if
you publish they will build it so the
readability spinner Foursquare all these
read various different types of
microformats do stuff something with the
data syndicated incorporated something
with the data interesting and and
therefore you know build their
applications across this growing
ecosystem so that's the why now that
which microformats is an instant
question there have been dozens of
different proposals and research of
different types of microformats done
over the years but it turns out about a
dozen of them have actually survived and
been well implemented so I'm going to
just give you the summary right here ok
h atom which is a microphone mat for
syndication any kind of date timestamp
content lots of different consumers of
that h card for contact information
organizations every single website has
an about page you should have that
marked up with h guard right because
it's getting indexed by search engines
there are tools that operate on it there
are client-side tools a browser tools
operate on it consume it similarly with
events h calendar for events same idea
all these tools and search engines index
it do things with it allow users to add
to their calendars this is an
interesting one we just started seeing
last year h media which has been stable
microformat for a while but just last
year we noticed that google has started
indexing it which is actually just a
couple months ago it started showing up
in the webmaster dashboard any of you
use the google's webmaster dashboard to
check out what those on your site so if
you look at what structure data the
google's finding they've started to say
hey we found some h media i have no idea
what they're doing with it but they are
clearly parsing it so H product is a big
one lots of e-commerce out there
obviously search engines want to help
you find products and search for them so
that's an easy one recipes was a
surprise so this was a microphone right
that was built almost as like a hobby
because there's just like a lot of
individuals that want to publish and
share recipes on the web and so they
developed a microformats to do so it
turns out google decided to build a
whole search engine based on h recipe
and the other search engines followed h
resume turns out people like to get jobs
and people like to hire people so
resumes have been also one of the
biggest sort of ecosystem microformats
have been put out there and
pushed by lots of sites like LinkedIn
and then consumed by library so there's
this magic company that's built a
library that consumes H resumes that
they've licensed out to dozens of
different clients that are looking to
bring in information about jobs about
job prospects H review reviews on the
web right this has been age old and
taken off like like like mad and so
similar to products if you're looking
for product reviews that want to post
them on your blog you can do that and
there's tons of tools for doing that so
extra if you're aggregating any sites
are a review aggregation sites but it's
popular enough that if there are sites
if your site has an aggregate of reviews
about a product you can do that as well
and then there's a several rel attribute
values that have taken off and been well
supported in Google and various other
different applications web sign in
advanced search Google's authorship
where it shows you the image of the
person who actually authored a page next
to the search result is all based on rel
author and rel me and those are micro
formats as well so if you write anything
for the web you should be using rel
author rel me NH adam to indicate hey I
wrote this you know you should show my
name and picture next to it in your
search results so those are the set of
microformats and this whole presentation
will be online so don't worry you don't
need to write all those down so that's
where we also microformats today okay
that brings us to the challenges and
lessons that have brought us to what
we've learned and built into html5 and
microformats too so there's a lot of
things that have happened over the last
eight years there's been numerous
different approaches to putting
structure information on the web and I'm
kind of curious how many of you actually
used any of these how many of you use
structure blogging anybody out there
okay I'm not seeing anyone about how
about Google base okay I'm seeing about
four or five hands of folks that
actually used or at least heard of
Google base right okay that's good you
guys are more educated than then more
experience than most the audience I've
talked to have never heard of Google
base at this point and then how about
google data anyone using google data
api's ok another about a half dozen
folks let's be let's be generous how
about common tag anyone hear about that
one too
ok a few folks so common tag was this
effort by Yahoo mean they basically
launched it they put a blog post up and
then there was nothing else as far as I
could tell that happened out of it so
there's been a lot of different efforts
over time I mean all these and then the
last few years have really seen an
explosion facebook launched Open Graph
protocol Google and Microsoft did a
schema.org Twitter did Twitter cards for
for link previews and and most recently
there was an effort called open metadata
org as well that started it seems like
everyone that wants to build more
metadata it starts a new effort to do it
but we can we've learned from all these
different efforts in the part of the
gold microformats is say okay well what
seems to be interesting to people let's
incorporate that and move on so what
kind of lessons have you learned well
I'm going to just give you three quick
lessons that we've learned here one is
that accessibility is really really
really important so when you're when
you're dealing with markup on a page on
an HTML page you have to make sure that
anything you add for computers for
machines does not interfere with the
experience for humans this seems like an
obvious thing and for the most part
we've done a pretty good job but in some
cases we slipped up so we use the
abbreviation element to capture machine
information that's a longer expression
of human readable information this is a
case where it's actually workable so the
abbreviation title attribute it must be
human readable and listenable if you
work with any kind of content that is
going out to screen readers which should
be everybody every single mobile site
especially you should make sure that
your title attributes are human
listenable as well if you're displaying
a date something like the ISO date is
actually more internationally readable
than any other date format so that's
that's okay you can do that what you
can't do is long strings of numbers and
letters and digits that mean nothing
except if you're a programmer okay so
we've come up with a couple of different
methods of working around that and I'll
just briefly go over these the first is
the value class pattern with separate
dates and times and that's specifically
for dayton times the second is the value
class pattern that uses the value title
class name as well which separates human
readable information and mystery number
information into an
to span so that it does not affect the
user experience at all we test this with
various different screen readers it's
not a problem we know it works so
separate but note that separate data
should be the exception anytime you put
data into different places that's the
same thing there's a chance it's going
to diverge over time it's it become
corrupt but sometimes you have no choice
you have to present one thing and then
give them machine something else that
they can understand the second big
lesson we've learned over time with
microformats our class collisions and
the losses of microformats from sites so
how many have you ever used a micro
format on a site and then all of us and
notice that something is displaying
differently anybody okay well maybe you
guys haven't experienced it but we have
seen people where they were already
using class names like summary
description some of the very generic
terms we've gotten some microformats so
when they added their microformats they
all of a sudden got effects that they
didn't want to see the second problem
happens that you'll have a designer that
knows microformats it comes in and adds
them or a developer to a site all right
well the site goes through a redesign
they rip out all the class names in the
CSS and everything and do a redesign
what happens although microformats
disappear because you're like oh I don't
know what these class names are they
don't seem to do anything there's no CSS
for them right okay so what we come up
with and this is what little is more in
microformats two is prefixed class names
to make it clear hey these are special
these are part of microformats and so
that'll increase the chance that people
will take a minute and wait and notice
hey wait maybe this is something I
should hold on to and keep for data
reasons the other thing it does is it
avoid collisions so by having these
little special a prefix name is it means
that your style rules that are using
your class names which can be whatever
words you want are likely to collide
right we've done a lot of research and
these prefixes are just not used outside
of microformats and lastly one of the
awesome benefits it's actually enables
generic parsing and this is all talk
about what generic parsing has has
brought us with micromax so the last
problem that we encountered with
microformats is too much markup so how
many of you would try to add
microformats to a page you like all i
want to add all these spans and divs and
everything okay yeah you guys know this
problem right so you may have seen
markup you may have had to add markup
like this or it's like just to mark up a
single person's name it takes me two
elements and a two class names
that's that's that's too much I
shouldn't have to do that or if I'm
marking up an entire you know middle
name and last name and first name takes
even more now this is a lot of class
names a lot of markup the funny thing is
if you try to do this with micro data or
rdfa it won't even fit on a slide it's
so much more code that it's crazy so the
fight like all of you the raise your
hands saying we'll microformats is too
much markup try doing anything of that
sort with microdata rdfa and you'll
wonder whoa that's that's actually a lot
more markup doesn't matter we can do
better right it doesn't matter if the
alternatives aren't doing as good of a
job we can do better so that's what
we've done in microformats to with a
single element you can mark up common
examples in fact most cases there's
already an element for a person's name
or a hyperlink and all you have to do is
attach one class name so by attaching a
class name to that the microphones to
parsers know how to pull out a person's
name or name of an object URL of an
object or the photo of an object and
this candles so many common cases of
markup on pages that we think this is
the lightest weight way to get data out
of the page and that brings us to the
more exciting sense part of our
presentation which is today with html5
and microformats to what is new what can
you do what works what is awesome
cutting-edge stuff ok how many of you
publish html5 or HTML data tables at all
anybody ok this is this is a this is a
more solid markup crowd than most I like
to like to see that did you know that
there's actually a google search engine
like display benefit to doing so has
anyone done that so what happens and
let's see if the network connections
working here i can show you a sample so
this is an html5 table it might look
like a table but
it actually is a table
so you can kind of see the TR TD th is
there right okay hcard some v cards ok
so we close that now it's one big table
with 500 table rows huge okay what does
that mean it's got one row of table
header cells and the rest are all tds
that's it there's no microformats oh
this is just html5 so what happens when
you do that when you actually mark up
your stuff with semantic HTML five
tables well Google actually pulls that
out and processes it they parse the
entire page they notice oh what there's
actually five hundred items here they'll
put that into a search result and then
they extract the table headers and put
those in a summary here name location
website Twitter and they ain't even
included the first two entries from the
table altima semantics I've never seen
this documented anywhere on google sites
like all the Google support you know
search engine marketing type things as
far as I know no one knows about this
technique but the technique is just use
proper semantic HTML turns out google
actually do something with it right
they're clearly not documenting
everything that they support but they
are and it's it's pretty awesome so if
you if you mark it up they will crawl it
okay that was a really html5 all the
HTML table data table features i showed
you have been around since the 90s so
maybe that's one of the reasons why
they're supporting them now because
they're really really well I just
thought since no one else needs to be
writing about it you should know about
it my two two of my favorite features in
html5 a time element a data element okay
this has made huge strides forward for
publishing data in HTML and publishing
data in ways the API should consume it
right I'm not going to talk about the
data attributes data hyphen attributes
that's that's four that's four script
libraries so a time element super
powerful turns out people publish dates
and times a lot on websites and it was
one of the biggest challenges we had
with microformats as you might imagine
when we talk about that value class
pattern now you can use a single time
element we're used to have to use
multiple different spans or whatever to
do things and that's really cool you can
put the machine readable version one
place and actually that's reasonably
human readable maybe if you
programmer and then these are localized
version in another spot in the display
or you can actually combine the two you
can combine separate dates and times and
using the value class pattern as well
now as a trade-off here you can decide
well I don't want to repeat my data or I
do want to put locale specific display
information one or the other you decide
which ones more important for you for
your design for your site and then you
can pick a solution that works they both
work so recently recently being like a
year now i guess the time almonds minute
hands to allow multiple different
granularities of time this is one of
those things that if you look at every
programming library every programming
language time is measured in what anyone
seconds or milliseconds since epic start
right 1970 oh 10 1 of course every date
and time you provide has the resolution
of a second right if I tell you tomorrow
I mean tomorrow exactly at midnight zero
zero point zero zero zero right no
that's not how humans work and that's
not how content works so that's not how
markup should work so markup marks up
what should be human content sometimes
you talk about the year no more
precision than that you can do that now
sometimes we have the year in the month
this is published all over the web blog
archives and you can do that now as well
or maybe you don't have the year you
just publish the day and the month like
a birthday that's a very common use case
there's lots of publishing of durations
on the web as well so you can say hey
this is 205 seconds long or this album
is 42 minutes 59 seconds long a little
bit of trivia anyone anyone what album
is for 80 minutes of 59 seconds long
anyone's a very popular album
pink floyd the wall so i haven't quite
tried the Wizard of Oz Pink Floyd thing
yet all the way through but I've heard
that that has some interesting
synchronicity so time element it works
with human time measurements data
element like I said prime my second most
favorite element in html5 this lets you
completely replace that whole value
class pattern minimal span thing so the
awesome thing here is it does exactly
what you think it would do you have the
machine readable data in the value and
the human readable data in the display
between the tags pretty simple to use
works great this brings us to
microformats too so I've shown you a
little bit about the prefix class names
and these are for identifying what's a
micro format and what are the different
microformat properties the next thing we
do is microformats to is we make sure
that every microformat was simply an
object like an age card and a flat set
of properties no nested properties no
sub properties having a flat set of
properties makes it much simpler to use
single class markup for common cases you
saw earlier where I use a single class
name like classical's age card on a link
to a person that will give you their
name their URL potential ur photo as
well if you get if you have a photo
inside and this is all live documented
on the wiki so if you're looking for
more information and this is all with
Mitch much more details there and
examples of example markup of a single
class name what kind of JSON is produced
different elements etc
microphones to has come a long way last
year the last year we saw the emergence
of three different microformats to
parsers and a test suite as well so
actually almost four if you count the
browser javascript extension extension
framework and no Jas implementation
separately they mostly reuse the same
code its parser code of course they do
is JavaScript but they have you know
just enough to handle the different
environments and we have a fully
compliant PHP parser and there's a ruby
processor in progress as well anyone
here code post Python well you've got
the opportunity to help contribute to
advancing microformats and actually
produce a python parser from what i
understand it should it should it should
be less code than then Ruby or PHP right
so I hear okay well let's let's see it
awesome point is there's a test suite
there's interop all departures you can
test your work against these existing
open source projects and you can make
them all work they're pretty awesome and
they all they all have almost all have
like front ends that you can use as well
to to test things so for example
microformats node you type in a URL you
get microformats back in json there the
PHP version has got a little HTML area
that you can type in you can check a few
options and do things there as well
okay so I mentioned that you could use
microformats to produce an API for your
website every website in fact almost
every page of every website should
automatically have a read-only API to
start with and if you use microformats
if you mark up your page with
microformats so you have a set of people
then you get that API for free you don't
have to actually add it as a development
task you don't have to add a separate
URL oh how do I get this in JSON form
because if you have it microformats you
mark this up like that you run it
through a parser and you get that so you
get a set of items so each one of those
people is an H card they've got name URL
note categories photos everything back
as JSON consume it with whatever you
know JSON parser libraries you have and
whatever language you want and then you
can get any page with microformats as
data this is incredibly powerful once
you've written an API a consumer for the
JSON microformats like that for one page
then it works for every page right it's
the power of standards once you've
written to consume a standard you know
that anyone that publishes that standard
you will also enter operate with right
the flip side of that is you can write
custom code to handle twitter's api you
can write custom code to handle
Facebook's API you can hit right custom
code to handle app.net API you can write
custom code to handle I don't know who's
the flavor of the week anybody
livejournal no they actually support
open standards I don't want to pick on
them anyone else but the point is if you
conceal microformats you get all those
and more and this is what's on the
horizon so Christian talked about what's
going into Firefox OS and all the
different API is Web API support among
the things that we're building into
there is it is consuming microformats
okay how many of you gone to a website
and have found contact information
website and been like wow I have to copy
paste this or retype this in to my
address book turns out on the mobile
it's far more important even than on
desktop that you can one click add
contact information or event information
to your address book on your on your
phone or to your calendar on your phone
so we're going to be parsing
microformats in Firefox OS so that you
users can immediately add those okay
obviously we're going to start out with
contacts and events but I don't see any
reason not to parse them in general
because who knows what api's on what
applications people are going to build
its exceptionally powerful so this is
coming okay I want to leave a few months
for QA but before I actually did q it
every I as well people ask a lot of the
common a lot of common questions so why
don't I do I'll do an FAQ first so the
first the first most common question I
get is which microformats should I use
there's so many different options out
there there's classic microformats
there's a dozen or so that I showed you
that well supported there's the new
microformats to there's microdata
there's schema.org there's open graph
protocols Twitter cards okay so let me
simplify a little bit the first thing
you should do is whatever your page is
primarily about you should include what
I'm calling classic microformat one of
those dozen microformats that describes
that page okay whatever is the closest
thing you have and if you don't have one
you can always describe your page as an
H atom entry because almost every page
has a title has a name has a summary has
a publication date great just do that
you know that's the least you can do and
it may even have a photo if you do that
that will provide a hook for search
engines to display the little preview
information right or when you paste the
link in to insert your favorite social
network here almost all them now show a
little preview right this is one of the
ways that you can do that now for adding
microformats for adding data you know
for all the rest of the information on
your web page you want to use as little
mark up as possible and for that I'm
saying just use microformats too so use
my Calista to both will remain subject
the new partials will pick it up and for
all the nested data and that'll give you
your nice JSON API s so that will add
the least amount of page wait for the
maximum amount of JSON API bang right
lastly there are folks that want their
site to show up differently when people
link to it in facebook or twitter or
other locations if you do that if you
really want to customize the display
every preview then there's ways to do
that right so if you want if you want to
customize a way that your site previews
in facebook you have to use Open Graph
protocol to do that
these are all site-specific but they're
useful in that degree same thing for
twitter twitter cart meta tags for
twitter now they're all using meta tags
that do these previews so if you are
both customizing the preview for a
specific site means you're picking
something different than what you
necessarily have on the page and you're
using meta tags to do this you really
need to be careful that over time as you
change one it doesn't get out of sync
with the other so that that happens all
time we know that's happening with meta
keywords so much so that meta keywords
are worthless right but if you're going
to choose to use OGP or twitter cards be
sure to keep your meta tags in sync with
the page content itself ok second how do
I validate my microformats right you've
added this great mark up to your tool
what can you use to actually validate
make sure that they work ok the first
thing you can do is get the operator
extension for Firefox it's a great
extension there's a similar Chrome
extension called Mike chrome formats
that one works well too I particular
like the debug mode in operator it'll
show you all the different stuff it
finds it'll show you the the object
properties or they'll show you
converting to other formats all kinds of
great things it'll even show you why a
microphone Matt might be invalid google
has published a Rich Snippets testing
tool as well so for that for that case
where I said okay use include one main
microformat for the page google is
really good for that so you can check
the Rich Snippets testing tool and see
what they're picking up see what they're
finding Google doesn't find everything
yet they find all of the things that
they really need to want to pay
attention to to provide information and
search results and that's okay that's
their application right lastly I really
like the nodejs parsers you I the
developer Glenn Jones has published this
amazing nice front-end you I website you
can put a URL in you can put in various
different options you can say only parts
for these microformats and we'll give
you back all the JSON will give you back
all kinds of feedback and of course the
whole thing is open source so you can
even host your own validator to do that
ok third how do you get involved
microformats we're the first standards
organization to put everything on a wiki
literally our specifications are on a
wiki you can create an account you find
a typo and go help us fix it
right this is unheard of if you look at
other size organizations w3c IETF anyone
else there's a huge process to go
through to get changes made even the
folks there on the working groups right
I'm on working groups at w3c if you want
to publish a new draft it takes you at
least a week no joke now there's the
what working group that has a nice get
based specification repository which is
a great advancement and so they just
update their specs all time but this
one's a wiki and we basically assume hey
if you're creating an account we're
going to assume that you probably are
doing the right thing and not the wrong
thing sort of Wikipedia style so far
it's worked out okay yes we get some
span sometimes we clear it out pretty
quickly and i would rather clear out a
little bit of spam once in a while and
have a lower barrier participation that
make it so hard to participate that
people don't dissipate so code
microformats an earmark on right we
talked about how do it for your API for
search engines for link previews
obviously a great way to participate
we've got Twitter account where updates
go up there all the time and lastly my
performance ablaze communities that has
found that IRC works better than mailing
lists it turns out so the combination of
if you've got a lot to say put on the
wiki give it a URL or blog it or if you
just want to chat about something and
ask a few questions in real time use IRC
microformats on freenode and thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
