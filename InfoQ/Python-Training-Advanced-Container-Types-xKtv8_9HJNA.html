Python fundamentals curriculum we're
starting out with lab 4.5 and you can
just type in that code example and make
sure that it works and then we'd like to
extend it to also report on the evening
and handle midnight and let me give you
the two-second tour of importing we can
do four different kinds of imports I
think
yeah and I didn't actually catch that so
it just says returning it but I could
say X is equal to and X is now a
date/time object we haven't yet talked
about objects very much and X has a
bunch of members that will give me
information about the
date that I have date time object that I
have
and really quickly to talk about imports
the most basic import statement is to
import a module and it's just import and
the name of the module if the Mosel
doesn't exist then you'll get an error
and this creates a variable &amp;amp; local
namespace called date/time that points
to a module and you can actually see
where that module is stored if your
Python installation shipped with a
source code you could go read the source
code for the module assuming that is
written in Python much of the standard
library for Python is written in Python
some of it is written in C for
particularly high-performance modules
you can import something specific from a
module so to access that now command as
of that last import statement I have to
say date/time which is a package it's a
module that contains other modules
date/time which is a module inside of
date/time and that seems like a lot of
confusing typing so I could get that
second module by saying from date/time
import date time and now date time is a
variable that's pointing to a module
inside the date/time module
now everything is imported all now is
actually a function so it's not
important only modules are in portable
but I could rename modules that I import
with a different name by just adding as
name at the end and again that creates a
variable in the local namespace that's
pointing to a module that I imported yes
and an ideally you don't know the path
to the modules so lots of languages lets
you import code by specifying the path
Python prefers that you manage the path
it automatically puts all the system
modules in your path and then you don't
have to know the path and you don't do
path based imports you do name based
imports so there wouldn't be any sense
of saying like import dot dot some
module name it's purely name based and
either Python knows how to find it
automatically or doesn't and there's
ways to manage that so I did I did
actually I did actually specify yeah I
said from date/time which is this module
import date/time which is actually a
class and if I just say import date/time
I will get the module if I want to
import something from it I have to say
from the module import something else
and don't worry too much about the
mechanics of imports because we'll talk
about them at great length here so all
the top all the top level built-in
modules are in the site packages
directory for Python which on Windows is
in Python 2.7 Lib I believe and it
automatically sets up to look in that
spot first whenever you run an import
statement so are people starting on that
lab
so if hours before 12:00 we take morning
if it's before 18 which every six
o'clock afternoon LF it's less than 21
we type evening else night that's fine
there is actually and you could say if
our is less than 12 and Python does on
some languages don't let you change
arithmetic operators with Python will so
see X is equal to 10
that works as we would expect
and nicely enough so does that so that
would say if X is greater than 11 less
than 12 its between 11 and 12 11 is less
than X X is less than 12 in mathematical
yeah exactly
a lot of languages would make you say
like if X is less than 12 and X is
greater than and you can do it that way
as well but Python does allow the
shortcutting arithmetic notation so has
everybody got their their date parsing
script working it's got a few ifs and
else if let's talk about some more
complicated data types and I'll just
show something in the answer to you
Lee's question really quickly we
actually have a lab later on that is
using a built in module that lets us
build complicated command-line
interfaces a parse but for really simple
usages of command-line interfaces the
cysts module provides access to lots of
our environment and SISTAR's v is the
list of command-line arguments there's
also Arg C which is the count and those
are kind of arcane names but
long-standing UNIX practice I was there
not Argosy nice I'm printing Arg V and
it prints a list which has all the
command-line arguments that I give it if
I add command-line arguments there they
are an Arg V and the first one is always
the name of the script that's currently
executing
that seems really dumb
and not the date portion
so now is a and that's actually some of
the confusion with the date time you
first look at it it kind of seems
confusing but it has portions for
working with just times just dates
differences between dates differences
between times and now my variable now is
equal to date time now whatever the
return value of that is which is a date
time object that has the year the month
the day the hour the minute the second
the microsecond or there's a few
built-in formatting methods that are
somewhat limited ISO format but is more
readable so for we were having trouble
running help before and help functions
on existing objects so if I say help
date there is no date there is no
variable name date help is a function
that takes a variable I do have a
variable called now and now is a date
time objects I could call help on my now
and as far as syntax it's just a
function call it requires parenthesis it
accepts one argument which is the thing
that it is going to introspect and tell
you about it's there it's in the list
it's just down a little ways so this the
first functions help talks about I'll
start with underscores and these are
emulation functions we'll talk about
that when we get to there basically ways
to make your object respond to variety
of built-in operators after that
anything that doesn't stop with
underscores built-in functions to the
object your introspect and in this case
there's only about twelve of them or so
they're not too bad ISO format you can
specify a separator it returns a string
and ISO 8601 format separators use the
separate the year from the time defaults
to T yeah yes argh V is always filled
with whatever the command-line arguments
we're that were passed to the script
when it executes and note in an
interactive interpreter
there Nia I told you wrong there is no
aargh see and my interactive interpreter
there is no script it's the name of the
interpreter if you're actually running a
script it'll always the first command
allows be the name of the interpreter
and there is no argh seat which strikes
me is really dumb and I'm kind of
convinced that there used to be but you
can use the built in function lengths
Elian to tell you how long a list is ok
so let's talk about some more
complicated types container types we've
already talked a little bit about lists
the syntax for lists is to put square
brackets around a comma separated list
of values lists are mutable we talked
about that as well
lists are ordered there is a concept of
order which means that if you evaluate a
list twice in a row without doing
anything to it it's items are in the
same order that they used to be it's
important because not all collection
types in Python are have a concept of
order and lists can be heterogeneous you
don't have to store only one kind of
item in a list at a time
so this is perfectly legitimate
it's a list it's got three different
types of variables in it you can
initialize lists a couple of different
ways this is the normal way in which I
would create a list just using the
brackets you can initialize empty lists
with empty brackets with nothing inside
them you can also use the built-in list
function which returns an empty list and
can also be used to convert some other
type to a list so you notice I pass it a
string and it converts that to a list of
single characters list the function will
accept any type that supports iteration
which strings do and a bunch of other
types do and we'll convert them to a
list this will be important later on and
then the cool thing about lists is that
they are iterable we can talk about
positions in a list Python uses zero
position syntax and it uses brackets to
index into lists so X is equal to list
asdf which gets converted into a list of
characters and I can index to an
individual spot and list by appending
opening and closing brackets and a
position to my list variable that makes
sense to everybody
there's then that another programming
languages some languages make the first
spot be one but Python has the first
spot be zero in the true computer
science fashion and the last spot be the
length minus one you can add things to
lists and change their contents
that's what mutable means so not only
can we fetch something at a single
position we can also assign to it
it's mutable and lists have some utility
functions so I'm running the help
function on my object which is of type
list so it'll show me the help layout
for the list object and again I'm gonna
ignore the underscore methods at the
beginning which list has a ton of and it
usefully has append I can add things to
the end it has pop you can see a little
down you can emulate stacks and queues
with lists pretty trivially it has count
which is a search function not the
length of the list lengths of lists are
determined by the built-in LAN which
works on a bunch of different types
and we can also take things out of the
list with the built in de L we talked
about a little earlier so that count
function I just mentioned specifically
because it doesn't return you the length
of the list what it actually does is
search for values in a list and tell you
how many there are so there's one D and
there's no and the built-in list type
has a bunch of wonderful properties the
implementation is fascinating but it has
really fast indexing and sorting
properties so it's really common to use
lists as the main tool by which you
process things and in place sort them or
search on them and those operations are
extremely fast list is the most heavily
optimized data structure and Python
thanks to Tim Peters so count says I'm
passing a value D and I'll look in my
list and see how many times that value
occurs so my list X it's searching yep
and similarly there was index
which will look at the values in my list
and return me the position of the value
if it's found and if it's not I'll get
an error
lists are iterable it's our first the
first iterable type we're going to talk
about so we've looked at branching ifs
and else the other common thing you're
gonna do in scripts to manage your
program flow is loop and python supports
are a couple kinds of loops supports for
loops and the syntax for for loops and
their semantics are different than you
might be familiar with other languages
for loops are specifically for indexing
specifically for looping over indexes
into objects typically so if you're
coming from AC e or java language you
might be used to a for loop to look
something like this
if I could type right something like
that there's a whole mini syntax in for
loops so for loops are really simple in
Python
it is for value in iterable and I'll say
X in this case and value is not the
index value is the actual value so when
I run this for loop it's printing the
actual contents of my list if you really
want the index when you're looping over
iterables you can use the enumerate
function
which returns things two at a time we
turns a pair of the key and the value
but knowing the index of the thing in
the list turns out to be a little less
important in Python than in lots of
other languages because of the richness
of the built-in mmhmm yep
so count is how many times does the
value I'm looking for occur in my list
so here's that makes sense there's two
zeros and index will return the first
occurrence if there is one otherwise it
will throw an error yeah so let's go
back over the for loops real quickly the
first one that I did is this one and the
syntax is straightforward right it's a
multi-line statement so there's a colon
at the end the bobby of the statement is
indented which in this case is just one
line and it's printing the value we're
looping over an iterable and when we
loop over and it will by default we just
get each of alyou one at a time but we
don't know what position that value is
and we could look it up with the index
function but if for some reason you
wanted to know what the index did
everything was as you loop through there
is a built-in function frequently used
called enumerate that takes an iterable
and instead of just giving you a value
gives you the position and the value of
the index and the value and when I ran
this loop then yeah when I ran this loop
then instead of just printing the values
like it did the first time it prints
first the index which is K and I
couldn't say I instead of K I suppose
it's not really a key it's an index and
the value so we'll talk about all the
built-in functions at some point there's
yeah there's about 60 built-ins and you
really need to know about 25 or 30 of
them and we will tour Python standard
library that has a bunch of additional
stuff the built-ins are things you don't
have to import to use they're just there
and if you look at
there's a special module called built-in
you don't need to explicitly import
anything that's built-in hence the name
built-in but if you wanted to see
everything that's built in you could
look at the attributes of the built-in
module okay there's a hundred and fifty
built-in things that also includes all
the values that are built in as far as
built-in functions there's you know 30
important ones
yeah I could use help on it as well
which is really long because it's
describing everything it's describing
every object in there as well as listing
every object they're just lists the
objects okay and you could look it's
page 13 in your curriculum if you want
to follow along at the simple looping
that we're talking about there's in
addition to a for loop there's a while
loop built into Python people familiar
with other programming languages what's
the difference between a for loop and a
while loop yeah so while loop you're
checking a condition and you may not
know how many times you want to execute
for loops are typically used when you
know exactly how many times you want to
run or you're enumerated over something
that has a predefined length so while
loops could potentially run without ever
stopping which is sometimes useful and
Wiles are just like if statements they
take some sort of boolean value not
necessarily an interval so we were
looping over X with for if I do while X
as long as X had something in it my
while loop would run forever because
it's just evaluating the boolean this of
X it's not actually iterating it
it's a while length X
and pop removes the top most first item
in my list so that works while length x
the first time it runs the length
function on my list X which presumably
had some stuff in it
therefore length is greater than zero
therefore my while condition is true
that runs the body of the loop I pop
something I print X zero zero and five
and the little nine in there is the
return value of x dot pop and my
interactive console is automatically
showing me the value of every statement
that I run I wouldn't get that out but
if I ran this as a script it runs again
length of X and length of X is shorter
but there's still something in it a
couple of three values I pop something
off it prints the thing that I popped
off there are five and prints X which
now has just zero and zero and so forth
until my container is empty
in which case length of X returns zero
which is a true fie value of zero and
false and my while loop stops running so
while loops like if statements it's a
multi-line statement it in ends in a
colon there's an indented body
underneath there's no parentheses around
the boolean condition necessary those
are optional and that's all for a while
yeah and actually it's popping from the
end of the list so it by default is
acting like a queue but there's
built-ins on the there's there's
built-in functions to treat lists as
though they were stacks or as though
they were queues first in first out or
last in first out either way so you can
emulate stack or queue behavior with a
list pretty trivially the other cool
thing about lists is they have a whole
mini syntax built around those brackets
the next thing we're gonna do is a lab
we're going to iterate over a list and
explore the mini syntax around brackets
and this is somewhat unique to Python as
far as I know lots of other languages
you're familiar with have bracket
based indexing of things let's go ahead
and give ourselves a list using a
built-in function range is a built-in
function and it returns a list from the
start value to just before the end value
so I have the value 0 through 9 in my
list and so far we've looked at indexing
to a particular position and that works
our bracket our brackets can take three
values separated by colons to index and
they can take positive and negative
numbers and figuring out what all that
means can be a little challenging I'll
start with the easy ones the first
number you pass a bracket is the
starting position and if you supply an
ending position instead of returning a
single piece of the index a single value
it returns a slice
and it's it's nice that I've got the
numbers synchronized up here it's
returning me the slice that is starting
at the fifth position zero one two three
four five through ending in the seventh
position and you can think about the
positions as the commas in the list
they're sort of between the values so I
said five through seven and that only
gets me five and six it does not include
the seven the seventh position is right
here yeah if you if you think about it
as the position of the item itself then
the slicing index is returning one
before the the last one is not included
it's a non-inclusive know the last
number is the position no no length of
the slice if I say zero through one I
get that single item I get that single
item if I say 1 through - I'm not
getting a slice that's too long I'm
getting a slice that's made up by taking
all the values between the first
position and the second position I can
specify up to three numbers but we're
not there yet okay so there's one more
number I can specify I can leave off
anything I want to so if I say just X 1
that's the one position if I say X : and
don't fill in the second number it is
assumed I mean to the end of the list so
that's how to get all the list except
for the first item I have a slice that
starts at the first position so right at
that comma and I left off the ending
condition but it would be the length of
the list so it would be the last comma
here that's not actually printing out
and similarly if I leave off the first
number it assumes you're starting at the
beginning of the list
so I'm getting from the zeroeth position
which again isn't printed through the
one to three third position 0 1 2 0 1 &amp;amp;
2 here 3 positions get the actual list
I'm working on and my numbers can be
positive or negative
so anybody want to speculate about what
that will do I know I have a smiley face
in brackets doesn't seem wrong that this
evaluates so I left off the first number
and it would be by default that begins
the list let's go ahead and put that in
so it's gonna start at zero the second
number represents the position that's
gonna go to and if you specify negative
numbers it starts at the end and counts
backwards so this is all the list except
for the last item and it's the exact
same thing as saying the second position
in my slice is the length of the list
minus one well I can just leave off that
length of the list and supply the minus
one so again if you think about other
languages you've used where you have
lists and very frequently you do want
things like give me everything except
for the last one
or give me everything except for the
first one there's a built in mini
language between brackets there's and
the first condition can be negative how
about that one what does that do
the first position is going to start at
the end and count backwards so let me
get get my actual list here so it's
starting here on two three four then the
second number is left off and by default
that would be the end of the list so
this will get me the last four items in
my list and I could give them both
negative numbers if my order works out
and say start from four back and go to
two from the end crazy right
okay there's one negative numbers are
counting from the end of the list
positive numbers are counting from the
beginning of the list yep one more
semicolon and it's always implied and
it's always one by default but I can
supply it and say to and in fact let's
do this so it is very good I have a
start position of default because I
didn't supply it that would be the
number before the first : looks good and
supply it I have an ending position of
default that would be the end of the
list by default I didn't supply it but I
could and then to is how I'll increment
and this is getting me every other item
in my list usually if I iterate over a
list I get every item I can get every
other item or every third item or every
fourth item
unfortunately negative numbers make no
sense in this context cuz I don't think
I could take one more thing between
square brackets so three numbers what's
the first number represent starting
point starting location and if all I
specify is the first number I just get a
value not a slice I have to specify a
second value at least by putting in com
a colon even if I don't say what the
number is but the second number is the
ending location be false to end the list
and the third number is how I increment
every one by default but every other etc
it's a whole mini syntax between
brackets and it's super incredibly
useful as you know if you've done this
processing at all lots of stuff that
it's several function calls and other
languages can be reduced to one bracket
expression that you have to think about
for just a second so go ahead and make
yourself a new file call it class PI I
would like you to put in that file a
list that has all the names of your
classmates print off the list with a for
loop so when you run it it should print
all the names one at a time in a for
loop and that much of the lab is in your
textbook
it's lab 5.2 and it once you just print
hello name we're name is the first name
and then I'd like you to do three extra
things so go ahead and follow the
instructions
all the first names you can look at
people's name tags print off each name
hello name in a for loop and then print
the last name in your list not the last
name but the last item in your list
print the last two items in your list
and print every other item in your list
also using for loops and using our
spring slicing notation oh and there's
one thing I forgot to mention
here which is it's kind of implied but
even if we're just specifying one
position ie we don't want a slice we can
still use negative numbers so there you
go for free the last item in your list
is negative one so it varies I'll show
you a pet that is the preferred style
for everything a lot of the standard
library comes from ports from other
languages like the unit testing
libraries a portage a unit and so the
unit test library uses Java standards
which is all camel case in general
Python prefers underscore and lowercase
particularly for variables but it's
really common to use camel case for
classes and objects and all uppercase
for things intended to be consonants
although python does not have a constant
type yep the last name in your list the
last two names in your list and every
other name in your list all in one
program so when you run it it should
print out hello each of the names in the
class and then hello the last name hello
last two names hello every other name
this would be a good time actually while
people are hitting labs I pull up a blog
post earlier that I had put up from a
previous class of additional resources
you should know and these might be
useful as you're going through and doing
labs I personally am a big fan of Python
on a nut shell which is a desktop
reference to the Python language and
good chunk of the standard library Alex
Martelli and one of the Python gurus
there are other books that are online
and that are more tutorial based and I
mentioned a couple of them putting the
official Python tutorial and Ivan the
Python code like a Python ista you
should read when you've completed this
course and we'll probably talk about the
last day a little bit and also Doug
Hellmann's Python module of the week is
now out in book form it's like 1,500
pages it's like this gigantic book but
just to get a guided hands-on tour of
Python standard Lib those are great but
in general python has really good
documentation and so you shouldn't
restrict yourself to just the help
function
you can go and look at pythons built-in
documentation and for instance here's a
list of all the built-in functions and
if you click on one it's actually the
same content as help but frequently
there will be some more tutorial like
usage with it I do mention the built-ins
and the keyword modules which will give
you a list of all the built-ins and
keywords and some tools which those of
you who are on Windows should think
about using a replacement console
possibly I got a good question from you
Lee who's playing more with the first
example but to change the type of
objects a lot of languages use a keyword
to cast the type from one to another and
Python actually uses functions the
built-in functions and they're named
after the type so there's a function int
that takes a value and attempts to make
an integer out of it pumpkin float
there's a function STR for Strings boo
bol for boolean's and they're all
built-ins that list of built-ins that I
pulled up moments ago
okay so everybody's completed that
alphabetize your list and don't
alphabetize it by going in and retyping
anything so I said that the built-in
functions or the built-in list type has
a concept of order it also has a
built-in sort function and there's ways
to pass your own comparator to the
built-in sort function but by default it
will try and sort the list if the list
is homogeneous or if all the types on
the list provide their own comparison
functions it can successfully sort and
it's not very interesting to sort a list
that was already sorted there's also a
reverse function which sorts it and then
reverses the order
and it works on strings just goes by
alphabetic case by default and note that
this is a destructive sort that's
modifying your list in place so you have
a different list after you call the sort
function than you do before it and a
couple of other notes about lists we
probably should mention lists are
mutable types and we talked about this
really early on but if I say Y is equal
to X I have two tags on the same
variable that variable is mutable so if
I change one I change the other what if
I wanted a copy of the first list to be
able to modify a change maybe sort and
not mess with the first one there's some
built-in functions for copying things in
Python but actually the default way of
copying things is this you'll see this
idiom very frequently I'm taking a slice
of my list and it's a slice that starts
from the beginning and goes to the end
and slices return copies so that if you
take a slice and modify the slice you
don't modify the original so in this
case now Y and X look like the same
thing but in fact are not so I made a
copy with just brackets : and that's
implying the beginning of the list to
the end of the list return me a slice
that's as long as the whole list it's a
copy
make sense yeah so and that's one of the
piece of syntax that we've been using
and not explaining but dot is the
dereference operator for python and in
Python everything is an object so in a
lot of languages you have a distinction
between simple types and complex types
that might have additional things
besides their value but everything even
simple types in Python actually are
and they have a multiplicity of built-in
functions on them so yes if X is a list
of names X has a member function just
because it is a list called sort they
are part of the list and notice there's
not actually that much stuff to know
here I can't just highlight the last
column for a list you need to know
append it adds it to the end count
counts how many instances of a value
extend lets you append one list to
another so a pin just gives you one more
list and let's look at that really
quickly
with me so far right I just added one
more vitae my list if I wanted to add
another list that I had this doesn't do
what I want it to do it means that the
last position is a value that has two
things is a list itself what I wanted to
do I would have to use extend and it
copies all the items from the iterable
you give it and adds them to the list I
just did the range to get me back my
original list without the stuff in it so
all range does is give me a list of
numbers index we've talked about insert
here's my list
it's position first I think yeah nope
list is built-in ex inserted or insert
inserted at a particular place there's
pop removed reverse and sort which we've
talked about we've covered everything
built-in on lists and let me look at
your problem and then there's one other
piece of syntax to know about lists okay
so if you don't specify anything and
just enter it is a syntax error because
you have to specify the name that you
want to dereference it by when I'm
getting extra stuff I'm hitting X and
then tab and your interactive will
autocomplete and this gives you a list
of all the things that you could say
here like insert is one of those things
so up here I hit tab and in my console
instead of showing a little pop-up like
that it prints out the whole list but
that's just a this is not specific to
Python a specific type ipython which is
a interactive console and this is
basically doing the same thing I hit tab
and here you get a list instead of
printing it out this assumes you're
running under a console only terminal
and so it just prints out everything
what if you wanted to check and see if
something was in a list how could you do
that if I wanted to make sure that
yemm's name was in my list of classmates
how could I do that I could do count and
check and see if the value of count was
greater than zero so I could do names
count yem greater than zero that would
work in an if statement the
preferred way to do this and see if I
still have while and is to use the in
operator and the in operator returns
true or false and it's just presents and
instead of doing if y dot count simian
greater than 0 as my if statement which
does work but you read that and it's not
necessarily fluent if I just say if
simian in Y that's a lot more fluent and
the in operator supports a variety of
types as we'll see
like strings so I'm checking for the
presence of a given character in a
string okay do we have enough time to
tackle strings in a little more detail
yeah we do we got 10 minutes to lunch
time thoughts questions ok so insert
takes a position and a value so you need
to the position and you can put 0 if you
want to insert it at the top which is
the implementation of push if you're
looking for stacks but I should say
while the Python lists they're really
ridiculously performant it's worthwhile
if you're a C programmer to read Tim
Peters implementation of the sorting
features in lists because it's actually
really cool several algorithms
implemented depending on like how big
the list is and whether it's a
heterogeneous or not about the only
performance gotcha is actually inserting
at the beginning of lists if you have
very large lists inserting at the
beginning of list is an expensive
operation
okay so strings can we talk about
strings a little bit more we actually
haven't done too much with strings we've
specified that we can use single quotes
double quotes or triple quotes on
strings I forgot to mention the best
part about or the reason for triple
quotes and I should mention a couple
other pieces of Python syntax so the
reason for triple quotes among other
things is a triple quoted string can
span multiple lines by default strings
can only span one line one and it
complains syntax error I don't have a
closing quote if I want to have a long
string that has a lot more content
I can use triple boots and it does in
fact have that embedded new line in it
triple quotes are also used for
documentation where do you suppose this
documentation comes from it actually
comes from Python source and the Python
syntax specifies some places you can put
plain strings they're not assigned to
any variables and they will actually be
stored on the object that contains them
so for instance the first thing in any
Python program can be a triple quoted
string
that briefly describes the script and
that's not a syntax error and there are
actually ways of programmatically
retrieving that you can also use this is
called dock strings you can also use
dock strings when we get to you can use
dock strings in classes and methods when
we get to functions and again they'll be
remembered and can be retrieved so all
the stuff you're reading when you use
the help function is actually embedded
via dock strings right in your code and
we'll have a future lab where we'll note
you can also embed parsable and runnable
tests in your dock strings that verify
that the implementation of your program
is correct so doc string is a triple
coded string does not assign to anything
and at a plot that appears in a few key
places and the key places are the first
line of any namespace so the first line
of my script I have a triple quoted
string that's actually significant I'm
not assigning it to any variable but it
gets assigned to the doc string variable
of my scripts namespace when I run the
program it doesn't appear you don't see
it but my it's like a comment but
comments are thrown away when the
program is compiled and this is actually
saved and can be later retrieved so when
we use help we're looking at the doc
strings that are embedded in the Python
source code of the libraries so the
primary use of docstrings is to document
your code in ways that are runtime in
respectable because it is very common
for somebody to be poking around your
Python library in the interactive
console and they don't wanna have to go
someplace else necessarily to read a
quick brief help they can just they can
look at the documentation is actually
part of your source code and is
retrievable at runtime so it's a really
nice feature built in and there's a
library to let you embed simple tests
that look like interactive console
sessions that you can then run so you
can say this function does this here's
an example of it running and the output
should be and it'll run your doc tests
and tell you that all of them are
working or not
which as long as they enhance your
documentation is a really useful is a
really useful tool it's not a full unit
testing suite but it's a useful tool
what else about strings here
let's talk about dicing and chopping
strings up a little bit strings can be
indexed into although they're not
mutable and we already know everything
there is to know about indexing into
strings because it's just like lists my
name we can get a single position or you
can get the last character we can get a
slice just like lists same stuff works
on strings
so again if you're comparing strings and
you're you know looking for a prefix or
something you can use the bracket mini
language to do that
there's also split and join built-in
functions for converting to and from
lists based on a delimiter so my name X
dot split and a by the way my ipython
show ending with a question mark like
that is a shortcut for help X dot split
but that is a ipython ik specific built
in don't expect it to work if you're not
running ipython not part of the language
so help on X dot split it splits based
on a separator so X was my name and X
dot split and I'm passing it a separator
value of a space returns a list with all
the values no separator and
all right so why is the list X is the
name and if I wanted to go the other way
and what I'm doing yep and it's not
actually a pattern there is a red X
version of split by the basic version of
split is looking for a single character
and it did yes mm-hmm
so I ended up with a list that doesn't
contain any spaces but contains each
piece that was uh between the spaces yes
yes it's a list that contains two
strings to go the other direction
this is a common idiom and it's kind of
confusing
so the string type has a function split
that splits a string by a separator the
string type also has a function join but
in this case instead of taking a
separator it takes a list and it joins
by the value of the string itself so
that line 17 there is really this Z
equals a string and let's go ahead back
two spaces C join Y and if you remember
Y was a list before so to go back to a
string inserting a separator between the
positions in a list you use the
separator as a string and call join and
this works as a shortcut because the
string literal there is converted to an
object right away and the string literal
has methods
so the first string that's inside double
quotes is my separator and it does not
have to be a single character it could
be anything and it'll take a list as an
argument and it'll put all the items in
the list concatenate it together with
the separator I specified and you will
even see sometimes this because you just
want all the stuff in a list joined
together with nothing between it so I
have an empty string as my separator so
I generally use single quote whenever I
can because it's less keypresses
I use double quotes sometimes for long
strings because I think maybe I'll type
a single quote in it and triple quotes
for what I want to span strings the
other thing is if you want
your slash ends
any PHP programmers here I thought I saw
that on somebody's PHP makes the
difference between single quotes and
double quotes as to whether or not it
uses the escape character so when I say
slash in this is interpreting it as a
newline and you'll notice both single
quotes and double quote to do control
character interpolation slash in is a
newline slash T is a tab if you're
familiar with them then this will make
sense if you aren't familiar with them
it won't make a lot of sense if you want
to avoid interpolation you have to
specify that you have a raw string by
prefixing your string with an R
so if you have a string that has a slash
and a significant character and this
will bite you sometimes because that's
fine
there is no slash D control character
but just by changing the next character
there is a slash T there's a tab
suddenly you have a different string
than you thought you're getting so if
you're concerned about embedding control
characters when you're typing string
literals you can prefix your string with
an R for raw and you can also do that
for a Unicode entry if you're doing
slash and exited hexadecimal unicode's
although Unicode is gonna be beyond the
scope of this class and totally changes
from 2 to 7
it actually works in from two sorry from
2.7 to 3 it totally works in 3 it's a
little annoying in a 2.7 we already
talked about the built-in function
length which works for strings as well
as for lists and one more piece to
mention about strings operators we've
used the plus operator for concatenation
there's one other operator very
frequently used and
listed here under the additional
documentation which is formatting
strings this is from the book type in
the Python by Mark Pilgrim which is
slightly dated at this point but as a
really readable python tutorial the
percent operator which is modulus on
integers is the string formatting
operator in Python 2 and it looks for
percent signs in the string it's
applying so the percent operator between
the strings here is a string formatting
operator inside my doubly quoted string
this percent s is a format code that
means convert the first value to percent
s or to type string
and it supports a whole variety of
formatting options this says I have a
formatting code starts with percent and
then point 2f specifies a float with two
decimal places
and it's converting that float to have
two decimal places
by default the string operator uses
positional indexing and it uses tuples
which is going to be the next thing we
talked about after lunch so it put the
first string it got the first thing it
got got converted to a string and put in
this bass string the second thing I got
was converted to a string and put in the
bass string when we get to dictionaries
you can also do a name based
interpolation instead of position based
interpolation and there's a bunch of
formatting for numbers for dates
anything for Strings
sadly no tuples only tuples are very
similar to lists they're immutable as
their main difference and we'll talk
about tuples after lunch as our next
next type so effluent we're gonna talk
about tuples and dicks dicks are key
value stores complex key value stores
and we're gonna do a bigger lab and
we'll typically do larger labs in the
afternoon okay anything else we should
wrap up before lunch I think it's about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
