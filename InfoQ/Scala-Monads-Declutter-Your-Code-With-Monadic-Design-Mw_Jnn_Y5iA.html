I'm going to be talking to you today
about monads in the Scala language now a
monad is is a concept that's probably
going to be relatively unfamiliar to
most to most folks that that come from a
procedural or an object-oriented
programming background but it shouldn't
be too scary a term it's it's
essentially a kind of a design pattern
and design patterns is something that we
use all the time in object-oriented
programming let's say so you know for
example your adapter pattern or
composite pattern or strategy pattern or
what have you you can think of what I'm
about to introduce here as sort of them
the monad design pattern and it's
something that ends up being used fairly
commonly in in functional programming
and Scala in particular so we're going
to start with an example here the
motivation basically is is to try to
declutter this this code so what do we
got on left-hand side we've got three
classes foo bar Baz so from from foo you
can get a bar from bar you can get a Baz
and from Baz you can compute some value
we don't really care what what the
computation does just the idea is that
you want to be able to given a foo get
its bar and get the Baz from that and
then compute but the the Monkeywrench
that we're going to throw into the works
here is that that any of these methods
get borrow get Baz could potentially
return null and in fact let's say the
food that you start with could also be
null so on the right hand side you see
sort of the typical strategy for coping
with that the possibility of null or you
know possibility of failed computations
or fit you know failed intermediate
computations is you check for null so
you say if foo equals null then let's
break out early and return null
otherwise we keep going if the bar that
we get from food I get bar is null then
again we break out early and so on and
at the end of the day we're able to
return the value that that is computed
the other thing that you notice of
course is that is that our compute
method here returns in a capital i
integer
object rather than a an unboxed int
because again we're representing the
possibility of a failure in this say in
this computation so you know this is
fairly cluttered code here
it's a pattern people are familiar with
so you sort of come to expect it but you
know you really have to have to squint a
little bit to to picture that the intent
really is to say food get bar get Baz
dot compute and not not have to worry so
much about all the null checks okay so
another another possible style you might
see to try to deal with the possibility
of null instead of instead of doing the
early returns to breakout this is even
more verbose although a little bit more
sort of functional looking is using
these nested ifs so you know instead of
saying foo equals now return our Leila
let's let's just say all foo is not
equal to null then then we'll proceed
into our logic and so the innermost part
of our logic is we're returning
returning the value of Bab compute but
you know then of course we break out
into the series of else's where we have
to return null each time again
so it's essentially equivalent code and
we really don't like that all that much
either so in scala using a you know
basically the same sort of a java style
you can see if i flip back and forth
here these look basically identical and
really we're just is unhappy with that
this is a pure functional technique here
there's no that there's no immutable or
there's no mutable state there's no
early returns but it's still ugly it's
still hard to read so what we're going
to do now is is try to introduce the
concept of a monad to deal with the sort
of conflated concerns in that code all
right so what's a monad a monad is
basically something that has this shape
here and notice that that there is no
there isn't actually a trait in monad in
the in the Scala standard or standard
libraries that you can that you can
inherit from it's just if you want to
write something that has this monad
design pattern it's going to it's going
to have this following shape and the
idea of a monad basically is to provide
like I say here a standard interface
for composing or or sequencing
operations on some value that's
contained in the Monad so let's say that
this monad contains some some value a
there's some some value of type a then
the monad but provides a method map and
keep in mind this is functional
programming so this is going to be a
higher order method here because it's
taking a function as an argument the
function is going to be able to like we
say map from some value of type a to a
new value of type B what that'll give us
is a monad containing our new value of
type B flat map is a little a little bit
more oddly named and a little bit later
on you'll see why it's called that but
essentially it is fairly similar we've
got our contained value a and we're
going to take a function again higher a
higher order method here we're going to
take a function that translates a z'
into already wrapped monads of type B
and then return return someone out of
type B so we're going to call that a
monadic function that's that's being
passed in the flat map so in particular
to deal with to deal with this sort of
code bloat that we saw in our initial
example we're going to introduce the
option monad the idea of the option
monad is is to is to basically
encapsulate the idea of possible failure
in a type rather than just saying okay
well you know this this thing could be
null or not null so the two possible
concrete classes that implement this
option trait are called some and none so
you can see some has some value a and
none has nothing special and what we
want to try to do is define appropriate
map and flatmap for both of these for
both of these cases so here's how this
is going to look option is of the shape
that we want
what we had seen before was we were
going to have a monad of some type a
provide a map and a flat map each of
which have the shape word map map is
taking a regular function or flat enough
is taking a monadic function and both
return a new monad in this case option
so we want to actually implement these
in our in our two case classes
so some has the following implementation
map basically takes takes a function f
applies it to the value a and then wraps
that up in a new sum and flatmap the
implementation is even simpler we don't
have to wrap anything up we've got our
value a and the monadic function gives
us an option of B so we'll just apply
that directly now for for the next case
Arnon a case it's a little bit more it's
a little bit more interesting it's very
straight forward but it's but it's kind
of cute if we have a none value in other
words value representing essentially
null or a failed computation when we
apply some function to that via map what
we would expect to happen is we still
have null you know we still have a
failed computation we're not going to
pull a successful value out of thin air
right and similarly with flat map even
if the flat map or even if the function
provided is the you know again somehow
able to pull a successful option of Bees
out of thin air still we have no a we
have no value for a so we're just going
to return none and you'll see in a
second how this has some some
interesting consequences one point I
wanted to just throw in here is that the
standard scala option class is
implemented slightly differently but at
the end of the day the way that they
work is going to be the same so going
back to going back to our initial
example here reward we want to compute
now instead of an integer you know
capital I integer that could be
potentially now let's let's instead say
that we're going to explicitly represent
the possibility of failure with this
option let's say wrapper so the
possibility that our food bar could
return you know could could not have a
bar to return we're going to say okay
this is going to return the option of
bar which basically says well maybe
we'll get one or maybe not similar with
bars Baz and then Baz it's definition of
compute again that's just going to
return a straight in their computation
let's say we'll always be successful and
what we want to do is define our new
compute that's taking maybe of foo
or maybe nothing and return maybe an
integer or maybe nothing so let's break
this down let's say let's sort of start
from the inside out let's say that we've
got a Baz and we want to compute an
integer so that one's going to be pretty
straightforward
this compute path is going to have type
int and it's just going to call Baz
compute so that's that's pretty easy now
for the next step let's say well let's
say we're given a bar and we want to
compute the Rivi the result from that
and we'll use our previous definition of
compute Baz
well that's going to have type option
event because it could fail and again to
define things in terms of our options
map and flatmap
what we can what we can see is that bar
Baz could potentially fail and compute
that since since that's a function that
goes from remember we were talking in
terms of you know Monette and monads the
transform from some type a to some type
B well here we're transforming from some
type Baz to some type int that's that's
what that's the shape of compute Baz so
so we can say bar Baz dot map compute
paths now let's let's try to fill in the
next blank we want to do compute foo and
again this is going to probably return
an option event again it's the
possibility of failure now how do we
fill this in well the the tool that we
just that we just developed was a method
that takes a bar and an option event and
that's you recognize that from our
definition but before that's a monadic
function it's it's returning not just
two straight ends it's returning an
option event so what we'll do here is
say foo bar which gives us an option and
call flatmap on that with compute bar
and then finally we can we can define
our compute overall similarly saying you
know we will take our maybe foo and
flatmap compute foo on that because
compute foo again is a monadic function
or mud add method now this is highly
verbose here and probably looks a lot
worse than then it looked when we were
just returning null so let's let's
collapse this a little bit and this is
starting to look a little bit more
interesting it's it's it's definitely
much more condensed and it's also nice
in the sense
in the sense that we don't have multiple
points from which we can return from
this method you know either return a
value or return null but this is fairly
hard to read so we're going to take a
take a look at a couple more examples
and then come back to this one example
two here is let's say instead of
returning null from our get bar and get
Baz let's say if we if we get a value
back out let's say that that value is
always real but if for some reason we
don't have a bar in Foo or we don't have
a bad as in bar let's say that can throw
an exception and also just to throw an
additional kind of twist into things
let's say the compute can also throw an
exception so the easy way to do this if
we were in Java is to literally say you
know foo get bar get bad compute and
just accept that that well you know if
any of these thrown exception we're just
going to propagate this out and and just
declare that our compute method will
throw an exception and that's that's all
well and good but it's it's a little bit
sloppy engineering style in terms of in
terms of well you know you probably want
to be a bit more informative about what
kind of exception it was where it came
from what caused it perhaps so let's
let's let's expand on this just a little
bit to give ourselves a bit more of an
engineering challenge and say that say
that if if foo get bar throws something
we're going to actually throw something
specific a get bar exception and
similarly with bar if if get bass fails
we're going to throw a get baz exception
and if compute fails we're going to
throw a compute exception so now things
are starting to look a fair amount
uglier we've got some some try catches
and we could split this up a bunch of
different ways but but here's one
possible way we have one try block again
of course this could be nested try
blocks where we try food I get bar and
and you know try bar get Baz and so on
but the point of course is that as we
try to not lose any information about
the failure that happened we have to do
some work we have to we have to wrap up
our bar exception and a compute
exception wrap up the Baz exception a
compute exception and so on and in fact
I still cut some corners here because
I'm still not catching the
cute exception to do something with that
I'm just letting that flow directly out
from from compute so this is still
fairly sloppy and even so it's it's
clumsy so I'm gonna introduce a new
monad that's similar to the option monad
we're going to call this one validation
this is going to be somewhat drinking
from the fire hose here so so you may
want to pause the video at this point
and and kind of scratch your head over
this just a little bit but that I'll
walk you through it pretty quick this is
going to be very similar to option in
the sense that there is a trait that we
define and there are two cases one case
representing success and another case
representing failure in this case we're
defining map and flatmap fairly
similarly and I'm going to not talk
about lift fail for a second that's a
third method I've provided in here but
it just hold that thought map and
flatmap
on the success case actually looks very
similar to to what it looked like in the
sum case of the option monette that is
when we call map and provided a normal
function from a is to B's we're going to
apply that function to the contain value
or contain a and wrap that F of a up in
a new success object if we call flat map
that's going to literally just just
apply F using this this monadic function
f to a and if that succeeds it succeeds
if it's if it fails it fails our failure
cases is going to be different from none
in the option amount out in the sense
that our failure case actually has some
information associated with it it has a
map method it has a flat map method that
they don't just return none they return
a new failure containing some E and I'm
using e to represent exception but this
could actually be any type whatsoever it
doesn't have to be something that that
represents a throwable or an exception
or what have you now to get back to this
lift fail thing this is this is
something I should mention I've based
this validation monad implementation
here loosely on a validation trait and
in case classes from the Scala Zed
library which is very handy I'm not
going to talk too much about here but
it really does a good job of filling in
the blanks in the Scala in the Scala
standard library implementation it's
it's something that you should
definitely consider using or at least
exploring for your for your projects so
lifts fail is something I've borrowed
like I say loosely from from scholars ed
and what it's going to do is say well
let's say we have a validation instance
of type validation of E and a so you
know it would parameterised on some
arrow type and some value type and we
want to be able to use that you know
essentially translate that into a
validation of the same value type but a
different error type of some validation
of F and a now just just to point out
this is not something that is part of
any sort of standard monad interface but
it's something that we're going to need
because we're going to need to translate
from our get Bad's exception and get get
Bar exceptions into compute exceptions
so that we can treat these all as the
same type so under success our
implementation of lift failed does
nothing very interesting because we
don't have a failure that we're dealing
with but in the failure case where we've
where we're not containing a success
value or tender we're containing some
error value then we need to essentially
treat that sort of the same thing as map
where we create a new failure and apply
some some function f that translates
from our error type e to a new error
type F to the to the contain error value
and we'll wrap that up in a new failure
object so you'll see how I use this in a
second the the way that we apply
validation won't add too to our throwing
exceptions example is is is like this we
we do the same the same kind of thing
where we say well we're going to flat
map on our possibility of failure from
calling foo bar and we're going to flat
map again on our possibility of failure
from calling bar Baz and incidentally is
this is the last thing I was just
talking about we're going to make sure
that if there are any exceptions of type
bar exception or type as exception or
what have you
we're going to lift that failure into a
new compute exception okay so so cool
and this this is definitely more more
compact and more succinct than than we
had before
or with our try caches but it's still
pretty hard to read so our final example
of the day oh and I should mention that
it's a little bit weird in option we saw
basically flat map on the outside flat
map in the middle and then map on the
inside and here we don't see any map at
all we just see two flat maps so this is
a little bit different and it's it's a
consequence of my having introduced
compute as returning a valued validation
of something and int rather than just a
straight int so we'll see how how to
make this consistent with that pattern
again in in just a moment
alright so our final example of the day
now we're going to look at it starting
in Java first again is this idea of
non-determinism and this is a little bit
weird to think about but look think
about a list as representing not a
sequence of values but rather a choice
of values so let's say you know if our
food gate bars returns a list of bars
that it's actually returning a set of
choices of you know bars that we could
potentially choose from so it's is you
know some sort of a non-deterministic
choice similar with bar dot get Baz's
and Baz compute all and the way this
ends up looking is going to be something
that's again probably very familiar to
to a Java developer that's ever written
nested loops is you know you loop for
all the all the food possibilities out
of foods and then all the bar
possibilities out of get bars and so on
and and the thing that's a little bit
curious here is at the top of the
function we've we've instantiate 'add a
an empty ArrayList to contain our result
set and as we go through our set of
nested loops what we do is add all of
our bad stuff compute all's to that set
of aggregated results and then finally
return at the end so if you just ignore
the fact that we're dealing with a
mutable array list here which in
functional programming is somewhat taboo
it's it's really not too bad and in
Scala it's even somewhat somewhat
simpler because that that set of nested
for-loops turns into one for
comprehension we call it and so it looks
pretty flat here the way that we're
seeing we take a flew out of her out of
our set of Fu's we take a bar out of
set of bars and Abbas out of our set of
douses and our results is is yielded by
Bowser compute all and then what we do
is for all of that we just yield our big
fat set results okay so that's kind of
cool this is very readable it's even
simpler than the Java example which
wasn't too bad to begin with so now the
question of course is well what does
this have to do with monads we don't see
any map or flat map in here and I didn't
say okay well you know we're going to
solve a problem with the list monad but
surprise the for comprehensions are
actually a monadic construct so I'm
going to show you what that means here
and I just define what these four
comprehensions are somewhat formally so
let's say I've got some pattern for and
then in brackets we've got it we've got
a pattern that's being matched or a
variable that's being bound if you want
to think about it that way coming from
some expression some initial expression
so you know four-bar comes from food get
bars for example then we're going to
yield ISA you know some new expression
pertaining probably to to the pattern
what that actually translates to onto
the covers this is really just syntactic
sugar for our our Calton map so the
Assumption here is that this value is 0
or that you know this expression e 0 is
of some type that has a method map on it
the anonymous function that's passed to
it is a function that takes this P this
p0 this variable that's bound and yields
our expression e so that's kind of
interesting and then similarly if we
have a for comprehension that's a that's
a whole list of generators pattern 0
coming from expression 0 pattern one
coming from expression 1 and so on the
way that we translate that is well let's
let's just break this down into
expression 0 dot flat map pass that a
closure or a nun on this anonymous
function taking our p0 and then define
the rest recursively in terms of a new
for comprehension on the rest of what
was there so you can see that that
pattern one yielding
you want and so on and the only thing
that we've broken out from that is
expression zero and pattern zero okay so
for comprehensions is the way that we've
defined monads based entirely on flat
map and map we can see the four
comprehensions operate on any kind of
monad so let's get back to this last
example that we were looking at where we
did a four comprehension over over a
bunch of lists let's now start thinking
about this as oh it's the list monad so
let's let's let's go through our
translation process based on our
formalization before let's say for food
comes from foods well what does that
turn into well there's a bunch of
generators here so there's going to turn
into a flat map so the foods that we're
given as is the function argument here
we're going to call flatten up on that
and pass that a closure that that takes
some foo and gives us another another
nested for comprehension here the way
that we're going to translate that is
well you know we're going to pick the
bar coming from food bars off and we're
going to turn that into another flat map
then we look at Bad's coming from bar
dot Baz's that's going to be another
flat map and then finally we've got a
for comprehension on the very very
inside that has only one generator so
that's going to turn into a map so
that's kind of cool when we can actually
simplify this a little bit because this
innermost map is actually just mapping
on the identity function so we can just
toss that out entirely so that's kind of
interesting we've we've we've seen
patterns like this now we've seen these
series of nested flat maps in maps so
what if we were to take what we've seen
here and sort of go in the opposite
direction taking our first two examples
that have these nested constructs and
turning them into four comprehensions
all right so our first example based on
the option monad we add a maybe foo and
we flat mapped on that we got maybe a
bar flat mapped on that and and then
finally we flat mapped on the Baz got
Baz def compute so let's let's sort of
fold this back up into a four
comprehension so starting from the
inside out let's say map all right so we
know that's going to be some for
comprehension with one generator this
flat map is going to now be a four
comprehension
with two generators and the outermost
flatmap is going to be another for
comprehension with three generators so
that was pretty cool well we'll see that
again in just a second so we went from
we went from this case where we've got
this whole nested series of if if Elsa's
returning null at each step which really
conflates the concerns of doing your
actual computation food I get baar dekho
Bezdek compute with the fact that we
have to deal with this possibility of
failure and we've really slimmed it down
into this this very this very fairly
fairly slick little little bit of code
where we say well let's get a foo let's
get a bar let's get a Baz and compute
that and the fact that we're coping with
this you know the fact that these are
optional that we could you know return
none instead of some end is is really
doing good good job of separating
concerns the option line out is
encapsulating that that coping mechanism
we can do the same thing with our
validation monad example we can take
these these flat maps and I also
promised that we were going to make this
more consistent with with the option
example that we'd seen previously
remember how I mentioned just a minute
ago that if we're mapping the identity
function we don't have to include that
in a map well let's just for the sake of
it throw it back in so now this looks
like the pattern that we're used to we
can say okay well this this map is a for
comprehension with one generator and and
so on until we get this series of
generators all in one for comprehension
and the fact that that food art bar and
food bars are giving us different error
cases they're giving us a get bar
exception and get baz exception the fact
that we have to convert those into
compute exceptions it doesn't take a
whole lot of typing here we just say
well you know we're going to lift that
into the particular monad type that we
care about here which is a validation of
compute exception and int and so you can
see this this looks very similar to what
we saw before so I'm going to close out
here with a bit of a roundup and
summarize by saying basically that a
monad is a pattern that captures
policies for function application and
composition meaning the policy in the
case of option was to propagate failure
the policy in the case of the list monad
was to basically do the equivalent of
nested for-loops
do the the Cartesian product of all of
the lists combined so that's the policy
and we and we basically hide that or
wrap that up in inside our map and
flatmap and then as sort of syntactic
sugar that helps us make this make this
look really pretty for comprehensions
provide the sequential looking syntax
and it's all done on top of map and
flatmap so we're going to we're going to
see this this pattern fairly frequently
some monad making something explicit in
the type system while hiding something
else so in our in the option case we're
making the possibility of failure or the
possibility of missing data explicit by
saying oh we have an option of int while
hiding all the boilerplate if non null
logic that's very convenient
similarly with validation from from
Scala Zed we make the possibility of
errors explicit and there is of course
have some type and some value but we
hide the boilerplate try-catch logic we
also saw the list monad which makes this
possibility of non-determinism
or the possibility of having to deal
with a bunch of different combinations
explicit in the type system and we hide
all this boilerplate of nested for-loops
but there's other monads that we haven't
gotten a chance to look at here and i'd
encourage everybody to play around with
these as sort of an exercise for the
reader there's some really great kind of
wacky monads out there that end up
helping helping encapsulate other
concerns so the state monad and and sort
of an extension a logical extension on
that the undo monad make the presence of
mutable state in an algorithm the idea
that for for each sequential function
call you might actually get a different
result given the same arguments just
because there's some there's some state
that's being modified in the background
it's making that possibility explicit in
the type system again by saying Oh
we've got a state of something or an
undo of something while hiding the fact
that we have to propagate those state
changes through our algorithm
recursively or whatever there's another
monad called promise which is really
cool it's it's similar in a sense to the
option monad and even simpler in a sense
because well I'll just say what it is
here it's similar similar to the idea of
promises from Java util concurrent or
what-have-you the idea that we're doing
some asynchronous computation and we get
a promise of some future result we don't
know when it when we're going to get it
but let's you know assuming that we do
get it at some point we're going to
sequence those computations let me you
know let's say we have a bunch of these
monadic asynchronous computations and we
want to make that possibility or that
make make the fact that they are
asynchronous explicit in the type system
but not have to worry about all of the
threading logic all of the joining on a
thread to wait for its ability to wait
for its conclusion and so on the
transaction monad is another interesting
one there's a number of different
implementations of it that you can find
across the web
it makes the notion that a computation
could possibly be rolled back after
after being being completed so some some
state that was mutated could be undone
in a transaction it makes that explicit
in the type system again while hiding
the fact that we actually do have to do
these roll backs at some point or
another and the list the list just goes
on from there so hopefully you've seen
that that using monads at least in our
simple examples here a really nice way
to clean up your code to hide the fact
that you have to do some some repetitive
logic that doesn't have all that much to
do with the actual computation you're
trying to you're trying to effect you
really want to kind of want to sweep
that under the rug in some sense make it
explicit just in one place without
having to repeat yourself in that one
place of course is in the type signature
so the option of int for example and
leave all the rest out and you know like
I say here I want to encourage everybody
to use monads wherever you can to to try
to keep those concerns separate to try
to avoid that conflation of concerns and
your coat clean so thanks again for
listening and I hope you enjoy classes
