we would just like anything else get a
new class let me change this time so we
would create a new class all right then
we would call the new class yum yum bath
for example to keep it short run by
application
yeah finish so this is now going to be
our application object and what we are
going to do is we are going to extend
application that's it you don't actually
need to implement anything if you don't
want to
what I typically do always that's just
me i do my static final static final
string tag number right and i'm kind of
curious what's available in the number
in the application object itself so we
could is you could go look the
documentation or you can just go source
override implement methods and now this
shows you okay you can do these four
things you can do on configuration
changed remember like if the screen was
rotated or something like that on create
that sounds pretty standard on low
memory and on terminate okay now i'm
gonna only do on create that's sort of
like our any place where we can in net
something so if you're going to create a
new and a twitter object this may be a
good place to do that right on terminate
actually keep in mind it doesn't get
called it only gets called on the
emulator for some reason it doesn't it's
documented it doesn't get cold on any
other real device so not culturally the
purpose artists on create
so we could do something here we could
do something like to find the Twitter
I'll copy paste color to get another
places that I could be fair serious
you
cool
so we just move the Twitter
initialization and all that stuff into
one centralized place called application
or yamba
good yeah well it's available in
application applications available to
everyone so that's five works now what
do we do when we define a main building
block what's the next step oh it they
have access to it while I get
application yeah but that manifest so
let's take a look at the manifest file
hey I guess we're getting this three
days later well yeah it's a lot of
repetition but that's a good thing right
that petition gets it I'm going to get
it so um so how do you define the
application i mean if i go here and I
say control space there isn't another
application yeah we already have an
application yeah so it's actually you
ready have the application object
application object is the container for
all the other main building blocks so in
itself is technically not a building
block right so I can do here I can go to
control in space and then entered name
and then i would say dot Yamba
so although we didn't do this before we
always had an application it just is the
default application object like the
system application object now we have
our own
so that's that's that object now if I
wanted to in the Refresh service not use
Twitter here I can delete it I can also
delete it from here I can delete all the
references to Twitter except when we
need it
just one second so what we need to do
here is we need to say yamba app get
application Twitter should you make a
gather for Twitter um it's a good
question it's a good question um in
Android we break a lot of things that
you should do right so yes you should
use getters and setters no nobody else
almost nobody uses them in android right
there and it's this whole argument it
like jello is all about being a nice
object-oriented language with in caps
proper encapsulation and everything's
private and use gather some Suthers
together data a lot a lot i saw night
android kind of breaks that role and
secondly we use integers as pointers to
a lot of things right like technically
you know in java this is very unlike
java to be able to date to say was my to
be able to say in item get ID and then
to go into and figure out which item was
clicked but you wouldn't be doing that
you would be doing something like
instance soft operator or something like
that right or dot equals or something
like that right so you would be
comparing it differently you would be
working with the objects here we are
working with integers so the argument is
that it's faster and that's just yeah so
that's that's guy and you know I stick
stick with it but sure you could if
you're not too lazy to type all that you
could do this by create you can do this
like check there actually I don't think
you have to do anything let's see I can
just do this source generate getters and
setters to order
public and there's Miguel Tejada right I
probably don't want to set it so in
other words if you place it to type you
can use Eclipse to type it for you so
those does my southern my gather and
then in that case I could make this
prior to it that's not that's I guess a
more proper Java way it's not something
that you commonly see in Android down
this way right so then this guy as a
postive accessing to them directly would
say get twitter so like I said it's me
the camera there it really depends on
non-stop what makes me feel differently
now what pic the application object is
available in the government would you
mean well yeah but still it's a separate
object it's tells a bit obvious so every
every container a component we'd have to
access that's art object and say I want
I want to get to one of your variables
on your fields
DD you you get every object gets a
reference to application but the data
within the application is still cooking
prior to that application out great this
Christopher me describe it is beautiful
no no I'm going to define in the private
yeah only in this class tonight yeah
it's not protected us without word prior
to is the clasp visibility's packages
abilities everyone in the package would
save so this should work like that right
so you know so if it does great and you
guys can then optimize for the other
ones
so I could go here and now say manual
refresh
I wish would be seeing some of our data
okay there oh cool so that's it so now
we have a jamba object what we'll do
next is we're going to optimize also our
updated service in status activity to
use the end of it right not we want to
have their own version software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
