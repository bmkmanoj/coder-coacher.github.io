and thanks very much for coming along to
listen my name is mark pritchard I'm
from cloud bees I want to apologize in
advance i'm sure many of you all I hope
many of you had a better weekend than i
did i'm fred i dislocated my shoulder
and i'm very right-handed so this is
intended to have plenty of demos and
stuff so if the demos are a little bit
jerky then you know you'll you'll bear
with me i'm sure so i was going to make
some jokes about architecture but i'll
just leave it at that so here's his
myself Who I am what I did as you can
see from those sort of middle ones there
the ba systems in oracle space i spent a
lot of my career in what I call the sort
of enterprise Java mainstream app
servers have been very good to me I did
a lot of work on tuxedo way back before
this most recently over the last decade
or so I spent a lot of time on the
weblogic product as well so that's my
background what I do now is very
different and to me very exciting I work
at cloudbees now plow bees is a platform
as a service provider and that's really
what i'm going to talk about here but
the particular angle that i wanted to
sort of just explore for this sort of
late afternoon session was just to look
at it from the point of view of people
like myself and I just hope that you
know there are people here in the room
who share this perspective yeah you
understand a lot of the strengths and
the advantages of the sort of enterprise
Java development style the good things
about that technology but as we all know
I mean things have moved on there are
very good reasons for that but how can
we kind of keep what was good and yet
get a lot of the good things that are in
the new world and I believe that there
is a way of combining these things I
think there's a lot of really
interesting things that are happening
that do a line where
altogether I'm going to show you some of
the projects that I build i'll give you
you know the references to my repos and
the projects and so on so you can have a
look at that and try them out and a lot
of this stuff that i'm going to mention
i blogged about on the cloud bees blog
and my own blog so you know you can i'll
give you those references at the end as
we go through so i don't want to you
know be controversial I'm not trying to
sort of talk about enterprise Java as if
it were dead but you know from my
perspective I'm looking backwards now
and I'm saying okay what were the things
that we liked well we liked definitely I
think that there was a standard way to
build applications that you didn't have
to reinvent the wheel there was lots and
lots of stuff he knew how to do it if
you wanted an example you could find one
they will get you toria lots of stuff
like that all the sort of you no lies
vogel materials and everything else
young so there were that was a good
thing if you're trying to put together a
team to do large projects it's very
helpful you don't want everybody rushing
off and trying to do everything in
different ways because as you know it's
just not going to work and obviously we
like that sort of massive ecosystem of
well proven tools there are a lot of
libraries just about anything if you
want some kind of Java library java
project open source project to do things
you can go and find one you can assess
whether it's going to fit your needs you
can probably find a choice and you can
pick up what you need and you can use it
so that was that was all good and the
other thing which you know obviously
we're particularly interested in here is
you know the rich set of api's and
containers that were there but
simplified you know things like
messaging transaction handling
connection pooling okay you can say in
some cases these were fairly verbose but
they were very comprehensive and they
were pretty simple models to follow so I
think those i would suggest those work
those were good things those are you
know things that we want to aspire to
and the other good thing i think from
the app server error if i can use those
terms
though I mean of course many people you
know are still being very successful and
using those technologies but was all the
tooling and the infrastructure that was
put there to simplify deployment
configuration resource management you
want to as I say configure up connection
pools database connections and so on and
monitor those things well that was kind
of all part of the package okay so those
were those are the things we liked and
you know it worked you know I am sure
I've worked on many many very large
projects built using enterprise Java and
they worked very successfully so we I
like that so what are we not like well
you know you can add your own to the
list these are the things that I found
started to grate on me over time yeah
the stack was often too heavy for a lot
of the applications I needed you know
there are very few applications that
needed you know even half of all the
kind of enterprise Java containers or
you know the api's that are there in
Java Rex and so on you just didn't need
that much under the result the stack
became too large it was slow to start up
weblogic particularly suffered from this
and what that meant was that it made it
you know much harder than it should have
been to do sort of iterative development
and you had this whole you know sort of
symbiotic business all around people
doing you know trying to avoid redeploys
all the you know the zero turn around
folks you know that's all good stuff but
really it's all just trying to solve a
problem that shouldn't have been there
in the first place which is that it just
took too long to redeploy these things
and to bring the servers up and I think
as a result you saw that sort of pace of
innovation slowed it did become
increasingly hard to sort of mention
mix-and-match application services so
one of the things that you know I like
very much about say the no Jas world is
the ability just to pull in any kind of
package you go out there you find a
package on github you check it out you
see who's supporting it who's doing
things with it you can pull that into
your application you use
you sort of see nowadays you see this
you know a lot of new software as a
service providers out there you want to
bring those into your application
infrastructure as well with sort of java
ee it was kind of well you use use
everything that we have but you know
extending it became a little bit
difficult and i think one of the things
that increasingly use of great on you is
kind of sizing scaling and performance
just became yeah a black art it was like
lots of people made a very good living
out of you know being able to analyze
the performance of app servers and
applications running on them but the
truth was there was an awful lot of
stuff there that was quite a quite hard
to do so that would be my quick summary
of sort of if you like what was good and
what went wrong and so when we think
about the new world now where we have
these you know elastic on demand
resources i'm going to talk obviously a
lot about the cloud and the applications
that we can now build and deploy in the
cloud i thought well let's just put on
one slide the sort of things that I'd
like to you don't have a side like to
have my cake and eat it what are the
sort of applications that i find myself
wanting to build what are the services i
want from you know whatever my
infrastructure is and and what is
infrastructure is an interesting
question nowadays but well what I want
is in most cases for my applications I'm
happy to run pretty lightweight stacks
with you know a variety of web
frameworks there are a lot of ones out
there different people will have
different preferences I tent a lot of
the apps i'm going to be showing you i'm
just running using something like tom
cat and then i have frameworks that run
on top of that what i would like to do
is I'd like to have a choice I can
either have what i call a fully curated
service so i would like somebody to make
sure that I've got all the latest bits
whenever I run my app I've got the
latest version I got all the latest
package
is I've got security fixes applied you
know on time so that's what i call fully
curated that's something I'd like
because I don't want to worry about that
but on the other hand i'd like to feel
that I have the option to have what i
call a runtime manage stack which is
where somebody will sort of take care of
it monitoring my application restart it
let me know if there's a problem
anything like that but i would like to
have the ability to at least control all
the bits that go into that stack you
know so in this case i might say well no
I don't want you to give me the whole
stack I'm going to specify exactly which
version i pick up maybe there's been a
latest bug fix that came out and it
turns out it's not such a good thing
we've all had those situations you apply
the fix it creates more problems than it
solves I'd like to at least be able to
say this is the exact sort of micro
version of the stack that I want to run
because that's what i need and i know
that works for my application in many
cases the sort of applications i like to
build and the things i show you you'll
see that i'm very interested in kind of
mobile application development i do a
lot in that space and i'm very
interested in applications that are
going to provide rest services i'm going
to be using a lot of jason to serve up
data in that way i'm also interested in
consuming services from you no
third-party SAS providers running all
the way from say you know google
geocoding API through the smaller more
specialized SAS providers that do
particular things that I want and again
typically those are going to be served
up to a rest and JSON format so that's
the kind of thing that I want to be able
to do very effectively and quickly in
terms of the elasticity well I want to
get away from the sort of the Black Arts
I just want to be able to deploy things
as I need them you know if I have I know
that I'm going to have a certain amount
of capacity for a given server and I
want to be able to start up extra
instances of the server as I need
I want to be able to do that very fast I
want to be able to give the server's
back when I don't need them and then I
want the kind of routing services in
front of that that are going to do my
reverse proxies and load balancing and
so on and then if I want when I say
application services here I'm thinking
back to you know things like message
queuing notifications storage those kind
of services sort of lower level
programming constructs then I'd like the
fact that I have a choice I'd like a set
of consistent api's that are easy for me
to use as a Java programmer and as you
gather from the tour come and I'm going
to be talking a lot about the AWS api's
that's what I you know tend to go to
first but on the other hand there may be
SAS services that give me alternatives
to that that I'm interested in so for
example you know I was working on a
plug-in for our Jenkins product the
other day for work with mobile emulators
and what I wanted to do was to upload an
android APK so that I could you know a
SAS service that was running an amnio
emulator in the cloud could show me how
it was working and so on I didn't want
to write locally I want to do all that
in the cloud so I just wanted a simple
service where i could dump that APK file
and the emulator could run so there's
lots of ways I could do that you know I
use something like file picker but
there's there's any number of services
there and you just pick what's suitable
for you so it could be you know a
low-level API they reduced you want
something like an s3 bucket or maybe
there's some other service that does
what you want in a slightly different
and you know more attractive way so i
think that the nice thing about the new
world is but you can make your choice
here and you can mix and match that was
what i was trying to get to on the
earlier slide now you know obviously I
want the sort of management the
monitoring capabilities I kind of want
all that built in and I'd like that done
for me yeah I don't really gone past the
phase of my life were actually enjoy
writing code that does anything like
that so if you do then that's great I
admire you but
downton I'd like that basically to come
as a checkbox item and then you know I
really a Java programmer so that's what
I like I wanted aggression with the Java
tooling that I use whether it's sort of
eclipse or IntelliJ and again I'm sort
of fairly non-religious about these
things I do use both though I'll
probably be showing you eclipse in this
case so that's the kind of world that's
the kind of stuff that I'm doing and
that I find quite flexible and enjoyable
using the sort of pairs model and that's
what I'm really going to be talking
about so if you think all that rubbish
then feel free to walk out and I won't
be offended because that's that's really
what i'm going to be talking about so
i'm going to sort of mix and match
between some sort of examples of
applications and also the telling you a
little bit more about plow bees and
platform as a service and what we do and
how we do it so just quick show of hands
who's familiar with any form of pairs
who's used a platform as a service
product Heroku cloud foundry Google App
Engine I see a few maybe a half hospet
more okay so very quickly for the rest
of you the thing about platform as a
service is that we cloudbees will run
your applications for you I mean the
with difference is the same is true of
all platform as a service vendors so
what happens is that you know instead of
installing infrastructure and then
deploying an app onto that basically you
just deploy the application to the
platform so you take your built
artifacts whether that's a web app or
whatever it is and you push that up
through a variety of tools command line
or ide integrations and that app will
automatically deployed in containers
that we run and manage for you we do
that ourselves running on top of
lower-level amazon cloud infrastructure
so these are running on amazon am eyes
and so on and the other part of what we
do and this is where a Clow be slightly
differs from most of the other sort of
mainstream
past providers is that we also provide
this full-blown build environment based
on Jenkins CI and again I have a quick
side introducing Jenkins I feel like
again most people in this audience
probably familiar with Jenkins
continuous integration server in the
java space i think it's pretty well
known and post KCAL Iguchi who founded
that whole community is one of my
colleagues at cloudbees and that really
is the core of what we do in the build
space so this is the sort of one market
textured slide I have if you look at
what we do is a platform we want our
cloud platform to take you all the way
through from the point where you write
the code you make a commit and you push
that up into the remote repository now
that could be a public repository like
github collabnet or what have you or it
could be a private repository that we
host in the cloud so you can do you can
do either route and either one will work
you can actually mix and match there too
and so on but for simplicity let's just
assume you're going to push this github
and you push that code to github you
have a build job which is configured
it's all running in the cloud so as soon
as that commits is pushed you're going
to have a web hook that kicks in that
starts a Jenkins continuous integration
build again if you're not familiar with
continuous integration the whole
philosophy here is that as far as
possible your software is always kept in
a sort of release ready state so it's
not like yeah everybody has at the code
and then to a certain point somebody has
the job of kind of integrating it making
sure it all works and that your code
doesn't break mine by doing a continuous
build test automated cycle we make sure
that if I do anything at any point that
causes a problem with the build we will
know immediately the code gets backed
out and I get notified and I have to fix
the problem or we have to get together
and fix the problem but you don't have
to go back after
you know tip a hundred different commits
and try and work out what the problem
was and who broke it so that build all
happens all this is done using sort of
on-demand resources allocated in the
cloud that's what we mean by the Jenkins
executives and this is where you start
to see the sort of attraction of using
the cloud in this way because although
you can run Jenkins on-premise we have a
lot of you know customers that do that
as well but the reality is if you've got
lots of different people if we were all
working on a project and we're all doing
our stuff and pushing in bits to our our
parts of the project particularly if
you're getting close to say a release
milestone cycle when you've got a lot of
activity going on you could have a lot
of these continuous integration builds
all having to run so what happens here
is that we can simply spin up new
executives because these are just amazon
ami is these are just virtual compute
environments and we spin them up run the
bill get rid of them so the elasticity
is very valuable for that and then what
we do is take the builder artifacts and
then we can deploy them we can deploy
them into private environments or into
public environments you could have you
know devs staging test environments and
so on but in its simplest form we deploy
those into runtime application
containers whichever container is
suitable for the application that you're
actually running and then we provide all
the necessary sort of application
infrastructure like you know session
routing SSL routers session clustering
all that kind of stuff and we also
provide a set of partner services for
things like the ALM the application
monitoring people like New Relic
appdynamics and so on paper trail log
file management and so on all those kind
of services are all there and you
basically just associate them with your
application and say I want that service
for that happen at all it'll all be done
for you so that's pretty much our model
and you have two different ways of doing
this so really a relevant only to
you pay for it so you can do it either
using dedicated cloud resources and this
is if you're deploying sort of
production quality applications you have
a certain level of performance that you
need you can say okay I want this app
always to run on you know certain amazon
setups and you can size them
appropriately and nothing else will ever
run on those environments or we can
actually run them in a shared pool we
call this multi-talented and the whole
point about this of course is it's a
very efficient use of resources we can
do this very cheaply this is what
enables us to offer a free and complete
service for developers so you could sign
up now for cloudbees you don't have to
pay anything you have to enter a credit
card or anything you can try all this
out you can i'll show you how to do that
later on it's very straightforward but
you could set up a complete build
integration cycle you could deploy your
apps and the reason we can do all that
is because we can do all this
efficiently in a sort of multi-talented
mode so this is Jenkins I think probably
most you familiar i'm not going to dwell
on this the key thing about Jenkins
really is the strength of the community
there so I mean there are I think well
over you had three or four new plugins
coming out every every week now this has
been running from well over seven years
it's extremely widely adopted this is
the you know the number one open source
CI server and just looking at all the
messages about new plugins that I get
every day I can tell you that I mean I
think this number is now more like 650
so the real value of that is not sort of
just chest beating the fact is that a if
you've got any kind of Java related
build or test automation tool there's
probably already at Jenkins plug-in for
it if there isn't it's pretty easy to
write one and there's probably somebody
already working on it right now so
that's the beauty of this is that it's
very open and extensible so if you need
things and you don't currently have them
it's easy to get them
and there's a community that will jump
into support here and help you so just a
little bit of terminology I always find
this helpful just have my head there's a
lot of as a service okay I've talked
about platform as a service I hope I've
given you a picture of what we do just
to differentiate this from other things
that are delivered as a service so
infrastructure as a service is classic
amazon web services okay you're talking
about I want a server instance I want a
block of storage you know I want an SSL
router or something like that that is
infrastructure as a service and that's
just like getting physical
infrastructure in the old days but this
is all delivered in the cloud you don't
ever see a server with the lights
flashing and all that kind of stuff but
it's still the same thing you're still
essentially getting a server and you are
managing at least some aspects of that
server you don't have to manage the
physical stuff you don't have to manage
the power you don't have to manage the
low-level network connectivity but you
still have to manage that you know the
upper stack network configuration you're
going to have to manage you know
applications that you want to run on
that you're going to have to be
responsible for deploying them and
monitoring them and so on and then going
right to the other extreme
software-as-a-service salesforce com is
the sort of canonical example we all
know but there are now a whole variety
of you know different players in this
space who offer extremely useful
software as a service and the key thing
here is that these are packaged
applications so there are services you
consume you may be able to customize
them you may be able to extend them you
can certainly use them in your
applications but yeah if you are writing
your own applications that are doing the
things that you need to do typically you
need to be looking at platform as a
service and what we're really thinking
about here is how do I take advantage of
platform as a service and consume these
other things judiciously
in a way that's going to enhance my
productivity sometimes I need sort of a
little bit more low-level control I need
access to sort of more powerful
low-level api's but I don't to spend my
whole time coding to those or that's
inefficient at the same time I want to
take advantage of software as a service
but you know I don't want to be straight
jacketed by that into only the things
that the software as a service providers
will support and do well I said I'll
show you how to get going with cloudbees
the easiest way just go to clubs calm
and sign up I'd love you to do it do it
anytime but when you go in there you'll
see a toolbar and up on the top left
there'll be a thing that says click
starts and what our click starts well
there's something we put together as a
way to create that whole picture I
showed you the sort of life cycle of a
cloudbees project where you have the
source code repository you have the
continuous integration build job you
have the deployment of what the runtime
and all the resources all of that is a
complete cloud project you can do it all
in the cloud and what these are of what
I call projects in a box and that's very
nice because it means it's pretty simple
to set them up but it's much nicer to do
it with just one click and give it a
name but the other thing that sort of
almost it was up I wouldn't say it's
unintended but it came as a nice side
effect was that it's also a great way
for you to start playing with a new
technology if you're not familiar with
it I'm sure you've had this experience I
have you you know you think you read
about something you want to do it you
download something you try to run it
bang you're immediately googling for all
kinds of errors and you don't know how
to work and you know what you want to do
is to get at something running so you
can play with it and work out whether
it's actually going to be useful for you
or not well what's great here is these
all work we've set them all up we yeah
they'll they'll deploy all the bits that
are needed they're all configured to
work in the right way you can run them
up you can use them as a starting point
for your own invest
asian you can just use it as a teaching
aid or whatever so for example you want
to run up play framework click on that
run it and you'll end up with a complete
project deployed and you'll have the
full source code and everything now
there are loads of these coming all the
time the other nice thing here is that
the community have got very engaged with
this project so if you go on to github
look for the cloudbees community you'll
see a lot of us but you'll also see a
lot of people who are involved in those
different technologies and frameworks
who are contributing these click starts
in there and you'll see a whole lot of
new flick starts that are coming up all
the time so even if they're not in our
panel they'll probably be in the
community here they're great for demos
i'm going to show you one in a minute
but they're also useful for sharing
things in teams and i think this is
another aspect of my career that I found
the cloud has sort of provided these
interesting echoes because as you saw
earlier I spend a lot of time in sort of
systems integrators putting together
these big you know projects and I mean
okay they were of their time and the
technologies they use they look a bit
old now and so on but the challenges
were still there it's like you know you
yo the architects for a project get
together and decide the tools and
technologies you're using new people
come onto the project not everyone's got
the same background and skills but you
want everyone to work in a consistent
way this is where click starts can be
really valuable because the cliq starts
I said they're not demos in in the sense
that you can customize them you can
create your click start based on a
project so you could have a team of
people prototyping an application put
all that together pull it into a click
start and then everyone who joins a team
first thing they do is they run the
click start they've got a working
example of that application with all the
build and the automated tests all set up
for them so that you can just get going
and you can start doing it right from
the beginning so there's a lot of value
there and particularly for when you want
to
full hand off a project to a customer to
get feedback if you're an implementation
partner or something like that it's
extremely valuable you just give a link
to the click start click it all runs in
the clouds you don't have to worry about
whether they've got you know their
database setup on their site and you
know they can just run exactly what you
give them and they can then give you
feedback and you can have that much more
iterative way of working so my shoulder
does actually hurt quite a lot and
because I'm not going to be able to
click very well I hope you're going to
forgive me i am going to run a short
demonstration and i'm going to do it for
a video sorry let me there we go so i
did i recorded this myself just before
the weekend actually I didn't know I was
going to smash into Page Mill Road but I
thought it was worth doing so here's the
Eclipse environment and I loaded up the
cloudbees plugin and that's the initial
bit I was just setting that up I was
configuring my username and password
credentials so I chose to run a click
start and a chair I want to run a tomcat
based application so it's just cut off
the left or products blame what's going
on but it's part of that it's set up my
project with my source code here's the
git repository it created a local git
repository with a remote repo on
cloudbees that's all part of the build
there's an application with a database
also deployed on cloudbees and there's
actually a local eclipse data connection
there so I can run the application
either locally or I can run it in the
cloud so the other thing that we set up
is the bill job so there's a Jenkins
build job that set up ready to run it's
going to be triggered whenever I push a
change to that remote git repository so
what i'm doing here is I've just gone
into the application and I've just made
a tiny change to the index JSP I just
want to change that I can commit that's
going to trigger some activity so I've
committed that and I'm actually pushing
it to both the local reports
tree and to the upstream repository in
the cloud so once i do that the web hook
is automatically going to trigger the
continuous integration build you can see
there's a new job there cued up and
that's now running and if i click on
that we can see the jenkins build and i
can see it in the console output window
this actually took about a minute to run
it's a maven classic maven build I did
speed this up a little bit so in the
interest of disclosure I clipped a bit
out there and you can see the actual
change so everything can be traced back
to the change that I made and then if I
go into the browser the new version of
the application is automatically
deployed and I can see my change
reflected so what you saw there in in
less than two minutes was I created a
complete project with the source code
the repository the continuous
integration build job a database and
then I went in I made a revision to the
code push the change and it redeployed
that's pretty quick so just graphically
just let's just recap on exactly what
happened there because there was a lot
of stuff happened in that video so I
picked the framework I wanted to try it
out that is the complete project cycle
that got created there for me a new
repository a build job the application
and the database in that case I didn't
particularly bind any partner services
but I could have done that and once
that's done that's all there that's
still there sitting in my Eclipse
workspace okay it's not it's not just a
one-off operation I've now got that
project I can go in and extend it I can
customize it i can add things to it i
can go in and add maven dependency start
coding stuff so i've got it it's always
there for me as a resource and then I've
got the ability to view it and manage it
through either command line tools so if
you need to script stuff you've got the
command line SDK I can look at it
through the Eclipse environment I can go
in through Jenkins if you're used to
Jenkins and I can use all all the
Jenkins you know interface that you're
going to be very familiar with but that
if that work that's very good and it's
impressive but if it will kind of opaque
and you couldn't do that yourself and
you couldn't customize it it wouldn't
really be very useful because you'd be
limited just to the cliq starts that we
have thought of but it's a very easy
thing to put together because all that
click start really is is a JSON file
which is describing the steps that are
needed to set up that project so that if
i can just decipher this one for you
what it's really saying is okay take
this project there in the cloud based
community github site is the source git
repo so you're going to be picking up
the source code from there we're going
to clone that repo and we're also going
to pre deploy the application again this
is just a sort of nice tweak that we I
didn't want to wait for the Jenkins
build job to run the first time so I pre
deploy a version of the application and
then when the bill job runs it just over
writes it so that's what the app package
is but that can also be useful for
example if you have applications if you
have a click start that sets up an
application where the user has to do
something to actually go ahead to the
next step then what we do is is
typically to use that out package to run
up a web application that will deploy
all the instructions about what you need
them to do for setup okay so you can
cope with things where you have some
manual setup and then i have the runtime
so we have what we call this the cliq
stack so that this is where i can choose
between a sort of a fully curated stack
or a managed stack and i specify that
here and then here's the database and
here's information about the jane
build it's a fairly simple one the file
can get a bit longer but not very much
and typically all I have to do is to say
here's what I want to call my
application at the end of that I've got
that complete project with all those
bits all working and then I can go in
and I can have at it and play with it
and you know see if I can extend it see
if that's the right model for me and so
on and the way you call it so again you
can just write your own and if you if
you go into cloudbees community go to
the git repos have a look at them you'll
see all the different stacks that people
like the Play Framework guys and
Schuyler community and so on contributed
in here got good stuff there from meteor
and all kinds of other frameworks and
all I'm really doing is in that repo is
that click start JSON file I mean along
with all the other source code and
everything and I just give that location
you see raw github com cloudbees
community blah blah blah click start
Jason and I just passed that to the
cloud bees grand central is just like or
you know that's our main application if
you like for the cloudbees pass I just
passed that in and that runs my click
start and if you wanted to edit that
change that build your own click start
all you do is drop in your your cliq
star Jason path there boom and off you
go you have your own click start so
that's what we do and what I thought I
want just to look at is to bring it back
to this discussion of you know why this
is a very attractive model if you're
trying to run into price jar for
applications so if you look at you know
running a java wrap a straight java wrap
well yeah you can do that on cloudbees
and you know there are plenty of good
reasons why you might want to do that I
think that's not what most of our
customers do but what's really happening
is you take your java apps you write
your code your java main and it does
whatever you need it to do and what we
do we will provide
the jvm will provide obviously all the
things that come with a JVM and will
provide all that underlying
infrastructure that virtualizes that and
runs it in the cloud and so on so we we
do all that for you you just push up the
jar deploy it and it runs if you're
running let's say an EWEB profile app as
you've got a JBoss or a glassfish web
profile out again what we do for you is
we run all the stuff below the
deployment artifact so in this case it's
going to be a war file and then what we
provide is the infrastructure to
virtualize and run it and manage it and
we also provide the stack which in this
case is going to be not just a JVM but
all the container jars and so on but
make up that runtime stack and this is
where it can be very useful but you have
that level of control over what's
actually in the stack in most cases you
won't care you'll just say i want my app
to run on jboss EE 6 web profile that's
the stack I want but you might actually
care you might say I want exactly this
revision of that I want to take this
particular version of the jars that
stack is all visible it's all open to
you you can just it's going to be you'll
see it on github in the community you
can just fork that repository you can
swap in a particular jar pack pack that
up and deploy that as your own stack
it's not something most people do but
it's important that you're able to do it
if you need to and as I mentioned
earlier we have different categories of
stacks so if you think of things like
you know Tom care the jboss the the Java
main all those kind of things these are
very these are very well-known stacks we
have a lot of expertise in these areas
we will provide that full curated
service we will do all the all the hour
dates the security fixes everything for
you there are other things in the other
extreme where you have things that are
actually delivered by the community
these things are moving fast you know
people are there are changes coming in
every day there are poor requests coming
in on these stacks the community will
maintain and update them they're the
right people to actually provide that
level of support what we do is to
provide the runtime support for the
containers we will monitor them and
manage them and so forth just wanted to
throw this one up just to say all I'm
focusing very much on Java this is not
all about Java this mechanism is totally
general so for example we have stacks
there are click starts in that list
you'll find that run things like
WordPress and Drupal and so on well
that's nothing to do with Java what that
is is all about PHP but again the
mechanism for building up the stack and
for how we manage and deliver that to
you is exactly the same and once again
you can customize it in the ways that
you need so I'm going to skip these food
quickly because we will be coming to the
end of a day and i do want to let you go
on time the slides are all going to be
available what I just wanted to say is
that has as a concept brings a lot of
value to really all the different
stakeholders in a project okay so I'm
not going to run through all of these
now because time is going to be against
me I've got some examples here which
I'll leave for you to look at if you're
interested and please do get in touch
with me if you'd like to know more about
some of our customers and how they're
using platform as a service to to
actually get some of these benefits and
there's rupa da oh I'm skipping through
tues digital it's not on bullhorn doing
some very interesting stuff I'm sorry if
there any of the customers in the
audience I really haven't got the time
to talk about all of those now but
you'll find details on our website
because I wanted just to finish up in
this last five minutes by talking about
some of the kind of projects that I've
been building that I enjoy sort of
playing with and why I think it's a
great example of how this combination of
the sort of the lightweight cloud
oriented Jarvis stack with mobile with
amazon web service interfaces and
software-as-a-service is actually a
really nice environment to develop with
and I mean here are examples if you go
on our site you'll find a lot of blogs
that I've done all about how to you know
do continuous integration for mobile
applications so I've got a lot of
examples all around different chess
games so if you love chess you'll really
like these but if you're just interested
in mobile development you'll find them
interesting too we've got click starts
for example this is my colleague put
together for a sort of people who want
to start into iOS development again most
mobile applications actually have some
sort of back-end component okay there
are some that are purely sort of on the
phone but most actually have to interact
with some sort of service or data at the
back end and actually how you do that is
something that there's quite an art to
doing that and the the interaction of
the mobile device and the api's that are
available and the backend services
deployed in the cloud is a very neat
combination and it enables you to solve
a number of problems very nicely and one
of the ones that i thought i would show
you is if i can just come out of my
presentation for a second and if you
want to see this i'll just go into my
eclipse for a minute i'm sorry if this
is a little bit small but i'll do my
best here with my fully armed i have a
number of projects here and if you just
go on our site and you search for the
token vending machine i don't know if
any of you are familiar with this this
is a concept Hamptons and introduced a
year or so ago and they've recently
extended it there's some quite
interesting stuff about
the use of the Amazon secure token
service and identity federation which I
didn't recommend you to check out but
the nice thing about this is just think
about the problem suppose you have a
mobile app and you want to use services
like queuing like notification and so on
now if you want to do that on a mobile
scale you could be talking about
millions of users all over the globe
different points of presence all that
kind of thing how are you going to do
that well you need you know just having
having every mobile device having to go
back to a server even the whole network
of servers is not necessarily the most
efficient way of doing it so you need
some kind of global cloud friendly
infrastructure which is going to provide
those kinds of services well to me that
screams out for the kind of Amazon style
infrastructure so if I want a mobile app
that for any reason is going to allow a
user any arbitrary user to come in and
let's say post a message or something
like that some sort of a queueing or a
topic paradigm is very suitable but if I
want them to post to a topic let's say
that I own ultimately this is going to
go onto my amazon account I've got to
have some control over that I can't just
say have at it and you know you here's
my Amazon key you guys just get on with
it and do whatever you want I have to
have some restrictions around that well
as a technology called the secure token
service which lets you control that so
for example here's an application and
you'll see this so what I have on the
cloud B's platform I actually have an
application which is a simple web
application that's running but it uses
the Amazon Identity and Access
Management I am api's to issue temporary
time limited tokens that allow anyone
who accesses that service to get a
limited period token which lets them do
certain things and only certain things
on my account and for example I now have
a client application which I'm running
in an android emulator here on my local
machine and I can if I'm connected to
the network which i hope i am basically
I can use that token looks good so far
and I can actually go in and I can look
at the tokens now I'm sorry I'm not
connected so but what we'll what should
happen here and what I might just be
able to do but what it will let me do is
to go in and use those amazon api's
using that token for the access control
i can then go in and i can access the
services of my amazon account directly
from the mobile device and all that is
really very easy to develop in Java so
the service that did all that and you'll
find all this as a github repository
behind that click start that i put
together and you'll see the code in here
it's all based on amazon sample and it's
very simple classic java code this is
the attraction of java is a development
environment there are these very clear
very well documented well supported java
api's for all these services they're
really not hard to work with and if you
go in and take a look at them you'll see
you know exactly how to use them and the
only bit of this that is really in any
way complicated is the bit that hooks
this up with the secure token service
and again even that is very easy to work
with and if you just look at the sample
code you'll see how that works so this
is what i mean by this combination of
the ecosystem of java tooling all the
low-level infrastructure api's when you
need them restful services that let you
access saz api's when you want to use
those all pull together all delivered in
the cloud you
an elastic on demand model through pairs
I think this adds up to quite a nice
environment in which to develop and if
you throw in the convenience of things
like click starts and the sort of
tooling integration and so on then this
is why I think this is quite a nice way
to work so that that's me up to my 550 I
know I'm standing between you and the
beer so I don't want to go on any longer
I have some more slides a lot of them
are self-explanatory i'll be happy to
kind of leave them with you and thank
you very much if anyone has any
questions I'll be here and happy to
answer them but it was great to have you
here thanks very much
