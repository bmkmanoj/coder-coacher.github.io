started we are going to talk about
empathy today my name is dressy herpa
you can find me on Twitter at my first
name shout out to my parents for amazing
SEO I get my first name everywhere it's
bangin I'm mostly tweet jokes I work at
slac among the engineering team I'm a
backend engineer and I work on
integrations and the API we're going to
start with a brief history lesson this
is Margaret Hamilton she's a known
badass she was the lead engineer on the
Apollo 11 mission and she coined the
term software engineering and this is a
picture of her standing next to the
Apollo guidance computer source code
which most of it she oversaw and wrote
herself and she was 31 when Apollo 11
landed on the moon and it was running
her code and only landed successfully
because of her really robust system and
she worked on all the manned missions
and some of the unmanned missions and
she came up with the term software
engineering to give software a little
bit more weight at the time I was seen
as kind of like cool magical thing that
nobody knew how it really works and she
wanted to give it the proper heft that
she thought it was like deserved and at
this time software was built more for
like doing machine stuff like you I
think maybe you've seen pictures of like
walls of computers and you know wasn't
built for people was built for kundus
you heavy duty kind of machine stuff
so you know I think the case of software
being more for machines and people it's
kind of switched now we're doing we're
building more for people that we are for
machines so let's talk about empathy for
our customers for our non-technical
workmates and for ourselves well it's
time so this is not empathetic okay it's
not about hysterics or experiencing high
intensity emotions it's about
understanding and sharing in the
feelings of others so brené Brown is an
empathy and shame researcher and cheese
in Texas and she calls herself a
qualitative researcher which I really
like because it kind of shows that she's
talked about the whole story not just
specific data points and she defines
empathy is having four main components
it's being able to see the world as
other people see it it's being
non-judgmental it's being able to
understand somebody else's feelings and
then communicate your understanding of
their feelings back to them
overwhelmingly empathy is a skill and
it's really hard and we can't assume
that we're just going to be good at it
because we're good people it there's an
element of vulnerability and
overwhelmingly empathy is a choice we
could choose not to be empathetic
towards people so sympathy on the other
hand it's characterized by a sense of
distance and and pity and brené Brown
says that no aesthetic sentence ever
started with the words at least you know
if someone comes to you says I lost my
job and you say at least you know you
can get a new one like know something
like that sounds scary or that sounds
tough is a way more empathetic reaction
because you're you're feeling that with
them
so the key thing between empathy and
sympathy is the willingness to open
oneself up be vulnerable and we want to
kind of have some uncomfortable fields
and if we're able to be vulnerable and
open ourselves up we'll create
connection and connection is what gives
purpose of meaning to our lives and then
if we feel connected to somebody we can
collaborate with them and collaboration
is what distinguishes humans why we're
apex predators it's why we can live
outside the food chain and have best
friends at the thule read so now that we
have a bit of emphasis like background
on empathy let's apply it so i think i
mentioned that software used to be seen
as magical and to an extent it is
especially to people who don't know how
to build you know computer look we can
and we build things like apps and
storefronts and social networks and we
want people like so much that they give
us money and software as a service as a
thing in our industry and I think the
key word should be service right however
have you tried to use software you
didn't build it's really really really
hard and I feel this way and I'm not
what you would call a computer novice
but Google Hangouts gets me every time
and nobody here is born an expert and I
see if we forget our learning curve
flows are complex and our familiarity
with our particular software is born
because we spend 40 hours a week working
on this stuff what's interesting is in
case of a lot of disdain for users
because they lack that that you know
familiarity and that this game can
happen even when users come across like
weird flows in our products
and moreover we call them users that's
not very empathetic we should call our
customers customers Oh crazy because
they're literally giving us money for
what we're doing and we should call them
people or clients or guests just kind of
reframe you know I realign our thought
processes so we know who's calling the
shots you know words mean things also
art estate is really misplaced you know
software today is is really complex and
not a lot of the patterns are obvious
and it's getting more and more prevalent
as software is it more and more things
so during use abilities experiments
typically the researcher can't interfere
and that's because they want an unbiased
picture of how people are using our
software and I definitely watch people
use my software and it's been like don't
do that like ah like it's like a horror
movie like I don't go to that house like
I don't you know it's like really you
want to protect them somehow but empathy
can kind of combat that like empathy is
a competitive advantage and I think the
majority of us are probably familiar
with watching people use our stuff and
sometimes we can't ask people what they
want because
you know they become accustomed kind of
bad or imperfect flows and you know that
comes up still it's looking a real
example seamless is a food delivery
service that super popular on the East
Coast and they recently merged with
grubhub and they recently were like
released a new back-end and refreshed UI
and the reaction to these updates were
really really strong it was a total who
moved my cheese scenario and customers
had gotten used to like one flow and you
know even if it's more efficient they
already expended the mental energy to
like learn how to get food right and it
worked for them to suspect that so we
need to remember that familiarity is the
more powerful concepts than intuition
and we always want to make our software
more intuitive but that doesn't
necessarily serve the people who already
know how to use it today alright another
problem is that the group's building
software are not the group's they look
like the groups that are using the
software and this is a problem and it's
one of the reasons that software
development gets a bad rap let's look at
an example that this is apple's health
app and it came out in iowa state and it
didn't come with the ability to track a
menstrual cycle which is hilarious to me
because it's a huge indicator of a
woman's health and it happens you know
somewhat regularly for 40 years of your
life and it should happen so routinely
right so you can't track it that makes
that's kind of a cognitive dissonance
you know you can track your steps but
you can't track the thing that supposed
to happen to you LOL so she kind of
combined with knowledge of this product
could have avoided this really huge
blind spot and they're going to be
releasing this ability in iOS 9 but
that's a full year after this thing was
released it's not great so let's look at
maybe a better example um so usability
studies combined with familiarity can
sometimes result in something cool
there's an old harvest Harvard Business
Review article about sparking innovation
through empathetic design and that's the
idea that companies are the company's
employees
ha the context of the familiarity with
the product and if they kind of look at
it through fresh eyes they can build
something innovative and stand out so
the example this is the creation of a
woman's razor typically women do not
shave their faces and so men's razors
don't really work for them because we're
shaving things like our knees or like
you know what I'm stuff that men are not
shaving and so who leave it at that and
that's not this razor is not designed
for that that use case and so a woman
working in gillette redesigned it and
they made a hilarious amount of money
and that kind of you know combination of
empathy and design is a good thing
because they were literally already
making razors so we had that opportunity
today to kind of look at our own
products and kind of expand them and so
let's talk about another example of how
to build empathy slack everybody does
support we have two hour shifts and it's
really great because it built empathy
for our customer we see the kind of
things that they are struggling with but
on the other hand it builds empathy for
our customer support team I don't know
if many of you have done support shifts
it's hard is really hard to like keep
her cool and like answer question
especially when sometimes it can feel a
bit accusatory and something we do and
slack is like 200 people so this works
for us because we make it work but that
might be the case if you work at a
larger place but support can take all
forms and you can just you know and not
all the things we build our for our
customers so it's something that you can
take in consideration so on the moving
forward we can talk about empathy for
our non technical work mates
traditionally engineering is a real
hostile Department we got a lot of power
not a lot of oversight it's a real
inmates are running the asylum kind of
scenario but how can we foster a more
evident environment when there's a lot
of departments that don't historically
get along for instance engineering and
marketing we don't see eye to eye you
know it's a real like feel it in your
bones pass it down their children kind
of blood feud and I never understood
that because they're literally trying to
tell people about our good work like
that's what they're kind of that's a
cool job and so same goes for sales whoa
they're going to sell I work for money
so that we can live our lives like what
and it's not just those departments its
product this customer support it's other
engineers it's everybody right so why is
that I think it's because suspicion and
mistrust come from not understanding
what these departments are doing and not
having any visibility into their
workflow like I can tell you what a
marketer does all day well we need to
start feeling empathy for these teams
and treating their work as valid just as
valid as engineering work because you
know it is it is valid and for instance
like in sales they'll often have quotas
right and they to hit these quotas
otherwise they lose their jobs like it's
so serious for them and they feel that
sense of like anxiety every day and with
engineers we won't be fired for building
fewer features per month in fact if we
manage to compress a work like a flow
make it more simplistic will probably
get promoted so at the end of the day
marketing sales customer engineering or
all those teams they're interlocking
systems and we need each other to
survive
so with all this in mind I want to talk
about specific interaction that I had
with the marketing team at my last
company we convinced them to use Jekyll
for the homepage Jekyll is this is
amazing I know how we did it this is it
wasn't perfect no Chapel is a static
site generator written in Ruby and all
of the files are marked on right and so
you have some yam all the top the file
it like does a bit of organization and
then like whatever blog post as a body
and so I we really sold him on this and
i wrote a dependency script that
installed everything need both windows
and for mac i was like what's happening
and so we're all working in the same
code base both let the front and team in
marketing and every once in a while we'd
add a gem they didn't know about and
they would see a stack trace do you
wanna be a first x rays it wasn't not
your face where you're like oh what's
happening here well so like this is kind
of what they were seeing and its really
really wildly overwhelming for someone
that doesn't use computers to the same
way engineering does like a lot of them
had never even opened terminal before
and so they were just like I'm seeing a
times matrix like what this is
and I just thought about that when I was
trying to help when I was like calm down
like they don't they don't know and so
what we ended up doing was writing out a
lot of documentation and doing a lot of
training and a run book for when they
did you you know often they just had to
run bundle like so we just came up with
strategies from working in the same code
base and the result of this is that
marketing was seen in a really positive
light because they did successfully use
our workflow and it engendered goodwill
between the departments lowered friction
and marketing got what they wanted which
was more blog posts from engineering
because you know I covered a markdown
file write a blog price all day I'll do
it all day so you know it was really
great awesome so now that we've
discussed empathy for the people who
build things for let's talk about
ourselves I think within software we
have a lot of problems you know what are
we building these days I think there's a
lot of trivial products there's a lot of
social problems like women leave
technology and a rate of fifty percent
right and so there's also a market lack
of diversity in our teams you know and
these problems are only going to become
more pronounced as software touches
everything you know it's your fridges
become smarter and your TV's become
smarter you know like this is only going
to get worse so we need to come up with
an idea of how to build better software
and I think one of the ways we can do
that is by making software development
at no flex zone one is a no flex zone
why it's like it's a I think it's ground
zero for like fostering a an empathetic
environment and no flex zone comes from
a rap song by this team brother duo name
race rumored and it cautions against
kind of an environment of posturing and
I'm gonna think I'm not seen the song
for you now see you gonna pee now hurt
you no no flex zone they know better
they know that we do
and it's kind of a yoga safe space so
let's apply that to our work environment
you know is it welcoming how do you
treat questions that people ask look is
it is it a no flex zone because for
software to truly thrive it has to be so
I worked in flux tones where someone's
like throwing around their way and
trying to be really cool and it's really
obvious because it comes from insecurity
and so I think that's silly i think we
want to be kind and welcoming and
accessible it's an empathetic thing to
do and it's also the breeding ground for
collaboration and I think software's
becoming more collaborative especially
if we look at the success of tools like
github and slack like and in hindsight
these products are built to kind of
address them in really obvious and we
think about how we disseminate
information as well as how we do that
but for the actual information sharing
and the tone we take and sharing that
information so feigning surprise when
someone doesn't have the context or
knowledge that you do is really
alienating and I think you endear
yourself to someone when you take the
time to teach them as well as reinforce
your knowledge set at slack our
principal engineers hold office hours
every week so you can answer any
questions that you may have so you can
just have that face-to-face moment where
you can learn some stuff so I'm going to
talk about some collaboration ending
phrases for instance you don't know what
that algorithm is no I didn't come out
the womb knowing every algorithm like
it's fine like not knowing what a
particular algorithm is is fine like you
can you can gain that knowledge and
oh you're a smart girl 1 i'm a woman to
like using an objective that's like an
adjective that's objectively true about
me and i make it turning it makes me
feel that and not want to work with you
another one is we can continue to talk
about this or we can fix it and that's
literally in the wild I've got something
I've heard and the reason I hate that is
because you hadn't even fixed a bug with
no context no you you have to know how
to fix something before you could
actually fix it right so we're tough in
a way that this command has some code
how many of you have seen like a bud and
you're like I'm so angry like give blab
who did that who wrote this and it's
actually more like but I'm gonna burger
them as a terrible and sometimes I do
this and it's my name like I did it it
was me I was in the house like so bloody
meat is interesting because it gives a
semblance of control and we can get rid
of our negative feelings but it has an
inverse relationship with accountability
people could blame a lot seldom have
like the tenacity and the grit to
actually hold people accountable and
take it as a moment of let's work
together and it's interesting because
you spend all your time like raging and
being upset and trying to figure out
who's full of this as opposed to like
fixing lifting and working together and
learning more and blaming is really
corrosive because it robs us of
opportunities to be empathetic so how
can we build an empathetic code base I
think empathetic code bases have
comments they have a strong culture of
code review they have scripts and they
most of all most of all they provide
context
comments are our first line of defense
in building an empathetic code base they
give context to new hires but also to
ourselves like I know about you but when
I program I'm like a functional I'm easy
acts like in in the middle of the
problem I'm like yes I understand
everything I'm amazing was great but in
six weeks like I don't I couldn't tell
you I couldn't tell you so comments
lower our cognitive load by providing
context where you need it and that's an
empathetic packed so let's look at some
real examples this is not a great
comment I've written this comment you've
probably written this comment it
probably is all over everyone's code
bases and all you can think is like what
is so bad like I don't know and we don't
have context there's no this is an
empathetic because we don't have context
so we can include a link to our issue
tracker and that you know we can go to
github and there can be like an animated
gif what's going on or steps to
reproduce like so this is a lot better
because you now know where to go and
look so we can go a step further and we
can add some accountability like if I
know this is a hack I can put my name on
it and i can tell you when it's supposed
to expire and i still have a link to the
tracker but you know sometimes hacks are
here to stay so it was going to stay
maybe say like why and in slack you can
copy link to an archive link and you
know getting to get more of the context
there
that's near my podcast check it out
later so comments at the beginning of a
file are really helpful ad they're both
welcome and also a warning for instance
you know if I want to know more about
time zones cool I can go to the website
learn more about it but also I can know
that there are lots of cities named
laboz like practice in South America
cool another thing that's helpful is if
you're passing a hash it could be
helpful for you to know what's in that
hash and what is or isn't optional he'll
remember the Hair Club for Men
commercials in the 90s no they're like
I'm not just a president I remember like
this is something that I'm doing this is
like a screenshot from like our internal
slack and I got a shout-out for hey
including a lot of information at the
top of a file so that like when this
person went into the code base they
weren't completely taken unawares and
this is empathetic towards I work me
because he has information but it's also
empathetic towards myself because now I
can forget what i wrote safely which is
great and I can go back and read my own
comments is great so provided that we
have all the information now we can go
and start doing a code review and I
think the process of releasing code is
one of the most important things we do
it's the way we measure our output but I
think I spend more time thinking about
how to solve a problem actually solving
the problem and I've definitely open
pull requests not understanding what I'm
trying to solve but provided that we
know what our problem is in that we've
solved it we need to think about our
poor requests and
okay I'm gonna go left um so yes we open
up request I think the first thing we
need to assume as reviewers is like do
no harm we want to assume good intent on
the honest on the side of the person
that's giving us code but as like a
review er we want and as a review EEE we
want to assume that our workman is doing
good work and that they're not an idiot
and that they are you know they
understand the problem so let's look at
this pull request there's not a
description the title isn't particularly
helpful and I don't as a reviewer I
don't really know what's going on in
this code review have to go read a lot I
got read a lot of code I don't really
know what's happening um this PR makes
we do a lot of legwork we can improve it
by you know we could prove it by adding
a description we can say like I tested
it we can see what the risks are and I
can also call I'm more into question
with like some cool emojis so now let's
look at actually reviewing the code we
have to remember firstly as a reviewer
to assume good intent while commenting
on individual lines because
communicating is really really hard
sometimes it's difficult to derive like
context from something type in a text
box and it wouldn't be at all like
something you would say to somebody to
their face and so when reviewing code or
generally explaining technical things we
need to take ownership we don't need to
say your code is bad but like our code
is about this code base like all of it
you know and we also need to eliminate
things like just from our vocabulary
because just is really minimizing you
can say oh just three architects that
whole thing like and know that the kind
of minimizes how much effort it would
take to do that
and so it means adding context to your
GF thought process also github allows
emoji so you should use it because it
makes kind of harsh statement seem less
harsh so now that we've kind of like
started to release our code out into the
wild let's talk about how we tell people
about it everybody likes good
documentation but people don't like to
write it and it's essential for
reference and and onboarding software is
a complex machine and it's composed of
moving parts and it's constantly
changing and I don't have any of you all
have ever had your wisdom she found but
you know what you're sitting like in you
but come out you're like not not got any
more you're like listen to the nurse
tell you about how you're supposed to
clean your mouth and you're like I'm
never gonna remember this luckily you
know they give you all this information
but then they also give you like a stack
of papers and I like here you know what
there are any of this you probably won't
like look at this later and I think we
need to kind of do that for people i
don't know if you've ever worked on
something without guidance or
documentation but when you deploy it you
feel a lot of anxiety because you don't
really know how it works i would make
the argument that production code
without documentation isn't ready to be
released i also talked about the idea of
self documenting code there's this idea
gaining popularity in the Ruby community
that if you structure your code in a
certain way you won't need comments
because the code will be the comments
and that is malarkey like there's still
a knowledge transfer that needs to
happen and I would wager like in these
self documenting code base is just a
higher learning curve I recently talked
to a girlfriend who's in one of these
code bases and I was like I don't even
work she's like oh I para para game all
day and I was like like you were
literally every day someone giving you
contact with our mouths like that's how
that works for you and I think it's
important to have a code base that is
well structured but you can't leave
comments out of it especially if you've
ever used a library that's like self
documenting if something breaks in a
library you're never you're never going
to have a chance to figure out how to
fix it and there's a lot of ways that
you can easily add documentation to your
code base there's doc blocker was it
it's a sublime plug-in so that you can
literally just tap a few things and
start right
documentation all like right away if
you're building an API there's a thing
called a PM blueprint and it's you know
generates JSON for you via markdown
there's docs i/o which has like a lot of
element and it will also it has like a
simple folder structure and mark down
files that allow you to create custom
documentation on the fly so another
we've written down all the things now
what we should think about the things
that make our lives and our jobs in this
year can it be automated because if it
makes your life easier it's likely to
make your workmates lives easier as well
and so at slack we don't have individual
development environments which is really
cool because then you're not spending a
lot of time being like oh wise is broken
and it also becomes like the responsible
ops to maintain which is look really
great so the way that we connect is like
I have a branch and then I pick a dev
instance and then I commit and then like
it gets synced that way but sometimes
the committing it takes like 30 seconds
but like maybe are sinking or FCP would
take like two seconds and so became his
rite of passage every engineer would
work on their own script that would go
from like local to like the sandbox but
I'm going to tell you something I never
wrote a script instead I did this a lot
because I was like oh the pen in self
I'll write a script it'll be great but
every file I was like SCP SCP was
terrible and then we started doing this
thing where we had like a seal itís
like a con so now it's this it's like oh
I can make flight like in the type slack
sink death and a lil like look at my
branch and it'll push it up and this is
really oh my gosh this is so much better
but there's more than just sinking dev
we can ssh into dev we can tail the logs
and dev and we can also pull up a
Beyonce gift if ur feelin fancy
and it's nice because you can hack on it
in your spare time when you have
downtime and you can feel like
immediately that you're having an impact
on just yourself you know it makes your
work mate lives like more productive
more pleasant it's great so I think so
far I've only talked about improving
development processes internally I think
we can talk a little bit about external
communication and I think the way we
primarily interact with other developers
is via AP eyes and we want to
incorporate like other people's hard
work into our stack so the typical way
that I interact with an API is why
cobbling together like maybe the retro
pin maybe the right endpoint and then
trying to hit it but I mean nine times
out of ten the response is like oh
actually did something wrong and so I
think what we can do is provide copy and
paste will code that people can use
right away to kind of get started and
this is empathetic because it lowers the
learning curve and it makes you feel
productive right away and so that you
can kind of like feel like Oh easy quick
win and I can continue coding all right
so to sum up after the code bases have
comments they have code review if
automated scripts and they provide
contacts most of all so
to sum up our whole experiment here
empathy is feeling with people we build
software for all kinds of people and
empathy helps us to connect to these
disparate audiences we have to choose
empathy and I'd argue overwhelmingly
it's that the one thing that's going to
future-proof our industry okay so you
want to remember that empathy is a
competitive advantage and it can help us
stand out when choosing what to build
and when we take people's actual needs
into consideration when we apply empathy
to our non technical team mates we can
end cycles of mistrust and we can
collaborate and get further than we
would have otherwise when we apply
empathy to our fellow engineer we can
focus less on like time-consuming
minutia and focus on solving the real
problems at hand I firmly believe that
if we put empathy to practice we can
tell a lot of problems in software
development and working on these common
pain points frees us up to work on
cooler for stuff so got there making
workplaces in a flux own we're going to
build an empathetic workbook like code
base so get on board these are the
people that really helped me with this
if you liked any of these ideas any of
this appeal to you slack is hiring so
any ideas or stories you want to tell me
at all
yes you in the back your observation
yeah yeah it's some real inception stuff
when you're like oh just do this you're
like okay oh no there's other thing
that's broken oh no this you know it's
yeah just it was just recursion oh yeah
oh totally understand it the first time
you read about it no is it somewhere
yeah yes so you mentioned be more like
that and wow I'm always gonna be the
first one to admit but I don't know
something I find that to be way more
efficient because you're like I don't
know how do this and I think once people
see that you're willing to admit what
you don't know people feel a bit more
comfortable admitting what they don't
know sometimes it's like a Coalition of
the Willing sometimes you can have like
a partner that's like oh I also don't
know this and then it becomes this kind
of critical massive like not be terrible
about it yes
biologically who's currently looking now
yeah sure so the first thing that you
should do is after sirens and stuff is
if this
and so I do for people so what you may
want to consider while trying to figure
out if the company's empathetic or not
is try to interview with a member of
their support team and see how they're
treated and because if they're if they
don't have a career path of their own
it's they feel like people in
engineering don't take them seriously
then you can kind of tell the overall
health of of an organization everybody
case for support yeah is that a pretty
rare thing I'm i think it is I think it
is unless I mean I've worked to places
where you're you know if your customer
support team uses n desk you'll be
pulled in when they can't figure out a
problem but it's never been like oh I'm
just going to be a part of the support
hose and see what it is to work on their
workflow I think that's pretty rare but
you can suggest it at your company's yes
ma'am yeah
oh yeah so if someone says that you're
being too verbose in your comments oh I
I just reject that premise of completely
because huh what if there's someone new
that comes into your code base how would
they get that information you know if
they may be want you to be a little bit
less for both I would still argue for
the the existence of the comment but i
would say in six weeks what can you tell
me about this i would okay i'm kind of
control so i would it be like idea
remind me six weeks talking about this
and then I would be like oh like do you
remember what this code does that's kind
of terrible but um I would ask for you
know and a way for you to be able to
explain what this code is later other
than do a good blame image like trying
to find this person in later like yeah
yeah I would push back that's that's
nonsense which back I even want you yes
crosstalk i recently introduced codes
codes fell as much so also like a lot of
times when you're compressing code with
comments are going to be ripped out
anyway like it's you're in a javascript
framework you're most likely going to be
UTLA flying your code so those get
ripped out anyway so there's not really
no reason not to have them fight back
yes sir
and what was it a response to and yeah
so you're asking about the principal
engineer's office hours that came about
because we had a lot of we had an influx
of new hires and there wasn't enough
documentation so people were just
confused a lot and so my manager was
like well we need an avenue for people
to people ask questions it's typically
for engineering but I don't think if
anybody from any other department had
the collection they could easily come in
and it's been really lovely they they've
been tweaking the the setup it was twice
a week and nobody came to the second
session so now they're it's once a week
and they and the principal jr. is like
call tonight it's been spinning around
and it spreads the knowledge around too
so like I can get answers to questions
that I need so try it out yes sir see
you Ben should do things yes
I think it's probably been apartment all
all along but I think we're coming to
reel in flux point right now in terms of
like trying to extend more of a
welcoming red carpet to people from
non-traditional backgrounds so I think
we're seeing more head-butting than we
were before and also I think it's easier
to kind of announce your displeasure at
certain things because of Twitter right
like one voice becomes a thousand to
quote that line from house of cards of
fixing that so I think it's becoming
more important more visible because we
can talk about it more openly I think
it's always been a problem but I think
now is important people actually
thinking about empathy as an edge is it
we should always have it but it's super
yeah for sure we should always have it
but at the same time it's easy it's hard
because to feel empathy you have to be
willing to to be open to feeling some
discomfort and being uncomfortable and I
don't like being uncomfortable I don't
think you like being uncomfortable so
it's harder to open up your heart to
want to do this kinds of things anyway
now mm-hmm alright well give you some
time back thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
