good presentation my name is Mickel and
i am from in program and i intend to
give you a brief overview of our product
our company and then dive into a couple
of live data visualizations and given
the as the Internet allows let's put it
that way so in program is a data
visualization and interactive
infographics creation tool on the web it
was born in the newsroom and the two
founders were in the receiving end of
requests for data visualizations from
reporters and they wanted to create a
product that was easy enough for even
journalists to use to create
visualizations and that's what they set
out to do about three years ago and if
we look at it quickly you'll be able to
register and login on the homepage for
the free product the free product
contains approximately ninety percent of
the features you will get to your
library if you're like me and have lots
of infographics created which you can
edit or see live and share on it's made
we've made it as easy for you as
possible to get started with beautiful
data visualizations by having these pre
created templates that you can grab
there's actually two modes that you can
start from you can either take one of
these kind of power shape traditional
infographics or you can anticipate in a
single chart and just create a single
data visualization both are popular with
our users behind the interface is a one
you see is what you get editor which has
a familiar spreadsheet interface behind
the data visualization but it also has
the ability to load your own data set
which can be a static CSV but it can
also be a live updating JSON feet or a
published Google spread
which I hope to show you in a second
we've got approximately 30 different
chart types in the product and once
you're done we give you very much like
sill to the options to publish publicly
share privately in the pro version and
share socially and of course embed
anywhere you want so like I said in
program was born in the newsroom and if
you think of the news industry the
publishing industry it has been you know
in in dire straits for a long time
whether you look at the print ad
revenues or the industry employment /
for the last last few decades this is
steady trend downwards but us working in
this industry of creating engaging
visual content know that there is a
content type out there that is really
working and that's getting people
excited and in the case of Internet that
is of course funny cats there is
absolutely no denying the staying power
of funny cats in fact if we look at the
google search team at for funny cats
over here in the red line you see that
it stayed pretty strong for the last
couple of years but ladies and gentleman
in the blue corner we have a contender
that shows you the search demand for
infographics so this is our way of
saying that there is an actual real
demand for meaningful professionally
created content that tells a message
then that's even meeting funny cats so a
little bit about a program the company
has been in existence for three years
during which time about million and a
half people have registered for an
account and created about it's close to
three million infographics now and so if
you seem four minutes and average are
spent with product that gets you quite a
lot of humanity's time already spent on
the product just creating infographics
and that's just the short end of the
Liebherr the consumption end of those is
much bigger because they're seen by tens
of millions of people per month we've
got a 40 people were based in riga
latvia and
is over here in San Francisco where
we're hiring more people definitely as
the white name time you talk to me after
this our key market segments are media
and publishing and content marketing but
education is also strong that slide
shows you a couple of it logos we sign
up recently and now I'm going to take
this over to a demo let's see how this
how this works for it okay oh so um
we're back you're seeing my demo account
I've got 87 infographics created over
here and what I want to do is I want to
show you a quick example of a live data
integration actually we can look at we
can look at an existing example first
I'll just take the risk end and i don't
think i have loaded any of these
preloaded any of these but this is an
example we made last week at the
Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism
to illustrate the not strikes but rather
work slowdown at the at the West Coast
seaports related to labor discussions
and some of the things we wanted to
illustrate were the how this has
affected the number of ships waiting to
dock at the bay and also talked a little
bit about the about the union membership
so there's actually live data behind
this so in the case of this chart
actually i'm going to show you first i'm
going to show you a chart that doesn't
have live data so if we had to this one
i double-click that it's going to open
the spreadsheet that authority that i
just showed you here you'd be easily
able to manually edit any of the data so
if you if we find a mistake here for
instance we want to say that that is
that's 42 instead of 41 will just update
that and it gets updated live now if
that infographic is embedded somewhere
that of course it gets updated live as
well so one of the paradigms of of
infographics of data visualization we
want to break is is move away from that
static image
and bet it's somewhere and that never
gets updated when the when the data
updates but there's also a live version
and this is this post data from a Google
spreadsheet it's connected to a live
data source so I'm not going to be able
to able to edit that it it's updating I
set it to auto update never but I can
set it to set it to 30 seconds now in
the case of spreadsheets we only pull
every 30 seconds because we don't want
to hit any rate limits in the case of a
JSON feed week and we can pull every
second or so this is actually coming
from I'm not able to switch between
applications so to show you it's coming
from a Google spreadsheet over here so
if I were to add not essentially good
punish there's another sheep very
similar that's published and that has
the number of ships waiting to winning
dog at the apt important so I'm going to
go back and start creating a new one I
will go to my grave view which gives me
the templates that I have available to
me there's two custom designed ones we
have a custom package for larger brands
and publishers where our designers
create a template for them and that's
unlike traditional infographic creation
where you know you you order just a
single one shot infographic here we make
you a template even then use for
unlimited condon I'm going to grab this
one I think that was the same one I
think that was the same when we just saw
I'll edit some of this content so let's
call this the fickle nature of happiness
I have these charts ready here in this
case a line graph and when I
double-click that I'll be able to see
the dummy data behind that we pre
populate the charts to give you an
example of what
what the structure of the data is behind
that so you'll be able to change that
easily yourself if you don't like that
you can get rid of the rid of the data
very easily or you can just get rid of
the entire infographic so in this case I
actually moved quote no i didn't i just
let go of that i'm going to get rid of
these elements over here maybe that's
paint anything i'm just going to add a
new element here let's add a column
chart I'm going to insert that it will
react soon again that has been
pre-populated with with some dummy data
forests if I wanted to modify the
subtype in this case I could go to
settings and say that I'd rather see
this ass aspect graph for instance but
I'm going to go back here I'm actually
tethered through a phone so we may run
into a couple of errors and I will
connect a live JSON data feed here which
I hope we have on my clipboard ready to
go there we go yeah
and in the case of the JSON data feed
i'm going to set it to again to 30
seconds so if we if i'm happy with this
I maybe i'm going to edit that
I'm going to post a link to this to the
to the meetup meetup page and of course
if I don't like some of these things I
can always go back and delete them the
editor gives you pretty much what you
get in the end but you can also take a
look at the preview which in this case
gives you something completely different
what it actually looks like no this is
right you'll be able to see the
animations between your data sets in
this case we have hours of the day I
core against which are bloated and then
happiness indexes of places like Eden
and at along when I'm happy with this I
can just either if im a pro user i can
download that in different flavors of
static files or I can choose to publish
which will do now so i'll be able to
ensure it is data in motion published
for everyone
take a deep breath and there we go good
okey okey and now I've got that link and
like I promised I'm going to share this
on the meetup page oh that's me it's got
more hair but it's still me okay I think
I've gone through the main points at
least one as you want protects to the
live data bit of intagram there's a
whole lot more in the 30 different chart
types and and different other kind of
visualization flavors in the in the
product that you can poke around with
and definitely feel free to ask any
questions now or Q&amp;amp;A later yeah there's
some there's a couple of interesting use
cases first that comes to mind sports so
live updating sports scores one of our
bigger customers is in weather and
weather data is constantly changing as
well that is that's a nice youth cage
and for for more like internal use case
if you this is if you you can you can
take single charts and use those as you
know instead of your slides from your
from your favorite favorite slide
presentation for example so if you had a
sales presentation you could rely on
those numbers being fresh when you go to
meet the client it's going to have that
day's numbers without you having to
having to download anything you so those
kinds of three use cases we see
ok cool thanks so much you know later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
