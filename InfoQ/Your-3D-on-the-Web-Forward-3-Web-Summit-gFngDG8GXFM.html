thank you for coming or I guess staying
after lunch for a talk so here we're
gonna be talking about how we can put
your 3d on the web without you ever
touching WebGL at all because WebGL is
not easy and we're just mere mortals
doing JavaScript what do we know about
low-level hardware API right and yes
this is a sponsor talk so we'll be
talking about one of our new WebGL
engines at Autodesk here and my name is
Nava I'm one of the developers WebGL
developers on the project so first off
how many people here have heard of
Autodesk so about half the people I
don't expect too much because um you
know Autodesk is actually been around
for quite some time we're like counting
Microsoft been around since 1980s but
we've been doing desktop software for a
while but recently we're getting in onto
the web and bringing our 3d expertise on
to the web and we're a company that does
3d design software for engineering and
architecture and things like that
AutoCAD is you might have heard that one
that's one over on us
okay you know I've got out of this let's
jump right in so first what are we
actually talking about so let's just
show it off instead of talking about it
live demos are better than slides all
right so this is the thing that we're
talking about here this is fully
interactive 3d rendering engine that
displays your design files right in the
browser with the power of WebGL and this
is where we are at now WebGL is very
powerful as you can see we're getting a
lot of the features that we're getting
in the latest game engines these days so
let me zoom into some of the details
that we're getting from this guy so as
you can see this is you know just to
remind you this is running in chrome
right here we're getting kind of you
know PlayStation 3 quality graphics so
now that we see what it looks like let's
you know talk about why you want to use
this and how all right so the problem
we're trying to solve with this API
is the thing with design files is that
they come in a whole range of file
formats and these file formats are
locked up behind these giant and most of
the time very expensive pieces of
software that individuals like us don't
really have access to unless you work
for a large company that can't afford it
so let me give you a typical story okay
so this is you you want like someone to
make you a tractor you don't know how to
make it yourself so you hire a designer
your designer takes your favorite that
his his favorite software whatever that
is goes to work for a couple of weeks
he's made some progress and he wants to
you to check it out so you're like sure
okay just email it to me and then soon
after you realize that's a pretty bad
idea because that found something like
half a gigabyte because it's like a
design files got way lots of data in it
so you have to set up some Dropbox
shenanigans and okay takes two hours to
download finally once it hits your
computer you're like what the heck is
like an IP TV file how do I open that do
I need like Acrobat or download
something from the internet so you're
like okay I'll hit Google and look for a
dot IPTA extension after a couple hours
more searching around you finally landed
on the website of this company called
Autodesk that you never heard of and
you're like great this is a software
that I need I'll just go right here and
download it buy buy it and then expense
it to accounting or something and then
so you go down here you're gonna click
download and then you realize the cause
of bajillion dollars and at this point
you're just like okay let me just give
up okay but what if I tell you that it
doesn't have to be that way so let me
take you to our new little web app that
can help you solve this problem let me
refresh it just make sure it still works
okay so let's say I have this file here
call Qatar 1 1 1 9 I have no idea what
it is now it might be a guitar because
it's like a black box literally I don't
know what's inside it so I'm going to
drop it right here
upload my file to a server once it's
done uploading its going to do some
processing on it and you shouldn't take
too long depending on the internet boom
there it goes
all right and once it's done it should
show me what's in it figures crossed man
this is so close this is for furthest I
got oh okay so we got some buttons some
things are coming in so we're also
loading thing part by parts so you don't
have to finish wait for the entire half
a gigabyte file to finish so it's
loading in a little bit at a time let me
hit refresh again maybe there it is
oh well don't you hate when that happens
okay I have I have the page already
loaded okay in the next tab but as you
can see it worked alright so it turns
out to be a fake guitar from Guitar Hero
but it's great because I now I can see
that it's a fake guitar and the guy
didn't actually send me a real guitar
but this is an actual 3d model so I can
actually go in and it's fully
interactive I can look at like all the
little parts that's in this file and
let's say I'm you know I want to see
what's inside this plastic case I can
just open it up and I see that my
designer has been slacking off and
actually has not finished the inside of
this guitar but what you would have
known if you don't have this and can't
actually open the file okay so that's
that's basically the main idea and let's
look at some more complicated examples
so this guy right here is a pretty dense
model and again it's still running
smooth 60 frames a second okay maybe
close to it but good enough and here you
can really see the high quality
rendering I'll just kind of zoom into
all the detail we actually don't do any
compression we don't drop any detail we
bring all that in from the original
software so you see all these nuts
involved in screws but they are real
geometry
so aside from the pretty image that you
have here behind this picture is
actually also a lot of metadata that's
attached to each piece and we get all
that in the web app as well and you you
will get this through the API so for
example if I want to kind of take a look
at this it has like the name that comes
with it
so this one wasn't named it gives you
some physical properties materials and
all the other pieces have that as well
so and then besides that you also get
the structure of the model you get name
for every node and you get how they're
related to each other as well and then
with that you can kind of click through
and examine it a little bit so like this
piece is pretty interesting and then you
can dig into it a little more so there's
just a whole lot amount of data going on
okay you get the idea
and then so what we're trying to build
with this tool first is to better help
you understand your design data because
design data is is really dense as you
can see is 3d data which is hard to
understand so we're building tools
around it to help you kind of dig into
it a little bit so let's just show up
I'm gonna show a few examples so this
this car right here wouldn't be nice for
us to be able to look inside this kind
of gearbox that we have here because
it's kind of opaque I can like try to
take away things that helps a little bit
but it's still hard to see what's going
on in there so we have this tool that
helps us pull things apart actually and
it's called the Explo tool and it does
just that and this by far one of the
coolest features we have so here we go
someone like dropped a cop back there
I'm sorry about that so the reason we
can do this is that remember that model
tree that we have here we know how
everything is related to each other that
information is maintained therefore we
can write some logic just very simple on
a JavaScript side to pull this apart
relative to where it it's you know
groupings are and then with this you can
kind of just also do it over and over
because it's cool and that doesn't get
old and then finally we can you know get
a lot of clarity on this gearbox like
what's going on in here
like this is actually like five
different pieces that's like
interlocking it's pretty cool and then
there's this other piece down here and
then you can kind of fly in and out get
a much better clarity on this and also
with all the pieces now exploded you see
how much really detail is in this model
okay let's move on to a different
example which is building so this house
looks really nice from the outside
there's your entrance they even give you
a car but houses are more interesting on
the inside right so how do I look inside
this house maybe I like go through this
door but then it's kind of hard to
navigate around like you know it's not
really a good way to take a look at what
the rooms will look like so would it be
nice if we can just open this right up
well it is and we have a thing for that
as well so there's a tool that basically
just slice your model in half and this
way you can inspect it by sliding this
up and down and it will kind of show you
what's inside the house so now I
basically have a floor plan of the house
and you slide up and that's like a third
floor and if I want like cross section
of the house I basically just take this
and rotate it and you can now get a
cross-section of the house can you even
do it the other way of course
so just like that okay cool so there's a
couple more features like live
collaboration so we have a bunch of
goodie in here and then it's all
available but as the last demo I just
want to show you how robust our engine
actually is so this guy right here is
quite the monster this one a largest
models I have it has over 10 million
triangles and if you know gaming at all
that's more than what you ever will get
in like a game level easily we have a
lot of optimizations that will load this
into your browser and run in reasonable
frame rate as you can see here and to
prove to you that all the detail is
maintained I'm going to do a stress test
and look search for all the screws in
this model okay and the code name for
that is then and there you have all the
screws in this giant tractor and let me
just take a look at one of these screws
and prove to you that it's oops I missed
clicked it's real so just think about
how much detail is actually in this and
this again is in your browser running
with just JavaScript
you never know JavaScript could do so
much all right so now that you see all
the flashy things that you do you're
asking like how can we have this right
so we actually have an API that we have
a JavaScript library a bunch of
server-side services a couple things you
need to do to set it up but we all
provide that for you I won't have time
to go over it but all the information is
online or you can ask us later at the
desk what I do want to talk about is one
of the easier ways to use our viewer
which is using web components now people
have heard of web components it's keep
everyone's excited about it you know
it's like the newest thing and I am too
so what that means is with our custom
element you can use our viewer with just
one line of HTML so if you know how web
components work they look just like
native HTML tags
you have to declare that in the name of
the tag and for our API you just have to
define your URL to your file that you
want to display so kind of like an image
tag like you have a SRC equals something
and with just one line you will get our
viewer in your HTML so let me just demo
that live so this is what you get with
just that one line and let me show you
that there's no trickery I will pop up
my console here and it looks just like a
regular HTML tag and yeah it's you get
the whole thing and from there you can
call some API on it let me just I'll
just do some quick samples so first I
need to grab the reference to that
element here you can see that so we now
have the reference to that element under
that element is a variable called a
viewer and this is where everything is
so you do not we have a lot of things in
here so that's that's our engine right
there so I'm just gonna call something
simple our favorite feature of the day
explode and give it a value of 0.5 goes
from 0 to 1 if I do that boom so that
the viewer updates everything handles
the shadows reflections everything for
you
well this wonderful reflection is not on
like it I can do that reflection true
yes so it's just just like that so we
have all this available documented easy
to use and I think that's all i want to
show there's a lot more that a viewer
can do and i can tell you all about it
but i only have 15 minutes so that's it
these are links on the slide and I think
the slides will be made available later
and I'm here my contact info I'm also
supposed to say that we are also hiring
back in the whole shebang so please come
talk to us active who was afterwards and
thank you very much for listening does
he only support DWF files and my ear
phone thing is so if you go on our
website here okay he doesn't want to do
that okay here we actually support 50
different file formats so that's the
problem of trying to solve so we take
everything and it's turned it into a
kind of a neutral format but we save all
that data and then we we push it through
to the front end so we have a whole
translation service that takes 50
different file formats and then
translated to a kind of neutral JSON
friendly format that will load up on the
web the question is do we use any open
source libraries yes we do use three Jas
and I highly recommend that library has
a very good WebGL library for someone
who's not familiar but we do use 3GS and
we fork it and made a bunch of heavy
modifications to it yes if the files
already on a 360 Cloud storage
we do have a cloud storage service and
this is using that so in order to load
the file you it loads it from the cloud
storage so we have a bunch of services
on the back end that's we hook together
to kind of create this experience and if
you sign up as one of our developers you
get access to all that I think we one
thing is also the Internet's not very
good because that data is very small on
the model eye-tracking is only about 300
K so that is really not it
if the JSON is arriving you will
actually see sparse a bit load at a time
so let me show you
I actually am Not sure
usually the pages load
but I can talk about how we stream this
thing so let me load that load up the
model again you will see that parts of
it slowly come in so we kind of do the
optimization where we break this giant
3d file into little chunks that are
consumed that each of them are can be
individually consumed by the engine and
displayed independently of all the other
things that are coming in and so as
they're coming in we just throw it up so
that you have something to work with
it's kind of like very very similar to
you know what the paradigm that we used
to on a webpage things loading you know
at different as they come in so if the
files loading you will kind of see you
partially here okay that's it then thank
you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
