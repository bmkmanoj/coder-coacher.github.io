working application the one thing I
wanted us to explore is how we can
potentially optimize it slightly so one
of the one of the really good guides on
the developer.android.com website talks
about among other things designing for
performance and underneath specifically
talks about some j'ni tips so one of the
sections on the native libraries talks
about this j'ni onload function and so
what this will allow us to do is to if
we choose to implement our code in C++
have allow us to execute or I should say
pre-register our functions from with the
dalvik virtual machine as soon as their
library is loaded as opposed to waiting
until the first time our code is used
because what we don't know is until our
our functions are first used whether or
not we have correctly mapped names from
the function method names onto function
names specifically let me let me kind of
explain so here you know this fib Lib
function or I should say class has these
this method for example native static
long fib and R and of course this point
over here has the same sort of method
you know call Marikana android blah blah
they then are the name of this function
it has to exactly match the name of this
class the package and the name of this
function if it doesn't it will not work
and the problem is will will only find
out that it doesn't work the first time
we try to use it and at that point it'll
be essentially you know made too late
it's not something that we can
preemptively test for so what andrey
allows us to do is to actually
pre-register these functions and
essentially think we're miss pre bind
them before they're actually even used
the first time so here's what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna copy make a copy of this C
program and I'm gonna call this CPP for
example so just the you know create a a
C++ version of the
so here we go I'm and so now what I'll
do inside I'm gonna close this original
file and I'm gonna open this this other
file up and now what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna using in C++ I'm gonna go
and first of all I don't need this
anymore this header file instead what
I'll do is from the scalar file I'll
just take the J and I that age so that I
do need but this entire file can go away
like that you know I can see I don't
need it anymore and now I'm gonna go as
opposed to using this long you know a
naming convention that comes from job
because you know she doesn't have
namespaces I'm not actually gonna use
C++ namespace support so name space for
example calm Maracana Android Fibonacci
native in fact this this it just happens
to be something that I choose to do we
doesn't even have to match what they I
have in my java classes so let's go
let's just go and have this kind of
nicely indented this this entire thing
and I no longer has to be exported this
way so I'm actually gonna get rid of
this altogether this is still gonna
return a.j long but this doesn't have to
be AJ and I call instead what I'm gonna
do is I'm just gonna say this is a
static function so essentially it's
private it's not expert or anywhere and
in fact this becomes redundant I can
actually call this whatever I want to
and I can even simplify it make this
look you know most likely images in one
line okay so this I'm gonna indent this
I'm gonna indent this I'm gonna indent
okay so far so good
same thing I'm gonna do over here this
becomes a static so static J long also
has I also have to go and just fix
something I'm gonna get rid of this this
becomes just an and I like just like we
had before I can go and move this up
above and I'm just gonna go and indent
all of this slightly
thing too exciting really they're not
changing the actual code at least not
how it behaves and now I can go and
close this namespace so I'm just gonna
go down here and close the namespace so
now of course if I were just to come
follow it like this how will the dalvik
ever be able to find these functions
especially you know a they have names
that don't match anything and be they're
static so they're not exported so this
is one last thing I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna create a mapping so
specifically I'm gonna create a static
array of j'ni native method so actually
Emeth 'add and this i'm just gonna call
it a method underscore table for example
like this and this is gonna essentially
define a a collection I should say an
array of these j'ni methods each of
which is going to essentially map a java
named method name onto my function my
prime function will act as a pointer to
the function so here we go first I'm
gonna go and define a the name of the
java method so for example fib n r again
this is the name that was used right
here say that our then I'm gonna say
that this method maps on to a method or
sure I should saying this method that a
better method that I'm searching for by
name I also have to specify its type
because Java supports method overloading
and so therefore I have to specify
exactly which method I'm I mean now the
way you express types is somewhat weird
and it seems cryptic but essentially
what it means it's I'm using the syntax
that actually comes from J and I it's
defined right here
and if you see for example when you're
defining signatures if you see a J that
is referring to a long if you see an f3
frame to float if you see you know a
square bracket in front of something
that means referring to an array of that
if you see an L followed by a fully
qualified class followed by a semicolon
that's referring to
fully qualified class so essentially
what I'm saying here is I am looking for
a Java method called fib NR that takes
AJ again J being along and returns AJ
okay that's that's again just because of
the Java support for overloading have to
be explicit as to which method I'm
actually referring to and I'm now going
to essentially make this be a pointer to
the fib and our function that I've
previously created which is the one over
here I'm essentially pointing from a
logical Java name to an actual
functioning that's my first entry in
this table the next entry is going to be
pretty much simple similar sort of thing
and I J James because it also takes in
it along the returns along and then this
is gonna point to this function right
here so I'm just gonna say an eye that's
it I now have essentially a little table
describes how will Java methods map onto
these static function essentially static
functions through these function
pointers okay
now here's one the next thing I want to
do now I want to register these so I'm
gonna say using namespace in fact I'm
just gonna be lazy and copy the name
space down below okay and now I'm gonna
say okay I'm gonna build a static or so
sorry an extern c function so that
returns of j int in fact it could just
return int it's called the j'ni on load
in fact rather than pipe all of this I'm
gonna be lazy and just copy this from
here like so so copy and paste I don't
have to say an extern I like to simply
you know for a consistency it would work
either way and because it gets exported
anyways but what I'm doing
here is um creating a special function
that has a special name that'll
automatically be invoked by dalvik
virtual machine or any java virtual
machine for that matter when the
environment is for or when this library
is first loaded and so the whole purpose
of what I'm doing here is so that I can
actually connect my or execute on this
mapping on the load of my library rather
than wait until the first use okay
so here's here's basically what I'm
gonna do so now that I have the
environment okay I'm gonna go like this
and say else I need to go on grab my
class so how do I actually grab the
class J class equals or clause equals
environment env find class by a
particular name well what's the name of
my class
well the name of my class is gonna be
let's take a look it's this one okay now
why am I looking for a class the the
purpose here is so that I can go and
point so let's go down below go like
this and so that I can go and say when
you register these methods unfortunately
here they're all slashes no thoughts
when you register and then finally babe
live when you register these melodies
functions or against methods to
functions I need to tell the system as
to what it'll be
what will register it on okay so
basically what i'm doing here is i'm
looking for this class by this
particular name okay I'm gonna assume
that this class exists well actually I
should not assume I should just go and
say well if you know class if it doesn't
exist we're gonna obviously have a
problem so if it exists I'm gonna go and
register the native method so I'm gonna
say e and V of Z and V regester natives
okay on this class from this table right
so remember how
have this table that I built over here
so I'm gonna have from from this table
and I have to give it the size of the
table so the number of elements in table
I can just say 2 or I can say size of
this table / size of you know the first
element from this table for example
right or I could just say the size of
the J&amp;amp;I native methods anyway what this
will do it will essentially tell the
environment the Jaina environment that
we are going to look for these methods
on this class and register those methods
to point to essentially the following
functions so when these methods are
requested to run these functions execute
instead so the benefit of this is we
have do this once we do it at the
startup if there's a problem essentially
we deal with that problem right away we
don't have to worry about you know that
problem becoming you know a linkage
error down below so now that we've done
this we would want to go and get rid of
our class we don't really need the env
you know a local reference to this class
or say delete local ref and class and so
now we can say return zero we're done
otherwise of course we you know since
there was a problem we're just gonna say
return I don't know minus one or
something like that to indicate that we
weren't able to actually complete it
properly this actually returns zero I
should say we should return zero we
should just return the actual version so
I'm gonna change this to say return the
j'ni version and now we are should be
done again what leads with this code so
ultimately the benefit is all the
registration and mapping happens sooner
rather than later
so to test this out I'm gonna go to my
make file I'm gonna change this to be
CPP right because they now have a new
one this file and this file these two
files are actually now being ignored
they're not used for anything this
we file is not at all looking at the the
Heather file and so let's see if I did
everything correctly I should be able to
essentially get my code to work so let's
try clean and let's do an NDK builds and
it compiles so that's promising now I
can go over here and refresh and now I
can go and rerun again so what we'll see
is again we're gonna go over here and
type adb logcat log cat when our code
first runs at least when when it first
loads
it'll actually execute the on load and
it will be able to bind to everything
earlier rather than later so let's give
us a shot like for example 15 on NR here
this it executed it doesn't it's telling
you here that it's trying to load it and
right now it is it is loaded it and
actually it has already executed the on
bind method our source a on load method
is bound all of the all of these so let
me go back to show it you so it is
already executed this onload it has
already bound or found our class
registered all the natives and then you
know a lot us to actually run whatever
whatever function we actually ran but
ultimately this is gonna be slightly
faster and slightly better in terms of
you know being able to identify error
errors early rather than wait for them
to happen later and the reason why I
wanted to show this is while the the
j'ni way which is using the the actually
say Java age function to create a header
file which is what we we got what we got
here right and then we also built the C
file rights to to support it and using
this mapping you know using the naming
convention essentially well that gets
the job done and this is not how for
example Android its own Jane I layers do
it pretty much all of Android is built
this way instead using C++ files that
you know they not necessarily do much
plus plus per say there's not you know
there's nothing object-oriented here
it's still really pure almost pure CC
code but nevertheless they are able to
pre-register everything and an detect
errors and and run it slightly faster
performance then then if they did it
using the our initial approach so just
coming back to this diagram in this
preview you'll notice that you know if
we do do this do do it this way we
essentially no longer need to do this
anymore and we are now building another
C about a C++ source file the rest of it
obviously remains the same so just to
summarize I mean what we did here is we
just went over a very small you know a
subset of what in the case capable of
but essentially NDK enables J&amp;amp;I Jana
enables us to call into native live
native native code native code is there
to help us you know essentially take
advantage of some legacy code we've
already written or optimized parts of
our application for performance Android
has a whole bunch of api's native API is
that we could take advantage of so if
you scroll over here you'll see actually
all those api's or list of those api's
we could try to use other sorts of
system libraries but these are not
insert guaranteed to be stable and may
change so therefore our code may break
and ultimately you know we should
probably stick to these we also saw that
there are two ways of getting this done
one was to you know a build a native
library indicate native methods compile
it extract the header file implement the
header file create a make file optional
created an application MK file compile
into and name dynamic library using NDK
build then build a client app that
actually uses this new Java class which
then in the you know loads the dynamic
library and completes the picture in
general you should not use NDK just
because you prefer to code in C and C++
it's not the most optimal way of
building Android applications because of
the increased complexity like for
example your applications may become
more brittle because
ray management is no longer done
automatically and of course they may
come become less secure because of the
awesome memory management but ultimately
at least our applications are you know
able to take advantage of code we've
we've might have already written and you
know we may be able to at least hand
optimize code for increased performance
anyway I hope you enjoyed this the code
will be available online I'll post a
link to it and good luck and enjoy
coding and indicate thanks for joining
me
I hope you enjoyed the screencast and
you learned something new about the
Android native development kit and
you'll be able to take advantage of it
in your future project I'm argue to come
to mark on a stream for more educational
tutorials videos screencasts on android
but also other open source technologies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
