to talk about I know probably you all
want to get into use cases sorry into
technology but I want to go to use cases
so we're going to talk about why people
would use wearable technology and use
that as a vehicle to talk about what
technology we've put into the device a
little bit about software and then I
want to do a demo I brought an Elmo so
that I can show you all what the device
looks like and how it functions i also
want to show you our micro app store
which we just launched on wednesday
night so that's hot off the presses and
then we'll come back talk a little
business model and then open it up how
does that sound ok so wearable
technology let's put this on the
spectrum of the technology already own
when you sit down in front of your
television it's typically for multiple
hours at a time and usually only one
session per day you're plopped on the
couch as you are starting to use more
and more devices that are smaller and
smaller the session times decrease but
the number of times you use them per day
increases your smartphone maybe it's
five minutes at a time but 30 times a
day so we think that wearable technology
is the next step in this trend where you
might look at a wristwatch a hundred
times a day but it's only going to be
for three to five seconds at a time
that's the paradigm that we've created
and we're basing this on how we already
use wearable technology specifically in
the watches that have been around for
400 years so the first use case is you
we are all as business professionals
steeped in time everything depends on it
and what we're trying to do with
wearable technology at whim Labs is to
insert
personal data into time so for example
this device is always on I have two of
them here this device is always on we
have a reflective screen in the
background so that whenever you glance
at the device you can always see the
time that is our minimum requirement but
that meant that we actually had to put
two different screens into the device a
reflective screen and when I press and
hold the device a full color backlit
screen we're using a capacitive touch
screen so that this is now an
interactive experience but that only
introduces you to your own data how do
you get the data onto the device we've
put Wi-Fi a Wi-Fi radio and a bluetooth
radio into this device so that you can
connect to the cloud send information up
to the cloud and more importantly pull
information down from the cloud but
we're a multifunctional platform there
are many wearable devices that are
single function and they're beautiful
they're beautiful pieces of hardware
they're very tuned to what their to
their single function where a
multifunction device which means that we
look to you as business professionals
not just in what you want to be using
during your workday but also then what
you want to be doing after work so we
move into the fitness realm specifically
what we've done here is put a lot of
hardware power behind this and a lot of
sensors we have an accelerometer in the
device so we can sense motion a
magnetometer is for compass direction a
GPS obviously for location we put an
asterisk by that the GPS is in every
device but we're tuning the performance
right now in the product that we have
shipping currently but it's modular we
are not a wristwatch company that is not
our ambition the strap is actually for
the most part irrelevant this is what we
create a very very small computer
that you can put in a strap if you
choose but you could put it on a belt
clip and a pendant or you can start to
move away from the body altogether and
as this gentleman is put it on the
handlebars of bicycle what is important
here is not a catchment its access we
want you to have quick access to your
own relevant information so then we have
this gentleman who is without a doubt
posing for the crowd I think he's
flexing on purpose I don't have those
kind of pipes there's a lot of
technology that we have underneath the
touchscreen we have an arm 11 processor
so we're running a full applications
processor that is similar to what many
of you have in your smartphone's right
now and we have a lot of memory in this
device the wim one which is our
developer preview kit ships with 22 gigs
of memory we actually have a micro SD
card in the device so we can go up to 32
if we want to this is not user swappable
because what we've also done is seal the
device so that it's water-resistant now
it's not waterproof this is not it this
is not a diving watch we'd love to get
there we're not there yet but this means
that at least you can wash the dishes
and not have to worry about taking your
consumer electronics off your wrist this
is also we've made it incredibly small
and incredibly light in fact it's so
light that some of the partners that
we've been talking to or in the luxury
watch business say that it's too light
and they asked us to do a separate
version for which we have prototypes in
ceramic simply to increase the heft of
the device because the luxury watch
business heft is equivalent to value so
we actually feel that 22 grams in this
case for some users is not heavy enough
so we've booked it up in some models
there are a couple of different ways to
use the device if we
Wi-Fi in the device you can run this as
an autonomous computer by itself but we
also recognize that almost everybody in
this room also has a smartphone which
has its own set of radios so we have
some software applications that allow
the connection over Bluetooth between
the device and a smartphone to be robust
so we can send information instead of
just going to the cloud from the device
we can send information from the device
to a smartphone for example we have and
I'll show you a demo of this later we
have caller ID SMS coming from the
smartphone to the device we have some
developers who have created using
bluetooth a remote control so from my
whim device I can control my android
smartphone and any application on it we
can also we have another developer who
created an application from a whim
device I can control any application on
my Windows PC so we recognize that the
use case isn't just as an autonomous
computer out in the middle of nowhere
that it's also as one particular device
in a constellation of hardware that you
may have around you hour battery life
right now everything we do when we
architected this product is focused on
battery life this is a tough problem to
solve in such a small device so right
now we're running at about 30 hours in
normal use we can talk about what that
means normal use by the way this is even
us hardcore users in the office this is
typically what we get 30 hours if you're
connected to buy a bluetooth to a
smartphone because the device is always
sniffing and always paired the battery
life comes down a little bit to about 24
hours this means that we have a little
dock give a little paddle charger with
magnetic attachments and a little pins
here that connect to the back of the
device this is the charger and in my
house it sits right next to my cell
phone charger because I charge both of
them at night so that's the technology
wrapped in two use cases let me move
then to talk about the applications that
are running on this and this is
obviously why I'm here we're running
Android natively on this device it is
android 2.1 we're migrating up to up the
up the ladder as fast as we can but
right now that's where we started we
have an sdk we add it we changed some
api and we did that because our device
lacks some of the hardware that you that
the Android operating system is
expecting for example we don't have a
camera so therefore those camera api's
are out we don't have a 3g radio in the
device so we don't have a persistent
connection instead we using Wi-Fi we
have a batch model which means that once
an hour the Wi-Fi radio will spin up
send and receive all the information you
want and then shut back down again that
means that there's we had it we had to
customize that api so that you as
developers could write applications for
that sink model but the key behind a
micro app is even though we're running
android that all of you understand that
the UI needs to be different because
we're running on a smaller screen and
because we're attached to the body all
the time the use cases are different for
why you'd use a nap the feature set
needs to be different so we've coined
the term micro app same technology is
what you have in a smartphone but our
goal is to get developers and users
thinking about applications in a new
category we have a few developers who
took Android smartphone apps change the
api's slightly and put it on the device
and it works there's actually even a
developer who put Angry Birds onto the
device and it works but unless you
reconsider the UI it's not the kind of
user experience
that is ideal for such a small device
it's not a micro experience so we spend
a lot of time at whim labs helping
developers and users understand that
this is not just a smaller than you
smaller Android smartphone that this is
a new category of device that requires
some new thinking okay so the question
was why did we choose Android is the
operating system a couple of different
answers to that the first is the
developer community our device depends
on applications that other people right
our goal is to create an ecosystem
around the product for software and for
hardware we couldn't write all of the
apps from scratch and therefore we
wanted to go where the developers
already work and to use tools that the
developers already understand our SDK is
an add-in to current android development
tools so if you use eclipse still works
that's exactly what you use to create
and a micro application for the women
platform that answer the question that
was that's a big part of the other part
is that a lot of the work to adapt the
libraries and the lower code to our
hardware has already been done we can go
out and find different pieces of code
that helps us adapt this to our chipset
the question is is Android the best
platform so far in our experience yes so
far it is it it might even mean the only
platform that could allow us to do what
we've done I'm not sure we could have
built this product using another
operating system that make sense okay so
this is primarily a data consumption
device you want to take quick glances of
information you don't want to write a
message if you get an SMS we have a
method so that you can just do a pull
down menu and we have a few canned
responses such as I'm going to be five
minutes late if you actually had to use
a letter picker on here to type I'm
going to be five minutes late you're
going to be 10 minutes late it is not
designed for data input so we've created
a companion web service that is that
controls the the device it not just has
it doesn't just have settings for the
general settings for the device itself
but each application can have its own
settings so that any application can
actually do most of the data input up on
the web and then we pull that into the
APK in the application itself yes sir we
do not have voice recognition we don't
have a microphone in the device we're
thinking about that for future versions
but right now there's no room in the inn
the module this box is chock-a-block
full nothing else we could have crammed
in here so that means that for loading
apps onto the device for managing the
device how often it syncs what time zone
you're in for managing any specific
application which cities do I want to
pop up in my weather app what's my
google account so i can connect to my
calendar we point you back to the
website so you can do all of this device
and application management that makes
sense i'm going to show it to you so we
can also you can see
at first hand I think that that puts us
into the demo alrighty so the first
thing to note here is that this is the
reflective mode this is what you see all
day the backlight is not on I haven't
touched it I haven't spun the screen up
this is the view that you can get all
day when I touch the device that's when
I spin up that's when the color screen
comes on the applications processor just
launched we are now running Android and
this is a watch face and the watch face
is also just another Android application
so if you don't like it change it so you
can have large spaces that do whatever
you want them to do and I watch face
actually where I started doesn't have to
show time at all if you don't want and
it can bring data from other places in
the system in this case it's pulling a
calendar event that i have tomorrow
morning at seven-thirty out of
conference call so this is just pulling
right out of my calendar if I didn't
know you say so I timed out and went
into standby mode there and we have
other developers who are already
creating watch faces this is one of my
favorites this is showing you the time
current time what it's doing right here
is ours across the vertical stripe the
horizontal line is minutes past the hour
these are people who are getting
creative with how they want to
demonstrate time to you so you then get
out of the app the watch faces and I'm
now into the applications launcher Oh
pulled that down sorry so we have about
25 applications that third parties have
written from all there's a quick coffee
card this indeed is my Starbucks bar
code so i can pay at starbucks with just
with a flick of my wrist a lot of
different games where people are using
the accelerometer
and the piezo paper and the vibrator in
order to actually do sort of limited
haptic feedback so you can have a game
that can do interesting things they pull
up the calendar here is you here's the
meeting from tonight the the calendar is
we can pull from a google calendar or
from microsoft exchange it out of the
box you just go on the website which
I'll show you in a sec in order to put
your credentials in there but the point
here for the calendar is that this is
what we mean by micro experience this is
my day if I want to go see tomorrow
there it is the day after we're trying
to do something quick as easy as
possible let me show you what's
interesting in here how about there you
go so here's here's the detail for a
calendar entry in the calendar
application you can't add invitees you
can't select the location this is not a
technical limitation we could have
written the application in a way that
you could invite whoever you want to do
in select location but we intentionally
said wait a minute this is a micro app
this is supposed to be a quick glance at
information so you can consume it and
understand it quickly this is not a good
place to actually try and do a lot of
writing here's the weather same thing if
I just go down I get more if I want
different cities I scroll over I've set
up all of these cities on my on my web
page and we're just pulling for Macky
weather so very simple application that
we hope will others whole bunch of
different games on here oh there's that
one somebody was playing around and
wanted to do a mock-up of the google
icon and the time by the way are the
hands in the O's we also have some
people who are joking around with time
and having a nice time for example
carbon and xenon right now their atomic
weights are 654 so this is the current
time but wait that doesn't win the prize
for the geekiest way to tell time the
geekiest way to tell time so far is let
me see if I have it on here we have
pedometer Foursquare check-in here's the
geekiest way to tell time so this is a
QR code that if you scan it with your
smartphone this will return the current
time and you see how it's changing with
every second this is and then when he
goes into reflective mode we update the
reflective mode once a minute so he is
in this case reduce the amount of
seconds I don't know if you could just
tell that the QR code actually got
simpler and then when I touch it again
and we go back from reflective into
active that's when he starts adding
seconds back in again yes well no you
can declare between active and standby
what you want to show in both you don't
actually have to what you show and
standby doesn't have to be the same as
what you show in active it's the same
yes same resolution sorry yes same
resolution 160 560 whether you're
inactive or in standby but what we're
intentionally doing is letting the
developers declare what they want these
used to be here's a mini Ford exchange
application so you can see what currency
rates are the binary watch face which i
thought would have been the geekiest but
no QR code wins the remoter application
is what i can use to control my android
smartphone or by the way anything else
is running Android so from a tablet to
anything else the obligatory Bible
somebody wanted to do that so you can
read it from wherever you are so i'm
going to i want to talk about this one
because this is hilarious listen cracks
me up so there was a developer who is a
consummate technology explorer so what
he did was to create a connection
between the wim device over Wi-Fi to
Xbox Kinect and then he had the xbox
kinect on constant video streaming mode
in infrared in the dark so when anybody
would walk through his basement the Xbox
Kinect would capture the infrared video
send it to the whim device so that it
becomes a remote security monitoring in
the dark and if the person turned
towards the Xbox Kinect the Xbox Kinect
would capture that picture it's a and
and do some facial recognition so it's
stick on their face even if they started
moving around the Xbox Kinect knows our
face so from the wind device you are
looking at exactly who is walking around
your basement and then if you touch the
face of the wim device the Xbox Kinect
box in the middle of your basement set
off an alarm and start screaming and
yelling any attached strobe lights to it
which means that you're going to scare
the hell out of somebody who's walking
through your basement and you can do
this from a flick your wrist wherever
you are he thought that this was an
interesting spy application he was
joking around and I had a talk with him
wait a minute this is a spectacular
advancement in terms of home health care
and remote patient monitoring there are
people who really actually want to have
other people helping them in case they
fall down in the dark and being able to
figure out whether it was who fell down
in the dark and being able to perhaps
even jar them awake or try and wake them
up so this has I think fantastic
applications for going into other
industries here's another application
the guardian angel application and he
took a similar approach and that he is
also streaming video so there it is
right there he can stream video to the
device and he actually he made this
application so anybody who owns a whim
one can go download this application and
try it out so he's streaming video from
a webcam but he's also using the
accelerometer to know if you fallen so
he's measuring the big bump and then if
there is no activity after that he's
known that you'd fallen and he can't get
up and then he is has a back end web
service that
sending an SMS or an email to anybody
who you specify when you set up the
application in other words again he's
getting into remote patient monitoring I
think this is an incredibly powerful
direction for wearable computing so the
question was how does constant use of
the accelerometer affect battery it does
decrease it but we've attached the
accelerometer actually to the
microcontroller so we can allow the
device to go back into standby mode and
still collect accelerometer data now
there are some limitations for how we've
done that so if you actually want to try
and do that with your own application
let's talk about that for the way we've
architected it in a way we want to
architect it in the future but right now
we're allowing the device to go into
standby mode as it is here let me put
this also in another watch face so that
if any of my colleagues at work see this
they won't actually know how much of a
geek I am and show you which watch faces
that I really really liked by everyone
let's do that one there's another watch
base pretty simple I'm just pulling from
the weather app to show what the
temperature is in my hometown and you
had a question yes has a vibrator beeper
and buzzer so a piezo alarm and we
actually just have I think it's not loud
enough we try it we have a developer who
just today created a new application
that allows you to use this device as a
tuning fork he says so hold on I gravis
oh there's a heart rate monitor
application that also will start to do
blood pressure I have known let's see if
this works there it is so he thinks that
that's an E I have no idea so yes piezo
and then a vibrator and the vibrator
without a doubt is strong enough to wake
you up if you leave it attached to your
device and it's even strong enough I
found that if I forget to turn the sound
on when I have an alarm that goes off it
will actually just shaking on my bedside
table wake me up those pins along the
bottom we have 14 pins and so that
people can create different accessories
they can create a watch strap we
published the CAD files already for what
the module looks like so anybody can
create a watch strap right now with the
cat box we also will talk to people
about what these pins do we have USB I
squared C audio out audio in a couple of
dr. tech couple of grounds that should
pretty quickly add up to 14 our goal
here is to allow people to take this
module and to use it as the hub for
whatever new type of equipment you
intend to build so if you for example
want to build a motorized wheelchair
this was a developer that's working on
this motorized wheelchair he knows about
wheelchair wheelchair as he knows about
mechanics he doesn't know about
electronics and he doesn't really want
to learn what he really wants to do is
plug this into the armrest and then
write an Android application to control
the wheelchair from there that's all I
wants to do with this plug it into the
armrest especially if you have battery
power they can give you more battery
means you can if you wanted to leave the
screen on an active mode all the time
you can yes sir okay so the two
different questions the first is can if
you own a whim device could you connect
by a Bluetooth to a smartphone and then
tether it so that the smartphone is
using its own connections Wi-Fi 3g radio
whatever to bring internet data down to
the device yes you can tether this
device so that you can get faster
connections and more persistent
connection through the device at some
point you got to start worrying about
power right is this really the best use
case for the technology we've built so
far so we can have that discussion but
our goal right now is to say yes you can
bring internet data through the
smartphone to the device we also have
for Android and Blackberry phones a
smartphone companion applique
that goes on the smartphone because
android to android we can do a lot of
interesting things so and we're growing
that particular side of functionality
all the time so right now what we're
doing is sending photo caller ID oh
aight ben is this the time we're fed and
you want to call me so what we're doing
is sending photo photo caller Ids if
you're on an android smartphone
connected to the device there's been
calling me right now I'm in the middle
of something so I'm going to send them
to voicemail and that's done but the
point there is that I can receive a
notification it buzzes it beeps on my
wrist if I want to pick it up I can or i
can send it to voicemail what we're
trying to do is allow you to have more
control over the smartphone even if the
smartphone is in your bag or at your
desk so that's the smartphone companion
helps us do that even more robustly if
we're connected on an android or
blackberry smartphone because we can do
more on those platforms the iOS locks
down some of those capabilities the
second question you had was about open
watch and the answer right now is no
we're not we're not working with that
particular open architecture but I love
to talk about it more I think the
question you just asked is if you're let
me try to rephrase it if your device
wind device on your wrist is it is
paired with your smartphone and you
leave your smartphone on the couch and
walk away do we have an application that
will tell you that you just perhaps lost
your phone yes so it is it is a pretty
easy application to really say we're
constantly sniffing and aware of that
pairing and if it breaks unexpectedly
let's alert you now we also have a
feature so that you can turn that
application off in case you get tired of
walking away from your car and all of a
sudden having your risk of grace the
smartphone companion app is one of the
use cases so it's the application that
could go on your Android smartphone in
order to enhance
the connection between this and a
smartphone but without a doubt we do not
view ourselves as a smartphone companion
in fact that's why we're running Android
natively maybe this is me take take as a
question so as always going to prompt me
to talk about other different things
than the in the industry there are a
couple of other devices out there that
are smartphone companion smartwatches
and what they're doing is the Android
smartphone is doing the thinking and
then sending the screen basically the
screen the screen up to the device and
it's a dumb terminal that's a great
model if that's your use case we think
that that is too small of a use case so
no our addressable market is not even
smartphone companion or even SmartWatch
or even I think wearable computing
because you could because of you put
this in a wheelchair and also we're in a
medical devices or you could put this as
the switch on the wall and this is the
smartest switch you've ever had that
could actually run the home network from
here so then we're into embeddable
computing so we think this is a huge
market that's exploding yes sir in the
back I'm so let me let me run through
really quickly again what these pins are
and then we can talk about some of the
specifics afterwards so we have USB and
power it's for audio left right like so
in out we have i squared seat it's
another to we have a couple of grounds
in there and we have some dock detect
pins so that we can know if you are
putting this into one particular device
and therefore that has buttons on it
that you want it to control something
else like the beautiful jam box right so
that starts to get us into into our pins
what I love is feedback from you
afterwards as to whether that's enough
right or whether we need to do more in
order to make this a device that you can
put into almost anything so the question
is do we have NFC and the answer is not
yet would it be worth while I think so
NFC has a chicken and the egg problem
right now and we don't really want to be
either right we would love somebody else
to solve the chicken and egg problem and
then come
afterwards our problem with NFC right
now is sighs we just can't fit anything
else into this box so we look forward to
implementing NFC as we either game or
size or those particular components
reduce in size yes sir in the back the
question was do we consider and plus we
did and we still are the problem with
ANT+ is it's like bluetooth without all
the rules so a couple of developers
start using it started using it for
connecting to for example the heart rate
monitor or the bike a bike monitor for
the front wheel of your bicycle for
cadence most of the bike monitors out
there currently use an plus so yes we're
looking at it and we hope to incorporate
that into our next product on the line
I'm not sure in pluses what is currently
pervasive in the market I think that
will get replaced by bluetooth 4.1
cludes ble you don't think so so right
now we're looking at putting both of
them into the next product and by you
shaking your head I think that you're
saying that's a good thing to put both
of them in there we we were founded
about three years ago by a couple of
sorry
a couple of people who were from Roku
Motorola palm and then our CEO had been
at Intel for a long time and then ran
Rambis which is a technology licensing
company I tell you this because it
actually has matters to the business
model that we've chosen so they started
this about three years ago saying how do
we make wearable technology that is
beyond that not just a SmartWatch but
then goes beyond SmartWatch so that's
when they start three years ago is when
they started figuring out the business
case and starting to do some of the
hardware architecture two years ago is
when they really started adding people
and they raised an a round from Foxconn
which is the manufacturing company that
makes all of the products basically that
everybody in this room is using these
your electronic products the iPhone the
iPad we then we kept building we raised
the b round from Foxconn as well and
they are helping us with manufacturing
so our main the product is manufactured
in Shenzhen China and then we are and
then we just launched our first product
back in November which is the the whim
one developer kit so we started
basically last November with a Developer
Preview kit and the goal is to help
developers and users understand what
wearable technology could be and to help
us understand what all of the different
applications could be we're also a
licensing company you will not see a
product in best buy from whim labs we're
not a consumer products company instead
we work with brands who want to get into
wearable technology and we help them do
that quickly for example they license
this from us we haven't manufactured so
it's not sort of a software or hardware
reference design that we do drive by
licensing and sort of chuck it out the
window and then keep going we actually
say where would you like us to deposit
to drop ship these devices they can
create the strap for them they can
create the back end web site for them
and they can offer them
under their own brand through their own
channels with whatever application suite
they want in some ways that means that
we are the anti apple what we've
intentionally done is allow individual
companies to specify the product that
they'd like to build and therefore to be
the front in front of the consumer with
their own brand they don't have to be
subservient to the hardware brand or the
carrier brand they can be out front and
center with the hardware and our
licensees are in the fitness space the
mobile carriers face the business
professional case the use cases that I
already showed you those are the primary
licensees that we're working with right
now but this is not just for big brands
this also means that smaller software
development companies who thought that
they were forever going to be a
subservient brand that was stuck in the
iTunes App Store can now actually have
their own hardware that goes direct to
their own consumers if they choose so
it's that technology licensing history
from our founders that informs right now
our current business model and this is
why we're a platform company that is
working with licenses as opposed to a
final consumer electronics company so
the comment was have we ever let me can
I paraphrase again what what if we were
to sew this right now is three bits
different pieces of technology a screen
aboard and a battery and you're saying
what if we were just to take out the
board and sell the board and people
could put it in whatever product they
want with a different screen different
place battery someplace else their
sensors I think that's interesting right
now we're just focused on this this is
this is a large enough market and a hard
enough technical problem that we're
sticking to our knitting with this the
question was where could we get this now
so again he's bringing me back on track
what we're doing right now is selling
this for 199 dollars on Amazon so you
can either go to whim calm which i think
i have right up there wimp com which is
where you can or you go straight to
amazon
and that's where you can buy the
developer preview kit that we're trying
we're trying to keep it as fordable as
possible so the developers can then
start experimenting and creating
applications this also means that I know
when I don't want to run a long time Oh
what I kick here is the backend system
on and hit a button they get that here
are the settings for the device right
this is where I can set the time the
date again you don't want to do this on
the device you can turn some different
settings on or off down here at the
bottom is the sync interval that's where
I can deter I can tell it whether I want
to sink every hour every 24 hours or
we're even working now that we have some
devices out in the market we're seeing
how what real usage looks like we're
working on bringing that interval to
shorter periods of time well let me just
show real quick the micro app store so
there are several different watch faces
some people who have done interesting
things around travel some games some
productivity measures a stock ticker
some shopping tools there's a twitter
feed and some fitness related
applications right now this is all free
so we haven't added ecommerce yet to our
store so our first job was to have a
store where people could add
applications if you click Add here the
next time your device sinks the
application will be installed our next
step is to add e-commerce so that people
can charge price charged for the
applications so the question was there
are a lot of different app stores for
Android we need to we had to create our
own store because first of all we curate
the store so we're testing all of the
applications as they go through to
ensure that they're stable and we
haven't seen that from some of the main
Android stores without naming names
right if they
if a brand wants to create a product
with the whim module at its core they
will also be able to take this app store
choose which applications they want in
or out if it's a healthcare focused
device then they can only put in
healthcare focused applications if they
want to I think part of the value is of
the device is being able to have
healthcare applications when you're
focused on health care and then have
everything else when you're not but
that's up to them and then this this
store would appear as though it's coming
from now let me the other piece hold on
SEC the other piece that I didn't show
you that i need that i want to do this
on my device each application has its
own settings so this for example is
where i put in my google user name and
password to authenticate to get my
calendar down to my device so each
application can also have its settings
this is another reason that we couldn't
put our applications into the existing
Android stores because they don't have
this kind of plumbing the question was
when will licensees come to market with
these products we haven't made those
announcements yet and I'm is it a year
two years we hope that it's under a year
yes now what we're on the path and
producing a lot of these devices the
question was do we have a style guide
for the platform we have a full SDK that
is that how people develop and as part
of that we have something called the
micro app guideline which helps people
understand user experience and what they
should expect from the device it is not
particularly well written and I can say
that because I wrote it so we are always
looking to figure out what the actual
developers are finding and what lessons
resonate with them and what lessons I
forgot to include in this micro app
guideline document he has it right there
so my apologies if you're if it's
putting you to sleep yes sir until the
question was can you root it right
okay so we're doing everything we can
not to allow you to root it and I am a
hundred percent sure that you will
figure out ways to do it anyway the plan
the plan right now is and it's sort of
vital to our investors and our business
model that we at our software updates
arrive over the air in the background
and magically appear and that hopefully
we're keeping up enough so that you
don't have to root it but you're going
to do it anyway I actually asked one
gentleman a developer who had routed the
device put ice cream sandwich on it and
then he was the one who ran angry birds
and I sent him a note saying any took a
video of it so its up on YouTube and I
said him a note saying that's incredibly
clever right that's um how'd you do it
and he said there's no way I'm telling
you yeah and then just to taunt me he
said by the way the three different ways
you need to pay attention to for how I
could have done it yeah so he was just
poking at me the typical scenario for
accepting a developer's application it
needs to be technically stable and what
we define that in our my craft
guidelines what does it mean not to
crash how are you make sure that you're
using our AP is we sniff for nefarious
code we have a testing agency that does
a lot of the testing for some of the
other large Android stores out there and
then we prompt you to use the microwave
God lines for user experience but we
don't force that if you want to try and
cram features in here if you want to
read a book on here that's up to you so
we won't force that but we will strongly
suggest but you and I we get on the
phone and I'll try and do my best to
persuade you that maybe that UI is not
the best UI for a micro experience but
that's not a hard-and-fast cut off what
we're trying to do is make sure that if
a user downloads an application that
their device still lasts for the full 30
hours that they're expecting battery
power is key our platform uses our whim
framework so the first thing you need to
do in the
ant manifest is declare that using the
limb framework there are five different
things that you need to do to a standard
Android application to customize it for
the win framework and they're all pretty
simple so no no not every android 2.1
application will work on our device we
do not we unfortunately we took WebKit
out and we're adding it back in because
we took it out because they said wait a
minute if you're in this batch Wi-Fi
sync model then it doesn't make sense
and by the way in putting something
doesn't make sense we took it out
because we couldn't envision the use
case and then we had a lot of developers
who said wait a minute we want to use it
to render so we're adding it back in so
the question was if you have this this
dual application requirement right so
you have one application that runs on
the whim device in another application
that runs on a companion smartphone how
do you specify that we actually have in
the microwave store the remoter app that
does the remote control from a whim
device to an android phone he puts the
link right in the description and he
puts it in the application itself so
we're trying to cue that up but it's
still right now a manual process we look
for there are some interesting things we
think we can do with links and QR codes
but we can't we're not into the phone
right so we're we need to help people
get there but we can't force the app
into them into their phone if you'd like
to develop applications go to wimp com
there there's a link we ask you to
register your email address mostly so
that we can keep you up to date with
when we come out with software updates
sdk updates you download the sdk right
here and you put it right into your
android development tools and you start
going it includes the emulator so you
are off to the races if you then decide
that you need to practice on actual
hardware which i recommend just for
understanding what the UI is like then
it's off to amazon through web com so
everything you need is at whim calm for
you to get into this so the question is
what are some of the things we're doing
for security to weed out i'm
paraphrasing to read out in a farias
code set a good paraphrase where you're
on a couple of different things we've
done on the device we have our own
certificate authority so we are
verifying who you are in order to give
you a certificate so that you can post
apps to our store that's the first step
one of the things we also do is here is
a package manager if somebody tries to
put an application through the store
that is and then it's not it's
incorrectly signed the every time the
dvar if they try and side load an
application onto a device right every
time the device connects to the internet
it checks to see whether the packages on
the device are actually packages that
are authorized for the device so we're
doing this check whenever we connect to
the internet to make sure that this that
we don't have any nefarious code the
other way that we're doing this is
through our testing methodology this
third-party agency is running the apk
and a whole bunch of emulators and on
different types of environments to try
and do it their best to sniff around the
edges to make sure that it's not using
the network incorrectly that it's not
creating services that are thrashing
around that the permissions in the
manifest of the APK or indeed reasonable
permissions and that it's not abusing
those so do what we're doing the best we
can we think on Android and then some in
order to ensure that there's no
nefarious code that is that is that the
could hijack data I would love though to
have a discussion with other people who
need us to go farther so the question
was can you do just as we can do from
your device you can do find my phone the
question is can you do find my whim
that's actually tough given our batch
Wi-Fi model but what you can do is if
your phone is still paired to your whim
device from the phone you could tell the
device to squeal right so that's
especially important because if you
worried right now that your phone gets
lost in the in the couch cushions this
thing this thing I can have a mind of
its own so the question was what if we
were to instead of having the device
with all the hardware and therefore all
the expense in this autonomous device
what if instead we were to focus on
being a smartphone companion piece of
hardware and therefore take out some of
the components that we already have to
lower the price and perhaps get to
your market does that paraphrase the
question you had so wearable computing
is not limited to just being a
smartphone companion and when the first
iPads launched when the first tablet
computers launched people said wait a
minute it's just a big smartphone so
therefore why do I need that I already
have my iphone why do I need something
bigger and I think what we have all
recognized is that when you change the
form factor dramatically the use cases
start to change and these take on a
market of their own so now people have
tablets that are fully featured and
fully powered and they they don't worry
about the fact that maybe there's some
overlapping technology it's the fact
that this now can do different things in
a different form factor what we're
trying to do with our technology isn't
to obviate your cell phone it's to get
into different use cases whether it's
strapped to your body or whether it's in
the arm of a wheelchair or whether it's
a hospital administration where you are
no longer actually expecting to have a
smartphone where you instead you are now
an autonomous wearable computing device
where the user paradigm is now for these
subtle glances of information that isn't
depending upon your smartphone so we can
now branch off and we are now
unencumbered by having to have a
smartphone nearby and we think that that
will introduce us to entirely new
markets and fitness where you don't want
to have a smartphone right you're trying
to actually lighten the load or in
business productivity where your
smartphone maybe is in your pocket or in
your in your in your briefcase and you
want glances of information because your
smartphone is now a cacophony of
information that it's overload where you
just want a glance of the things that
are most important to you very quickly
and subtly so we think that the use
cases for wearable technology take us in
a different direction than something
that's just tethered to a smartphone and
that this by itself is a new blossoming
sector that we're attempting to
penetrate and to to explore
let me sense did I wrap it in a bow yeah
all right thank you very much for having
me I appreciate it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
