essentially to describe some of the
research we've been doing for a number
of years around a variety of programming
languages Java among them can I get to
show the hand hands who in this room
knows what an industry analyst is and
what we do that's pretty difficult so
that's about three hands maybe four so
basically what we do is we do we
research software we research trends we
research programming languages we gather
as much data as we can and we try to
figure out you know based on where
things have been where things are now
and most importantly from from our
perspective at red monk what all of you
think of technologies what you're using
why you're using it what works what
doesn't and we attempt to extract from
that ideas as far as where things are
headed so what I wanted to do today was
two things so first of all trace as the
title describes essentially the rise and
fall and subsequent rise of Java when I
say java I'm primarily talking about
well for the most part during this
presentation will be talking about the
language but I'll be referring to the
platform as well but just as importantly
to try to extract from that a couple of
lessons as far as you know things that
the wider java community of which you
guys in the room are certainly
representative an idea of you know how
you might improve things how you might
continue to grow how you might push
towards greater ubiquity and growth over
time so you know the rise I probably
don't need to describe too many of you
because many of you have lived it I'm
sure some of you are familiar with the
history the project began as a stealth
project at Sun Microsystems in 1990 it
was certainly not conceived to do all
the things it does today like so many
pieces of technology and in fact it's
its first actual prod
act was a as a cable box operating
system this was you know it was sort of
pitch for this I think it was time
warner and it failed it did not get that
contract this is I think in 92 94
however the web blows up a whole bunch
of things happen all at once 1994 1995
were very big years in technology
industry which see the introduction of
pieces Netscape Navigator 1994 mysql
apache in a whole range of other
subjects in 1995 and you know really the
history from a Java perspective reflects
that so for a long time tob was I'm
swimming somebody in the room have
looked at the tob rankings anybody okay
we got a couple hands so for many years
t.o.p was the only sort of the only
outfit that was tracking programming
language popularity programming language
interest and so on so I don't know if
you can make the make up the chart here
it's pretty small but the basic ideas is
that in 1996 java was by there sort of
rankings and by their metrics the six
most popular language in existence and
ten years later was number one interv
beyond that I mean yes it's number one
yes it sort of performs well on on this
particular metric but you know the
really important thing you know for the
industry as a whole is that javis band
this tremendously large ecosystem and
again I'm not going to I'm not going to
dwell on this many of you have benefited
from this many of you in fact we're a
part of it but we're talking hundreds
thousands of applications we're talking
hundreds of businesses some of you know
which were very small some of which were
very large and this was the ecosystem
that was spawned you know by this
project the stealth project as was
called serve initially and again none of
this was anticipated it grew into this
effectively de facto duopoly all right
so for many years if you were building
software business you sort of officially
had two choices you had
the Microsoft ecosystem where you had
the Java ecosystem now many of you
probably know that that was never
actually true there were a whole bunch
of other things that were going on under
the covers that subsequently had been
exposed but for the most part you know
if you were building an application it
was going you know most likely going to
be part of one of those two ecosystems
so this was the rise so from its
inception in 1990 you know through the
mid part of the last decade you know
Java was the biggest ecosystem on the
planet you know simply because relative
to Microsoft it had many many more
commercial participants who were able to
actively build out that ecosystem and
make it sort of the phenomenon that we
all know today the fall you know came
sort of gradually the fall came
gradually enough in fact that many of
the people you know even involved in the
project many other people involved in
the ecosystem probably didn't you know
feel it at the time you know it was
subtle enough and you know essentially
not obtrusive enough that it really took
some people by surprise in spite of the
fact that the signs were there so one of
the arguments that you might have heard
made thoroughly in recent years you know
there are people who compare Java to
cobalt alright so COBOL still exists it
was just actually ported to new version
as the mainframe so it's going strong at
powers you know critical applications
all of the world it is all of that said
probably not the most dynamic and
refreshing environment for people to
program in so that comparison is one
that typically rankles Java people but
at least on the age front there is some
truth to it all right so there's a
company called stat wing they make a
essentially an online analysis tool and
what they did is it they ingested a data
set a survey of 10,000 developers that
was done by the folks from Stack
Overflow how many of you in the room you
stack overflow okay that's most of you
so you know Stack Overflow you you have
a general sense that populations
obviously well primarily if not a wholly
developer centric
and you know really what they found was
that there is a statistically
significant correlation between age and
Java now it's week you can't you you
can't what that means is that you can't
look at this and say okay because
somebody is X age that means they use
Java but there is a statistically
significant correlation and that
correlation says that the older you get
the more likely you are to use Java so
on the one hand that's great you know
there's years and years of experience
that means you have a sort of deep
talent pool to draw from on the flip
side it's not as good because it means
that you know sort of the young people
coming into the industry are not as
likely to be using the platform or the
language and you know one of the things
that sort of people you know when we've
talked to businesses that are in the
Java ecosystem you know for a while you
know they'll sort of push back and say
well you know look our numbers are
really good compared to things like C
and C++ you know we look great and in
fact it is true so this is data from ole
OH ole Oh basically for those of you who
are unfamiliar with them is run by the
folks in Black Duck basically they go
out and index open source projects you
know really that are publicly exposed so
they don't have good visibility into the
enterprise where job is strong but they
do have a good sense for in the sort of
increasingly wide world of code that's
available on the web who's using what
and more specifically within those
trends where are they headed what are
the trajectories so what you can see
here is if you go in and look at the
commits and this is over a multi-year
period you know for Java versus C and
C++ Java actually performs reasonably
well right I mean it never matched the
heights from a commit perspective that C
and C++ saw but at the same time it has
not experienced the dramatic drop-off in
growth basically what this says is that
you know the Java ecosystem from a
commit perspective has been strong for
quite some time and remain so so you
know this is again it's it's a very
valid piece of push back that we get
from
you know from essentially people who
want to defend the job ecosystem the
difficulty is is that if you compared to
some newer platforms it doesn't sort of
compare as well now you have to take
into account here the growth is a very
relative thing you know the way that we
explain this is that it's much easier to
double my income if my income is five
hundred dollars in it that it is if it's
five billion dollars alright so growth
needs to be taken you know not sort of
as an end-all and be-all but at the same
time what we're seeing from a variety of
platforms you know JavaScript probably
the most notable lately is dramatic
growth in terms of the overall commit
volume so you know the you know servitor
then static performance of java commence
overtime is a little bit more troubling
you know you're not seeing some of the
same growth that you're seeing from
emerging platforms and you know it's not
just in terms of the total commits this
is the these are the olo numbers for
monthly contributors and the interesting
thing is is that you know one of the
last times I talked about this this
subject in terms of tracing the arc of
where Java has been and where it's going
was in 2010 and JavaScript hadn't passed
it yet so you know when we reran these
numbers and looked at them it's it's
sort of interesting and potentially
troubling from a Java perspective to see
the JavaScript at least for a monthly
key of the monthly contributors that olo
has visibility into is now a more
popular platform than Java and we see
exactly the same data when we look at
the monthly projects you know so the
total volume of projects that olo is
tracking again you know we see sort of
decreased traction from the Java side
and increased traction from platforms
like JavaScript now it's not just the
data that has been telling us that you
know there are some changes going on in
the Java ecosystem you know that it's
not just the sort of data making the
case that job is quote/unquote in
decline analysts have been making this
case for a couple years many of you may
have seen these reports this is from
Forrester this is a gentleman by the
name of Michael
Terry wrote a piece Java is a dead end
for enterprise application development
this was in 2010 his colleague later
followed up John rhymer followed up and
believe that was in what 2011 and
basically you know what you're seeing
then from from application analysts is
skepticism skepticism of the future of
Java skepticism of the future of the
platform skepticism of the future of the
language and they're looking at some of
the same data sources that we are but
they're also you know involved in
talking businesses talking to businesses
about their usage so they're coming to
conclusions that suggest yes you know
hey the platform is in decline which
obviously is implications for everybody
in the room you know other events you
know certainly have have not helped
matters many of you probably remember or
actually still read about you know the
ongoing appeals around the Oracle and
Google litigation this you know from our
experience as I'll show you in just a
moment had a chilling effect in terms of
interest and participation in the Java
platform for a couple of reasons you
know first of all raised questions as
far as our my skills can be transferable
from you know the Java world over to
this mobile world of Android or Google
going to be forced to completely redo
that platform it also raised questions
about sort of the nature of warchol and
you know the nature of their stewardship
so what we begin fielding from
developers you know which are the it's
the audience that we care about most the
audience that we believe is going to in
the majority if not all cases dictate
the future of technology was profound
concern you know so we have a system
called red monkey analytics in part what
it does is is that it looks at what
developers query our content right so we
make you know we produce research we
make that research available for free on
the web and then we watch what
developers do with it we watch the
interest they have you know we watch
their concerns we watch their queries
some of which actually are quite amusing
but in this case you know really that
the a couple of the top concerns and
this is for the entire county of year
2010
senator on oracle and google so the fact
that this sort of occupied so much you
know sort of attention sucked up so much
oxygen in terms of the conversation
around java and the conversation around
the java ecosystem is not a good thing
and likewise you know we saw you know a
great number of issues you know
associated with the sort of ongoing
strife between oracle and some of the
the open source communities most notably
apache so you know you combine all these
things and any one of them in and of
itself isn't a big deal but it they
become a bigger deal in the context of
language fragmentation right so as we
talk this is sort of a concept that a
lot of people kind of struggle with what
we mean by this is actually pretty
simple you know if as sort of we talked
about earlier the de facto standard for
most businesses for a very very long
time was that you're using probably one
of 22 languages probably something in
java probably something in microsoft and
you know some combination in make cases
you know if not you know sort of
strictly one of the other that's no
longer the case and that hasn't been the
case for a long time you know the fact
is is that if you go around to any
enterprise now they are likely to be
using any one of a dozen languages you
know they're using different languages
because they're different tools to solve
different problems you know some of
these languages you know may in fact be
based on the JVM you know I came in to
the tail end of this last discussion you
know talking about Scala and ceylon and
groovy and things of that nature but you
know the fact is is that many of them
are using languages have nothing to do
with job at all right you know we're
talking about things like Ruby Python
Perl JavaScript PHP the fact is is that
Java the language faces far more
competition than it did a decade ago
because we no longer have that sort of
artificial duopoly of you need to use
this application or you need to use that
application developers are now making
choices for themselves because they can
and not surprisingly when you have a
group of individuals making individual
choices there are a lot more of them
being
made so that's all sort of doom and
gloom that's all the decline that's all
the bad news but what about the rise you
know this is something that you know
with all due respect to my sort of
analyst colleagues I think it's missed
and I think it's lost because people
focus on the wrong pieces they don't
look at the bigger picture they don't
look at sort of what's going on in the
larger context all right because from
where we said when we talk to developers
their stroll a tremendous amount of
interest and a tremendous amount of
vitality in the java community and that
gets lost and that doesn't necessarily
translate so as an example this is an
eye chart you're not meant to read it
has anybody seen these graphs before
okay we got a handful of hands basically
what this is is these are we do language
plots once a quarter we haven't run the
numbers for q2 yet so this is q 1 but
basically this is based on research done
by a couple data scientists drew Conway
at John miles white and ultimately what
it does is it compares two communities
all right so on the one axis you know we
have github on the other axis we have
stack overflow because what they decided
was that they wanted different
communities they didn't want to for
example just reliant get hubs assessment
of hey what languages are popular
because in spite of github size you need
some checks and balances you need some
representation for different communities
and in spite of the fact that github and
stack overflow are you know have a huge
amount of overlap in terms of users and
you know are aimed at the same audience
in terms of developers you actually see
a lot of individual differences between
them you know there's actually quite
stark differences between them excuse me
Ruby for example performs very well in
github it tends to perform slightly less
well on stackoverflow c-sharp on the
other hand possibly has an artifact the
fact that the founders of stack overflow
were themselves out of the Microsoft
development tradition tends to have C
sharp perform much more strongly so what
we see is 22 communities that are very
very
developer focused that attract an
enormous amount of attention and time
from developers and yet exhibit some
sort of slight differences so what we
sort of rely on them for us to be
somewhat predictive as i said before
we're believers that developers are
defining sort of the next steps for
technology what all of you in the room
use will have a stronger say in sort of
the future of the Java language in the
future the Java platform than anything
analysts like myself say you know we
take our cues from you we don't try to
set those cues because ultimately you
guys are the ones who are empowered you
know as far as setting the technical
direction so when we try to draw our
conclusions from what you're using we
turn to behavior we turn to usage so in
the get in a case of github we r you
know looking at effectively what code is
being sort of maintained in public
repositories and what languages is that
written it on the case of stack overflow
on the other hand we're looking at
commentary we're looking at the volume
of commentary around particular
languages we do that through tagged
volume so what we end up with is a plot
which basically just correlates the
rankings in each of these two
communities and what drew and and John
found is the same thing that we've found
is that the correlation is exceptionally
strong so their correlation I think when
they ran the first iteration is plot was
point seven eight if anything it's
gotten stronger over time last couple of
additions I think have been pointing at
1.8 2 and what that means is that you
know almost eighty percent of the
variation in sort of one side of this
graph can be attributed to changes in
the other side of the graph it means
that more often than not they line up
but the bigger finding you know from our
perspective was ultimately as I said you
can't see it here if you google Redmont
programming language rankings you'll
find these was that the languages
ultimately separate themselves out into
tears so you know at the upper right
hand corner of the graph you have a
small tier of sort of what we consider
to be tier 1 languages a little bit
further down from that you have a sort
of larger
grouping of what we consider to be tier
two languages there's roughly a sort of
group of tier 3 and tier 4 languages and
the interesting thing from the
perspective of all of you in the room is
that Java has never not been included in
that tier one of the first grouping of
languages but more importantly has never
really been outside of the top couple
and again in github and stack overflow I
mean these are exactly legacy properties
right you know these aren't exactly the
kinds of properties that are sort of
reflective of enterprise tendencies you
can't argue that github or stack
overflow are strictly representative of
quote-unquote enterprise Java
development because they're not and that
Java tends to perform very well it has
you know historically in continues to
and just as strongly again you can't
make it out in this chart you have a
number of other languages that run on
top of the JVM most notably scale-out
which is sort of slowly inching up to
the top of the second tier that are you
know also included in not the first year
of popularity they're not in there with
a JavaScript Java Python PHP Ruby etc
but they're quite popular and they're
quite you know they're not ubiquitous
but they performed very well in both
environments and again this is a rare
thing so the point to sort of take away
here is is that even if we're looking at
communities in github and stack overflow
that we consider to be predictive that
we consider to be reasonably
representative of where things are
headed and what sort of the developers
who are driving things forward use Java
performs well which may not be what you
know you might expect if you're just
looking at sort of raw commit numbers
jobs i'm sure many of you have seen
these in sort of various pieces of
analysis this is just trends from indeed
com indeed com is effectively a search
engine that sort of munge is a variety
of or indexes rather a variety of
different job related sites and you know
can give you trends in terms of the
demand for particular technology the
demand in this case for particular
languages and this is the absolute chart
so this you know sort of measures the
absolute number of jobs as opposed to
the
to growth rate but the point is is that
as popular as all these other languages
you know that we talked about might
appear you know particularly the hot
languages JavaScript PHP Ruby Python etc
none of them approach the number of jobs
that are available for Java and none of
them appear sort of headed on a
trajectory as we saw in the commit
volume where they're likely to so you
know the point here is obviously quite
simple is basically that you know when
we look at sort of job data when we look
at the available employment data
basically what we see is a robust and
sort of sustained job market for Java
technologies and again this this really
hasn't changed as long as we've been
doing these analysis so it seems a
little bit weird to us to suggest that
enterprise application is dead you know
for you know or at least enterprise
application using Java and yet the job
market remains robust and is outpacing
languages that might be considered in
some context to be replacements for Java
you know we we can't really square those
particular conclusions likewise we have
lists traffic if any of you seen mark
mail we got the idea actually from some
of the some of you guys may know della
bore topic he took a look at this years
ago I can't remember how many it is now
probably at least three or four and he
was looking at sort of comparative
mailing lists traffic so what Mark male
does is that they ingest email traffic
from a variety of open source projects
you know so they you know these these
lists are public they make them
available mark mail goes out sucks them
all in and can obviously plot you know
the distribution of frequency of traffic
on these lists in terms of the number of
messages being sent sort of back and
forth and you know there are obviously
any number of query terms we could use
for Java but I wanted in this case to
look specifically at the OpenJDK
communities so this is nothing more if
you go to mark mail org if you go in and
into sort of a query just for OpenJDK
this is what you'll see and we actually
saw similar patterns for a couple of
other sort of Java related projects
and again what this indicates to us you
know aside from the performance on
stackoverflow aside from the performance
on on github aside from the performance
and jobs is that there is continued
discussion and growing discussion more
importantly of you know java the project
so these are the kinds of things you
know when you start putting these
together it really challenges in our
views for the notion of the decline but
the biggest thing from least from my
perspective as an analyst which really
kind of you know throws into throws into
question you know the the sort of
supposed idea that this is a dead
language is the fact that developers
keep using it for projects all right so
in some of these cases of course you
know these projects are very old you
know the eclipses Eclipse project
actually i think is what a six months
older i think than we are as a firm so
they've been around for a decade so okay
fine that's not a recent choice and so
on but when we look at projects you know
Hadoop is just a couple of years old
cassandra is even younger than that you
know neo4j likewise what we see you know
in these projects Jenkin hudson what we
see in all these projects is that
developers continue to to choose java
and not because an enterprise forced
them to not because they had to not
because somebody else made that decision
for them they chose it because it was a
good solution to the problem that they
had and you know from from my
perspective as long as developers
continue to make these choices in terms
of building key pieces of our
infrastructure moving forward you know
the Hadoop ecosystem at this point is
enormous as long as these projects are
still being built on Java again I I
can't build the case that it's a dying
platform I certainly can't build the
case it's the platform in decline you
know this is again a platform that sort
of you know points to continued growth
but what about from a sort of company
perspective and i don't mean sort of the
enterprise you know the you know
traditional fortune 50 fortune 100
business you know who has extensive
investments in java what about a company
you know a company that has started more
recently and has the opportunity to make
you know basically clean slate
decisions they tend to make some similar
choices anybody know this is if you're
from that company don't cheat okay
somebody your cheats anyhow so these are
the open source projects from netflix if
you go to the netflix open source
developer page what you'll find is a 23
pages of these these are projects that
netflix is built for itself subsequently
made available as open source they have
camera but what the actual project total
is these are 20 that are based in java
all right and that is the overwhelming
majority of projects that are written
there and even a couple of the other
ones asgard most notably that are not
written in java are written in things
like Ruby you know they were on top of
the JVM so the point here is is that
even when you have a you know an
organization that is cutting edge an
organization that is an organization
that's successful enough that many of
you may have heard this before netflix
on any given sort of weekday night is
responsible for 130 the internet traffic
in the united states all right so
they're operating at a scale that very
few businesses are and what is their
choice for the projects that they're
running to maintain that infrastructure
to test that infrastructure in the case
of simian army to essentially try to
tear that infrastructure a park you know
for testing and so on purposes they
choose java all right so this is a
choice again that netflix could have
made they could have picked a variety of
different languages and they didn't so
again you know really from our
perspective undermines you know the case
that the job is in decline in android
you know for all sort of the legal
issues surrounding it and i'm sure many
of other people in the room might have
an opinion on that subject whatever that
impending might be one way or another
the fact is is that android has
introduced java they were introduced at
least the principles and the semantics
of java to an entire new generation of
developers a generation developers that
isn't necessarily concerned with things
like eclipse isn't as
really concerned you know with things
like it do but they just want to build
an app you know they want to build an
application for the you know hundreds of
Android devices that are out there
running right now so basically what we
have is a language which as we've seen
you know is sustaining you know
certainly it's its position from a
popularity perspective at least
according to metrics we see a language
which is growing its mailing lists
traffic we see a language that is you
know continually employed by core
infrastructure projects whether those
are in a sort of your typical multi
organizational open source or whether in
the case of Netflix they're primarily
offered by one company and now in
Android you see sort of the relevance of
Java you know back on devices and again
it's sort of ironically come full circle
because if you remember from the outset
you know it was intended originally to
power cable set-top boxes in Time Warner
reportedly rejected it because it
offered too much control to users and
Android you know all these years later
is still offering that choice to users
and in the process of doing that it's
bringing Java to you know literally tens
of millions if not hundreds of millions
of customers worldwide and then lastly
if you remember the this I thought was a
very interesting piece if you remember
that the survey that we looked at
earlier that indicated that you know
basically you you had sort of a
increasing probability of using Java the
older that you got you know they they
surveyed they being sort of stack
overflow survey 10,000 developers and
the interesting thing is of that study
almost one in three we're using java in
some form or fashion so again you know
when you survey 10,000 ran to developers
from stack overflows perspective and you
get almost one and three you know 31 and
change % you know who are on top of the
platform i'm not really sure how that's
a dying platform i'm not really sure how
you build that case it doesn't make
sense you know has the language peaked
you know from a popularity perspective
you know will java ever be at you know
again as popular sort of on a relative
basis as it was is it ever going to
keep I the type of market share that it
did 10 20 years ago when it had less
competition no java in that sense is
piqued a job will never again it'll be
that popular never again be sort of that
central but everything is relative right
the evidence from our perspective again
you know we drive this home sort of over
and over and over again because we hear
sort of the opposite over and over and
over again is that the the evidence from
our perspective simply doesn't support
the claim the job is dead you know job
is no longer as popular as it was but
Java is very very popular indeed you
know and you know given the sort of
context and the time limits for this
particular slot you know we chose not to
go through every last piece of data but
I can tell you if you want to build the
case you know the Java is you know
continues to grow if you want to
continue you know if you want to build
the case that javis trajectory continues
to be up it's really pretty easy to find
that data because there's a lot of it so
as I said at the outset you know that we
had two goals for this particular talk
the first was to trace the rise the fall
and the rise of Java but the second was
to try to give you guys some ideas to
try to give you guys you know sort of
some thoughts in terms of things it
might be good to see things that might
continue to ensure growth and you know
there were a couple different sort of
examples that I'll point to and this is
one that you know to to pee I guess
candid Java certainly has not always
absorbed this particular lesson all that
well easy in most cases tends to win
over complex even in cases where
technology you know you are sort of an
inferior technology so you know one
example that I use all the time sort of
trying to illustrate you know the
question of convenience is I you know I
talk about postgres so many of you
probably use postgres in the mid part of
the last decade I had a conversation
with some people from the postgres
community and their question to us as
analysts was why are we so much less
popular than mysql you know we have a
better product
x you know we're more performant and we
have all these wonderful features that
MySQL doesn't have and while it's not
this simple you know one of the things
that we had to point out to them is you
know we said okay hey look developers
are increasingly picking their own sort
of linux distributions and you know the
trajectory from our perspective is clear
they're going you know they're headed
towards debian-based distributions and
in fact we believe that to be the case
today and you know we asked the
post-grad team at that point you know
hey you know how do you install postgres
on top of debian and then came back and
said well you know hey we're not in
repositories because of these other
issues but it's not a big deal if you go
to the website you know you downloads
package you build it and you're off and
running and you know we had to sit there
and say hey like that's the point right
that's the problem if I have a choice as
a developer you know I'm trying to do 90
different things and you know I want to
implement something quickly and I have a
choice between two databases that are
probably going to do what I need them to
do at least in the short term and I can
stall one of them on the command line
because you know a single command it
will go download fetch it install it and
do some basic configuration and more
importantly now maintain that package
for me over time so I don't have to go
back and update it myself or i can pick
something that i have to go to website
download manually build and install i'm
probably going to pick the easier one
now you can talk to me all you want
about how much better your features are
how much you know how technically
superior your project is but at the end
of the day that's not going to matter at
least in initial adoption scenarios you
know when you get into huge production
projects and everybody watch the
benchmark it's obviously a different
scenario but particularly from a from in
the early days the ease-of-use matters
and you know one of the other examples
we point to here is Mongo so again many
of you have probably encountered Mongo
many of you may have strong opinions one
way or another on Mongo but what we
talked about with Mongo is ultimately
that it's it's almost taken sort of the
MySQL proposition that much further I
mean yes it's in all these you know
distributions it's all these
repositories so yes you can install it
very easily but it's more than that
you know basically the this sort of
promised for Mongo and we hear this all
the time for developers why do you use
it have you bench marked it did you know
did you hear this horror story that
somebody wrote about it losing data and
so on and they say yes I heard that it's
unfortunate I hope it doesn't happen
probably well at some point but it's
just so damn easy it's just so simple
you know really i download it i unzip it
we're done there's no schema you know
there's no bindings I'm just j signing
things that in and out of it from you
know really the minute it gets there so
these matter you know this sort of lack
of friction matters you know and these
are the kinds of things that you know
otherwise you know technologies
otherwise probably don't seem to have
that much in common do you know so we've
talked about sort of the MySQL example
but Amazon Web Services is another
perfect example of this sort of tendency
at work there's a piece going around
today I think it was written yesterday
the day before about you know Amazon's
performance and price performance and
you know how it's subpar it doesn't
compare to the dedicated hardware and so
on but the fact is is that it's just
easier it's just easier it's faster you
know and you know the example that I
talked about here i have a friend of
mine who works for a fortune 100
organization he runs infrastructure he
comes back to me he's been sort of
working nights and weekends six months
you know trying to improve their
provisioning time and he comes in he's
all excited and says this is great and
we improve the the provisioning time
about order of magnitude as I God's
that's great what did it go from he said
well it used to take us weeks that's
like okay that's that's pretty bad but
certainly not unheard of what is it now
its head it's awesome we can usually do
it in the same day not always but
usually you know I had to sort of take a
step back and say that that's great but
you may want to kick off another one of
those six months projects because the
expectation now isn't same day the
expectation now is 90 seconds it's that
convenience that trumps just about
everything else and again this is not
the kind of thing that historically Java
has tended to do well many of you I'm
sure have I should we have anybody in
the room was responsible for the DL J
licensing
okay you know many of you in the room
probably have experienced some of these
yourself you know they couldn't get java
in too many Linux repositories because
licensing incompatibilities and so on
you know that the some of the folks at
son tried to jump through a lot of Hoops
to make that happen so there have been
efforts to improve in this regard but as
you move forward as you want to sort of
build grow improve the java community
this is one of the things that i would
point to you know try to remember that
the it's not the technology in many
cases it's going to make the decision
it's how easy it is to use how easy it
is to access and that gets completely
lost you know people ask you know why
did you know PHP when sort of the web
war over Java you know what you know in
spite of you know some of the best
efforts of companies one of the answers
was simple PHP was everywhere you could
get it on any server of any type
anywhere you know we talked to Tucson a
long time ago and said hey look we've
looked at you know the top 20 web host
has defined you know in this sort of
shootout and only three of them are
offering Java and two of those are only
offering it you know under manage boxes
you can't get sort of a low cost you
know Java environment so no surprise it
didn't get used as much so really think
about easy really think about
frictionless access and so on frameworks
likewise matter and they matter a lot
you know one of the things that you know
we've looked at in the red bunk top five
in this again is these are the q1
numbers in the red bunk top five you
know this is sort of a rough ranking and
frankly that the actual placement isn't
nearly as important but this is sort of
interesting to us you know in this trend
extends well into the top ten what we
see from a lot of the emerging languages
is that they tend to be dragged along in
many cases by a framework by a popular
framework that solves a problem and you
know they do this you know sort of in
part by providing sort of a center of
gravity providing an area of focus and
you know when we look at Java when we
compare it it's tough you know this is
the top 20 this is a
an article from this past fall this is a
graph you know trying to compare the
relative merits of the top 20 web
frameworks for java you know for the JVM
you know top 20 now think about think
about it from the perspective of a
customer if you're a customer you have a
website you want to build it you know a
lot of customers and even a lot of
developers going to look at this and say
all right i'm going to use rails i'm
going to use Django or if I want to use
Java all right I need to do an
evaluation of the top 20 frameworks you
know that that choice is difficult you
know it's a great book by the a guy by
the name of Barry Schwartz called the
paradox of choice and if you go to
believe this is still true that a week
or two ago if you go to Java source net
and you look at open web frameworks I
think it's 67 web frameworks are listed
right so the point here isn't go out and
destroy all these other frameworks go
out and destroy you know the sort of
diversity that the Java world has come
to be known for but the point is
basically that you know as you move
forward as you want to encourage a usage
volume adoption so on you need to think
about these questions you need to think
about trying to reduce or simplify the
choice because at the end of the day the
people who are you know have to make
that choice right now probably don't
care very much they want an easy answer
they wanted to be fast and then lastly
frameworks are evolving you know some of
you who have you know who in the room
have probably had experience with some
of the heavier weight Java frameworks
java j2ee and you know which became je
and so on was you know obviously a super
heavy framework I used to have to chart
my cube you know it was 3 by 4 and
eating a magnifying glass to read it
that that's changing right we're moving
away from those huge heavy weight
frameworks that solved every you know
gnome problem you know and spring was
sort of one of the first trends there
you know try to simplify some of the
tasks the Java world but then it was you
know really frameworks like rails you
know which you know came along and said
all right yeah there's a bunch of things
we can do we're going to solve one
problem we're going to build web
applications we're going to do that well
we're going to do a fast and you know
that continue this sort of multi-year
trajectory towards smaller frameworks
and you know we've even seen sort of you
know recently you know the continued
evolution into micro frameworks so
things like spark bottle flask you know
all of these very very tiny very very
lightweight frameworks are now being
used to compose applications they're
being used sort of discreetly as as sort
of more minimal crutches than the
heavier weight frameworks that they're
being used sort of in comparison to so
while there has been some sort of
incorporation of this in the Java world
you know as you move forward looking at
frameworks this is one of the things
that would encourage all of you to take
a very very serious look at and then you
know sort of obviously there are a lot
of evolutions from a functional
standpoint one of the most important
recently I'm sure you've all heard if
not used nodejs you know a synchronicity
this is one of the things we had all
sorts of people coming back to a saying
wise note so popular why are people you
know looking at it so on it's just
another framework and the answer is it
really wasn't just another framework it
certainly wasn't the first asynchronous
framework there's lots of things that
predated market twisted and otherwise
but the fact is is that this is one of
the first really popular frameworks that
came along and said yeah we're going to
do things very differently we're going
to essentially embrace the asymmetry and
enable different types of applications
and by design that's actually going to
make us worse at some applications you
know very much like you know you see
people trying to shoehorn rails into
standard applications instead of try to
be on the websites it doesn't work but
the point here is basically that they're
not trotting out the same application
framework over and over and over again
expecting to be successful they're not
just cloning existing frameworks they're
trying to do something fundamentally
different than trying to do something
new so again as you're out there you
know think about how frameworks have
typically evolved so when you build
interesting applications if there are
interesting pieces of them that you know
you continue to build over and over you
know like rails was extracted from what
was at base camp i think at 37signals
django was extracted from the website
from the Lawrence Lawrence Rael bulletin
you know look at the applications you're
building there maybe
sort of really interesting frameworks
that can come out of them but again try
to look around and try not to create yet
another one and yet another one and yet
another one and add to that the problems
of choice that we just mentioned and
with that I have one minute left to take
any questions you might have that's a
great question so the question
essentially is is that the the AP
curriculum sort of shifted to Java 15
years ago so you know how do we sort of
account for you know the differences in
age you know effectively how do we
account for the fact that look if you
take AP Computer Science you need to be
using Java but we see less you know sort
of kids using it you know I think there
are probably a lot of different answers
to that but basically what it comes down
to is that you know curriculum
unfortunately we did a sort of analysis
of this not too long ago in terms of you
know looking at the the you know sort of
curriculum compared to the sort of the
available jobs you know we just scanned
I think was the top 15 or 20 university
curriculum you know from a Forbes list
that was online and they're not terribly
reflective of the man they're not
terribly reflective of you know where
things are curriculums tend to be very
dated and therefore you know in our
experience students depend less on them
you know so a lot of them certainly will
have been exposed to Java a lot of them
you know will certainly have you know
receive some Java training along the
line but very few of sort of
particularly the cutting edge guys today
are relying sort of entirely or heavily
on on their school education there
instead supplementing that with actual
experience in terms of you know coding
open source projects you know sort of
internship work and in some sort of you
know increasing number of cases it's
difficult to say how many you know
through you know very alternative
channels in terms of MOOCs and other
online learning opportunities and with
that I think I'm out of time so I just
want to say thank you very much it's
been great and I'll be around for a
little while if people of other
questions
