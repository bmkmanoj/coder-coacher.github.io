I guess y'all you're not tired of me yet
willing to check to the basement I
wonder what that Mason's did down here
huh um yeah my name is Kelsey go more in
us I am a programmer I do want to say
that specifically because I'm giving to
like soft talks here I write code for a
living um this is all stuff that I have
learned and researched as a citizen like
yourself it's not a specialty of mine so
who here makes tech for money we here
programs for money I do ok cool who here
um writes coder make stuck at a tech
company anybody okay who here uses
products programmed at a tech company
awesome does anybody pay money for
products program data tech company maybe
you've a github subscription or
something yeah ok so like money money
money tech company tech company tech
company um I want to say those words
because what I'm gonna be talking about
today is where that money comes from and
where it goes so the model today for
tech companies to make money in large
part is to start small and to solicit
investment large investment from
institutional and also just sometimes
individual investors the way that they
make money is what we call an exit event
which also sounds like something an
asteroid does but generally that refers
to an initial public offering on a stock
market or a sale of the company to a
bigger company both of those things
generate a lot of cash where that cash
goes is the profits are split between
shareholders in the company sometimes as
our employees early employees but
usually they're mostly those investors
who invest it early and the peep the
investors have given the people who make
the products money in exchange for a
fraction of the ownership and we call
early investors venture capitalists
which also sounds like something out of
an action movie I don't know why I
venture I think that's to do with
risk early risk but the the vc's tend to
make a lot of money off of each of these
exit events and our labor as people who
make tech at 10 companies is going to
grow that investment and eventually pay
off I wanted to sort of lay that out
because I'm going to be talking a lot
about VC money and where it goes but I
do want to be really clear where it
comes from which is that we make
products that generate that so where
does that money go so natural politics
there is increasing tech investment in
national politics obama was a major
recipient of tech donation money they
tech companies and tech interested
investors by lobbyists says do as other
industries to they support national
candidates ro Khanna in is a national
Assemblyman in the south bay and there
there been millions of dollars poured
into his campaigns against my condo they
haven't been successful yet when tech is
still kind of getting the hang of that
stuff nationally nationally the
priorities there's four main ones it's
immigration tax policy cybersecurity and
net neutrality immigration is kind of a
third rail in our industry people don't
talk about it so I'm not going to UM
know-it-all sir is this I actually would
love to see and hear more folks talking
about immigration or immigration system
and the consequences of it it's not in
my I don't know very much about it but
I'd love to learn more about it so if
anyone wants to appointment anything let
me know taxes tech companies want the
same thing as everyone else they don't
want to pay them and cyber security and
net neutrality other people talk about
these things and talk about it better
than me so I'm not going to talk about
national politics this is also kind of
intentional I tend to think that smaller
scale politics have a much bigger effect
on our everyday life and yes once again
I'm going to talk about the Bay Area in
California I am biased towards it um
it's my hometown and I care very deeply
about it I have a local bias in general
I really do think that this is where
policies are enacted that in that
directly touch our day-to-day lives and
that's what we should be paying the most
attention to because our actions can go
much farther in that sphere think though
even if your are mostly are you all
from where are you from the Bay Area me
raising hands who's from outside the bay
area mat so California okay who's from
outside of California who's from outside
of the US no no like living right now
yeah or working or whatever ok cool so
this is a big mix I am going to focus on
california area but i think this should
be important to you a couple reasons why
one is that a lot of the money generated
by tech ends back up here because the
investors are in california and because
the big companies are in california
another one is that a lot of these
models are being exported so tech hubs
around the country including I know
those folks from New York here and those
folks from LA are being built on the
Silicon Valley model and I'm going to
talk specifically about ways that were
that tech investors and tech political
actors are building a model that there
then applying to other places so talk
about state and regional level what does
tech money care about on a state and
regional level so did those of you na
from California get a wind of some of
this fuckery is really the only word I
have for it um six californias is a plan
to spit split cut it does what it says
on the box to split California in 26
States small government and all that and
it's just like completely unrealistic
and unworkable it doesn't make any sense
it was put up as a ballot initiative
because California allows any weirdo
with enough money to pay for signature
gatherers to put whatever garbage
 they want on our ballot um
direct democracy uh so it didn't get
enough valid signatures in 2014 and
they've tried again for 2016 mm I think
it's still in process whether it'll get
on the ballot or not this is Tim Draper
he is a billionaire venture capitalist
he is the son of a billionaire venture
capitalist and he's the grandson of
another billionaire venture capitalist
and I believe his son is also a venture
capitalist meritocracy so he is the
founder of draper fisher jurvetson
associates some of his investments
include skype hotmail Tesla baidu which
is the Chinese search engine twitch
remain
used also an unaccredited university
named after him in San Mateo that offers
degrees in entrepreneurship he is the
sole founder of six californias just him
he poured five million dollars into it
to buy 1.3 million signatures which is
basically going rate and only seven
hundred thousand of those were valid
last time around that's actually a
pretty good percentage which gives you
an indication of how messed up this
processes um you know this is kind of
like wacky right like tech money and
politics wacky rich guy doing wacky rich
guy things true accurate um but this is
actually not his first attempt at
entering politics in in the year 2000
where there happened to be a lot of
other wacky funny money tech stuff
floating around but we don't talk about
that anymore um but in the year 2000 on
the ballot was proposition 38 which was
placed here by Tim Draper it proposed to
give every student in this state four
thousand dollars each to of ten private
school with no regulation or constraints
whatsoever it was essentially a proposal
to privatize public education and it
would have been at a cost of 3.3 billion
dollars to the state of California Tim
spent 23 million dollars on that
proposition his dabbler in another two
and a half million it was believed to be
the largest contribution by an
individual to a ballot proposition in
California history at the time this
proposal was far to the right of even
the most ardent at what about your
advocates are true school choices in
other word for that which has fallen out
of favor but was actually pretty popular
at the time so it's way beyond anything
that even the most serious people had
proposed it failed handily not before
their opponents spent another 30 million
dollars on it um again still kind of
within wacky rich guy territory right
except that in two thousand he was fresh
off a stint on the State Board of
Education so in 1998 with his only
qualification being the development of a
business simulation game for kids he was
appointed to the State Board of
Education by governor pete wilson who he
just so happened to have fundraised for
and been a major donor for the board of
education in California has quite a
power they set policy they adopt
textbooks and do procurement on large
scale they also evaluate policy and
implement evaluations this is this is a
large amount of power over the state
education system and he was on that
board when gray davis was a democrat
replaced pete wilson that's govern in
1999 Tim Draper was not reappointed
however this man was this is reed
hastings you likely know him now as the
CEO of netflix he's also on the board of
facebook he was on the board of
microsoft he was already very wealthy
when he founded netflix from his 750
million dollar acquisition um he was and
is a huge Democratic donor and he was a
special supporter of Gray Davis the new
governor at that time and he stayed on
the board of education much longer than
Draper he was actually there from
through the beginning of Governor
Schwarzenegger term in 2005 and he
served as a president of the board for
four years so he was very involved in
state education policy and still is and
so like Draper Reed Hastings had his own
big money school bill on the ballot in
two thousand this was another
proposition and this was proposition 39
it was right after 38 proposition 39
proposed to reduce the threshold to pass
local school district bond measures so
it used to you had to get two-thirds of
the vote to pass a local bond to pay for
things in the school district this
reduced it down to fifty five percent
this past easily probably at least in
part that the proponents of it out spent
their opponents over six to one they
raised 3.5 30 1.5 million dollars to
pass proposition 39 that included a
million dollars of reeds own money out
of his pocket it also was thanks in big
part to Reed's buddy and his campaign
co-chair this is John doar he is a
billionaire Parker partner at Kleiner
Perkins Cal field and buyers you may
recognize them from the LM Powell case
kleiner perkins and their star partner
door made their huge well i mean very
substantial wealth investing in
basically any tech thing you've ever
used google amazon AOL into it son EA
Genentech Zynga like a lot a lot of tech
companies John doar himself kicked in
six million kleiner perkins the firm
gave a million to
proposition 39 a couple other partners
shook out the couch cushions and threw
in 1.5 million more than eight million
total made from investments in these
companies went to pass prop 39 so it's
like a lot of money and you're probably
like I fell asleep halfway through your
description of this like school but all
this money to past school bond measures
just to lower the voting threshold well
not just that one proposition of popular
prop 11 provision of proposition 39 has
nothing to do with with bond funding at
all charter schools are private
organizations there can be phenom profit
or for-profit that run public schools
and they're funded via taxpayer dollars
per student it's been a growing movement
over the last 20 years basically to take
government out of education and to hand
it to these private organizations the
provision of prop 39 that's relevant
here requires that public distich public
districts provide charter schools with
space that's reasonably equivalent to
those used by non-charter students in
the district they have to be identically
furnished and they've relocated in the
area that the charter school wants to
locate it and this is a this is an
important part of prop 39 LA Unified
School District has filled us requests
via the controversial practice of
colocation where they literally give the
charter school's classrooms inside the
non charter schools uh it doesn't go
really well the charter schools
especially are not very happy about that
and in fact in recently this basically
culminated in this long series of
drawn-out lawsuits against the LA
Unified School District by the
California Charter Schools Association
okay where am I going with this well
guess who's on the board of the
California Charter Schools Association
Reed Hastings is on the board he is also
a co-founder of an a major investor in
aspire which is California's largest
charter provider aspires board also
includes Steve Merrill who was a former
partner at benchmark capital who's
they're famous for their huge and return
off their investment in ebay their major
investors say in New Relic I lost give
this talk in Portland sorry I didn't
take all the Portland references out um
also on the board of a spire is Richard
yaniv it's who is an executive at sybase
and verisign before he became a venture
capitalist as well um he sings is also
on the board of Kip which is a massive
why charter network one of the biggest
ones he's joined on that board by the
CEO of Viacom and the for murder a
former director of bain capital who's
invested you know you probably have
heard of them in context of mit romney
but may bain capital x she has a huge
tech investment arm as well they've
invested and optimizely rent the runway
linkedin a bunch of other ones his big
sort of jewel in his charter investment
portfolio i guess is rocketship
education there he's on the board he's a
major investor in the k2 five rocket
ship network they're known for their
aggressive growth they actually have
their own real estate department to
procure land to build new schools on the
former CEO of rocketship rob occasion
rocket ship is a big tech organization
and former attack organization the
former CEO of rocketship john Danner was
a bill a millionaire made rich off the
first tech boom major investors include
the CFO of skype sheryl sandberg Arthur
Rock who's a legendary venture investor
invested in fairchild semi apple and
intel menlo ventures who invested in
uber and were be parker accel partners
who have been made rich off etsy and
dropbox the aforementioned benchmark
capital they also invested in snapchat
Instagram and yelp and then as mentioned
kleiner perkins and john doar all of
those folks are in for over a million
dollars on rocket ship and it turns out
actually everywhere you look in the
charter school movement there's tech
investment it's a huge huge source of
it's a huge or i guess recipient of tech
wealth loreen call jobs Steve Jobs widow
after his death most of her vaunted
philanthropy has gone to charter schools
through her msn collective Education
Fund Jeff bezos's family and Paul Allen
have put in a lot of money in Washington
to develop charter schools Mark
Zuckerberg Milliyet like billion dollar
donation to Newark schools was actually
specifically focused on charter schools
also kind of a clusterfuck look that up
um so what it is spending this on so the
shorter schools are spending this on
pull often drugs and political donations
and so in the early shows a lot of that
was statewide measures to allow charters
but now that they're allowed in most
states the charge the movement has
turned their focus on their dollars from
state to local governments they've
poured absolutely unprecedented
political action committee dollars into
school board elections around
country it school board elections to be
clear are generally very local affairs
right so we're looking at numbers like
in 2012 tech funded packs spent 185
thousand dollars in 150 thousand dollars
in 2014 West Contra Costa saw three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars last
year from one political action committee
against a kid who had never come out
against charters last year Arthur Rock
and friends spent two hundred
eighty-five thousand dollars in
minnesota school race wishing this new
jersey new orleans all over the country
and again this represents a tenfold or
more like magnitude of dollars that had
gone into races like this these are
small local affairs usually they're
often won by door knocking it's it's
it's a lot of money and it's new so why
are they doing that well a lot of the
opposition to charters happens at the
school board level right and the school
district level and so Reed Hastings has
spoken about what is wrong with school
districts basically he says what's wrong
with school districts definitely their
democratically elected school boards one
stated goal of the charter school
movement is to shrink school board power
and that's sort of where their
opposition to charters happen so it's a
real focus of theirs why why tech money
why charters why all this money well I
think this last quote sign kind of
speaks to that and what he says is look
the school at New Orleans famously is
went all charter a couple years ago
there are there are no more
government-run public schools the school
districts still exists in New Orleans
bringing the town or more and more
charter school networks sort of like a
chamber of commerce would to develop
business I hope it will become a
long-term model for great education and
you have to sort of keep asking yourself
why where did this sudden interest come
from and I think to answer that you
kinda have to follow the money right so
rocket ship which is the big tech jewel
that I mentioned earlier is has a huge
investment in the philosophy of blended
learning and blended learning is
classroom time backed up by computer
based instruction and one thing you see
in common with these well there's
there's multiple trends that you see in
common with these charter schools but a
huge one is computer based instruction
and all my work and in fact there are
charter school networks that are
completely online like seriously
starting in kindergarten completely
online schools this is a new it's
it's a it's a lot of software it's a lot
of a product that needs to be developed
for that and this is a newish sector
called ed tech and EdTech has been
growing hugely as of late and k12 in
particular in the last four years has
shot up into the right the way that fit
their that VCS are looking for there's
online classes to be provided there's
apps to drill for tests tests often also
provided by some of the same companies
classroom management tools there's
there's almost a market that is being
described by the folks investing in it
is almost limitless and you see the
folks who I mentioned earlier really
getting in on that dream box online is a
math ed tech tool that was bought for
eight figures by Reed Hastings in John
Doerr it's used in all rocket ship
schools John Danner who was the CEO
rocket ship left to develop his own
EdTech app that's used in rocket ship
schools um Scott W Hamilton who was the
founder of Kipp which is a major charter
network left there to head a vet tech
company that's used in those schools
there are VC firms that are only focused
now on EdTech they only invest in EdTech
there are multiple ed tech accelerators
including multiple accelerators that
focus only on startup servicing the k to
12 market the size of the k to 12 market
is projected this year to be over 800
billion dollars with a be a lot of money
there there are some challenges in
investing in EdTech this is a quote from
our favorite Twitter egghead Marc
Andreessen um famous for netscape and
for many many vc investments after that
he works at injuries in Horowitz and he
says I wouldn't want to back a business
that selling to public schools are
characterized by public financing unions
or government-run institutions those
institutions are incredibly hostile to
change now here's the key point marga
Andreessen does invest in ed tech and
you can take this at face value where
he's not interested in investing in
businesses selling to public schools or
businesses character is public financing
but he is interested in creating this
market for those products nonetheless
and one way you might do that is by
changing the way public schools as we
can see them exist so you can change the
way they procure things another way you
might do that is to buy Possible's
entirely and go directly to parents and
students a huge trend in ed tech lately
is behavior management
systems which rely on passive
surveillance of students collecting data
about them and processing them to drive
actions and and interventions a lot of
these products are free one of the
problems though is that there are strong
regulations about what you can do is
student data and what you can't it's
very convenient though to have political
sway so that you can change those
there's a great piece in modern culture
that i'll post a link to about
surveillance about tech specifically
that i encourage you to read by jesse
erwin so so what what did you want to
say about this just to cut off any
conversations you know heated
conversations technology in the
classroom is not inherently bad i would
probably argue the opposite right like
we live in a wired connected world it
would be a shame not to take advantage
of this the charter school argument is
complex and i don't dispute that either
I would know in no way argue that the
over two million students and all of the
admins and educators who who build and
work in charter schools are evil or
scheming for profit I think that's way
overly simplistic however i do see this
as private infrastructure being built
under our nose our noses by people who
are openly advocating for less
democratic processes in order to serve
their own economic interests and that
bothers me and I think it should bother
you to public schooling has long been
considered a cornerstone of our
democracy and whether you agree or
disagree with what the corporate before
school reform movement is doing our
ability to have that conversation at all
is being used served by the enormous
amounts of money that's being poured
into these local supposedly local scale
conversations about it it's being
usurped also with our own labor and with
the money that we're generating Aztec
employees and I think that's all the
more reason for us to care and for us to
pay attention another thing that I want
to wind up this talk by talking about is
that there's something we know about
tech and business models they imitate
each other they copy right so from
myspace you end up with facebook you
know uber and lyft and sidecar groupon
and livingsocial and sometimes they
improve on those earlier models and I
want to point out a way to you that I
see this happening in another venue and
that I think we should all sort of be
paying attention to does anyone know who
this is huh no one Ron
way that's right um Ron Conway is so
wrong you were not gonna get through 40
minutes for me about politics without me
talking about ronco me so Ron call me is
like an enormously prolific angel
investor like you have almost certainly
interacted with a wrong hallway product
today he made early investments in
Airbnb in Google in paypal and twitter
in zynga and Facebook BuzzFeed reddit
pinterest mint Square and over 650 other
tech companies I mean it prolific and he
is wealthier than God and the devil
combined in a mutual fund it's out of
control this is probably wrong
Connolly's most impressive investment or
you could say purchase to date the city
an entire political apparatus of San
Francisco and I this is no exaggeration
really um in 2011 he negotiated a tack
that what is referred to often as the
Twitter tax break for his portfolio
companies Twitter and Zynga he decided
he liked that so much he'd buy more he
spent six hundred thousand dollars
getting Mayor Ed Lee elected and looks
like re-elected without opposition
because Ron Conway is too scary to go up
against he's bought five six or seven
depending on how your accounting of our
Board of Supervisors and um he's done
that in order to enact laws favorable to
the companies he invests in and again
this is not me being a tinfoil hat all
of this is stuff you can read about and
you should he recently so blatantly
brought a short-term rental law for his
portfolio company Airbnb that
competitors Airbnb are suing the city
because they were cut out of the deal
that's how blatant this is this is Greg
Suhr he is often described as an old
friend of Ron Conway um I haven't found
a picture of them together but um he is
the chief of the police of San Francisco
in 2012 they believe SF City which is
Ron Conway's political consortium which
includes many companies likely if you
work here the company that you work for
look it up they made a widely publicized
$100,000 donation to the SFPD and that
was actually paid out a donation is kind
of weird to call it it was paid out to
an SF City member to develop an app that
SF city decided the PD police needed was
never really delivered and never really
got ruled out I think that this was a
testing ground there was also recently
you may have seen Marc Benioff who's
also a member of SF City donated like a
Batman water motorcycle to the sps
seriously look it up it's kind of cool
um it's not kind of cool it's super cool
but troubling nonetheless so why why do
I think this was a floater why do I
think this is a bubble well in herself
to Sandy Hook wrong call me came out and
basically said like guns safety is where
I'm focusing my fellow film topic
efforts gun safety is my thing that's
what I'm going to address well
philanthropic efforts is not the right
way to put it frankly because what he's
doing in his own words he says I'm
looking for the Mark Zuckerberg or Larry
Page innovator for gun safety and so
what he's actually done to address gun
safety is he's run a series of
million-dollar entrepreneurship
challenges offering to invest in
technological solutions for gun violence
this has addressed so far a couple of
those challenges have addressed the very
large in this country market of private
ownership but there's also a couple
challenges planned for Community Safety
which if you read about this stuff
you'll learn as a euphemism for police
when you see the word community in
connection with guns it means police um
he had a partner in announcing this
challenge Ian sobieski who is a VC with
a group called band of angels um I'm
sorry I had to say that out loud this is
a quote from him he says there is money
to be made gun violence is expensive to
society and there was a big potential
market for solutions and he would know
because one of sobieski is proud
investments is SST Inc another hint when
you see nondescript initials when you're
reading about defense or police stuff be
very scared SST Inc was formerly
ShotSpotter which is a gunshot detection
system that's been installed in a in
Oakland do you know which I'm going to
talk about because this is where we are
but it's also been installed in New York
and in other cities around the country
the concept being it's a network of
microphones and when a shot is fired it
detects it an alerts law enforcement
it's been shown to be wildly and
effective for actually preventing gun
violence but it turns out that may not
be the point um last year through public
records act it was discovered that shot
spotter is actually on all the time it's
not activated by anything like unlike
holla claims and it Rick records voice
detects voices and records conversations
and that may very well be a feature not
a bug Oakland is the site of a hotly
contested domain awareness center which
is planned with an initial investment of
11 million dollars the concept is it's a
hub for law enforcement you're
collecting data and you're running it
through face detection software and data
mining software and alerting software
notice that I keep saying the word
software because this is very clearly a
market right like this is the concept
being that you could buy software
products to run this enormous amount of
surveillance data through at a local
level and it's being designed in fact
with an eye towards future integration
of additional tools and software it's
meant to be something that that provides
for ongoing procurements by the city so
far it's mostly been bid on by military
contractors but Google actually put in a
bid because Google already has similar
products that it's sold to other
municipalities in New York Microsoft
helped develop a domain awareness system
that now they market to other smaller
municipalities as well it's called
automated workspace for the analysis of
real-time events Microsoft aware just in
case you ever doubted anything you read
in an or well book um this is a market
that exists it's growing and in some
ways it I was I was surprised and kind
of shocked to learn this but if I think
about it there's really kind of a
billion-dollar unicorn in the room here
right which is that palantir which is
rarely listed when we do this sort of
like incantation of Silicon Valley
successes palantir is one of those
billion-dollar unicorns that's done very
very well Palantir was founded by X
PayPal mafia that's what they call
themselves many of whom are now vc's
including Peter Thiel it's
euphemistically a big data company but
it's openly funded by the CIA it has
multiple US government clients it's a
surveillance
it's a surveillance company and it's a
surveillance processing company and like
any sort of market where you have a big
entrench sort of ruler you start to see
folks sprouting up can you tell us about
to come out of my mouth to disrupt that
market and indeed we've seen multiple
smaller startups if you go on Angeles I
think there's like about 90 startups
listed in the policing category right
now as of the last time I checked which
was like flash month one of the big ones
is predictive policing is a big trend
that's all so again that's what they
call it predictive policing and some of
the companies that do that our pred Paul
and hunch lab and street cred and that
is designed to expand local municipal
level surveillance systems and then to
predict where crime is going to happen
you can talk about that I have lots of
thoughts about that but um I bring this
up because this is obviously a hot topic
right now and one of the big calls and
rightful and worthy calls of the police
reform movement right has been for body
cameras I this isn't like the charter
school thing this isn't an argument for
or against body cameras but I do think
it's very worth following the money when
we look at things like body cameras so
body cameras the main provider of body
cameras and police cameras in the u.s.
is tasor they you know the same folks
that make the giant air quotes
non-lethal weapons taser cells cameras
they're very excited about this new move
to get body cameras their stock has been
going through the roof because of the
sudden interest in body cameras central
to tasers plan for profitability is not
actually the cameras themselves the
cameras themselves don't cost very much
money in this scheme of government
contracts but instead they're
cloud-based evidence strategy is central
to that company's plan for profitability
and cloud offerings increasingly have
been the cash cow for companies selling
to police departments and lest you think
again this is something I'm being tin
foil hat about Haiti part OV who is the
director of code org and worked in
high-level positions at Microsoft and
myspace is on the board of
user as is Brett Taylor who worked on
google maps and was the CTO of facebook
this is a tech company now and it's
something that we should think of as a
tech company the timing of taser
contracts are interesting as well these
contracts have been being worked on for
a while and if you there's we're
starting to come out and see the process
behind getting those contracts in place
there have been stories breaking in
Albuquerque and as South among others
about the aggressive sales practices of
taser and possibly illegal no-bid
contracts they've been working on in a
lot of ways the legal barriers in place
in terms of control over the policing
market are more easily surmountable than
those that have been easily
steamrollered by the charter school
movement so if I were a betting woman um
which I am um but i don't own Taser
stock but you know i don't think it's a
bad buy at this point um if i were a
betting woman what i would expect to see
in the next couple years is to see the
police reform movement funded engineered
and taken over by tech money and some of
the same folks who have funded the
school reform movement okay so so what
am I going out with this well are you
scared I hope your I don't know I'm
scared by this I don't have a ton of
like encouraging words yeah here I find
this frankly quite terrifying um I do
think that we have a special burden here
as tech workers to pay attention to this
and to think about our role in it we all
make trade-offs to pay the bills you
know I'm not really intending to guilt
anyone out and this does happen in in
lots of industries right all over the
place but I think that we seem like
especially committed to denying the
downsides of the tech economy that we
live off of and to me it's very common
to encounter engineers who seem to think
that politics is too messy or like
beneath them right I did a talk where I
did all Jenny Holzer slides and Jenny
holds her as a tech based artist and
text based artist and she has these
truisms that she projects and in unusual
places and one of the ones that keeps
running through my head lately when I
see people how they talk about tech and
how they think about tech
abstractions of decadence right in some
ways we've buried ourselves in the
technical details and we're neglecting
the real world impacts I think this is
silly I think that one of the things
that I find slightly encouraging is that
I meet people every day in the tech
industry who are really good at big
systems who are kind and smart and
inventive I think that we could do
better than that I also think it's
really naive I think if you're
determinedly a political while your
bosses spend the money that your labor
generates on political change your not
impartial you're just being played so I
think that we could do better at paying
attention I think we could do better at
speaking out I think we could do better
at making choices that are informed by
these things when I first gave this talk
I concluded by being like let's read
more journalists you should please like
read more journalists i have a link that
i'll show you the next slide where i've
linked some of my favorite local
journalists that right on these topics
let's just pay attention and be better
at reading the news and i was like you
know happens i work at a YC funded
company quit my job like pretty soon
after giving that talk um it wasn't
directly related to it but i'm not
saying you should quit your job but i'm
not saying you shouldn't quit your job
right like I think that now I'm serious
I think that we're lucky right we have
some of the most unfun precedented job
mobility compared to folks in our
generation and in our in our area and I
think it's worth considering whether
this is a criteria that we use to make
daily decisions also go to school board
meetings go to police commission
meetings this is your community and you
can actually this is a level where you
can make your voice heard ok thank you
very much this is an article covering
the topics I talked about here
I guess we could do Q&amp;amp;A do we have time
do we have interest in that I have five
minutes I guess if anyone wants to ask
questions I don't I'm nervous about this
prospect yes I love this guy he's like
five minutes I got it uh I don't know
that's a big one I mean I'm kidding but
that's a big question I will say this i
think though that seriously schools and
police are locally governed and as much
as they reflect structural changes and
like large movements there is actually a
lot of impact that individual folk I
mean a school board election really is
at the scale where you can knock on
doors not all of those elections i
mentioned did the big money always win
and when i look at the Taser stuff
actually SF for over ten years police in
SF don't carry Tasers there's a lot of
reasons why tasers are a bad idea
non-lethal non-lethal weapons again have
been they don't there's a lot of reasons
not to do them and they don't carry
tasers because for the last ten years
local activists have fought against it
and you know SF is is a medium-sized
city and even with all the power of the
money and the might and in again a
company that's very powerful that people
managed to shut that down so I'd like to
think so obviously money in politics is
a big thing it's scary and I don't have
an answer to it but I think at this
scale there are some things we could do
yeah
yeah I didn't talk about this much this
time but I've given this talk before
basically I just think I love the work
that's been doing to widen the pipeline
bring more people in diversify tech but
we can't do that with one hand and be
ruining communities of color and poor
communities with the other I think their
hand in hand basically that would be my
answer is that is that satisfying you
look unsatisfied yeah I mean that's I
think that's basically all I'm saying is
again like I think we have to look at a
holistic view of archimedes an economy
yeah you go for it get him yeah I think
that that's a false dichotomy and I
think that's part of the problem that we
consider local community problems and
people in tech problems to be different
we're people in communities and we're
doing a job of that the question
being that that activists aren't
interested in these campaigns or yeah I
don't know i mean i hope that just
seeing some of the connections drawn
helps I don't must have a good answer to
that I think you're you're probably the
expert so you would do more but um I
think these connections are really
hidden but they're not I don't like
again I'm not filing fo like freedom of
information act here I'm someone who's
reading articles written by journalists
and I think that um when you start to
see the connections of web there's this
woman Audrey Waters who I link in this
piece and I love her and she's a she's a
big like thorn in the side of ed tech
and one of her like I think of it as her
catchphrase which is what's the business
plan and it's something that we don't
ask enough how is this making money cuz
if you're proposing to change the world
we need to know how you intend to
extract capital so yeah a lot of
depressing answers I think that's all
the time I have but I'm around and happy
to talk it out with folks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
