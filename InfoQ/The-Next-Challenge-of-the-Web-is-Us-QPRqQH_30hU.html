that is a deep
hedgehogs and other things mostly that
I've been a web developer for a long
long time and I've seen I've survived
the first com boom and I survived the
Java applet revolution and I survived
the flash revolution although it's still
around so it's amazing when your
JavaScript conference and everybody's
like oh flash is totally dead nobody
uses that go into video streaming and
talk to people they're going to adult
entertainment not that that exists on
the internet but a lot of people are
using that still there as well so it's
not that easy to say like one technology
is gone and the other one will replace
it I was here a few weeks ago already
and I was at Google i/o and I wrote this
not scathing but disappointed article
about it because I've been at Google i/o
for several years I spoke at the first
google i/o on a panel as well and I
always look forward to google i/o
because i work for mozilla the open web
company that does a browser and google
always announced the most amazing stuff
for the web at Google i/o and chrome out
of a sub did this and did that and we're
like I was already preparing my speaking
notes for talking to the press how we
match what Google is doing right now
because they always like browser makers
fight each other and actually we're
friends it's it's really not that much
of a competition we all want to get the
best browser out there to make the web
available to you and I didn't have to
prepare anything this time because all
the key nodes were about android l and
like oh look there's like this paper
stuff and now and under what we do with
polymer it's fine and like and I got a
bit scathing about the android car thing
when i said like oh it's a great new
platform where you can reach dozens of
users in and surrounding the silicon
valley because saying like 15,000 other
cars like look and now here Absalon it
like well done whoa look i can have like
a map on my car like i have on my phone
on my car already that's amazing and but
i was just very disappointed the web
wasn't mentioned at all and so was the
chrome team I mean they were very
confused about this as well cause
strangely enough people in gooby don't
know what's coming in the keynote so
it's why I like working for Mozilla as
well because there's no
prizes except for one's coming from the
outside so I was just wondering why is
that what's going on why does google all
of a sudden push everything into android
and don't give me the competition that I
was expecting any more because in
essence took the web should be this
well-oiled machine I've been 17 years a
web developer and we've done the same
things over and over again and we should
have to like what it should be simple it
should be totally simple to set up your
first website I mean companies like wix
com and things like dad's make money by
having little page generators it's like
like geocities 30 or something like that
and it should be that easy but you see
even at a conference like this they
managed not to get the picture of people
up on a website right now and that used
to be easy you know like i go into my
ftp air upload the thing and i'm done or
I go into flickr and I have an API
talking to Flickr getting the photo into
my website somehow somewhere something
went wrong and we did something
different what really annoys me mostly
is I was part of the team that built the
first pop-up blocker and and got it into
the browser and promoted it because pop
ups were awful and are terrible not the
stores with hipster clothing but the
things that were in your face and say
like download these kind of things and
we've done these 20 now you go to a
website like the wonton soup recipe here
and then it asks you do you want to have
the same content that you already loaded
over your data connection onto your
phone right now for one dollar
ninety-nine after downloading 20 meg of
application like we don't even pop up
pop-ups in people's faces anymore
because everybody has a blocker we just
asked him to download our app right now
because for publishers this is of course
great because you have full control over
yet I treated yesterday I spoke at 42
conferences last year and I found 15
different apps of different conferences
on my phone I don't need any of these
these conferences are over nobody does
anything with the app of the
conference's afterwards it's just a
schedule so why is that not a nicely
marked up HTML table with an app cache
to actually work offline too simple not
nice enough not enough interaction I
don't know
why do people give up on the web and
start thinking in apps instead what do
companies want to have a nap and not
just say like okay the web is there I
can reach people worldwide without 24-7
without them having to buy a very
expensive phone I don't have to put my
software into somebody's marketplace and
be at their beck and call to allow me or
not allow me to actually use it their
publication on the web is is unhindered
you just put the stuff there and you're
there but people are not excited about
it companies are not and I think the
biggest thing is it's all about business
it's about numbers and it's about
business and wonderful things like you
control the interface completely I mean
you all probably work with designers and
or companies that wanted to have their
own drop-down arrow color because it's
their company color and they want to
keep controlling the web like oh this is
our font and this is the font sizes that
we have and I'm like okay what about
somebody with low vision we don't have
clients like that or we don't have
customers like that yeah you don't
because you piss them off that's why you
don't have customers like that that's
why you miss out on that opportunity so
with apps I've got full control I can
click manage the hell out of it I know
what my users are doing and end users
have a better that they like apps more
they like I put effort into download
that thing and it's it feels like a more
emotional thing to use an apt and use a
website a website is just one of those
50 that I have opened and it just
doesn't feel the same thing but
companies are making the same mistake
that they're really thinking people are
so excited about their app that people
that they are themselves and we're not
we just want to have something you see
this with like Foursquare going to swarm
and all of a sudden o colors different
yeah it I still do my head to my
went to my checkings I don't care what
the thing looks like you see with i mean
if i were to pay a big company for
example i would spend a lot of money
buying a chat app and then I realized
that three weeks later all the teenagers
just use the next chat app that comes
around there's no loyalty as much as we
think there is and apps are all about
making money and control and it scares
people that the web cannot be controlled
this is a 1950s model in the 1950s p
realized we cannot make good products
because we don't make any money with
them a product that doesn't break you
sell at once make sure your product
breaks after year so you can sell the
next one in the 60s we moved it even
further and said let's make it look
outdated let's come up with fashion
ideas like make shoes higher lower
higher lower every five years so you can
sell new shoes and with apps we got the
same thing we've got a v1 and v2 on it
you cannot sell a new version of a
website but you can sell a new version
of an application and promised new
features only for the v2 version and the
old one and we might maintain it but
probably you don't even have a choice
you have to upgrade to the other one so
what apps do is make software into a
consumable product and yesterday
actually my video just released I spoke
at TEDx testimony key about this so if
you got 16 million time it was good fun
to do and I'm pitching a fake app that
exists called what's out which is a
local check in for public toilet so you
can actually be in whatever and it was
kind of silly but I showed that a lot of
apps are there to make you addicted to
them and stay inside them and that's the
business model you have to be
competitive with other apps or you're
going to lose out on the web you can
link to other services and take content
from them and be successful that way a
napster not just area that's why things
like app links exist from Facebook
reinventing the link into applications
but why are people not getting excited
we've got lots of people here you've got
lots of friends you get paid by the
internet you get paid by doing things
for the Internet I suppose nobody here
writes JavaScript for illustrator
although you can it's not fun but you
can I think the biggest problem we have
is that we're inside this massive echo
chamber we all have these really cool
macbook pros and fast well I have
fast connection in Europe you have
connections in America
100 megabit up and down came for free
with a flat but we'd like to talk to
each other about our things and the last
two years I've seen not many things
being done for end-users anymore but we
get so excited building little tools for
each other building solutions for each
other building add-ons to other
solutions for other solutions to each
other and tell each other that's an
amazing thing the website said a list
apart and these kind of things that we
used to follow that solve QX patterns
that showed how to deal with clients
that showed how to build things in
environments that you don't expect they
had Deb going away they're not as
important anymore and instead we've got
like heck and news and a co je s where
we're like like six thousand little
solutions per day that we should be
using we also don't share the pain every
single one of you I would assume has
adblock plus installed or something like
that because it's so annoying on the web
well the annoying web is what our
clients are using so we should share
that pain a bit we should realize what's
going on I've been debugging my blog a
few times because I thought my ads
weren't showing up until I realized I
got the blocker installed but it's over
i mean like i used to make about two
thousand dollars with my blog in
2005-2006 because i had like four
hundred fifty thousand readers or
something like that nowadays thirty
forty dollars it's not a business model
anymore to put ads on a website if you
write about web development because we
all basically block away the bad things
of the web from ourselves so our clients
can suffer that that's not right you
should know what people have to go
through and make it better instead of
just blocking it away from ourselves of
course here you live in a Silicon Valley
and I love this quote the other day or
it's like Silicon Valley is so
disruptive that they've taken a job that
can be done from anywhere with the
internet and produce the land crunch in
one city
and it's true i mean i don't mention any
names yeah i used to work for a large
company and they didn't said like
everybody has to come to the office and
work there at mozilla we work from
wherever everybody can come to an office
if they're in the city will occur with
an office but you can work from home you
can have your children you can have your
real life you can have a social life
it's internet companies that do things
on the internet why should we sit next
to each other in big boxes that cost a
lot of money and actually give you the
things I got my laptop two weeks before
i started and there's nothing on it
because everything is web-based that we
do in Mozilla and that's great because
this is what how to use their technology
if we don't understand how the internet
is connected and empowers end-users why
should we be the people to build
products for them and know what they do
so don't get too frustrated and too
excited if you see a Silicon Valley News
&amp;amp; think you're falling behind because
the tech press here says like every
developer should know this and know this
and be 19 years old and when you 22 you
might as well get shot I was at Google
i/o and is so annoyed at my camera was
led that my buff my phone was empty I
was at the Twitter after party and had
this 20 year old mansplaining to me like
how how how to get a job in the Silicon
Valley and how to have a career in IT I
mean I'm okay I don't know me but the
guy was standing next to me was the VP
of Marvel often Marvel interactive and
the gather guided I came from England
with instant is one of the founders of
skype so he was telling us the old guys
at the event how to get a career around
here and what to do with our jobs it was
just amazing Saudi don't get too
frustrated when people tell you how
awesome they are and what kind of cool
things they do in their company most of
it is just like yeah whatever like I see
you in a job interview and see how you
fare in and we assume that everybody has
these computers we assume that everybody
has a mac how many of our tools right
now Mac only this frustrates me to no
end I just been to Guadalajara and took
me a few months to pronounce that in
Mexico and everybody had like a windows
machine with linux on it like okay so
here's the cool 20 should I can't show
you that one oh this is the owner
doesn't work either like it's just
amazing how we take the high-end
technology and put more low-end stuff
into it it's like oh yeah here's always
X they spend like years and years making
it the best operating system beautiful
and everything and go to command line to
do everything you said in his computer
and you can do the same thing right but
it's fascinating when you look at
statistics this is the European whatever
this wonderful URL down there that shows
you that politicians really know how to
do your l's on the internet but it shows
you that ninety percent of the
population aged 16 to 74 has never
caught used a computer let alone like go
to the internet and do these kind of
things they all will probably get phones
now as the first thing so our job is to
bring the web to those people as well
they don't need the web they can have
the iOS store to kind of the Play Store
they kind of apps and everything but I
think that i surf the web they deserve
to have the same thing that made me what
I am now wanting to write things and
publish things in the world make
pictures share things with my friends
collaboratively work with people in
America and India and everywhere this is
not possible in closed environments
unless you stay in one product inside a
closed environment and then all the work
you put into there cannot be put into
another product again why do we keep
stepping back in this and web
development used to be this wonderful
low barrier to start HTML CSS JavaScript
all documentation is online you seem
today another startup another
introducing like video tutorials you can
teach yourself everything that you need
to know about basic web development
right now on the web and that's amazing
and that's just wonderful and in the
past when I started it was not even a
book so I wrote the first few books and
I'm unhappy the way they are now but I
had can't change them anymore but we
forgot about this we forgot how cool it
is to just write an HTML page and put it
there go to jsfiddle right a little
thing Press that collaboration button
and you can have an audio and video chat
with somebody talking them through the
code that you're coding together with
them always web RTC how cool is that
like you don't need flash you don't need
anything anymore we can teach each other
all these things but instead when we
stop talking about development because
we're
echo chamber it's all about spaceship
spaceship spaceship like when I see
articles like oh people that don't know
the command line shouldn't write CSS I
just want to slap that person like I ok
I started as a pearl developer let's
let's let's go against each other on in
command line and then we see how much
you know the command line like oh yeah
we just chmod that folder 777 cuz then
you can generate files in there yeah and
so can the rest of China and Russia
grade so there's this myth of this great
thing called the full stack developer
and that always cracks me up like we're
not web developers anymore we are not
interaction architects anymore we're not
HTML monkeys anymore whatever job title
we gave us over the year it's always the
same thing and no chase gave us the
impression that we're all server admins
and CSS experts at the same time we know
every from big everything from beginning
to end and everything in between and
that's just arrogance and it's also
unfair to others because you want to get
on holiday for a change you want to get
sick from time to time and share with
other people we should still be allowed
to concentrate on one thing in one thing
well because it's not easy I love this
little quote when somebody Zanella
front-end developer I want to die so I
can end the pain because yeah you cannot
tell me that you are with like 60
minutes on Stack Overflow you actually
know how to set up a node server harden
it against the DDoS attack and know why
things don't render in WebKit compared
to Firefox this is something that you
cannot take in our brains are big enough
but there's other things in there like
kittens and football matches and stuff
so we we cannot just concentrate on one
thing only so what do we do to get
things get people started and it's
always the thing it's so fascinating to
see people starting to work with
computers and start working with the web
and get really excited about it and
google released something new the other
day called the web fundamentals and it's
good because a lot of documentation how
to get started is a bit old school it
doesn't talk about Mobile's at all
doesn't talk about responsive design
doesn't talk about like embracing that
not everything is a computer with a
keyboard so the web fundamentals to a
really good job getting people started
with thinking about in a mobile
environment and a
top environment about using HTML CSS and
JavaScript and 15 other things that are
extra but not necessary but ok to use
now as I found a few bugs in it and I
was like oh this is cool so let's
contribute I mean I'm from mbn we have
an edit button great contribution makes
fun so I looked at the github account
and said ok to contribute install xcode
command line tools install our vm
whatever that is set our vm default to
2000 meaning like go back and hack the
thing that you don't know what it is
install pigments run Ruby gems
dependencies install node.js and install
the grunts ooh CLI that's how you start
contributing to this when you found a
broken link I was just standing here
like what this is like the amount of
effort we put into creating static pages
is fascinating me nowadays there static
how hard is that like the dynamic pages
are the ones that are the problematic
ones and then you put a cash in front of
it gets better as well or even better
was this the other day couteau swiss is
like bourbon but for stylus okay
watermelons are like oranges but for
monkeys if I don't know about one thing
is putting more and more on that it's
just not helping so I was in there what
are you doing why are you putting so
many attractions on abstractions on
abstractions to solve a problem this big
all of these things are power tools like
we should explain people how to hold a
screwdriver not to get a power drill and
do that because the battery runs out on
that one they don't know what to do with
that because they're too happy to turn
but we make it far too complex I have to
ask ourselves is this all innovation or
just fluff are we just getting too
excited about putting a logo on a
javascript file on github and call it a
product because every few weeks we won't
be the guy on hacker news that does the
really cool thing how many of those have
been used in production not many because
you go to people like enterprise-level
people I've got this bitter thing that
is in the pre-alpha by some guy
might do something else next week shall
we put that into the 50 million users
that we have yeah you're fired Thank
make these things work better make these
things real and then we have something
going because to me all the poly fields
abstractions and libraries are our
liability as well the more you rely on
them the more you have to make sure
these things stay secure the more do you
have to introduce people to them and
explain to them and saying that
everybody who starts with web
development knows what SAS is it's just
arrogant it's just as long as this thing
is not in the browser and it can't be in
the browser because of pre-rendering and
everything so let's let's not that as
long as it's not in the browser you
cannot rely on it because it's an extra
step it's an extra effort that people
have to learn and it should be very much
worthwhile their time to learn that
extra thing there's enough things to
look into to learn one of my favorite
bands had this like if you came to
conquer you'll be king for a day but you
will deteriorate and quickly fade away
and this is what I see in all these
things oh wow this week I'm on hacker
news and the man I'm like everybody will
use my light Oh nobody did because
there's three other libraries two
minutes later so don't get too excited
about inventing things for ourselves
let's concentrate on end users for a
change maybe build something that is fun
maybe build a ticket vending mr. I don't
want to kill myself after I used it for
three minutes maybe an airline website
that has like real data where the planes
might be this is really cool kayak does
a really good job with that where you
basically have a slider that has how
much money do you have and where could
you go this is a really cool use case
that's the kind of stuff that I want to
see I think we got stuck in a problem
called what if we always built these
libraries and abstractions because we
think we cannot change things well what
if the user has an Internet Explorer 9
okay why don't you give them something
that works and test for it and make it
there no that's not working so here's
the polyfill that works with internet
explorer 9 not that we ever tested it on
internet explorer 9 we just put the
javascript in there that it should
understand because it's too much effort
to test and everything as well but what
if the users all were fast on a
connection okay sent the modems
would wire in the ground help them out
otherwise you will not have end users
that have it there so let's thinking
about a beautiful world that is out
there or might be out there or we want
to have and turn it into actually into
what we can do which is the if what you
can use any technology on the web if you
put this around it just test for the
thing before you apply it and you're
safe the end users that don't have a new
browser that don't have the support of
that will not be the wiser it's like
don't give people on ie6 beautiful
interface it just confuses them they're
not used to these things they're used to
the things that they have to use and
don't be so arrogant to say like oh they
have to upgrade no they're not allowed
they work in government they work in
hospitals they're not allowed to do
things having a fast basic HTML page
with a bit of CSS rendering for them
would make them much much happier than
having a parallax scrolling website that
doesn't show anything but loads like 50
meg on like two and a half minutes so
let's do that more let's just test full
of things and then implement them it's
called progressive enhancements been
around for a long long time but people
still go for the 40 a graceful
degradation which is double the work
just do something working put the if wat
around it and make it better so first
good example for that is offline first
which to me is the biggest problem that
we have to solve every single video out
there like when Microsoft hasta cool is
the future or Apple is the future is
always like very good looking strangely
washed people that have super
connectivity everywhere where they are
they drive through tunnels and they got
like 50 mega big megabytes coming on
down to their phone this will never
happen we will not have flying cars we
will not have holo decks because people
would have sex in them and not eat
anymore and die
we will have a future that is as broken
as the future as the reality is now we
have holds in connectivity we will not
have power battery life will be will be
short it's getting better but it will
always be an issue so let's find ways to
make this work offline first is the new
progressive enhancement to me think
about the offline use case first and
then the others which of course is an
issue cause as we all know application
cache is broken right big article in few
years ago application cache is a naughty
word and yeah that's why people have
problems using it who here used app
cache in a real production environment
good if i'll put your hand above would
have called you bloody liars because one
of the really interesting things that
Google IL was when we set together with
friends from chrome and friends from
microsoft and we talked about the good
thing that's coming service workers and
we said ok so what is the app cache
numbers every browser out there every
statistic Oh point 0 2 percent or less
people did use app cache at all and we
all complain how broken it is and wrote
like 50 thousand articles are like or we
cannot use it nobody tried it it seems
like it's just so depressing if you
think about it I've got a few things out
there like books that are awful that are
online now because they use app cache
it's a terrible solution it was rushed
through it was like it's like HT access
on steroids but it doesn't it doesn't
make any sense but we have it in the
browser and we didn't use it and that's
just really that was eye-opening to me
we put all these efforts in to put poly
fields in and make things work and we
pretend that people use these cool
technologies already but nobody does
in-app caches case that's just
depressing you know why is a browser
developer that I put so much effort of
making these things work if we don't
implement it instead we write articles
complaining that they're broken use this
stuff five bucks fine tea issues and fix
them for us and with us which brings me
to service worker service worker is
incredible it's a super complex thing to
look at the first time but what it means
and this is what I talked about you have
full control over the online experience
of the end user you don't have the
magical things that weren't app cache
app cache is a problem because it's
magic it's this thing and it does
something and when it doesn't do it we
like don't know what's going on here
with service worker you've got callbacks
you've got promises you've got every
single control mechanism we have as
programmers to do something useful with
the with the network stack it's a great
video out there by Jake Archibald 14
minutes long google i/o called
serviceworker the network layer that's
yours to own and it's super funny is a
very very funny English guy and it's
also spell well researched you cannot
only detective Samba users offline but
you can also know when a connectivity
goes down because that's the biggest
problem a lot of our offline and online
logic is all about like other users
offline I show them that the users
online I show them that even having a
wireless connection doesn't mean that
you're connected you might have to go
through some login system like in this
room here so service worker has ways to
test for all these different things and
put promises in to find out what's
happening with the network stack it's
like having a programmable cash or a
programmable router directly in
javascript in front of your website and
this is amazing because I don't hope
that something gets cached but I can
name my cash and I can do an inventory
of it and I know how many files have
been do I have been there I know how
much data i used and so on and so forth
so service worker is one of the most
important things to look at in the next
few months cause an app that doesn't
work offline is not a nap I'm offline
all the time don't pretend that he uses
will be online all the time I'd be happy
about you live in San Francisco you know
as soon as it's cloudy GPS connection
doesn't really work or there is no
wireless that's free except for the
hacked ones there's at web directions in
Australia there was actual fire camp
German guy as well raiden gave another
talk about offline first and he talked
about the the more interesting parts in
UX model of that because we don't even
have the right interaction models for
offline and online connectivity how do
you tell a user their online
I mean I've Foursquare's my favorite
like an exciting new era has occurred
like okay if that era exciting times a
day because I'm offline it's not
exciting anymore it just means I'm
offline so finding ways to get people to
understand that we're trying to do
something for them to give them data for
later when they go offline is a big UX
problem and for designers I think it's a
super interesting model of getting
things out there so please look at the
interaction models that are out there
waste us starting with it we put the
plumbing in with service worker but we
don't even know how to show the end user
when they're online when they're offline
when their connection is slow the
operating system on devices does it for
them but on the desktop not so much so
make serviceworker epic help us with
that firebox look at the documentation
it's implemented now in the latest
chrome it's implemented partly in
Firefox Internet Explorer shows interest
but that's why we talked about the app
casting as well because Microsoft
wouldn't do anything without knowing
numbers and it's totally fine because
they're at their business clients are
businesses are people that don't want
functionality in the browser that they
don't use so if we don't use things
things are not going to get into
browsers we can complain to Microsoft we
can complain to Apple but if the numbers
of the use case of new technology is so
low why should I put engineering effort
into there and put the new things in
there if we don't even show interest in
them now the other big thing of course
is web components that's been around now
for a year or so and it's it was big at
Google i/o it was bigger every other
conference there's probably five talks
here about web components as well and
web components are awesome and I always
hated that on the web I didn't have a
widget factory I didn't have a way to
build interactive widgets except for
base JavaScript to render against the
browser with web components we render
with the browser which means it could be
much faster much less battery consuming
much nicer and interaction models much
richer because the keyboard
interactivity of the operating system
for example would be given to you rather
than you having to simulated in the past
we always had to use JavaScript to
create things we can create everything
with JavaScript that's like that's
always the way out like or
browser doesn't do that I write
everything in JavaScript good but the
performance is painful and its
performance is up to you as well so with
web components we've got this
opportunity to build real interfaces
real application interfaces that render
well and can be reusable as well that's
the biggest part about it but I think
we're always shooting the mark already
you have these custom elements that I oh
and component kitchen and people are
building lots and lots of components
already there like Oh dogma my slider or
like photo gallery like out of a sudden
we put all the things we put into jquery
and didn't perform there inside a custom
element and hope it performs and we
didn't change our code at all we didn't
do anything useful with it we just hide
complexity into our own function and one
of the first ones on component kitchen I
saw was was was an X or nobody was
called my portfolio my dash portfolio as
a as a web component how is it how is a
portfolio a component components are
little modular things that you can put
together and mix and match and do things
with them making a whole website as one
component doesn't make any sense the
whole component thing to me started when
i worked at yahoo and we moved from Yui
3 2 y by 2 to Yui 3 because large
corporation every department worked for
themselves and they didn't want to talk
to each other they just wanted to build
one little part of the front page and
they didn't want to the CSS of the
others bleed into it they didn't want to
have to functionality be slower than the
others so we had to do like all kind of
front loading and I frames and nested
iframes and really dirty things and now
we have that with web components it's
little components that do one thing in
one thing well that you can mix and
match google does a great job with for
example in polymer with the web services
components like you can say like google
dash map and give it a lat long and it
will render a map for you that's great
the only problem I found with it is that
people don't think about the error case
what if the gps lookup didn't work the
new component should have an error
message as well in it and not just be
like magically not showing that's not
good enough at least show something to
the user that make sense and that's not
the latter long because people can't
read that normal people i worked in maps
so i had to
so web components are not dare to
actually hide complexity and we do it
right now already which is like oh now
now everything works because it's one
element it's not 50,000 50,000
JavaScript files and CSS files anymore
it's one element let's just hiding
things it's like reinventing net or ASP
just with cool new technologies we
shouldn't be thinking about that we
should be thinking about modules and
reusing them so web components in
themselves are actually a component if
you think about it because they're tears
they're not in the browser yet chrome is
very much ahead of us Firefox is in
there others don't do it yet but there
are actually four different standards
that are going into web components that
are in different ways of support already
in browsers and you should think about
all of them the first one is shadow Dom
which always sounds like a name of a
goth chat room or something like that
one is the elements that are in the
browser that you don't see video element
you put in there and the video element
has a scrubber volume bar all kind of
buttons these are not magical pixie
things these are HTML CSS and JavaScript
you just don't see them in the source
code unless you go through developer
tools and you turn on shadow DOM and you
see them so that would allow you to put
your complex HTML inside the browser and
let the browser render it for you that's
what shadow Dom is about not implemented
fully in any browser yet because it's
really really hard to do but this is the
thing that makes web components really
perform if we get this sorted out HTML
templates allows you to do templating
much you do like with like handlebar
mustache sixty thousand other JavaScript
frameworks that do templating but in the
browser directly these are chunks of
HTML that are not rendered that are not
actually slowing down the browser that
are just there until you use them which
is really cool as well you something
used to I used to do in PHP or in Perl
before that and then in asp sharp and
didn't want to work anymore and live
anymore custom elements allow you to
create new elements like your own
elements that select my navigation my TV
set but the really cool thing about a
custom element is that you can also
inherit from others so please please do
won't come up with your own button
inherit from the HTML button do this
only the changes that you need to do
because the whole accessibility of a
button is already baked in this works
for you the keyboard accessibility the
discoverability by screen readers the
index ability all these things are there
for you your own button that is just a
div with a click handler does not do any
of that stuff but with web components or
in this case custom elements you can do
that and the last ones HTML imports
which once you have your custom element
done you just import it into the
document and it's used when needed the
big promo HTML imports is right now that
they're synchronous so the more custom
elements you do the lower the slower the
first load will be so we have to find
ways around that but it's really tricky
maybe some worker thing worked out there
with service workers we could do that I
think how far down the line are we with
this as re componentized yet that shows
you like how much is implemented where
and what you can do with it and you can
click through it and read the
documentation and everything so that's
pretty sweet as well now it's good to
last bit of what I want to talk about
and that's dangerous messaging and over
sharing and this is something that
drives me crazy we are so good in
telling people what's broken about the
web because we love to talk to each
other about what's broken this was
telerik the other day saying web
components aren't ready for production
yet very well researched article nice
lots of information in there if you know
your stuff it's really insightful the
tech press will go on that and make the
headline web components are another
fever dream of Google developer work
they love to see us fail I love it like
that the tech press loves to see taare
talk about bad things about html5 and
the web and their whole business model
is the web that people click on ads so
you're shooting your platform in the
foot here that actually is not fair
enough but this is a dangerous dangerous
thing we keep telling people this
technology is not ready here's the 15
things that don't work yes true let's
fix those things let's concentrate on
fixing those things behind the scenes
with pull requests with with bug filed
with trying things out and sending your
test results back to browser makers we
all want to hear this stuff we know
what's broken we just want to know how
to fix it and we need real data and real
users to fix it for you so when I
tweeted about this this was hilarious
because while M components aren't ready
for production yet and the first thing
by Alex Russell from google was like so
much fu d and then it sparked a slight
discussion and a bit more discussion and
a bit more discussion and this is like
the who is who of people in web
components that was going on there i
picked exactly randomly the right time
where everybody went apeshit on that and
it was just wonderful because this is
good but it's in public so the evil tech
press can go there now oh the microsoft
guy said that is broken the google
psycho's guy said that is broken if we
went to drop interviews like we describe
our technology to people we would never
get a job you know we would be the only
the first thing we were over excited
like i'm the best thing your company
whatever half everybody else just makes
it disappointed but I steel toilet rolls
and from time to time I don't wash
myself and like you know we're so
excited about telling each other what's
broken rather than celebrate what's
working and make good things with it and
make real products out of it so let's
enable creation and we talked about that
they introduce it as earlier it's it's
super rewarding to teach and I promise
all of you you start teaching and you
end up learning I used JavaScript
professionally for five years before I
wrote my first javascript book oh my god
I realized I've know nothing about the
language spin although I used it and
that's even worse nowadays it the other
day i defined the stack overflow
developer full stack overflow developer
because so many people are just copying
and pasting results from sec overflow
without ever knowing what they're doing
but at the same time tell you that
they're soft skills better than yours
it's quite fun so one of the things we
have in Mozilla is webmaker and this is
very basic with things like x-ray
goggles which is just telling people
that hTML is not fixed but you can
actually play with it popcorn maker to
remix videos on the web thimble to
actually zach is a code editor and a
result next to each other
and it has error messages that are real
human readable and a lot of times we
just build little projects for them to
get people started with HTML and we make
mistakes in those and the description
like in commons is how to fix the thing
and the more you fix the code the better
to display on the other side gets this
is all our lives we don't code we debug
that's what we do eighty percent of our
times we might as well get people
started with that as well because it's
much more rewarding than like oh I put
hello world on the screen error is going
to be pay your billions for that so I
think with web components and reusable
things in the browser in our platform
such height that such high fidelity what
you see is what you get is not a dirty
word anymore it's not what you so
intensely wished you'd gotten which it
used to be it's just something we can do
app maker is basically a drag-and-drop
applicant generator and with a button
you can package it up as an eight as a
html5 application send it to a Firefox
or Android device why not why does
everybody need to learn things and why
does everybody need to have a mac and go
to the command line to write CSS they
want to build apps a lot of cases these
apps can be just simple things that are
boiler plates as I said wix com and
other people make money with that we
might as well build really cool things
out there I want to see the the old
school portal kind of apps go away and
use web components instead and all of
these here like in app maker all of the
ed chat room and the beat spaces chat
output or a button the things down there
every single one of them is a web
component that went back to a repository
of components as well none of this is
inside only app maker it just goes out
and can be used in all the others
because google also released at that
designer for polymer for the new paper
design and this stuff looks beautiful if
you haven't looked at it yet it's
gorgeous it's like really wonderful and
this is just a drag-and-drop thing to
put it together and get the coat back
why not start with that in a meeting to
iterate this way with so much faster
than integrating with code and showing
each other how fast we are and how good
we are encoding to each other this is a
an editor for the phaser html5 game
editing suite
why not I love games in the past that
had editors directly in them we should
have more of those makes it makes more
sense than waiting for the next level or
having to pay extra for the next level
inside the app I think it's time to step
up for us and to realize that we've run
away from our end users we are in this
echo chamber where we get each other
excited about problems that don't really
exist that much where it's really end
users out there have completely
different questions and completely
different problems be nosy look at how
people use their phones look at people
over people's shoulders how they use
their computers find out what the
problems are when people get stuck
somewhere people download apps because
they don't find a website that does the
right thing for them and we have a
chance to do that we can iterate much
much faster than anybody else the web
can like iterate so much faster than any
other platform out there but not if we
make every single thing that we put on a
website dependent on Ruby and sass and
fifty thousand build scripts and like
knowing these kind of things these are
cool tools these are great tools to use
but they should not be the starting
point don't frustrate people that want
to get into our world because we have a
lot of people to hire and we have a lot
of work to do so people should get
excited about it and not be like okay
I'm not as intelligent as those guys I'm
never going to work there this is
frustrating there's not a good idea so
be awesome do like amazing things have
your spaceships write them talk to each
other about spaceships but do it at
spaceship conventions don't do it in
public don't tell people that everything
is broken just because we have so much
inside I'm the other day somebody asked
me so Chris with you didn't work for
Mozilla where would you work and I have
a problem with that because I have so
much insight into other companies none
of them seems interesting any longer and
it just sounds arrogant but like every
one of us knows things about their
company they don't like and with each
other we talk to each other about this
so if we actually we're sharing the bad
things again like maybe going into a
company and other people hate I would be
successful there and would love being
there so let's celebrate the good things
that are going on with our environment
let's celebrate that we are independent
that we could work from home that we
let's demand from our man
just that we work from home from time to
time so we're allowed to have a social
life I found that an honest engineer
somebody who cares about the product
that they build working from home is the
most effective person out there you have
to remind them to go to bed and stop
working you don't have to drag them into
the office and caffeinate them and give
them extra money to incite them to do
more work we love our work we love
coding we don't love sitting in meetings
with business managers that don't know
what we're doing but we still have to do
this all the time so let's think about
not spending money on like business
facilities but how to coach our people
to be independent and also think about
twenty-four seven coverage by being in
other countries from time to time lots
of things to think about so to take in
what you hear today look at all the
other talks as great stuff coming up but
think about it not the way like oh my
god this is broken oh my god I can never
be using that but think about how I can
how can I use that today what can I do
when I can I take from this talk that I
explain to other people in a simple
language instead of telling them you
need 15 libraries to make it work and
that's all I had so thanks very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
