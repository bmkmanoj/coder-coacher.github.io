I'll let them introduce themselves no my
name is probably unpronounceable to most
of you I'm Portuguese so my name is Nick
cuts that I usually people go by just my
initials are see I'm Chris I handle a
lot of the infrastructure for
CyanogenMod I've been involved in the
project for a long time shouldn't go
ahead and warn you guys one of my things
when I'm doing stuff like this is people
taking pictures of me I'll take a
picture of you this might look kind of
funny yeah and I'm Brent crumble I'd
only go by Beckett I'm a device
maintainer for a few of the devices in
cm alright so I kind of want to start
off talking and talk about where CM fits
into the Android landscape because
there's two very distinct sides so let's
uh so now we all know that Android is
open right we all say androids open in
fact it's so open that it's kind of
twisted the definition of open Android
runs with of Linux right so everyone
knows that Linux license under the GPL
get new public license so if you make
changes to the Linux kernel you have to
release those changes to your users
right so now the Android platform it's
licensed completely differently uses the
apache license so you can copy that you
can modify it redistribute it and you
have no obligation to make any of your
changes available to anybody at all the
only thing that you have to do under the
apache license is make sure that you
preserve the notices and attributions
that are in any source code or in any
text files or whatever that comes with
the source code that you downloaded
so pretty much anybody can go and just
download the Android source from
Google's get servers for free
compile it use the build a phone or a
tablet you can make if they make changes
to the Linux kernel cab they have to
open those up but if they made changes
to Android to suit their device there
there's thanks to the apache license
nothing else they have to do so you know
that's that's pretty great if you're
trying to build a phone or a tablet you
know you can use whatever you want but
you know if you want to just go and
download it and you want to play around
with it yourself for mere mortals right
well what are you gonna do with it what
are you gonna run on so well there's a
couple of things you can do um well you
can build the emulator I mean but I mean
how fun is the emulator I mean it's
pretty crappy to begin with but I mean
it's it's gotten better all right if
there's anybody here from Google but but
it's it's still not the greatest thing
in the world well you can build her own
phone all right so let's build a phone
right I mean that's great but that's not
in the realm of things that most of us
can do well maybe you just want to
install Android on the phone you have
you know maybe you think that you know
there's something that that pisses you
off about the way it works that you want
to just go ahead and change you know or
you know you just want to play around
and see how it works again you think the
codes cool well it's open right you
should be able to do that well this is
kind of where that word open starts to
get a little bit fuzzy so we like to
think of what we call Android as a as a
piece of software but really what
everybody else thinks of it as it's a
combination of hardware and software so
how many people here have actually how
many people here have actually
downloaded Android and compiled it all
right
all right all right all right so you
know it's got support for a couple of
devices you can build it for Google's
Nexus phones sorta for the Motorola Xoom
sort of and I think the g1 is supported
up until like Froyo so these devices are
Google's flagship devices they're the
Google Experience devices they're
designed to be what Google thinks
Android should be and they're designed
to set an example for manufacturers that
want to use Android to create their own
devices so a really great thing about
these phones is that you can just get
them you can compile the Android you can
install Android on it you know they have
um their unlockable you can install
whatever you want on them no problem so
Google's gone they've released this
insane massive amount of code anybody
can download and given the resources
they can build a device if they want and
in doing so they've totally disrupted
the entire mobile industry in all the
companies that were these great mobile
giants they're basically burning
carcasses at this point and it's because
all this technology that was once
considered totally proprietary it's just
open anybody can use it
it's totally available that's easy so
anybody who wants to use it so of course
you have a business plan behind that and
that's advertising licensing proprietary
services but you know we're not gonna
delve too deep into that right now but
if you just want to build Android it's
open right you should be able to just
build it well this is where things start
to give a little bit a little bit fuzzy
yeah even more fuzzy
well in the real world hardware
manufacturers are really in a incredibly
competitive environment so suddenly they
all have this code base that they can
work on and they have this huge need to
differentiate their devices they need to
stand out they need to be immediately
recognizable so they start building new
features they change the look and feel
they start adding all these third-party
apps it you may or may not want so
they're free to use anything they want
they can use any trade secrets
proprietary technology whatever there's
no requirement for them to release any
code other than the Linux kernel because
of the way Android is licensed it's
pretty beautiful actually you know
Google's really accomplished their goal
there the bad part is that with these
devices other than the Google phones the
Nexus phones is that even if you could
build your own OS for them you can't
easily install it the bootloader stops
you from doing that
you need a cryptographic signature from
the manufacturer to install the software
on the hardware that you bought so
basically what you have is something
that's totally proprietary it's not open
it's pretty much the opposite of open
you paid quite a bit of money for it all
right well in defense of these
manufacturers all the competition and
the accelerated rate of development that
Android is enabled it's really pushed
the state-of-the-art forward it's why
there's a new device that comes out
every month that has another core or it
has another gig of ram or it has you
know whatever super feature from the
future I mean these software innovations
are really pushing the state of our the
state of the art forward and they are
they're shaping mobile and they're
shaping the future of Android but so
where does way to see em fit into this
and where does a user fit into this so
you the we all have the code to Android
we all have the same code that these
guys are building office all right so
there's a little story so when when I
first got the g1 I think I got it on
launch day um I knew a little bit about
Android
I hadn't really done much mobile stuff
in fact I've done no mobile stuff at
that point I knew it ran Linux and I was
pretty intrigued by that
so like the good gentle user I was at
the time I immediately wanted to build
the entire OS from scratch myself well
that was actually possible and it was
doable and there were a ton of other
people doing the same thing and there
was a pretty great community that was
kind of rising out of the ashes of
Windows Mobile on XDA developers so
everybody there was kind of playing off
of each other's work and you know remix
it and building new bigger things and
working from source code maybe not
working from source code but really
great things are coming out of it so I
kind of got involved in that I decided
to put one of my builds up there one day
and the response just blew me away it's
really good in like 24 hours there were
like five thousand posts on the thread
that I started and it was really
motivating so two years later here we
are and the same ROM has two and a half
million users and hundreds of people
contributing to it from all over the
world so incredibly excited about that
so what is cm what is sign Janardan so I
call it a Android distribution just like
Ubuntu or jennszoo our distributions of
Linux for commodity desktop hardware cm
is a distribution
of Android for commodity smartphones and
tablets right there's no difference
there's still computers right so it's
meant to bridge the gap between the open
spirit of Android and the stuff that you
can actually buy today since we not many
people in this room can go out and build
their own Hardware right now it's
available for something like a hundred
shipping devices and these are just the
things that we support there's way more
than that that you know maybe have one
or two features that aren't quite
perfect but you can still compile them
yourself if you want so it doesn't
include any bloatware none of these
little third-party apps that the that
the manufacturers think are so valuable
and you know of course we're making them
tons of money but for most of us we
don't need them it's fast it's got lots
of great features and the best thing is
that you can make it to anything you
want you can customize it you can modify
it so it's really made for developers
and advanced users but more recently
we've kind of gotten away from the
feature creep and really focused on what
we think is the best parts of what we
have and we really want to deliver a
really great experience when you install
cm so in that respect it's pretty mom
friendly I'd have my mom run it I would
the best thing about cm is the community
that's kind of sprung up around it
people here and that's awesome that's
more people than I've ever spoken for
before we have two and a half million
users that's unique users these are and
these are unique devices these aren't
just people that wipe their phone and
reinstalled it these are actually unique
devices and these are actually just the
people that have chosen to opt into the
stats reporting
and that's freaking awesome
it totally blows my mind no idea that it
was going to end up something like this
I mean it's like we all just do this for
fun I mean this is kind of like we kind
of consider this like a little like
niche project that we just do for fun
but I mean you know we just do in our
spare time and you know suddenly we
actually have what you would a lot of
people would call market share right
users a pretty decent number right yeah
all right so here's a here's a graph of
the number of devices that we actually
have official support for that you can
just go to our download and write that
you can just go and download um so it's
somewhere around what 89 and that's that
doesn't include all the devices that we
actually have support for that you could
actually compile for that's not all the
targets you can compile for these are
just all the devices that that we think
are ready for you to use and we think
everything works and you know you're not
gonna have a problem and want to smash
it on the ground because you installed
some custom ROM and something doesn't
work and or GPS leaves you off a cliff
or something all right so um this is the
number of users that we're adding every
day right now it's something like it's
not it's something like 12,000 new users
a day I don't even know what to say to
that
all right so so why would you want to
use this well maybe you're a control
freak like the rest of us and you want
to have complete control of the device
that you paid for and you paid quite a
bit of money for now this includes root
access to the device this enables a
whole new realm of apps that that you
can create now we use the latest release
of Android when we're building cmcm 9 is
based on Android 4.0.4 cm 7 is still
based on gingerbread but we're trying to
move everything forward we do nightly
built so if you want you can get a new
build every day and a lot of people do
and based on our stats we have half a
million users that just use Knightley's
so that's pretty good there's tons of
cool features there's a theme engine so
you can turn your phone pink or purple
with one of our C's themes we have a
lock screen widget if T $9 custom
launcher there's tons of little features
that you'll find in there that you know
you're just like oh well that's awesome
that's so also it's open source so
there's no surprises so you're not gonna
find any secret software that's running
in the background that's capturing your
keystrokes and sending them off to some
remote server and if there were we give
you the source code for it
so for developers I think most of us are
developers in this room here so if
you're not using cm you really need to
be using cm the biggest reason why is
because since you have the exact source
code to the firmware that's running on
your device if you're running an app
that you're having problems with you can
actually debug that app all the way down
with a bare metal I mean you can debug
it down to the curl layer if you're that
crazy I mean this is this is this is
really great I mean I have on every
Android product I've worked on I've
probably found at least one bug in the
framework itself and its it's pretty
maddening and being able to do this and
actually know what's going on see what's
happening it's it's kind of necessary
it's also you also learn a lot when you
do it and if you're working a native
code it's really the only way to do it
and that kind of brings us around to the
real reason for doing all this is that
if there's something that you don't like
you can just change it right so maybe
it's just like something in the UI that
you know like you know maybe like
there's a cancel in an OK button that
are swapped right and you don't like
that well I mean you can just change it
super easy and you can just load the
entire platform I knew Eclipse change it
installed on your device and see the
change right away it's super easy and
you don't need to buy a special device I
mean if you want to get under carrier
subsidy I mean sure if you want to do
that you can't but hopefully if you do
make some of these cool changes you'll
contribute it back and everybody can
benefit from it so there's a lot of
stuff that you you know it's not perfect
there's a lot of stuff that I would like
to see added to it but kind of keeps me
motivated and it's a lot of fun to work
on
it's a lot of fun to to to see your work
go out to so many people and that's
really why I I do what I do because I
can get it in the hands of so many
people so easily and you know if you
ever worked on a project where you know
you did a bunch of work and I got canned
it's pretty it's it's pretty miserable
nobody want to do that yeah so our goal
is really to take all this great
hardware that these companies like
Samsung and HTC and Sony Ericsson are
making and crack it open and kind of
bring back some of the open spirit that
Android is really all about and make it
work the way you want all right so so
how do we do this
so I'm gonna get a little bit technical
but not too technical just kind of want
to talk about some of the some of the
things that that we have to do to to
support Android to new device now this
is this is the same thing that a
manufacturer would do we're not doing
anything different so Android it's not
like Windows or a bun - or any other
desktop OS you can't just get Android
and install it and think that it's gonna
work because it's pretty much the
opposite of that I mean this is this is
designed for a a limited device although
these devices aren't really limited
anymore but there's no there's no magic
drivers that load in the background or
anything like that the entire OS is
totally customized specifically for the
hardware that's right on and the
hardware is moving insanely fast in
every month there's you know another
core or Ram whatever so it's really not
uncommon for a manufacturer to release a
dozen devices in you know the span of
like three months and a lot of the times
they're exactly the same with some minor
variations but really when you look
inside there
variations uncommon system-on-a-chip
platforms right so there are running
things like Qualcomm Snapdragon or TI
OMAP hexina s-- or Tegra so what a
manufacturer is gonna do when they're
designing one of these devices is
they're gonna start with with one of
these platforms you know based on the
specifications and requirements that
they have so the final product that
you're gonna buy might be totally locked
down the chipset manufacturer that they
originally based a product on they still
development kits that you can just go
and buy you can buy dragon board or you
can buy a panda board you know with a no
map chipset you can buy an Origin board
right and the chipset vendor they also
make the code open-source because
they're pretty much founded on the
concept of engineering and you know they
want to they really want to sell great
hardware and see it used so they're also
open sourcing most of the code at least
enough to get it up and running and work
with it so we do in cm we have a whole
bunch of different devices to support
all the way across the spectrum so we do
is we take this code for these reference
platforms and we merge it together so
there's lots of gifting and other
barriers and things like that that we do
but once it's all together um it's
usually the case where we can get one
device in that class of devices up and
running it usually means that we'll be
able to get maybe a dozen others running
so pretty often if you follow cm device
support or anything like that you'll see
one device come up like you saw recently
we did like the the Samsung skyrocket
and you know also like the Hercules and
the galaxy note like all at the same
time because we got the chipset support
for that family of devices going
so plus the chips have support the
manufacturers have to supply the source
code for the Linux kernel so once we
have those we can usually at least get a
device booting it might not work very
well but at least we can get the booting
and we can take it from there so we have
a good foundation to start with so if
someone decides to port cm to a new
device what do they have to do well
there's a whole bunch of subsystems
beyond these chips have support kernel
support that needs to work
so Linux is kind of running the show so
yeah the source code to Linux and most
of the subsystems are pretty
straightforward so touchscreens
input Bluetooth Wi-Fi through all
standard Linux stuff there's not really
any magic there maybe there there there
might be some some difference in kernel
versions that comes into play but for
the most part that's pretty
straightforward now Android has a
hardware abstraction layer what it's
designed to do is provide a common
interface between the framework and the
hardware so how it's not perfect now is
very immature how basically supports the
vendors at Google's worked with so when
other manufacturers are trying to build
their hardware what happens is they just
hack the hell out of it and do whatever
they want they extend the how modify the
framework whenever they got to do to get
their stuff working so that's that's
actually great and it's kind of dragging
things forward you know new versions of
Android support things like composition
bypass and all these features it you
know certain vendors have have
introduced to support their particular
platforms to make them fast
well you know it's all pushing
everything forward
just one note about this regarding the
the halls and the fact that vendors kept
extending them this is actually a ended
up generating a feedback loop in which
Google is taking some of the
modifications that the vendors and the
the silicon manufacturers are doing and
integrating it back into Android yes and
one of the main reasons that ICS now is
being a bit more troublesome than usual
to get running on the families of
devices we support is because the shift
between Android 2.3 and Android 4.0
includes a lot of this kind of work by
Google they are doing a lot of extension
and adding extensibility to that the
hardware abstraction layer in order to
facilitate facilitates these hardware
manufacturers to do their own magic
stuffs in the devices they do yeah so
even though they're hacking the heck out
of Android you know they they're really
pushing Android forward to so it it
really is a combination of hardware and
software you know it's not just it's not
just software like I think we think it
is so but fortunately for for our
purposes most of these how about
mutations you know with things like
graphics basic audio if you get the
route the reference platform code it's
available so you have something at least
basics to start with so let's um let's
kind of go through a couple of things
that uh that we have to deal with in
order to to get to get something running
so number one it's gonna be graphics now
GPU drivers for things like Adreno and
Mally
they're totally proprietary unless you
work for the manufacturer of that
hardware
you know like Qualcomm you you'll never
see that code even if you even if you
work for Samsung or Sony years and
you'll still never see the code
they are you know these are their
graphics drivers that's it and on top of
the GPU now these are limited systems so
they need to do some clever things in
order to make everything nice and fast
so what you see on most devices are what
we call an overlay engine and what the
overlay engine does is it can take video
from some other chip on the device and
display it right on the screen all right
like the camera app is gonna do that or
playing back video or it could do
hardware display in composition and this
is a big thing in ICS is that what
vendors are doing is they are getting
information from the hardware
abstraction layer and then deciding how
to render the display so they're not
just sending it to the GPU to render it
what they're doing is they're splitting
it up figuring out exactly what's on the
screen and maybe sending it down these
special pipes to this special overlay
engine now you know really engine it's
got all these weird restrictions like
it's not just gonna take like a regular
RGB buffer it's gonna be in some weird
format you know maybe it can't handle
rotation there's gonna be all kind of
limitations on it but when it works it
works really well and they try and make
it work really well for the for the best
case so a lot of this is video so the
graphics code that you see NCM it's
pretty much identical to the reference
code that we're gonna get from a chipset
vendor but what's painful for us is that
the user space code is going to be tied
very tightly to the kernel it's also
going to be tied tightly to the hardware
revision and capabilities so it takes us
a little bit of time to figure out
exactly what works and because of the
tight coupling often we'll get code from
like the kernel dropped from the
manufacturer we'll have ancient code
from like six months ago where the
device or the chipset vendor is you know
shipping zero day stuff and they have
this really you know this really amazing
way of doing stuff but you can't exactly
use it because protocol
doesn't match so you have to go in and
in most cases what we do is we'll pull
in the newest code and figure out
exactly what needs to be there update
you know everything else and goes along
with the systems make it all work and
try and get the latest and greatest
going alright so number two my favorite
thing is audio so if you haven't noticed
your phone has lots of different inputs
and outputs you have multiple
microphones multiple speakers noise
noise an echo cancellation Hardware
chips that are dedicated to that some
devices have digital signal processors
whatever
there's aux inputs and outputs there
might be Bluetooth so basically audio
routing functionality it's it's handled
it android takes care of most of it if
you're gonna switch from a call to music
it can do that now it's gonna switch
from a call with echo cancellation to
music over Bluetooth maybe you can't do
that so well so the reference code
usually contains basic stuff that runs
on top of Android that handles that
policy on how to switch things it also
handles the things like talking to the
hardware itself because it's pretty
non-standard in a lot of cases they're
the the interface of the audio hardware
it's not it's not also it's not anything
that you think that it is it's actually
calling out to a separate chip or
separate processor doing remote
procedure calls you know crazy stuff in
order to do things just like to change
the volume I mean you're starting to see
it also happen more often but it's not
that it's not the standard case it's but
hopefully we'll see more of that and you
know the chips will be built more up to
open standards but if we don't do it
right you know maybe your Bluetooth
headphones won't work maybe if you call
your mom it's gonna sound like you're
underwater
and you know that's not very usable if
your phone can be a phone and do things
it has to do it's pretty useless right
so we have to make sure all this stuff
works so we have to go in and take the
code that is supplying the reference
platform that's applied any Android we
have to make all that audio routing work
and we have to figure out what the
manufacturer did to you know make to
make it work to begin with so cameras
and media so they're pretty nice to have
and they always rely on dedicated
hardware so there is dedicated hardware
that handles media encoding and encoding
on all your phones all your tablets and
usually a separate piece of hardware
running its own little OS that you'll
never get to see the inside of
fortunately there's a there's an API
called open max that bridges to Hardware
coders from software that wants to talk
to them now it's available for most
systems but this is another place where
like the how it gets extended like crazy
and packed into bits in order to get
good performance maybe you need to get
data from one device to another in a
special way like they might be sharing
memory so you don't want to have to copy
that data from from you know from one
memory segment to the other that would
just kill your framerate so it needs to
take into account all the circumstances
so you see a lot of changes in the
framework because of that but it's
pretty straightforward
my camera's cameras are painful cameras
are the hardest thing that we have to
deal with in cm and if we're going to
call it a bi-stable and it has a camera
the camera spork so the drivers are
cameras they're never open source
and the biggest problem is that the
abstraction between the camera hardware
and Android sucks in ICS it got that
much better but it's still pretty awful
and the problem is is that because of
this the camera driver itself depends on
internal parts of Android and those
parts change with every release so they
might they might depend on you know some
internal memory allocator inside of
Android
they might depend on how Android passes
native windows around from one
application to the other and there's no
way for us to easily fix that now
there's a couple of cases where we've
created wrappers for these things or
we've you know our C's created some
camera wrappers or for some older
devices we've totally in reverse
engineered the drivers and gotten those
working but you know it's it's pretty
guaranteed that if we try and take a
device from one version of Android to
the next and try and use those old
camera drivers they never work they will
never work they never have worked even
once that I can think of so in that case
we're kind of at the mercy of the vendor
to hopefully get us updated drivers and
firstly there has been one vendor that's
actually worked with us on this
that was actually Sony Ericsson they
actually built drivers specifically
without their proprietary stuff for a
new version of Android for us and that's
how we have like nearly perfect support
for a Sony Ericsson devices so last but
not least is the cell radio and GPS
hardware which are the most important
things in the device you carry around
your pocket every day well there are
black boxes there's we have no
visibility of these things so radio
hardware it's actually a dedicated
standalone processor
just kind of does its own thing usually
runs a real-time operating system and
the only way that you can talk to it is
over like a remote procedure call like
RPC type mechanism it's the only
visibility you have into it so Android
fortunately provides radio interface
layer and there's two sides to this
there's a Java side and there's a native
side so the room let's the Java side
talk to the native side but Google isn't
exactly a cellular carrier type company
so they're kind of relying on these
vendors to define the specs so they go
absolutely crazy with it in shipping
devices and sometimes it's totally
different you know if you have a if you
have a Galaxy s2 for t-mobile and a
galaxy s2 for AT&amp;amp;T the low level code is
totally different
well the good thing about the rail is
that it's pretty well defined on the
Java side it's pretty debuggable you can
see when things are failing so what
we've done is we've taken the rim
we know we need to adapt it for multiple
vendors we figured out the problems that
something like a Qualcomm device that's
on HTC versus some Sony Ericsson device
or you know some TI device so we
subclass the rill and we have all the
little different tweaks for the
different carriers vendors device
combinations whatever we load that up at
runtime and it works and it doesn't
affect other devices it's a pretty good
solution
so all right so now hypothetically we've
made all this hardware work but there's
something that may or may not have stood
in our way from the beginning and that's
the bootloader lock so from the
perspective of someone who's trying to
make these things work and do things
that they're not supposed to do the
bootloader lock is our worst enemy so
this is a security measure I guess that
it requires a cryptographic signature on
the firmware so the bootloader has some
special key and it needs to authenticate
the firmware in the only way that you
can flash firmware on a lock device is
if it's signed by the manufacturers key
well this is pretty horrible and if you
want to install CM you need to be able
to install and sign firmware period
there's no other way to do it so the
situation is kind of getting better but
it's still pretty bad so devices that
are there's quite a few devices out
there that are pretty much impenetrable
and they actually will do things like
verify the code at runtime so even if
you actually managed to get the code on
there it won't execute it motorola so
these are the devices with the worst CM
support so if you want to run cm don't
buy these devices in fact don't buy them
at all
so there's lots of other devices out
there that are pretty much wide open
they let you modify the things that you
need to do or that you would actually
want to modify and they kind of get it
and so these are the devices we have the
best scene of support for so there's
some that are kind of in the middle like
HTC that sort of let you unlock some but
not others and then there's something
like the Nexus phones that are kind of
the best of both worlds that let you
they actually let you lock it and they
let you unlock it and and relock it and
when you unlock it it actually wipes
your phone right so if I stole our
seized phone from his bag and I had no
way to get in there and I thought oh I
can just fastboot OEM unlock and get to
data well it's not gonna wipe the device
so I can't get anything from it but when
you unlock it and you go ahead and
install a custom ROM you can actually
unlock it there I'm sorry you can relock
it afterwards so you can risa cure it
and sort of enforce that again and
depending on the way that you flash the
firmware you can still do signature
tracking and all that and it's still
pretty secure I mean it's really the
best system and I wish all the vendors
would pick it up but you know it's kind
of a camera uphill battle so I think
none of these protection schemes I have
actually lasted the test of time at all
all of them have been cracked there's
some notable Motorola devices that you
know they they actually stop code
execution and not just flashing so
that's kind of a you know a really crazy
level of protection that nobody else is
doing so now none of us are really
involved in actually breaking bootloader
protection schemes but what happens
we're not exactly sad because it means
that we felt like we now have access to
a new device that we can run cm-1
all right so what are the crap that we
have to deal with there's a lot of
proprietary code I'm not I'm not gonna
say that we're super open-source and you
know everything's been
reverse-engineered and everything's
happy and shiny but there's there's a
lot of proprietary code usually revolves
around the radio subsystem so if you
download cm or more more if you want to
build cm what you'll need to do is we
need to plug in your device you'll need
to run a script that pulls a handful of
files from the device and uses them
during the build and you know these are
gonna be the the binary blobs you know
that we call them you know they're kind
of needed to build a working system
there's gonna be the the OpenGL drivers
you know stuff for the radio we we try
to exclude everything that we can but
unfortunately it's just the way things
are and if you want to run your own OS
in this what you have to deal with um
another issue is that now the
manufacturers are releasing kernel code
but it's a mess
they don't actually release the actual
code that they used to build the device
it's been scrubbed down you know
comments or remove from the code make
sure that you know there's nothing
that's it reveals their internal
development process totally cool makes
sense but at the same time what usually
happens is that they strip out all
support for any other devices so if you
download a kernel for galaxy s2 on AT&amp;amp;T
it probably doesn't support anything
else if you download a kernel for the
HTC Sensation unless HTC made a mistake
and left code in for another device it's
only gonna support the agency sensation
nothing else even though during their
internal process it supported 20 other
they've deleted all that and there's
there's no changelog it's really just a
tarball of a bunch of code no
identifying information so since there's
a lot of advices in the same family what
we try to do is we try to take the code
and we try and combine it together so in
cm maybe you'll see a kernel that can be
used on like five or six different
devices they're all similar same chip
site family um see manufacturer but we
put it back together and that's actually
how the manufacturer probably had it to
begin with but they made it difficult
for us we fixed it so now when a new
version of Android comes out like
probably jellybean this week hopefully
it's insanely difficult for us to
integrate and this is a problem that
every manufacturer faces and that's why
it takes so long for you to get an
upgrade from 104 one version of Android
to another even if you're running stock
so because google writes too much
freaking code like the releases are huge
and nobody knows what's actually in them
when when ICS came out it was even worse
for us because we didn't have the source
code for honeycomb so we pretty much
started over yeah we could we we
couldn't upgrade cm7 to ICS it was it
was too hard week had customize the M
sub C m7 so much that merging ICS into
it it was just impossible it just we can
do it and on top of that I mean they
took a lot of our features a lot of we
need to do so we were happy so I mean so
I mean we started over we reevaluate at
everything it was good for us because
you know we we ended up with a better
product
so the last issue and this is this is
really frustrating if you if you
contribute to cm and you you find issues
in Android itself maybe or you know even
if you're just working on Android as a
you know as an on seeing a person is
that there's no visibility into what's
coming next
none no idea what's coming everything's
kept closed until Google decides to
release it so they just open everything
all once and there you go
so sometimes maybe we'll find a bug and
you know in stage front or we'll find
some rendering bug or whatever upload
the fixed to the AOSP code review system
and then they'll say well we already did
this yeah it's already done it's in some
magic internal branch that you can't see
so we can't merge it and you can't even
get it out there to the people that are
working off of ESP master branch because
they're not gonna merge it because they
have it in some magic branch inside and
don't even think about trying to upload
a feature because if it's not on the
roadmap it's totally pointless to even
try you know just sit there nobody even
look at it
and you know if you if you bump it
enough times maybe you'll get an ask to
reply or something but you know new
features you know you from an as an
outsider you'll never get them in so
you're better off just submitting them
see honestly I mean it's it's it's
pretty frustrating so we have a lot of
challenges to overcome in androids open
but it's not exactly the friendly kind
of open alright so and that's the
technical side so internally we we run
our project a lot differently from most
open source projects that you that you
see so we have a core team
and we have a public relations team and
we also have device maintainer teams so
the core team consists of a handful of
guys myself Chris and feel guys our job
is we keep the infrastructure going and
make the policies set the direction for
the project we merge all the incoming
patches and we try to keep everybody
else coordinated so we do other things
too but as leaders of CM that's what we
try to do herding cats
yes herding cats now we have a PR team
it's headed up by ABS like Dakota swirl
his team they maintain the forums the
website they write all the documentation
on our wiki they do the release
announcements they handle bug reports
they manage our social network presence
and basically I do all the things
engineers don't do and will never do and
they suck at and these guys are you know
it swirls way better than you
so we also have the device maintainer
teams and these are the guys that make
cm work they do all the porting work
they're the ones that are interested in
taking a device and bring it from stock
to CM opening it up and we have a whole
bunch of these teams sometimes it's just
one person sometimes it's 20 people
working on one device every team they
handle a device sometimes they handle
family devices sometimes there's right
now I think we have there there's one
team that's doing all the international
Samsung devices we have a team that's
doing most of the Samsung tablets we
have teams that are doing US Samsung
devices we have guys that are doing all
the LG devices we have we have guys who
are doing all Sony Ericsson devices so
there's always little subgroups inside
of inside SEM and they we don't we don't
try and make them work any specific way
so whatever works for them if they want
to work in secret until everything's
ready you know if that works for them
let them do it
you know this whole this whole sort of
modding community its kind of its kind
of competitive and you know it's uh it's
it's it's it's tough when everybody is
trying to use everybody else's work and
bring something out there and everybody
wants to get their name known and so
whatever if it works that's how it's
gonna work
so a road map doesn't really exist you
know we have we have some ideas about
where we want to see cm go and we sort
of set some some leadership and some
goals maybe we have some ideas for the
app you know couple weeks ago I wrote
all these features I don't want to see
in our camera app but you know in
reality it's just kind of when it's
ready you know we're really just a bunch
of volunteers I mean we're not a
business we're not here to make money
we're doing it because we think that
it's necessary you know maybe that's a
little cocky but we think it's necessary
to sort of maintain maintain the balance
between users and everybody else right
so I mean it's a lot of fun to I mean
it's it's it's a lot of fun to pick up
one of these devices and pour to Android
to it and see it work and figure out all
the internals of it and you know just
and also get it out to all these people
that are anxious to use it
I mean we're spending a lot of free time
on this and I mean we don't really want
any more stress in our lives so you know
when it's ready now past these main
teams we have I don't even know the
number I mean there's probably in the
hundreds now of people that just
contribute code and really this is where
all the cool stuff that you see and see
em comes from like it's not on a road
map it's you know nobody really has it
in mind it's just you know somebody is
taking a shower one day and they have a
great idea they sit down and decide to
code it you know you know I'm really
impressed with this I mean sometimes
I'll go into the code review system and
you'll see this totally amazing feature
and I'm like yes perfect
and it's so easy I get involved I mean
anybody here can get involved I mean if
you if you see something that you don't
like about your phone you can just
change it you can just check out the
code start hacking install it and it
does exactly what you want
all right so maybe I convinced you to
UCM if you're not already so here's some
resources that you can use get that see
em that's where you can download see em
that's the front end to our mirror
network if you want to know if your
device is supported you can just go to
get cm and look in the sidebar and
you'll see code names and more recently
you also see the actual name of your
device and if it's there and it's
supported we have a wiki there's tons of
information there
there's detailed instructions for
building cm yourself
installing CM on your device there's
information about the project how we
work how to contribute and tons of other
information about just sort of this
general side of Android in general we
have a way of the forms and just simple
forum dot CyanogenMod calm there's
thousands of people online at any given
hour of the day it's really active it's
probably the best place to get to get
help with some issue that you're having
with in sewing cm or may be working on
something working on some future we'll
see github and get up is awesome we have
a we've an organization on there we have
something like 440 projects on our
github organization and you know it's
kind of if you load up get up calm
CyanogenMod you'll see an in scene
sidebar with a project list goes on and
on and on and on but every sub project
inside of Android is its own git
repository and every device we support
is its own git repository so there's a
lot of stuff there some of its dead but
probably 90% of it is all active
now our codes on github but don't send
us a pull request because are you gonna
get back is an automated response saying
that we don't actually take bore quests
now as cm grew we couldn't just merge
code from somebody else's repository we
needed to do a proper code review we
needed to we needed to decide on this
stuff and you know dissect it so we
started using Garrett and Garrett is
Garrett is the same platform that AOSP
uses for code review it's awesome it's
totally integrated with git it's super
easy to use and we did a ton of Doc's
on our wiki that will help you get set
up with it if you so choose use the
system and contribute to us and you can
also find us on freenode
so sorry you can also find us on
freenode if you want to if you want to
track any of us down CyanogenMod - dev
we also have a general channel you know
it's mostly full of trolls but at the
same time it's it's it's a lot of fun if
you ever need help you can you can get
some out there alright so one more thing
so this morning we release cm9 rc1
so we did the release for 37 devices and
you know it's a we think it's a pretty
good start
there's probably at least 20 more that
we're aiming for by the final release
which will e be in the next couple of
weeks
yeah you know he's laughing so it'll
probably be next six months but you know
I mean we we really didn't put a lot of
time and work into this and I hope you
guys liked it if you check it out so and
that's it
that's all I have so you know we can we
can do some Q&amp;amp;A and just have some
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
