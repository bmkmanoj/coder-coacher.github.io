we're talking about the hello world
example and again what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna a right ocular world
but the point is really to a make sure
you guys understand that the tools and
how they're configured and also to
understand to dissect this application
and see all the bits and pieces so
that's that's what we're gonna do so
like I said in terms of the tools the
only one you officially need is the SDK
and you get it from
developer.android.com and you would down
go to these steps it's a two part
download so within it you need to
download something else which I'm gonna
show you how to do next the other tool
that you need is eclipse which you would
basically go on the downloads and you
would download the Eclipse
now Eclipse comes in gazillion different
versions or configurations and versions
so the one you want is usually the Java
developers version not the Java EE
version which is twice as big and it's
got its bloated with stuff you're never
gonna need so you want this one and you
probably want the latest indigo which is
pretty good yeah yeah the spring should
be fine as well yeah
yeah if you guys already use like Jo
Eclipse for spring or spring source or
something like that that's fine yeah so
that's that's basically the tools so
with then SDK so let me now explain the
SDK a little bit so if if I if you have
a directory where you unzipped it so
let's say it's a directory like this
right so let me let me close this stuff
out I'll explain things so this would be
that directory that this is what it
looks like right now
there are couple of significant
directories in it within it tools and
platform tools are the tools that you're
going to be you
using these are all the tools that we
need it is very handy to have these two
folders be part of your path okay you
guys know what that means right put it
in your path right it's different like
in Windows you gotta do the control
panel system and then environmental
variables advanced environmental
variables and find that somewhere there
question yes so this would be
underhanded and then under SDK problem
you're looking for the SDK subdirectory
so basically so that's those are the
platform tools what do you have in in
these two are all the tools that you
need now eclipse is really just gonna be
you know when you press a button in
Eclipse it really just calls one of
these tools
so these tools are significant right so
tools and the only difference between
tools and platform tools is that
platform tools tend to depend on a
platform so in other words it may change
between like Gingerbread and honeycomb
and you know Ice Cream Sandwich whereas
those are less dependent on platform but
you usually just care about the union of
these two right so some there's some of
some of the tools here for example DX is
the compiler dalvik right a IDL is for
processing a ID else the interpreter IPC
stuff adb is a tool that we're gonna be
using quite a bit so you want to have
this readily available to you and so
don't worry about all the details I'll
explain them as we keep on going the
other set of tools that we have are more
patent specific simulator me sound
something like you've already done and
so on one of the tools that you're gonna
find is a tool called Android right so
this tool called Android that's in the
tools directory if you kick start it if
you double click on it it's gonna open
up an SDK manager okay so this is now
Android SDK manager
so you started you get it by starting a
tool called Android or you can just go
on a command line and type Android and
if it's
that is gonna bring up a window like
this now I'm saying like this is because
this window substantially changed
recently with the with the release of
ar-15 which is the latest version of
tools so if you're using something like
our 14 this may look slightly different
it does the same job so it doesn't
really matter right but what you're
seeing here is you're seeing what you
have installed or what's potentially
available for additional installation
right so you can see that you have
installed some tools that I kept for
Android for Ice Cream Sandwich I have
installed the documentation as decay
blah blah blah for 3.2 I have installed
this and so forth and so on now their
gazillion things that are installed or
possibly not installed but you don't
need them all you just need to one
single as a platform right so don't go
crazy check everything now and kidding
install install packages because it's
just gonna take a while and it's gonna
consume a lot of you know bandwidth and
all that and you just don't need it you
need at least one like you need one of
these as the case like as SDK platform
I'm gonna be using Ice Cream Sandwich so
that's if you know if I have to pick one
I would pick probably that and say yes
install it right and then that in itself
is kept up on okay MX
so um in addition to the official stuff
that is you know named Android Android
Android you're also gonna see enough
sorry as this name just says decay
platform you're also gonna see the third
party stuff it usually has a little
green plus so for example google api s--
by googling that is that with google
stuff remember I pointed out right so if
you look at if you remember those slides
I said they're all this very version so
I said well Google is one common
modification well that is this one so
this is what Google for Ice Cream
Sandwich this is what Google for
honeycomb etc settle right now in
addition to Google other companies do
their own
additions right Sophie
here's the HTC stuff right so here's
Kyocera support for dual screen here's
you know vo 3d support from LG edk from
Sony Ericsson and so on and so on right
on if you are a third party store
company and you want to get your stuff
in here you you call Google and you get
them to add you to read possibly or you
don't care about that and you just
provide your own repository so certain
companies you know like for example
Cisco they're not here but they're ready
it's readily available on the web so you
can just point to that repo and you can
pull this stuff down okay so so that's
that's what that the manager is now once
you download all this stuff you're gonna
have a subdirectory in your sub
directory here called
platforms and Adams yeah so after tools
and platform tools this is the second
set that's significant that's where your
platforms and the being right so for
example under platforms you see that I
have a whole bunch of platforms I get
three four seven and so on so this
number corresponds to the API level
right supporting is Ice Cream Sandwich
right in C and so on right so the
add-ins directory contains third-party
stuff so basically the only difference
between the add-ons and platforms is
that this is official and this is
unofficial right or it comes from
third-party companies not part of the
Android Open Source Project AOSP so
basically these two sets the union of
those two sets are your possible targets
right that's what you could be
developing for any of these things now
like I said it doesn't matter your sets
are gonna look different than mine
because you probably just have one
platform I don't care how many you have
as long as long as you have at least one
again and that's perfectly fine for all
our purposes for training
so if you specify in the application
that it requires a specific target like
Kyocera dual-screen Adam it's only gonna
run on the device so the market should
filter and not even make it available
unless that something is available yeah
you're getting an invalid connection
error when you run the this tool called
Android so it's possible so this
typically tries to go through HTTPS
because I work a lot behind the
corporate firewalls I usually suggest
going to a preferences enforcing courage
to go HTTP going through HTTP I mean
without test so basically not using the
SSL but sometimes you know that's the
first thing to check with proxies second
option is just make sure you're using a
proxy now our network doesn't have any
any process or anything like that
required but it could be that you're
going through a VPN or something are you
you just connected again so that's one
possibility
yeah why are available factors limited
to four it misses not sure yeah you guys
could simply have a older version of the
tool so this window looks quite
different now they organized it per like
I'm seeing the version first and then
things possible for that version whereas
before it was all kind of like a flat
list so they kind of changed the UI
quite a bit recently so so that's why so
if you install our fifth
you're gonna get these sets of tools
yeah so that's that second part the two
part download right so that's what your
installed in in here and then ultimately
you get those those those directories
yeah now let me just show you one of
these platforms it doesn't really matter
which one I pick because they all pretty
much look the same inside so if I pick
for example Gingerbread Android 10 right
in in a directory like this you're gonna
have these this is your framework right
this is the a IDF file specifying
everything that's available on the
platform at that release none of you
care pretty much on the most important
directory is really the images and
that's where the actual file system
images are right so so this would be
this would be your operating system this
is sort of your main image this file is
usually anywhere between 62 to 300 Meg's
and it's equivalent to for example C
colon backslash Windows right it would
be like where you store all the stuff
user data would be a user data partition
which we're going to talk about and this
is usually this is a ram disk it's
usually tiny that's a high kick stuff
off and then this is the kernel itself
for the emulator okay so those are some
some directories which I'll correlate to
the actual file system once we actually
look at that from the actual device so
that's a that's a high level of what up
SDK looks like and what the platform's
look like and what's inside of the
platform a couple other directors like
for example skins is defines the skins
for your emulator this is very emotive
specific so this is like QVGA and hvga
skin and so on it's not that significant
for the most part some templates for
eclipse in and so on so that's just FYI
in terms of the platforms and adults
there sample code if you don't if you
to download it there may be some sample
code which is just sample applications
and so on okay now that's that's all
that matters right now in terms of the
SDK like I said you guys should add it
to your path if you're adding it to if
you know Windows you do it under control
panel if you're a Mac or Linux you do it
usually as part of the dot but I use
bash so I have a that is a bachelor's
here but I believe and so I add it to
one of my paths here I just forget where
I think I decided here so here's my path
right and I added it to the end of this
path that's right here so just add the
actual directories of stools and there's
we platform toe side question
which one oh say Quinn may or may not be
there but you're not gonna need it
oh maybe if we do end decay so yeah if
we get when we get when we when you
forget to that it depends on how much
how much interest you guys having that
then it we may need it and then I'll
explain what is it's another set of
tools if we need to set up yeah so
that's um you would know if you gave it
in your path if you can just type and
written something happens right and you
don't have to see the into the directory
so that's that now you don't the next
thing you download these eclipses like I
said you would go to eclipse up come or
download the proper version Sun is
falling I'm gonna start my eclipse now
how many of you first first-time users
to eclipse okay properly okay how many
of you would consider yourself power
users alright so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna create a new you know so
typically I'll give you a quick overview
of Eclipse because I usually find that
people you know it's it's very it makes
you super productive once you know some
couple of little tricks so for one I'm
gonna create a workspace where I'm gonna
keep my my work now me typically the
default is something like C colon
backslash workspace or it could be you
know till the Android workspace on the
bias
I'm fits Linux I'm gonna create one just
for this class I'll call it bootcamp
December December 2011 for example and
so I'm gonna create this workspace so
this is where I'm gonna keep all my
projects right so this is now loading
eclipse
normally to do Android development you
don't need the latest greatest computer
but eclipse is the only beast that kind
of takes a lot of em memory or you can
take a lot of memory so keep that in
mind first time you started it comes
with this welcome screen first thing you
want to do is just kill it okay you
don't need it
um no and I'm starting from a very
virgin sort of explodes right like
nothing configured in any special way so
far eclipse has a concept of a
perspective the perspective is simply
how you're looking at your world so
there gazillion windows like for example
this would be one window here task list
and this is another way to call outline
and this is another window called
problems and then there's another tab
for blah blah blah you know in this
windows you could for example move
around so I can move this window here or
I can return it here depending which way
I prefer right you can mess things up
like I could put this here for this
scare put that there and then I'm like
holy I don't know what's going on
anymore you can always go into went
window and say reset perspective and
that's gonna return it into whatever
some default setting is for that
perspective the perspective we are
currently in is the one called Java and
it's the one that you typically use for
Java development yeah yeah yep okay so
right now we're on a Java perspective
and that's what we are gonna use for
creating applications right I said
earlier one of the things about the
Eclipse is that it's also a two part
download so just downloading Eclipse
from for Java developers is not enough
you need to also add Android tools you
would need you would know if you have
Android tools installed if you have some
buttons like this if you're seeing like
a button that looks like a little
Android peeking out behind some error or
something like that that usually means
you're good to go
but this sort of new this icon recently
changed so you may not look exactly like
what you have but if you have this
button if you have this button you're
pretty sure you you have Eclipse
equipped with the Android tools you know
yeah now if you didn't you want what you
would do is you would go help for
whatever reason and then install new
software and you would need to add a
repository to go to eclipse to go for
look for plugins and that repository is
spelled out on this site so under
installing it's gonna tell you how to do
all that but I'm just going to fast
forward to that basically you guys
should already have it it's it's called
sorry it's called the DL - as a cell
that google.com slash Android slash
Eclipse right so within that it would
then find the tools right and it would
install the tools so you just want to
select everything go next next next
restart in Eclipse and be done right we
are right now at version 15 of tools so
if you have like 12 or something older
you may want at some point you know
upgraded you can do a lot interim doing
lunch but not it's not a big deal so so
that's eclipse so far I'll show you some
code stuff later on as we keep on going
first of all I don't use this task class
so I'm just gonna kill it because I'm
really not gonna need okay so right now
I have no projects you guys me already
if you use one of our machines you may
have hello world here okay so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna create a new one
so I'm gonna go file new Android project
now sometimes you don't have Android
project here right
that's because eclipse is lazily
initializing some of your menu stuff so
you may have to go under other okay and
then find android project under Android
or whatever is right under the project
doesn't really matter how you get it you
just get it right
now what they're gonna do here is I'm
going to do the hello world project so
Eclipse organizes your code into
projects and projects live inside of
your workspace right that's kind of the
awesome concert so I'm gonna say hello
world new project then I'm gonna click
Next what this is not doing it's saying
select the build select the the build
target this is what we're targeting this
is the our project is going to be
designed for one of these versions so
this is where you get to make some
business decisions what are you
targeting like I said you may want to
target the latest greatest right that's
what I'm doing here I'm saying I'm
saying I'm saying let's target Android
4.0 I API level 14 which is really the
the OD quality Ice Cream Sandwich then
I'm gonna say next
okay so on this screen is saying what is
the name of your application the name of
the application is not insignificant it
could be something like yellow or yellow
comics space world doesn't really matter
it's just a name just English yeah how
do you make sure that what oh good
question so yes I forgot to tell you so
once you have the SDK installed in some
location like this right you need to
tell eclipse where that's installed so
you could do that under preferences by
the way if you don't know went or
anything but Mac Preferences is under
tools not under here but other than that
everything else is the same so then you
would go into Android and then you would
set this location you would navigate to
the root of your SDK
and then you click apply and it should
give you stuff in here
like if this is empty then it didn't
work out they did it okay yeah you just
need to do that apply that's a deal yeah
yeah you don't yeah and then you don't
need to restart or anything it's under
sorry under windows me no preference
yeah just yeah that's the only
difference between Mac and PC everything
else is gonna be exactly the same with
respect to clips so then so back to file
new Android project world next big
target and hello world the name of the
project right now project package name
is going to be important so in in
Android we assign a package to each app
and that package is the unique
identifier of that app so we're not
gonna uniquely identify an app based on
its name because this is an arbitrary
piece of text right we're going to
define it based on a package name the
package is a Java package and as you
guys know in Java we usually use the
reverse of your domain name right it
could be something like com dot you know
Maracana dot kilo for example right or
call that example of Hello whatever that
something is okay that's pretty typical
now
the next thing that it's asking us is
about activity should we create an
activity you guys don't quite know what
an activity is but roughly it
corresponds to a screen right
so one activity is dropping one screen
so sure we're gonna create one if you do
choose to create one then it's named
this here is ultimately gonna be a Java
class so you want to adhere to drama
naming conventions which is basically
start with the upper case and use camel
case rights like yellow the law world
activity is good capital hwa right so
that's gonna be a java class now this is
interesting because it's ask you the
minimum SDK version so I already said
I'm targeting Ice Cream Sandwich why is
it asking for many more this is where
you get to choose what is the furthest
back you're gonna support with your app
so we are after all building for later
is greatest but what if it's running on
an old phone which doesn't have the play
this games how far back are you gonna
support so that's what you you get to
decide pulled the line somewhere and you
may say I'm gonna choose Android 10 so
in other words I my app should run on
anything between 10 and 14 between
Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich right
so that's one way you can do that if if
you try to run it on a phone that's
older what's gonna happen is first of
all it's gonna refuse to get installed
in them to begin with so it's not even
going to install you know it's not
does this change what the clips gives
you is warning we're not really not
really a clip doesn't really do a lot of
stuff around this because yeah it
doesn't really doesn't really know about
that
so whatever you pick is a target that's
what it's testing against it's the
previous I'm usually that graceful
scaling down like I said you were
responsible for it what that usually
means is doing a bunch of if you know
bill dot version equals or less than
blah then don't call this it's a bunch
of if statements usually in practice
there was a version that I forget which
we're a number that is but it used to be
that even if you refer to a live class
that doesn't exist it actually breaks in
newer versions if you refer but don't
call a non-existent call code it's all
good but I forget which version the
actual exchange no it's not so it
doesn't give you an arrow it's gonna
give you a warning yeah you may give you
a warning Kyra
that's okay let's ignore it yeah yeah
we're gonna look at that in a second
okay I'm gonna click on finish this I'm
not gonna not doing anything else I'm
gonna click on finish and what happened
was we got a new project here so this is
our hello world project so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open up this
will expand it a little bit and so now
within this I'm gonna show you some of
the similar things that there are
again I'm going to I'm gonna
double-click I'm gonna we're gonna look
at some files that's significant in a
second but let me first do this and so
these are all the files that we got from
some boiler plates right so these are
sort of like a clip just took and
created this for us we didn't write a
single line of code yet right but we
obviously have a bunch of files so this
is all from a template
now these files here under SRC and Jen
that's your Java right those are your
Java files the files and the re s are
your resources right on and so basically
when you add your job and your resources
you get that file called a pea cake
remember application package that's kind
of that's that's what that looks like I
had it this box boxes before but now you
can kind of relate these are the files
so that's my some of my Java these are
some of my resources right there's
another file that's significant and
that's the manifest well that's sort of
the meta information about your app
again so it's these files that basically
make up your apk hmm make sense so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up these
files and then we're gonna explain them
so I'm gonna open up only the
significant files an opening manifest
file I'm opening strings main images
p.m. G's the e I don't need to open I'm
you guys know what image looks like it's
gonna look well here it's gonna be like
a drag in this case it's that little
graphic right but you click on to get
something started right what else is in
here I'm gonna open up this our file I'm
gonna open up the the activity
Java okay so let me do a little
modification to my fonts and just so you
guys can see it is there any way of
switching between two monitors at least
at least you don't have to deal with the
projector so hopefully that helps in
your eyes
but let me make this bigger that font
change the basic font - because remember
I started with the Virgin that should
make your life so I'm gonna make this
slightly bigger okay so let me start
with the manifest file so the manifest
file is an XML file right and or so it
says it says it's an XML file so how
come this doesn't look like an XML file
well that's where Eclipse knows about
certain types of files certain xml types
that are you are specific to Android so
it tries to provide some handball we
make your life easier so as opposed to
typing as XML you feel in the versions
like package remember the package name
is specified version numbers and so on
then at the bottom you actually have
these tabs when you can flip between
various things like this is the
application stuff right then there's
some permissions then there's some
instrumentation and so on and so
ultimately if you want to get into the
actual XML you would click the final tab
and that's where it is this is my actual
XML I'm actually so now is not in this
hmm
okay so this is an actual XML code right
now you don't really care about too much
about this file today right now don't
worry about all the details but what
they're just gonna really briefly want
to point out we basically have the
manifest right within that we have an
application within that we have an
activity right and then there's some
other junk in there there are certain
things that you may have may remember
remember the API level 10 we talked
about before right that's what we said
about the minimum target SDK is so those
artifacts that we placed in that dialog
said are just basically in the file
right now so this file is in specifies
the meta information about you when an
app is being installed this file is
actually being analyzed by the
installation installation process that
Skype knows everything all the bits and
pieces about your app and stuff so the
next file that we can use in here is the
file called strings again it's an XML
file again Eclipse provides some
hand-holding so it tries to like make
your life easier editing the things
actually for some reason it's showing me
this in the old you guys if you're using
r15 this should look differently you
cannot have it in a different it's a
slightly different UI I'm not sure why
but again this is just a XML file right
so what you're seeing here is you're
seeing name value pairs where basically
we're specifying strings what the name
of the key is here in the actual values
here he value okay now why are we why
are we doing this what's the goal of
putting things in a separate
internationalization is one when it's
usually just the best practice not just
in Android but you know
you should not pollute your code with
your English right because you know if
you want to make some change like I want
to change a piece of text I should not
have to go through the entire company
compile retest you know recheck it in
and itself so on that's what we're
trying to externalise as much text as
possible that's the best practice in
Java
anyway let's say it's an Android yeah
another thing another research that you
may see is another one called
Maine dot XML which basically is the
layout that we have to use for the
screen so this is going to correspond to
this is gonna correspond to the UI or
the screen for our activity right
what you're seeing is basically a box
that's gonna look like our screen when
it's all said and done right a bunch of
widgets you could put it for example
take some of these widgets and drag and
drop them right I could for example as
another on/off button
I could make this button wide I could
add some radio buttons and so on and
some make them big yeah so that this is
how you can build UI yeah so the one
point that I wanted to point out here is
that although I have one set of in
resources in this case strings in main I
could actually have alternative versions
of this as well yeah so for example you
get side internationalization if I want
to interact International is this app
it's as simple as creating an
alternative version of strings.xml
yeah so to do that this would you do you
basically say file new and great XML
file so I'm creating another XML file
right so I'm gonna say strings.xml I'm
using the same name that the previous
fall has right and it gives you a
warning the destination is ready exists
yes I know
so go next
but now what I can do is I can qualify
that name and the different name and the
different qualifier so for languages the
typical qualifier would be the language
itself right so a Manning that is a
qualifier now under under languages what
I would basically put a two letter iso
code for that language sort of like what
goes on you know domain name right so
for example let's say I want to provide
a diversion for French so I would put FR
now notice that all that's happening is
the system is making a another resource
folder another directory called Valley's
- FR this one is just called valleys
this one is gonna call cold valleys - fr
right I could now add more qualifiers
like for example if I want to specify
French but not for France but I want to
specify French in Canada right for
Quebec because they speak quite
differently right and I could then add
the region in them again - latter ISO
code so CA so my directory now becomes
valleys - f r - r CA right since
basically all it is it's a naming
convention so basically if you look at
it now aha I have two sets of strings
string one and string two same name
different folder right and now this new
UI actually kicked in so what you can
see is that I can now specify the piece
of text that we are externalizing right
so for example am i hello
there's my hello in English and then if
I actually knew how to put in French I
would then put in here and same for app
name and so on
yeah oh yeah it automatically opens it
up so basically it's kind of weird but
within this view I'm actually seeing two
files side by side so this is values
from 1 this is values from another try
opening up one of these so there's a so
all tools would to when I say tools I'm
talking about Android development tools
or ADK right that's what you plug in to
eclipse the old tools may not have this
version where you see things side by
side so it actually opens up two
separate tabs which is ok I mean it's
not that confusing and but one thing
that's confusing is sometimes when you
sono do tools would look like this right
you would just see each file like this
which is fine same thing like name value
pairs BAM now one thing that's confusing
is that sometimes when you double-click
on this it doesn't open in this view but
it opens in this field I'm sure it may
look like this like actually I don't
think I can he may look different right
because once in a while eclipse actually
gets confused and it doesn't know what
that XML file is it's a bar right so the
solution to that bug is to actually go
and right-click and say open with and
then you open it up with the right thing
and then it should look up ok right so
you right-click on the file you say open
with and then your I open it as a
resource editor it's been happening yeah
Morrison hmm yeah it's actually the bug
that's got me introduced recently it
wasn't as bad before I think it's more
more more
yeah yeah so that's a that's one thing
to to do um for example if I wanted to
just if I wanted to do an alternative
version of my layout
I'd remember this was my my layout file
was main right so you layouts you same
thing right I could click on by the way
there's always an icon for that right so
you can click on this little icon here
which is the equivalent of new XML and
grid XML file right this little a plus
click on that right and and it says okay
what do you want to open I want to say I
want to create another layout hello
world and I'm gonna say main dot XML
right so I click on next it says the
destination really exists but I could
qualify it again for something else now
layout usually don't qualify for
language it's not like it's a different
layout for for English or French right
sometimes you do maybe maybe it's a
different layout for Asian languages
versus European because of the form
factor right it's more square 8 than it
really depends but usually layout stuff
you would qualify based on orientation
of the screen for example is the
portrait mode the landscape mode so that
would be here so for example say
orientation is landscape that's gonna
give me a directory called layout - land
right you could also qualify it if it's
in arm you know if it's in a UI mode for
the car or desk or television right
you could also qualify it for re night
mode versus day mode now if you could
also qualify it you know touchscreen is
stylus versus finger and so on and so on
so in other words you can go crazy with
this and create this alternative sets of
resources the system is automatically
gonna figure out the best fit at runtime
right if it doesn't find the best fit
basically trickles down
- until it gets the default version or
something like that right um so that's
kind of how that works I usually
recommend leaving this kind of work for
the late later in your development cycle
because you don't want to have to
maintain two sets of files right so just
gonna get get get everything working and
then give it to a translator to
translate the nice thing is you don't
change your Java so it shouldn't change
you shouldn't affect anything so so
that's a little bit about the how that
works go for dual for the layout any
questions yeah so the application may
have two different layouts the system is
gonna figure out which one to use at
runtime so if I'm using my device
you know portrait mode is gonna use
portrait layout if I use it in landscape
it's gonna say in landscape is a better
fit I'm gonna use that on the layout if
you don't have landscape is going to use
the default which is the one which
doesn't have any qualifiers well you
could do night night mode a mode but
there's going to be something in the
system in the operating system is going
to trigger that yeah yeah no you can't
you can't come up with your own
qualifies now yeah it qualifies need to
be something that the system already
knows about right you may notice that
for example for images we don't have one
image directory but we have three right
drove all aged a high density for a per
inch low density French medium that's
the French right so basically all these
images they're identical
in terms of what's on them but they're
just different size they're like 28 24
by 24 36 by 38 6 and 28 by 28 a 48 by 48
pixels because of different density of
the screen so can you do layers based on
accessibility I believe so
so you have things that are available to
you are dimensions of the screen
versions size regions keyboard like that
to me in terms of accessibility or yeah
I am not sure what to use for that
now the imagine there is something but
I'm not sure what the were the best
qualifier for that is so now that you
have all your resources what you need to
know is that this folder here the
resources folder is pretty pretty much
pretty well managed in other words you
can't just go and create your own
directors or your own Falls like there's
like a certain structure to them it's
very structured that's what I was
looking for right and whenever you
change anything in this folder under re
s right what's gonna happen is that
change is gonna be reflected in this
file called R okay so R now we're kind
of going for Javal and
R is the file that helps Java that's in
your Java file that helps Java link to
your resources it's basically the globe
between the world of Java in the world
of resources
so there's a tool that whenever you make
a change here that all goes and updates
are so that that object that references
the ballot with the same token if you
make a mistake in one of your xml files
for example are it's not gonna fail to
update right so it's in then that all
subsequently fails your java and that's
what you kind of have hard to find
errors so you should be mindful of that
I'll point or some of this stuff later
but R is important and it's
automatically generated so that brings
us to R so R looks like this okay it's
an ugly file right it's got a bunch of
pointers basically right it's basically
a bunch of inner classes right so each
inner class like drawable it's gonna
point to one type of research to draw a
layout is gonna point to layout right
strings is gonna point to strings and so
on and so okay and then within that
you're gonna have specific items with
their respective pointers so like I said
R is auto-generated you do not want to
modify it ever and as a matter of fact
you don't even want to look at it right
and it's really ugly but we're gonna be
using it quite a bit just we're gonna
use it but you're not gonna look at it
so I'll explain how that works so
ultimately what runs at the end of the
day is your job so your job is the top
dog that's what executes that's what you
know runs the show right Java is merely
being augmented by a bunch of XML and
other resources they're just there to
help get a show going right so Java runs
out at the end over there so as you can
see I have a we have a file called hello
world activity it extends an activity so
this something that comes from the
system right
and then we override something that we
inherited namely oncreate okay and we
call it super so up until a line 11 we
don't really do anything new right right
everything is sort of you know up until
this line we're back at square one right
so what is this line then do this is the
only significant line in this whole file
because everything else is just back to
square one so what does this one do
so what this line does it says set the
content view view is basically it's sort
of like a component like what goes into
this activity so the content for this
view to our layout main okay remember I
said we don't look at our but we use it
quite a bit so here's how we are using
our so our corresponds to this file our
dot Java but so if you are a layout main
was basically this property here our
layout main so it's this number 0 X 7 7
F 0 3 3 0 0 0 okay you could have just
typed that in if you really you know
like typing but if you don't you just do
you just use the do it like this our
layout main now our layout main
basically that the number 0 F 0 X blah
blah that points to resources layout
main.xml right so this is basically a
pointer to that resource or if you get
multiple versions of main.xml it which
is the most appropriate for tonight so
that's what we're saying set a content
for this view to that file which is
ultimately pointing back to that file
the main XML so first again yeah
so if your if your if your application
is allowing user to change languages you
could do that two ways you could do it
on per application you know an
application also in other words your
application manages that thing itself
right change language there's some if
statement or case statement goes and
changes the language it would not be
automatically done by by Android Android
is automatically gonna figure out which
of these to use based on some system
conditions
more specifically it's going to go into
the system settings and look up the
preferred locale and language for this
user so if you wanted to allow your
application to do that then your
application could actually change the
system settings which would cause system
to then run the application using
different resources different language I
mean yeah you may need to have the
application restart which is yeah or
there's a whenever so called
configuration changes the application
does get notified this is configuration
changed I forget if language is one of
the configurations that there is I no
screens changes like when you rotate the
screen you get notified and a bunch of
other things do not find a percent sure
about the configuration but that should
cause and configuration change to be
called to be notified yeah so yeah so
that's basically how Java now links to
users um now let's do this we are gonna
want to run this this code right and to
run it what I'm going to do is I'm going
to need a device
since you guys didn't bring your phones
like we told you to we're just joking
now yeah I wish responsive by its EC
right or in some new sensor I wish we're
gonna use an emulator yeah
do I have another lot available so some
of you may not have this icon here again
this icon is relatively new it comes
with our 15 which is the latest version
of tools so if you don't have that
version of tools then click on this icon
so it's actually this icon used to be
both both things but then they split
into two yeah so just click on that icon
icon ultimately what you're looking for
is a tool called AVD manager so it used
to be that SDK and AVD manager or one
now there too right so a B D stands for
Android virtual devices okay now I'm
gonna delete this one there's create a
new one so so what so you can have as
many virtual devices as you want but you
need at least one so let's create one so
I'm gonna create a new one so I'm gonna
click on new okay and you get to give it
a name the name is not important you can
call it Bobby
Tommy anything I'm gonna call it ICS for
Ice Cream Sandwich right then I'm gonna
run Ice Cream Sandwich on mine so I'm
going to pick from Target the
appropriate version which is gonna be
this one Android 4 or API level 14
then it's asking me for an SD card now I
recommend putting some kind of red card
in other words giving it some kind of
size but you don't need too big like ten
megabytes is good for our purposes but I
do recommend having at least one as the
car because we're gonna be doing
something later on where we're gonna
need to put some some stuff on it
enable start from snapshots is basically
what it does is when you shut down the
emulator it's going to save its memory
state so when you restart it it doesn't
go through a full reboot but basically
loads loads from that snapshot it's kind
of like in Windows when you hibernate
your computer right it's like that
so you're trading basically the shutdown
for a startup speed so sure you can
enable skin is just a look and feel like
if there's gonna be this big of a screen
that we go screencap keyboard not have
keyboard that's our stuff Oh
default is fine I don't really care and
two hardware options you can you know
disable give it more memory disabled LCD
say what idea or things like that I'm
just gonna leave it as is click on click
on create okay and then click on start
so select it and click on start and just
launch
we save this fits okay so while this is
booting let's talk about it Tallulah do
what you guys see starting up right now
is a as an emulator No are you guys
clear what the difference is between an
emulator and simulator I mean it sound
like a synonym to each other a so a
simulator merely simulates the execution
of something and like makes it look the
same way emulator on the flip side
emulates the actual code right so what
you see right now what's going on in
America peers we're booting ARM based
code we're emulating the chips but we're
working with the same binaries isn't the
real thing
essentially this is a virtual machine
right your virtualizing the hardware
right so it's a much closer
approximation to the real thing than a
simulator simulate real typically have
to compile for simulator then you run
one code base then you compile for the
real device so you're running a
different code base so if you're testing
when a simulator you're actually testing
two separate code bases it's not as
approach as precise right
blackberry and iPhone use simulators and
reduce emulator from get-go so that's
why for the most part we don't need the
physical device I mean obviously
simulator itself also get some
limitations and you know it's not
perfect for example if you do anything
with like sensors you know I mean I
tried shaking my computer didn't really
do anything so there's certain
limitations there are certain things you
can fake with the with the emulator as
well I'll point that out later on but
but for the most part it's that it's it
takes a while to get going
as you can
like you know it's gonna consume quite a
bit of memory and you can kind of like
connect probably might be pure at some
point it gets really warm and all that
um but the good thing is once you get it
up and running you've done for the most
part you don't have to reboot it ever
again yeah yeah you want to kind of keep
it we're gonna be reinstalling it on the
same emulator some because it's
expensive to start as you can see you
want to just let it sit there yes the
enable snapshot avoids the startup
process by basically studying it from
the memory from the snapshot so it takes
your live memory and dumps it into a
file so when you start it up it just
mean it's that in continuous it's
basically like hybrid it's like you know
if you create a project for one version
want to switch no that's quite easy to
do and there's no problem with that
so to change the version in the target
version you would basically go into your
project so each project has meta
information and this is a property of
Eclipse you could go right click on this
right and you would go into properties
ok and then there gazillion things we
choose in here but you're interested in
Android stuff and that's what that
version is that we we put in as a target
so although I said Android 14 it says
compile with 10 because that was the
minimum SDK to change it there now if
you don't like Eclipse click-click-click
kind of approach there's a file called
project properties and that's why it
does to specify the target
yeah yeah that's fine you can do that at
any point in time
mm-hmm that's basically just gonna
change which which libraries is gonna
bundle it's gonna compile against yeah
which is this file here
that's our libraries that's where we're
putting this yeah cool so um so this now
started my my emulator you have to kind
of do this you know listen to some yes
and you mean it may need to unlock it so
you have to kind of like drive that
circle right think to unlock it but this
is like a virgin' device now what I'm
gonna do next is I'm going to run my
project so to do that I will basically
go into the project and you can click
with a little Run button below a green
button here right that's an arm button
you can say run and it says how do you
wanna run it and I would just say as an
Android application to click OK and then
switch to this and eventually it should
be running
don't you hear what it's doing so Oh
something film me does something so so
so I'm having a problem here right it's
failing to Tehran I can try I can try to
right click and say there's another way
as opposed to a green button you can
right click on a project select run as
and say run and that's it's gonna
probably fail again for me okay so he
see here's the problem problem so first
time around I try to run it it failed
second time around it actually doesn't
know about my emulator so now eclipse
what it says oh you don't have any
phones to run on so it went them started
the whole new one so you may notice it
now I have the second one being started
right here right then it just picks
something from the list right so this is
this is unfortunately a bug I wasn't
expecting it to happen so quickly but
it's it's a bug in Android and you could
so first of all so the the connection
between your Eclipse and your device is
done via Steam called ADB Android device
bridge right it's it's like it's your
bridge for communicating between two
computers like although they're
physically in one computer they're
actually to write like this is an
emulator right this is a separate
computer all together with its own you
know it's ARM based shape with its own
file system operating system yet right
so the connection between these two
things is done by a adb Android device
bridge and but it by the way this stuff
works exactly the same if it's physical
device or emulator device so it's
agnostic to the type of device now every
once in a while that bridge just blows
up right so
it loses the connection between the two
what
you could try as you could shut it down
and restore it but that's kind of like
as you guys saw like watching it start
up is kind of like watching the paint
dry right it just takes a while to go
through so you probably don't do that um
usually the remedy to that is to do this
so I on a command line I first of all I
did
ADB devices to see what list of devices
that I have and as you can see I don't
have any it's an empty list so what I
can do next and I can do
ADB kill server that kills that
connection so good and then I say adb
start server and that reboots
the connectivity between the device and
my Mac right so now if I do adb devices
it actually sees my emulator there it is
before it was a nebulous right so kill
server start server is a useful remedy
for one both things don't work when
Eclipse loses the connectivity and it
happens so I'm going to click on on run
now so I'm waiting for the paint here
Serena's ended up uh-huh there it is
okay so there's my application alright
so oops my application crashes that's a
different story but but you can you can
see that it actually starts right on the
device
there's our app right on the emulator I
will just pop up eventually it takes
some time to build and deploy but it
should just pop up again so a couple of
things so some of you can have cared a
problem with a certificate expired let
me explain something so one thing that
happens the magic that happens behind
pressing this button right so when you
do this press this button or when you
right click and say Ron first you need
to compile the thing right so in Eclipse
we have built automatically turned on
that's why we don't we haven't had to do
any of this Eclipse whenever you save
any file so whenever you say any of the
project files Eclipse always goes that
it does variable 3 build rebuild 3 volt
right so part of those rebuild is a
couple of things that happen let me show
you this project on a file system so if
I go to our workspaces boot camp ok so
this is our hello world project here
right you guys already saw source folder
you saw resources right and we talked
about manifest file there's couple
things there are a couple things we
haven't seen one is the bin folder
that's what the binaries go right so
what happens all that Java
first of all gets compiled so Java gets
compiled to class falls right remember
we talked about how that works so
there's my Java compiled into class pass
yeah next that Java gets recompiled into
the dalvik binary code right so this is
your classes the Dex file right it's in
a single archive uncompressed but that's
dalvik code all those resources that we
had right remember all those resources
like draw balls and pictures and
graphics and layouts and so on all those
resources they get bundled into this
file called ap underscore right so at
this point you had your classes which is
your dalvik and you have your resources
which is this file those two get added
into this file which is the hello world
apk file and that's your final shippable
that's what you know cell right so
there's a tool a apk builder that does
this there's all this like mumbo-jumbo
of like putting everything together into
a single archive right so that's that
file apk right and like I said it's just
a zip file if you actually want just for
fun what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to
workspaces bootcamp and bin folder oops
hello world and then you don't have to
do this and in that folder I'm gonna
empty dirt TMP just to kind of like show
it there and I'm gonna unzip the the
hello world APK file and as you can see
these are the components of the actual
aqk right so there are resource files
this is the manifest files some
information about the resource files the
actual images meta information classes
these are Dalek code and then net
information so it's part of the build of
the apk what also happens is the apk
gets signed right if you guys remember
when we talked about at the annual day
you have an app and I said an app is
basically your Dalek code that's the
classes though that's fall some
resources that's that
resources that AP underscore file right
but also what they said is that classes
must be signed right so do you remember
signing anything
not really so to make life simple for
development the signing capital to
magically buy the tools yeah into that
purpose Eclipse uses something called
the debug keystore it's kind of like
default key that it uses for debug
purposes now this key unlike your real
key which you should use for 25 years
this key is actually good only for one
year
so for some of you ran into this problem
because whatever generated the key is
you know it was over twelve months ago
right for some reason although those
machines should have been refreshed but
maybe it's actual the the official image
that goes on them is also older so it's
just a matter of you know removing this
key no big deal just deleting it now
what this information what this bits and
pieces stored so on every computer on
your development computer in your home
directory you're gonna have a directory
called dot dot Android now on Windows
your home director is gonna be documents
and settings then username then dot
Android on Mac and Linux it's gonna be
your tilde right at your home right and
you're gonna have dot and redirector but
I don't think that it looks the same
right inside of that directory you're
gonna have a bunch of stuff among them
you're gonna have that key store called
debug keystore ok so that's where the
key is that's your key right there so
you can you if if you get certificate
problem you just blow up this file and
it's gonna get into be it's gonna be
regenerated by itself what if I actually
was going into production I now want to
sell my hello world app I'm in such a
good app I want to put in the market you
know charge some money for it now
you can't do most markets I'm not gonna
accept something sign with a debug key
so you're gonna sign it with your own
key so enter it uses a standard tool for
signing stuff it's called key tool it
ships with most most Linux and Mac
computers have it built-in on Windows
you don't have it built-in obviously and
the way you get it is to get it to buy a
JDK chooser Java development kit
actually has Quito
right but nonetheless if you don't want
to do it like if you don't want to use
command line stuff you know there's a
button for that in Eclipse right so but
this is the standard tool to kill Akito
but in Eclipse you would do it like this
you would right click on your project
you would go Android tools and you would
say export signed application package
say next you could now create create a
new key store or just follow the
directions for what I use is and I would
use my my standard key storm so I not
say that I want to create I want to use
existing key store so I would go browse
and I would I would use for example my
keister now if it's an existing one I
need to password for my key store so
type in the password go to next it says
use existing key you know to create a
new key I'm going to use existing key
you know I need to need a password to
use that key and where do you want to
save this and I'll probably put it in
the same UPS in the same place as my
other stuff so Ben and I would probably
save it as hello world they're signed
that's it I now have a good enough
version I can put in a market
okay so that's just how it works with
the with standard tools for Eclipse to
to basically create a version like this
any other problems with with hello world
so far - also anything like that you
guys pretty setup how do you really pull
it again yeah so if you click on run
again so if I make a change so for
example if I go to my main and this was
causing a problem gonna remove it and
I'm gonna remove this right the radio
buttons right I'm gonna click on save
and I'm gonna click on run right in my
new version is gonna be automatically
redeployed so just wait so there it is
right there's the new version yeah
alright so how do you everything you can
do from a little button in Eclipse you
can do a command line so if say you're
like a VI guy or you know notepad guy or
whatever you don't like eclipse right
can't afford it or something so you want
to do this on a command line so I would
go workspaces
I think boot camp hello world hello
world so if I wanted to do this command
line you use the tool called Android and
you could say something like Android
create project and then you specify all
those properties about about creating
the project if already having a project
I can actually say Android update
project and that actually analyzes my
project and says oh I see already have a
project what that what
is that we need to fix so I need to say
that there's a name hello world in a - -
path for this project so this my
analysis my project and it says well I'm
still missing hello world missing
argument for flag path dot so so so the
current deaths will be like that right
so that now I know Essex there's a the
missing dog it was a dog that's missing
right so so basically so it's Android of
the project name of the project path the
project it will be the current working
directory that was a path so this
analyze the project and basically
noticed that I have the following things
a missing right so basically the main
thing that was missing is the bill that
smell which is basically your ant script
yes familiar with that and there's a
build system so that's what it uses so
now if I wanted to use command line I
would say and debug I believe it's like
this and this actually built you a debug
version of your project it's not
probably lower case debug so let me try
it
debug like that yeah it is so this now
compiles it and built it and does all
that stuff that we explained this is the
magic that happens behind the little
green button like okay now this built a
new file in my bin to see the bin right
so it actually built this is the file it
just gives a longer name but it's the
same file right built it's actually a
line said no this is the phone after
it's a line yep so now if I wanted to
run this file to install it I would say
adb install hello world debug
jpk so this now pushes this file to the
device if you connected via USB if you
push by USB in my case it's gonna push
to the device right here okay so if I
say install this is gonna fail because I
already installed it yeah so what you
can do is you do the install - are and
that actually causes it to be green so
debug apk is signed with a debug key
yeah these are I mean then these file
names are arbitrary yeah they're not
important so so and when you do it in a
command-line it actually creates
multiple versions like you so you so
first it says unaligned then a line sit
then then creates the final one and so
on so it kind of like burns couple of
steps so that's a command line that
makes sense cool
any other questions on the killer world
you're not able to run it just the word
of advice in honeycomb so honeycomb is
sort of like a black sheep in the family
it's the only one that we don't have
open source code for and the emulator if
you use art if you use the API 13 which
is honeycomb or or 11 12 and 13-hour
honeycomb honeycomb is extremely slow
the amulet tree actually it's a known
problem because it's designed for a
multi core cpu and emulator is a single
core so it actually runs really small as
well r14 seems to run reasonably fast so
I would use 10 or 14 but not 11 12 or 13
it works fine on if you have a real
device
okay any other questions so what we've
done so far is we talked about SDK right
tools we created the project we analyzed
the project okay and also what we did is
we ran it on the emulator so so far
that's that's what we did um let me one
thing that I did skip or because I
wanted to first we have the device
available to you so we can actually see
it is they wanted to talk a little bit
about a file system right so Android has
a file system that's you know
interesting and they're supposed to
talking about it on a slide now I wanted
to start at the device so I can actually
point out things on the actual device so
so let's take a look at the this
differently one of the things that you
can do in Android is you can you can
look at the runtime environment of your
device by creating a new by opening up a
different perspective and inside of your
perspective looking at the file explorer
so let me show you this what I'm going
to do is I'm gonna click on this button
here I'm gonna say open up the DDMS
perspective now if you don't have it
that's probably because it's not shown
so you would go under other and then
find it still don't have it something is
not installed but otherwise DDMS should
be rather there so this is my DDMS
perspective it's basically just a
different way of looking at the world
right so well what I'm seeing here is
I'm seeing my device emulator
ICS blah blah these are some of the
processes that are running and now I'm
gonna click on file explorer ok so these
are the files that are currently running
on my device the files that the
currently installed on my device
so you just make this a little bigger
okay so first of all you have couple of
permissions here that are interesting we
have the data permission which
corresponds to user data okay we have
the SD card partition which corresponds
to as the card right and system is your
operating system another way to look at
this is like this remember I said if you
look at the platform it doesn't matter
which platform each person has a
directory called images that's good
that's going to file system images
alright and I said you know system is in
here well this file corresponds to that
that is that user data corresponds to
this partition here at least initially
but from that that point on user keeps
changing it makes sense as the card is
actually not shown not not shown in here
so what happens is when you create a an
emulator is this remember that directory
dot dot Android remember dot Android
directory I said you also have one of
the subdirectories is a directory called
a BD ok inside of that directory you
have all your ABT's you may only have
one but there's my ICS that we just
created so if I see the into ICS AVD
yeah these are the files that are in
there so basically what happens is when
you create a new emulator you copy the
user data the user data from here right
you copied into that emulators directory
because from now on it's gonna be
changing so that file came from there
and then it's been changing like
initially it was for max smarts or
something else keeps changing right as
the user keeps that are using it
downloading stuff stuff and things like
that SD card that you created a 10
megabyte SD card there it is so that's
now an SD card right and then there's
some other things that are not that
important like bunch of log files and a
bunch of snapshots and those are images
they represent filesystem images so the
actual emulation works via the tool that
we're using is a project called Q mu Q
mu K mu which is basically a toddler of
virtualization engine open source column
of virtualization and so this is
actually emulating arm yes but you're
actually loading the Linux kernel on top
of on top of your Q mu engine so it's
still the Linux come running yes
virtualizing the code
yeah it's a minute Agarn
yeah it emulates the chips the deer
shall cover yeah yeah it is just like
you know you guys can do a boot into
Linux or you know Windows or something
like that that's also using
virtualization or you can run you can
run like Mac or Windows on Mac or Mac on
Windows yeah basically virtualizes your
your hardware your low-level partner so
that that's the project it is now
they're moving away from this so 400 or
so was it for Google TV you have to use
a VM um I'm sorry so if you have
multiple devices physical or emulating
when you run it it's gonna say which one
gonna ask you which one yeah it's gonna
pop up a little dialog and is gonna say
I find two three five different devices
I could run on which ones you want so so
back to this so part of the filesystem
like I said is we have we have the
system folder so system folder is a
read-only partition okay you can't
modify anything on this petition okay
that's the partition that system is on
it's got AB directory bin directory
framework and live directors there's
probably only directors that are
significant and if you compare that
you've to this picture
remember our stack so basically your abs
that's what they are right that's in the
app folder your frameworks are in the
frameworks folder your libraries are in
the live folder and your drivers well
your Linux stuff is all over but like
lab something some of it is in that
folder Lib hardware for example for
drivers some of it is in bin folder for
example for binders and so on and so
that's basically how this is broken
broken bomb good question
should you find you hello world under
app no because this like I said it's in
read-only file system so you could not
save it there so these are the apps that
ship with the system you know your
calendar your camera your contacts your
desk lock your and then so on and so
those are the things that ship here now
when user downloads an app that goes
into user data app partition folder so
this is a user downloaded stuff so
there's my hello world right there ok so
first of all so that's that's what hello
world goes now one of the things that's
most important on the data partition or
US developer is the data data British
father so under the data there's a
second folder called data also also
called data right so if I open this one
up
that's what you're gonna find that every
app has its own private file system
there's a folder for each and every
application corresponding to to that
yeah so yeah so that's basically what
the follow so that's going to be a
private folder for each each of these
directors can each application so for
example our hello call maracanÃ£ hello
there it is and it's empty I mean it's
got an empty lib folder but there's
really nothing in it so the way this is
made private is based on UID and GID s
so it's Linux kernel basically enforcing
this I'll show you that later on ok so
so that's that's that that's a little
bit about file system just a high-level
we'll get back to that and as the card
is there but as the card is just you
know not very well structured there's
what you can basically put stuff all
over the place
since Ice Cream Sandwich is actually or
honeycomb design creating subdirectories
but before that it was just basically
one big giant storage space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
