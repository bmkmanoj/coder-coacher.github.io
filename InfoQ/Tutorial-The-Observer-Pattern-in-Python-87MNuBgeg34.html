circle and the author of the advanced
python newsletter and i'd like to talk
to you today about the observer pattern
in python now design patterns in general
are very interesting to study for any
object-oriented language because they
are ways to reuse ibly solve problems in
code that are common and come up in many
different contexts because in languages
like Java and C++ and C sharp and PHP
there's been a lot of research done
since the turn of the century and
there's a great big volume of body of
literature for us to learn from and use
but in Python some things are different
about how you actually apply them and
implement them because Python has some
useful characteristics that the other
languages don't have features like
dynamic typing features like functions
being first-class objects and other
characteristics as well that lets us
implement design patterns in Python in a
way that is often simpler more concise
and more maintainable readable and
useful now with the observer pattern if
you're not familiar with it the idea
that observer pattern is that you have
some root object which we'll call the
observer bowl and the observable has
some way to know when some state changes
of interest we're talking about this
very abstractly here but I'm going to
get very specific with it a little bit
but something will change that the
observable we'll know about and you'll
also have a number of other let's say
satellite objects that want to know when
this happens you have a number of other
entities that want to be notified when
this thing changes so you notice the
pattern here we have one speaking too
many so I actually don't like to use the
terminology observable in observers
which is traditional when talking about
the observer design pattern what I like
to do is call them the publisher and the
subscribers I think that's more clear
let's look at this in detail with Python
and see how it actually works with some
code
now let's look at the most simple way
you can implement the observer pattern
in Python now in these code examples I'm
going to be using Python 3 and if you're
using Python 2 don't worry
pretty much everything applies all the
concepts directly apply the only thing
that's gonna be different is a few
details of the syntax so you'll be able
to follow along just fine now let's look
at the code here I have in this file
called observer 1 py because it's our
first example an observer 1 py I have
two classes a subscriber class in a
publisher class the subscriber is pretty
simple notice it has a method called
update in this simplest simplest variant
of implementing the observer pattern
each subscriber must implement a method
called update it doesn't have to be
couple of update it just has to be
consistent and something that both the
observer and the observer Bowl the
publish excuse me the subscriber and the
publisher can agree on and in this case
we have a method called update that
takes one argument which will be a
string again it can take any arguments
so long as all parties involved agree on
it now looking at the publisher class we
have a few interesting things first we
have a method called init the
constructor that does one thing it
creates an empty set a set is a useful
data structure to use on the publisher
side to keep track of what's going on
because that's all it needs in this case
then now we have a couple of myth
methods here called register and what
these do is they allow a subscriber to
register itself with the publisher it
allows the observer to register itself
with the observable and this is
important because we want to allow any
object to register itself with the
observer so that it can receive those
notifications when the time comes and
register is one side of it unregister is
the other side with unregistering we
were just saying I don't want to receive
these notifications any more now how are
these notifications sent what does it
to send a notification well that's all
handled in the dispatch and it's very
simple in the dispatch method all that
happens is that when this method is
invoked then every subscriber has its
update method invoked passing this
argument called message so notice a
couple of things this patch here is just
another method the publisher can invoke
it itself some other entity can in
certain circumstances invoke it as well
it surely just depends on the
architecture of your code and how you
want to use the observer notice also
that the dispatch method takes a message
which in our case is just a string but
of course it could be an arbitrary
object or even several arguments they
are all arbitrary objects but keeping it
simple here we say for subscriber in
self dot subscribers subscriber update
message very simple now how do we use
this well now we're going to go to this
file called drive i've called driver
underscore observer dot one it's just a
driver script to demonstrate how we use
the simple form of the observer pattern
with this simple form of the observer
pattern we start by creating a publisher
object then we're going to create some
subscribers the next step is that these
subscribers have to register with the
publisher now there's several ways this
can happen in the example you're seeing
here I just have a top-level few lines
of code that register a few of these
subscribers but a subscriber can
register itself by calling pub dot
register passing self as an argument so
we could for example design each of
these subscribers to in its constructor
invoke the registration with the
publisher as a global variable it could
register itself whenever it's at object
creation time now I'm going to now the
next step is we call a method to
dispatch a certain message then
one of the subscribers and the next line
unregister x' and then we dispatch again
what happens when we run this
we have the first round of dispatch the
message it's lunchtime that goes out to
all the subscribers one subscriber
decides they don't need to receive these
notifications anymore and when that
happens when we dispatch the next
message time for dinner only those
subscribers that remain receive this
message this is a simplest form of the
observer pattern in Python but we can do
much more interesting things with the
observer pattern we can do them in much
more concise readable maintainable and
to certain extent fun ways then we could
easily in some other languages let's see
how that works
now we just saw the simplest form of the
observer pattern and how you do it in
Python and this is a common way to do it
where you have a method called update or
something like that as long as it's
consistent between observable and
Observer publisher and subscriber but we
can do something a little different in
Python that gives us more flexiblity and
what this relies on the fact that in
Python functions are treated just like
any other object but I have a function f
of in something like that I can say G
equals F and it's like I'm taking this
object I'm using over here where I call
G of in and it acts just like the
original function because it's the same
function just reference under two
different names F and G and everything
that works with functions free-standing
functions in Python also works with
methods the methods of objects so we're
going to exploit that to give us more
flexibility so that a subscriber can
register with the publisher even if that
subscriber is not implemented a method
called update so that it can pass a
different method to register to register
with a different method or even a
free-standing function something else
entirely so we need to make some
modification so if you look here we have
first the subscriber class from the
simple example above and we have the
publisher just the same as below we need
to make some modifications to both let's
start with a subscriber what I'm going
to
you I'm gonna make two different kinds
of subscriber classes and I could reuse
code a little bit better here but I'm
not going to bother it's a simple
example and the first class a subscriber
one has the same interface with the
update method just like in the previous
example but subscriber two has a
different method with under a different
name call receive so what we want to do
is make it so that we can actually
register subscriber twos receive method
with the publisher what do we have to do
for that well if you change this first
and the constructor of the publisher
class we need to seed self dot
subscribers as a dictionary instead of a
set and when the subscriber invokes the
register method we want to provide a
function this argument I'm gonna call it
callback because conceptually that's
exactly what it is we want the observer
to have a callback function invoked
called
when the notification goes out and
that's the channel that's the mechanism
by which the subscriber is notified now
what we can do in Python again I can say
okay callback this argument this third
argument called callback is going to be
optional and if it's not supplied we're
going to fall back to the original the
one called update
now that's good we have a flexible way
to invoke the register method now the
way we add subscribers is a little bit
different because we have a dictionary
now and we're mapping the subscriber
object to the callback and similarly
with the unregistered method we're going
to have to remove that from the
dictionary which we do in this way now
the dispatch now the signature for
dispatch is exactly the same the
dispatch method and the way the dispatch
method is invoked does not change but
the way we go through the subscribers
and sending all these messages is going
to be different first of all we're going
to iterate through subscriber comma
callback and self dot subscribers called
items now this is Python 3 so items
returns an iterator and python 2 we
would want to say it or items instead
and once we do this we have within the
loop we can just call the callback for
the message and we can do anything else
in this loop we want but this is a
simple structure that gives us a lot of
flexibility in how we work with the
publisher and subscriber relationship
because the subscriber can specify not
only I want to be notified on the state
change or when this interesting event
happens but I want you to notify me in
this specific way there's a lot of
expressive power in this kind of pattern
and it's a lot harder to do in Java or
C++ or PHP or c-sharp how does this work
well I have a little driver script going
to this we have this is this creates a
couple of subscribers a couple of
different types of subscribers several
different types registers them and
dispatches the two messages we saw
before the lunchtime announcement and
the dinnertime announcement so it looks
like John doesn't care about dinner what
happens when we run this
notice what happened the interesting
thing here is that subscriber to Alice
does not have an update method in that
object the the object for Alice has a
method called receive and that we see as
evidence in the output means that she
got the message for it's lunchtime so
this is an important refinement gives
you more flexibility and how you can use
the observer pattern in Python but we're
not done yet
we can do even more and do it very
easily compared to what we can do in
other languages let's look at how that
works something may we may want to do
with the observer pattern is to have an
observer that can actually notify one
group of subscribers for one kind of
situation and notify a different group
of subscribers for a different situation
and we can even have subscribers that
are in both groups we can call these
different situations events all that
means it's kind of a abstract term but
all it means is that we have different
kinds of notifications so we can call
these different events another word we
can use as channels now how do we
implement this in code well let's look
at the code that we just made with the
flexibility of how we can notify a
subscriber and I'm actually going to
step back instead of having two
different subscriber classes let's just
go back to one and in fact we'll forego
that flexibility right now in this
example because these are independent of
each other and they compose you'll see
what I mean as we go forward now with
the publisher we need to make a few
changes here because the interface we
want to provide is that a subscriber can
not only register with the observer but
register for a specific event that that
observer can announce so how does that
work well first thing we need to do is
modify the constructor a publisher to
take several events
and that means that we're our
subscribers attribute or the publisher
class is going to have a little bit
different structure we're going to seed
it as a dictionary mapping event names
which will just be strings to
dictionaries which will each of these
dictionaries will map subscriber objects
to the callback function or method for
that particular event so the way we're
going to initialize this is to use a
dictionary comprehension
this is something that works in Python 3
and in Python 2 you can do something
similar you actually can't quite use a
dictionary comprehension here and some
versions of Python and all versions of
Python but it's a concise way to
describe and you can just create the
dictionary however you like now we're
going to also make a little helper
method called get subscribers
all this does is look up in the head
subscribers attribute and returns what's
the dictionary mapping subscriber to
their callback for this particular event
it'll be a little useful so with
register we need to add a new argument
and I think it makes more sense
semantically in terms of the design of
the API to put it as a first argument so
let's go ahead and put that there and
again events is just a string specifying
what kind of event or situation or
notification this subscriber wants to be
notified about so when we have the
signature modified the callback setup is
exactly the same but the way we insert
it into our record-keeping of who wants
to know about what is a little different
we're going to call the get subscribers
method and pass it the event name that
returns a dictionary and that dictionary
we will then in loot you a look up with
the who and then register the callback
in that way unregister similarly needs
to take an event parameter because a
subscriber may be registered into
several different events and they may
want to unregister to some events but
not others so we look up the dictionary
the same way get subscribers event and
after doing that all we have left is the
dispatch method so again we're going to
use a consistent signature notice what
I've done here I've decided to design
the API my observer class so that for
each of these methods event is the first
argument that's intentional
makes it easy to remember when you're
writing the code how do the right way to
do it okay so we have for a subscriber
comma callback and self dot subscribers
but again we need to change that it's a
pretty simple change dispatch method
just has to look up the correct
subscriber table for the particular
event so now we have this and I have a
driver here which is very similar to the
one we've seen before just using the new
publisher and subscribe
or class so let's see how that goes
great
it works notice how we have some
flexibility here because we're going
back to the driver we have two different
channels here lunch and dinner and
different subscribers are registered to
each and they get notified appropriately
depending on what they're subscribed to
so as you can see there's a lot of
flexibility in how you can implement the
observer pattern in Python and if you
try to do all the things we've done in
this video using some other languages
you might find depending on the language
that's a lot more work and pythons
feature setup dynamic typing functions
being first-class objects and some other
attributes and aspects of the language
as well make it a lot easier to
implement certain patterns there's a
certain design patterns in Python
okay so that's the observer pattern in
Python I hope you got a lot out of it as
we look together and all the ways you
can implement these design patterns in
Python and a lot of the flexibility we
have now in closing I want to point to a
few resources for you first all the code
examples that we work through together
are available at the link below at new
circle comm so you can go there download
that code work through it read it play
with it learn from it
secondly as I mentioned I'm the writer
and author and editor of a newsletter in
advance Python programming the covers
topics like these and more and you can
subscribe to that again all these links
are below my grade up comm last resource
I want to tell you about is advanced
Python programming course that I'm
teaching and it's a four day course and
we can adjust that to your needs and it
goes into all these topics and more and
it's not for beginners it's for people
who already know Python and already have
some experience programming and that
enables enables us to go into some
really fascinating topics thanks a lot
