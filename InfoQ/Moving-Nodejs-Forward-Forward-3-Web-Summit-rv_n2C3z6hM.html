that I lived the past year with no desk
and bringing no desk as a platform for
word about five years ago I packed up my
family and we moved out to San Francisco
for me that you know to be able to go
get one of the few nodejs jobs and you
know about five years of my life has
been dedicated to that and including
founding a couple companies around that
but this last year has been a real key
evolution point in the history of the
project so i'm going to share that story
and sort of see how that that goes into
the future of what what no dias has to
bring javascript so I'm DeSean I'm not a
angry pink unicorn I'm sorry to
disappoint my company note source helps
enterprise companies that are adopting
node be ready for node and scale node
with support and operational tooling and
as Dave mentioned I big community
organizers and you know as one of the
exciting tidbits this last year you know
I have a spectrum of meetups from node
BOTS to SF node and now enterprise GS
node BOTS has always been kind of the
anti meet up it's kind of like getting
together and playing legos together and
instead of sharing the outcomes it's
kind of an anti meetup SF node is very
much a traditional meet up and then
enterprise jess is an exciting
initiative where we really bringing that
sense of community to the enterprise and
the organizations that are not used to
sharing with peers ringing
together and really helping them share
the experiences of large-scale
JavaScript opponent so in 2015 no disk
grew up and moved out of the house it's
been a long time community project but
it's it's time it's time for this vital
evolution and a next step in how we
interact with node and how we contribute
to it what led us to leaving the house
was a no 12 which which took about two
years to ship and in for end users you
know many end users are still using node
10 it's you know very stable does node
and does everything that you expected to
do but if you think of the developers
that are working on a project like this
two years is excruciating it's painful
you know core developers that are there
working on a project like this need to
ship code it's it's a you know a
fundamental Ronnie for developers so the
fact that no 12 was so far behind and so
delayed left to what we you know what we
ended up calling I ojs I Oh Jess came
out of some discussions and and core
contributors wanting to to be able to
continue to move node forward and it you
know I just really shot out the side of
the projects federer done knee over
thanksgiving of 2014 you know just threw
it up and on
on github and there we were often in I
ojs you know it may have seemed a lot
more organized than than that but it was
really a fedora and you know it's
applies to many core contributors that
oh there it is and I oh jess is in fact
one of the names that Ryan Dalek creator
of knowed you know was it was toying
with early on and you know having I ojs
there we can continue to develop on the
platform and you know they five years in
five years into two nodes life you know
there are many individuals who you know
define their career around node and you
know that that needed to be in a
centralized place where everyone felt
that that that that original sense of
ownership you know no grew up very
organically and with a lot of individual
contribution in and that individual
contribution leads to a very positive
very tangible sense of ownership so you
know having a place where all these core
developers can go and feel like what
they're working on is meaningful and a
beautiful thing happened so with with
node and you know you can see this this
downward trend in 2014 with you know the
as time went on with with with 12 and
there was this this dwindling group of
core developers that that were working
on the project but then I just happened
and you know the vast majority of the
core team moved over to work
full time and we did something very
simple we explicitly asked for
contribution we said please come and
participate this is your project we want
you to be a part of this and you know
not just in you know the core code you
know node if you lift up the cover it
gets really complex very very quickly
you move away from you know the the
application layer where we're working in
JavaScript and you know there's a thin
veneer of JavaScript API but then
there's c and c++ and v8 and it gets
really deep into you know technical
weeds if you're contributing the core
but you know that's not a the entirety
of the note project there's so much more
that goes into really you know creating
the lifeblood of an open source project
so we made an explicit act of inviting
individuals to come contribute and you
know participate find a way to do that
we ended up having documentation
translated into you know a bunch of
different languages that it you know to
never had that level of documentation
and the translation of that amazing
amazing amazing time um that's kind of
the the inner working of that the end
users that you know what are using node
and running node in production just kind
of want to know that that nodes okay I
want to know what what to be using in
production and that what they're
investing development effort in on is
going to be there for them in
and you know a long time into the future
and that they can rely on what's there
so uh you know it's very exciting to see
all of those threads coming back
together in you know this year and you
know it's exceedingly rare in the
history of both open source software
that a fork like this happens and you
know it comes back together you look at
the history of open source and and you
know at a certain point interests
diverge and you know groups go in
different direction Linux is a prime
example of that where you know they're
just you know so many permutations you
know our Linux distributions were
constantly getting introduced to brand
new linux distributions because you know
there's a new flavor new tuning a new
direction on that but the reason why
that those threads came together is io
jess was you know what was never an
intent to separate from node I I gave an
interview back at the beginning of the
year and I described IHS as the ultimate
poll request so you know this project is
the expression of the oh no developers
node community asserting this is this is
no this is what we believe in in the
project and this is how it needs to be
run we need to continue to have that
sense of contribution and you know the
dynamic energy that made node what it is
today so you know we understand the you
know the rest of you know politics of
whatever's going on but you know this is
node and you know that assertion you
know was always around
in the note project so thankfully uh you
know with a lot of unfortunately you
know probably for a open source project
a little bit too much for my taste of
you know but behind the scenes talking
but when you need to course-correct
often times it's more constructed to
have a private conversation but
beginning of this year we began to head
down the path of foundation back in
December the new CEO at Giants got
Hammond who you know inherited day one
this sort of seizing the boiling pot of
contention you know announced that that
joint had the intention to move it into
a foundation and you know we set out
from there to really bring that forward
it's been a long year so you know the
official announcement was made back in
February at node summit and the node
foundation we went we we talked to a lot
of foundations along the way and you
know tried to find the right home for
four node and the Linux Foundation
really was the perfect fit for for the
project we you know they're the
community around node has grown up I for
one you know have a company that that's
dedicated to note but you know that
there are a lot of corporate interests
there but it's balanced by a lot of
personal interests you know if I wasn't
doing things on the business side I'd
still be involved in node because of
that personal passion that I have for
for the project and you know how much
it's it's changed my life as a developer
and you know sort of it allowed me to
develop and Dan JavaScript so you know
the foundation is
up and running now we just had some of
the the initial process coming together
and you know the something about the the
node car team is now the the technical
steering committee so you hear that
you'll tsc will pop up a lot now tsc is
just the note core team and rod bags
been great leading leading up that
effort there so uh where do you go for
node these days uh this is exciting this
is very new github nodejs is the org for
this a felix guy cousin Dorf had
actually registered this back a long
time ago and it was sitting dormant and
you know as the the foundation really
came into being finalized and when it
was clear that I Oh Jess and you know
the core contributors were all coming
back together Felix very generously
handed that off to the no disc
foundation and you know so anything
going forward node related is is going
to be found here as your primary home
for code for the real thing I oh jess is
for now still a thing you know we just
had a release of 2.5 the other day and
you know the the continuum of node
basically no don't you know you'd say
joint no tis no jest I oh jess is is you
know this fork but it's you know it's
all node and you know the you know
wonderful facts that we've been able to
bring it back together and you have
alignment as a community and there's a
continuum that goes from you know the
zero dots of the joint node days
the way through 0 12 and then you know
the one dots with IHS continue that
version numbering and right now the the
tsc is working on node 3 point 0 which
is where the converged code from IHS 2
and 0 12 are coming back together and
all of that will live at github nodejs
note so this is the new new home for
that if you're if you're tracking a 0 12
release that's still coming out of joint
node but this will be no Jess going
forward and the the primary both of that
so 2015 brings uh you know with all this
evolution even more ways that we can
contribute and you know the foundation
really represents a new way that
companies can can participate in an
facilitating node a couple years ago
Aaron hammer made the assertion that to
be a successful node.js company you had
to hire a core contributor that's you
know that's not a very scalable process
and I'm not necessarily what we we need
for the core project you know everyone
everyone as a company dedicated to note
wants to be sure that nodes going to
continue and going to move forward so by
participating the foundation we have
finally a platform to do that you know
the foundation has this evolving sliding
scale that encourages contribution does
a very good job at incentivizing
corporations to participate and and
really fund the project it's a great
system the and
you know the platinum gold and silver
are very sort of standard foundation ooh
things the key detail the essential need
that we as a community very strongly
asserted in rolling out this process is
that you know to to to represent node
the the foundation has to have an
individual membership level and that
individual membership group has to be
represented at the board so you know the
individual membership group I think the
the final details is about you know 50
bucks a year for an individual
contributor those individuals who are
you know not involved in the corporate
side of things and are you know join the
foundation at that level pull together
and have that that vital voice of the
community of the individuals who make up
a node and you know those individuals
are you know what's really made no great
as individuals and you know the I OJ's
process and that that explicit request
full in an invitation for contribute
controvers contributors it has evolved
into the working group process and
they're an incredible number of working
groups that you know are really
exploring the needs of the node
community you know nan has has been
given to the you know the node project
as the official way to do native modules
that that's eased that process greatly
so rather than doing sort of very
brittle bindings directly to a v8 code
there's an abstraction layer that makes
that scalable and you know you still
have to recompile for
for a major v8 change but you can go in
and not have to change your application
code significantly the API working group
is working on the note jsapi externally
and also internally the node has always
been on on v8 and you know that's been a
blessing you know because of the eight
we have fast JavaScript back you know
I'm still my age you know back in the
late 90s you know netscape
communications server had server-side
javascript but it's horrible they it was
completely inefficient you know the API
working group is also exploring how we
can make that underlying vm API more
flexible and more robust to to really
deal with with the v8 and also
facilitate things like you know what
Microsoft's been doing to put a note on
chakra and you know they're doing some
really interesting things with their IOT
platform with that tooling so you know
it's been been really positive we've had
a spider node in the past with spider
monkey running on the with the mozilla
team but if it was it was hard for them
to make maintain and you know it's
always been been tracking that that v8
api so we're gonna make that that API
layer more robust and should be very
interesting to see the outcome there you
know one of my favorite groups the
diversity working group came out of no
comp this year you know you know Dave's
an incredible job at really building a
diverse event and it shows from you know
that thoughtfulness you know
the beautiful diversity of the attendees
of this group unfortunately you know the
node core team is still you know a bit
too white male and you know as a company
investing in note we want to be sure
that we have you know a diverse pool of
developers that we can draw on so you
know continue to invest in that and in a
work to drive that forward Brian Hughes
if you did the the node BOTS event the
that node bought effort is you know
working toward you know what hopefully
will become a native api's in node for
some of that low-level serial
communication a node was was created as
an application development platform and
Chris Williams voodoo Tiki God has you
know he created note serial port the
sort of allowed the whole node BOTS
experience to to evolve he's been asking
core to you know to expose the low-level
API and therefore for Hardware interest
and you know so if you're passionate
about that you're building on that I
know that's a great opportunity to get
involved I Intel is internationalization
so 0 dot 12 introduces new standards
based internationalization features very
important for the larger larger
deployments LTS I'll touch on a moment
post-mortem debugging with core dumps
tracing and in all the translation work
going on so near and dear to my heart
and the enterprise is this this group
that we've been spearheading and
you know one of the biggest feedback
points that we heard from end users in
ifgs was like whoa like things are
coming way too fast uh you know I i'm
running this in production I you know
don't have any interest in you know
following the the day-to-day evolution I
want to make sure that that's happening
but you know what i want what i mostly
want is to know that what I'm running in
production is stable and is going to be
supported so the LTS working group was
created to really define the long-term
strategy for how node is supported and
with that that also has you know
facilitated a lot of the development
flow to you know you basically
established that the outer range of your
constraint with LTS and then you know it
colors the entire development flow and
and how that fits in so uh you know
converts node will have its first stable
release with what should be 40 in August
be very exciting to have you know
something that we can all move from 0-10
from 0 about 12 or from I ljs to a
version that is going to be supported
for quite a long time and you know the
first LTS release will be in October so
with LTS we have a new LTS a little be
cut about once a year and then that LTS
support will will be around for that
version for 18 months so you know when
an LTS version is released you know that
that API is going to be consistent for
you know a very long period and then
after those 18 months an additional 12
months of maintenance with you know bug
critical security patches being landed
there so you know you have it you know
kind of ironically a couple years you
know the original pain point of no 12
for developers remember the CEO this is
developers not being able to ship code
not you know the end user experience an
end user experience you know is a
stability and consistency our King you
know this this brings together the right
balance where the node core team the tsc
can continue to develop and you know
make that essential evolution of the
platform you know drive Ford adoption of
you know es6 and and all the exciting
things that are coming out of you know
the underlying evolution of the
JavaScript runtime but also you know end
of the day the most important thing is
users using node and you know the
resigning cries that you know end users
want no to be consistent in stable so
it's been a exciting adventure but you
know this little part of the JavaScript
ecosystem has you know really come
together and it's great to be have
everyone that's been involved with node
fervor yeah this last few years you know
together again and to see all the new
contribution that's happening so very
excited to move nodejs board and you
know together with that it also moves
JavaScript for so thank you very much
