there's this sort of general idea about
constraints that we have that they are a
negative thing yeah there's stuff that
limits freedom and of course you know
limiting freedom that sounds like a bad
bad thing I don't want that but I would
like to show you how constraints can be
extremely good and even beautiful if we
embrace them in the right way because
constraints are everywhere they
literally are everywhere they are in the
rooms that we live and work in they are
in there just streets that we drive on
the clothes on their backs stir the
balances in our bank accounts there the
hotels that we attend conferences in the
stages we present from now this
constraint our entire league legals or
our entire society is built on a set of
legal constraints which give us morality
and stability and safety and security
and those in turn provide us with
freedom and opportunities for us to
pursue things that we want things like
careers and dreams and just hobbies or
whatever you want to do constraints are
really inherent part of the universe and
life itself I mean death is the
constraint that gives meaning to life
but i'll spare you philosophical debate
certainly at 1030am yeah so constraints
are everywhere
so are they just bad art is good are
they really you know kind of both
perhaps in this case this man is Gary
Chang he's a hong kong-based architect
and he had a constraint of his apartment
of 32 square meters which is about 345
square foot which is about maybe twice
the size of this stage and that's it
that was his apartment and he grew up in
that but he wanted to do he wanted to
have a nicer sure like more Rui place to
live in and so what he did was he took
that constraint of his physical space
and he turned it into something amazing
by making all of the interior walls
adjustable so that he could have a
really nice spacious comfortable bedroom
and then he could just pull the bed up
pull different wall out and now you
would have a living room or we pull the
wall over further than I we'd have a
library room for reading you can see in
the bottom three screenshots from video
what he's doing with the walls he's
pulling him out turning them into other
rooms basically as a kitchen it pulls a
wall out here's a nice big kitchen
there's a bath tub underneath the
kitchen so he has a whole bathroom and
he took these physical constraints and
turned him into something really just
creative and amazing like I don't
necessarily want to live in Hong Kong
but I would want to live in that
apartment at least for a little bit
right but he wasn't even the first to do
adjustable interiors in 1924 the dutch
designer and architect it felt designed
was he was commissioned to do a design
for a house and the woman who
commissioned him she requested that he
designed it preferably without walls now
how do you design house preferably
without walls right so he went through
some design phases and ended up with
this fantastic house that sort of where
the interior bleeds out into the
exterior
and the interior is completely
adjustable into different sized bedrooms
in kitchen living room and this was a
really unusual constraint for him to
work in but it turned out that this
constraint produced or let him to create
this incredibly creative but also hyper
modern house because we look at this and
we kind of see Aaron this might have
been designed and built somewhere in the
last 20 years it has a modern feel to it
but this is almost 90 years old this was
way ahead of its time and that's just
because he was forced you think in a
completely different way where he could
not build on any of the architectural
styles that had come before there was
nothing in the history of architecture
that he could sort of learn from about
how to do such a completely different
style of house now we also have
financial constraints I mean who doesn't
work with a limited budget and for this
sommelier the design firm was told you
know there's only a very small budget
available for this I just want a brand
identity but I don't have a lot of money
turns out that was okay they came up
with this really great creative solution
where they took vanilla business cards
and envelopes and just put wine stains
all over them this is a very cheap
solution but it is such a like it so
much because every card and every
envelope is unique no two are alike
where you hold two up next to each other
and you can just tell this is a brand
this is an identity that really works
for her you know and that's a financial
constraint that drove them to do
something nice and creative and
beautiful we can also have arbitrary
constraints in a work or in things that
we create for instance Instagram was
originally built as just an iphone app
and the iphone at the time not any more
of the five but at the time was a three
by two screen aspect ratio the photos
that took were three by two more or less
but they decided to go with a fixed size
for their photos because they want to
sort of reminisce from the Polaroid
error
now they did a bunch of other stuff as
well so they didn't need to necessarily
go with the fixed photo size too good
have just gone with like hey these are
the filters this is like a little
Pollard frame around it it would still
look like Polaroids even if it was a
different higher resolution photo or
different aspect ratio but they went
with the fixed size and that resulted in
this unique sort of like identity for
them which we now associate with them as
much as we do with Polaroid more so with
Polaroid if you're older less say a few
younger and these were completely
arbitrary constraints there were no
technical reasons for them to do this
they had all the freedom they wanted in
terms of whatever this would be like
they chose to force themselves into this
square constraint and I'd say it worked
out pretty well for them a nature has
constraints I'm going to read this quote
but I Rob done trees have evolved in
struggle plans against plans many times
in vastly different lineages the highest
leaves win and so trees tend to evolve
to be as tall as possible given the
limits of physics and precipitation
without competition every forest would
be a thick film of green life now
imagine for a moment that nature didn't
have this constraint of physics and
precipitation and sunlight and the earth
would be covered in just thick films of
green life all over the the breath of
nature's wonder would not be here today
we would not even have life on Earth the
way we know it I found it so beautiful
that there are so many constraints in in
the world and in nature that we just
look at them you see that nature will
find a way life finds a way around these
constraints to either work within them
or to work around them but it finds some
sort of create a solution
but what I'm not saying is that you need
constraints for creativity that's not
what I'm saying it fosters creativity
but it's not dependent on it for
instance who's familiar with this
building okay so you've probably heard
of this this is the Sagrada Familia the
Cathedral designed by gaudi in Barcelona
and this is in my opinion one of the
most amazing pieces of art ever created
in the history of mankind this Cathedral
is amazing it is jaw-droppingly stunning
she walked through it you find endless
amounts of little details in every part
of this really gigantic beautiful
cathedral it is really incredibly
beautiful it's awe-inspiring and it's
not done yet they started in 1892 Goudy
died before it was even halfway
completed and it's not even done for
another 20 years so while this is a
great testimony to the limitless
potential of the human mind if we have
all the freedom in the world and no
constraints deadlines have their uses
because we cannot just always do
something like this certainly not if we
want to see the end result of our work
before we die so some constraints
probably useful for us specifically
deadlines
another constraint in life is the human
attention span which is about 15 to 20
minutes so I want to take a brief moment
of Zen to breathe in and kind of reflect
we seen that constraints can produce
really good things that can be really
beautiful the results can be stunning we
can find a lot of creativity and
innovation as a result of them so what
if we want to apply this to our work of
course we have constraints in our work I
mean we work in a digital media so we
don't have natural constraints we don't
have natural resources that are limited
for us to worry about so much the
interfaces we design the code that we
write we can basically go on endlessly
with us but we do have certain
constraints in our work and some of us
work better with them than other certain
techniques were better than others take
for instance screen sizes now since the
advent of the graphical interface we've
always kind of had essentially this
limited canvas for for the screens that
we work with we I mean there's no
there's a screen size limit of the
monitor or the display that we're
looking at but behind that the interface
that we're looking at is essentially a
limitless campus it can be endless in
any direction except that would be a
really bad experience so we say okay
well we'll make some of it constraint
but then of course not all information
fits so we have scrolling and we're
scrolling kind of realize that you're
not scrolling back and forth in sideways
in all directions that's kind of a
painful experience now that doesn't work
very well so we kind of said that's
let's decide to make scrolling gopher
t'kul only you know for the most part we
did and then we decided at some point
collectively that 980 pixels was a great
with for websites why
because the dominant screen size at the
time just happened to be certain certain
slightly over 980 pixels width but that
was not really constrained of the medium
and when mobile devices started coming
around you started having all these
smartphones and then later tablets we
kind of very very quickly realized that
that 980 pixel width constraint that we
had self-imposed really didn't make any
sense because now we had all these
different devices with different screen
sizes that just didn't fit that and it
was just a bad experience so we had to
come up with mobile sites and that was
not really working very well and so we
had responsive web design come up or you
know Ethan Marcotte came up with
responsive web design any basically he
gave it us he gave us a new constraint
and he said enough of the mobile sites
and desktop sites and all these weird
things we do trying to cater to all
these various different screen sizes I
kind of envisioned him it's like you
know maybe Gandalf and lucky enough and
he gave us a new constraint one that I
really like content should existed one
URL and she'd work on whatever device or
screen size is reading that content
I love that it's very fitting for the
nature of our platform of our medium of
the Internet of the web and so that
became a really sort of positive embrace
of constraints ditching the ones that we
self-imposed that didn't make a lot of
sense and we we see a really good result
that despite what some idiots my trying
convince you of responsive web design is
a really effective way of building
designing the absolute next generation
of websites and web applications that
we're making now accept and we're not
quite there yet the technology isn't
entirely there yet but also we started
to design for various screen sizes we've
done that now we have okay we're
designing for mobile first and then
we're expanding to tablets and then
expanding to desktops and it's a nicer
and richer experience one of the things
that we see happening in the code still
is that we're coding these websites as
if everyone is actually on the desktop
and has broadband data and no data like
no limited data use so now we're seeing
responsive website web sites that send
it look great on mobile but send four
megabytes of data to the small device
that's on 3g and might only have like
500 megs of data for a month so there's
still some some code constraints that we
haven't really embraced properly yet and
I think that's kind of a shame because
God constraints are a really great in
fact are so great that they're contests
about them who has heard of the 10k part
who's heard a 5k ah I feel like I'm the
old one nap 5k was this code come Co
constrained contest done by Stewart
Butterfield's in two thousand and two
thousand one and two thousand and two
and what this content was all about he
basically he challenged web developers
to make something HTML CSS JavaScript
images didn't matter what whatever they
wanted but the entire amount of data
that their website or mini application
was had to be five kilobytes or less
five kilobytes this was 2002 so we're
ready you know we're already seeing some
cool stuff happening in websites or web
page sizes grow a little so five cables
is crazy except in that craziness there
was something really appealing to a lot
of people because they came up with all
these really creative solutions to work
within those constraints there are
people who created sort of generated
interfaces by using javascript to
generate the next lines of code
automatically that would then create the
interface for it so that it all fit
within 5k of data even though when she
ran it in the browser would be a lot
more and we had all these crazy things
happening and it was such a success that
you did it two years more and then after
that about eight years later a list
apart looked at Edom's like you know we
should do this again all these page
sizes are ballooning and people aren't
really you know they're sort of taking a
lazy way out or just throwing library
after library after library in there and
it's not the best and you know with this
responsive web design happening right
now we need to promote that so they they
create a 10k apart in 10k apart is a
contest that where you have not five
kilobytes but you get 10 kilobytes yes
you know twice as much and you have you
have the permission of using one or two
javascript libraries here and there you
know you had a little bit of extra help
stuff that you could use that won't
count against those 10 kilobytes
and then with that what we ended up
seeing from that was people made entire
websites entire web applications and
little games in the browser using just
10 kilobytes of code and they worked on
smartphones and tablets and desktop all
within 10 K of code so this crazy
constrained ended up providing work
ended up causing to so much creativity
and so much sort of like code innovation
that we now have like fantastic results
from it and Stewart had this great quote
about it I think rigid constraints of
designing for the web forces to get
through to creative since the space we
have to explore so small we have to look
harder get more creative and that's what
makes it all interesting and I could not
agree more with this this is the results
of the 10k part in particular have just
blown me away the things people have
been doing with 10k of code now a
similar project around that time was
Dave che SI SSN garden and it had also a
code related constraint I was a little
different it said this is the HTML page
or XHTML page in that time you do not
get to change this code you do not get
to change the markup this is it work
with this all you get to do is provide
it a new CSS file and what we ended up
seeing from that that constraint led to
people designing more than 1200
completely unique designs for one single
HTML page and they work extremely
diverse some of them were just so
completely different from what you would
expect if you look at the decides and
the default templates the kind of
examples that they've provided some of
them are so different that if you were
opening in one browser they look
completely different than another to
showcase the different capabilities of
browsers and how CSS works and this was
really important because for our
industry
at the time to CSIS and garden came
around CSS as a method of styling
websites and designing them was heavily
on the dispute there are a lot of people
who are like nah tables are fine now
this CSS stuff this doesn't work it's
crazy go away but the sees this and
garden proof that sees this was not just
here to stay it was so fantastic for
styling website it offered you so much
more flexibility than you ever could
achieve with tables and this was really
pivotal for our industry and it all came
down to one constraint this is the
exchange mail PI X HTML page you do not
get to change it it also really taught
people about the separation of HTML CSS
and JavaScript which is a constraint of
its own because before that we kind of
messed everything up by putting it all
together and what we had with that was
really just messy code that was really
hard to work with later on so with the
separation we got this really clean code
it's much more maintainable work better
basically meant you weren't a dick to
anyone using your code in the future
including your own future self and we
had this you know this whole separation
thing that it kind of became a much more
successful technique for people to work
with we also have like now we have
mobile constraints resource constraints
where we may have smartphones with
resolutions on their screens that rival
or our desktop laptops and desktop
screens perhaps but they're running on
smaller devices with less resources less
memory less CPU power and also less
bandwidth power the average mobile it's
not like yeah you have 3g and I you have
LTE it's sort of grade but for the most
part in the world it's more like the
crappy Wi-Fi at a coffee shop full of
hipsters
no it's really not that great and if
your page works great on desktop because
your desktop is connected to broadband
and has a great connection doesn't
necessarily mean that personal mobile is
getting that three mega by page that
you've created about as fast so we need
to sort of like keep that size
constraint in check now modernizer which
I hope everyone is familiar with but we
in designing modernizer I set a very
clear set of API constraints that I
imposed on how it had to work it was
very simple it had to be very easy to
use an if else in your JavaScript and
just say like hey if the browser
supports this feature then do this if it
doesn't support this feature then do
that and have to work the exact same way
in CSS you have to be able to say in
your CSS if the browser supports this
feature used to CSS if it doesn't use
that CSS and that API constrained like
the very simple use case meant that
modernize was really easy to use and
really powerful to use and now used very
widely by lots and lots of people it
also had size constraints it had to be
very small the footprint had to be small
so that it would download really fast
because we had the html5 ship in there
so that ie browsers that didn't yet
support a new html5 semantic elements
would still be able to get the
understand them install them before the
page started rendering and look like
 so at the size constraint which
tied into the speed constrained it had
to execute and be done in less than 50
milliseconds because otherwise you had a
good chance of seeing this flash of
weird unstyled content happen so we
impose all these sort of restraints on
them and nowadays you know you can add
all the tests you want to modernize its
not under 50 milliseconds anymore but
for production you only need use which
he needs still pretty much underneath
that or even far less
and these these constraints that we
imposed we didn't have to I mean what
JavaScript libraries these days you can
just go do whatever you want not that
you should but we impress these
constraints on it and they work really
well and that leads me to looking
forward there's a pattern emerging in
our industry of opinionated interfaces
and i'm not talking about hell though I
do kind of like the idea of house and
just an opinionated interface but what
I'm talking about is the default
settings and the features that we offer
most users don't change defaults and
most users will take features for
granted if you put them in front of them
but what that means is every every every
setting that you create and every
default you choose for that basically
dictates the behavior and the experience
of your users and if you impose certain
limitations they can turn into really
great Liberation's if you have a feature
the user has to interact with that they
did or they don't have to but they have
they'll be aware of that and they have
to think about it if you take that
feature away you free up the cognitive
load for that user allowing them to
focus on the things that they probably
should be working on instead that's not
true for every feature of course room
features are really critical others are
sort of like nice for small amount of
people a good example that is powerpoint
and keynote you know these slideshow
software tools the first thing they ask
the user is you know what do you what
pixel dimensions do you want your slides
to be in who cares all right I don't
care this is a projector it is a
rectangle my slides rectangle should fit
but they have this feature in there for
you know maybe the one percent or point
one percent of users that actually use
it they have a need for it so there are
some people that really do need that
feature but most people they have no
need for that they just want it to work
they should be focusing on whatever
presentation they're about to create and
so it's adding cognitive load to their
experience that should not be there
until I'm creating is present date we
kind of make it opinionated and just say
your slides this is the aspect ratio go
focus on your story could focus on
whatever you're talking about focus on
your content because we make we believe
that slide should exist in all
dimensions or all pixel dimensions you
know not time and space now and so what
we do is we just say hey these are your
slides and if you're opening them on a
really small phone they'll fit nicely on
the phone if you're opening them on the
tablet if what they'll fit nicely in the
tablet opening on a desktop they'll fit
nicely on the desktop these are all
various various sizes for the exact same
slides that's how it should be you
shouldn't be having to think about the
size of your slides that's a feature
that should be embedded in the product
and the product should be opinionated
about that it should make that decision
for you and in some cases certainly in
this case it should not even like tell
you about that decision that should just
be ingrained in the product that's a
form of constraint
of course just having missing features
or hidden features in your in your
product or interface doesn't mean it is
opinionated and i define it as such that
the difference between a bad interface
and an opinionated interface is that in
the latter missing features are by
design you have to think about really
whether these features that you're
putting in your tool your website your
interface whether they are necessary for
the user to spend time thinking about
there's a good chance that maybe maybe
they do maybe they don't but if you do
hide them you need to you know this
needs to be a designed and informed
decision to make that so I want to leave
you with the encouragement to think
about the size and efficiency and the
use of your code the way Gary tangled
with his apartment or rietveld with the
house I want you to think about the
decode reuse and the reusability of
resources like the sony yays case with
the design branding for with wine I want
you to think about
I want you to think about imposing
arbitrary constraints on your app or
your website and think about what the
defaults mean for your users and what
kind of experience they really dictate
for your users and think about creating
the pinion ated software and hopefully
we'll see some really nicely constrained
but beautiful products as a result thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
