name is Barney and I work for a company
called coated technologies today I'm
going to talk about how to build
enterprise applications that look and
feel like consumer applications so
before we get into the topic very brief
introduction about us we are I T
consulting company based out of
California with offices in California
and India we've been working with the
row mobile products we for the last year
plus and we built up several enterprise
applications we are a partner for roma
by motorola microsoft and oracle and we
deliver on consulting projects so we
help both with delivering projects to
customers as well as training and there
are some flyers out here and back there
the talks about our company if you are
interested so i am going to folk start
by showing some screenshots of some
consumer applications and the whole
purpose of this call of this meeting of
this presentation is to talk about how
to make a boring enterprise application
so when we when people talk about
enterprise application the first word
that comes to mind is boring because it
just does what it is supposed to do it
is not fun like using an iOS app so I'm
going to show you some techniques to
make the enterprise apps look like a
consumer app the primary focus will be
on using jQuery Mobile will briefly
touch on Jake you m.o.b and sencha touch
which are other tools that do the same
thing i will show you some resources
where you can get more information and
leave some room for questions so
throughout the talk i am going to be
switching back and forth between the
presentation code and running some
samples so feel free to stop me at any
time and just so i can set my pace how
many of you are familiar with raw
elements version 2 or roads okay that's
that's a pretty good number thank you so
these are screenshots of gmail and
another application primarily focused at
consumers so if you look some of the
things that make it intuitive and
user-friendly are the usage of icons for
example for the inbox for the sent mail
so just by looking at those you know
what you are looking at the other kinds
of things are very intuitive actions so
when you look at the plus button you you
know that you are adding something and
when you look at these right arrows it
kind of intuitively tells you that when
you click on it something that is
clickable and when you click on it it
does something so again there are
different kinds of arrows each one meant
to
convey a different sense of activities
that you can perform so doesn't have to
look just grey and blue your apps can
look just like your rest of your
company's website or it can match your
company's branding so here we have two
screenshots from careerbuilder one from
careerbuilder other from nike so they
are using different colors different
icons different logos to brand the
application so just because it's an
enterprise application doesn't mean that
it has to look plain vanilla you can and
you should be able to brand it so that
your customers intuitively know that it
is your company's application that they
are working on so so I'm going to show
you some techniques to achieve what I
just showed you through the usage of
jQuery Mobile so for those of you
familiar with building web applications
I'm sure you've come across jQuery it's
a great application library for building
web applications unfortunately it works
great on the desktops but not so much on
the mobile devices and so jQuery Mobile
was built for primarily for mobile
devices both the smartphones as well as
tablet devices it's built on top of
jQuery so you get all of the querying
all of the nice carrying features of
jQuery but at the same time it adds a
lot of nice user interface touches it
also takes
advantage of the device features like
swiping tapping tapping and holding and
things of that nature so it's it's
really meant for mobile devices it
supports html5 so that any application
that you build you do not have to port
it to different platforms so any any
device that supports html5 runs your
application without any change
so as I said it supports it run
jquery-mobile runs on tablets
smartphones even look so essentially
what is what I was saying before it's
html5-based works and looks the same on
different platforms you can customize
for your company's branding so it
supports a whole slew of devices so one
of the things that sets apart jquery
mobile from JQ mobi and sencha touch and
the other frameworks is the breadth of
support for almost all of the devices in
the industry right from ios and android
and blackberry to windows mobile phones
webos etc the other nice thing that I
like about jQuery Mobile is it uses
something called progressive enhancement
what it means is for a device that is a
very stripped down device that cannot
run animations and things like that
without you having to change your code
it will run just the basic functional
aspects of the code whereas if you run
the same application on a very high-end
device not only does it support the
functional aspects of your application
but also all of the fans here things
like animations transitions Ajax calls
things like that so that that's
essentially what progressive enhancement
is so support the basic functionality on
the basic very basic devices and then as
the device gets better in terms of
features the framework automatically
starts providing enabling those on the
higher higher and higher power devices
so the support for devices is
categorized by jquery-mobile folks into
a grade B grade and C grade so at the a
grade or the iOS Android BlackBerry
devices as well as desktop browsers for
a b-grade device like a blackberry 5 you
do get your functional the application
function you just don't have the Ajax
navigation for example and for a c-grade
device like a windows mobile device or
even an older version of blackberry like
for version for you just get plain
vanilla application you don't get any of
the fans here features but the important
fact is the application still runs on
those low power devices so that is that
is something that is very nice because
you don't have to worry about porting
your code to these different sets of
devices you just write it once and you
are done so just to give you an idea of
the kinds of applications that have been
built using this framework there is the
Stanford application Walt Disney
opentable so as you can see each of
these applications they look very
different from each other they don't
they don't look like your typical
enterprise application they they convey
the branding of the company that it is
built for you can have all sorts of
icons that make the feature intuitive
you can put your own company branding
like the Mickey Mouse you can have
different background colors so so
anything that you can think of to make
your application attractive and
intuitive the user you can you can do
that
so there are some key components of
jquery mobile that lets you do what I
just talked about so some of the
components are pages and dialogues so I
will talk in more detail about several
of these toolbars buttons formatting
content forms which is which is one of
the more frequently used aspects of any
framework UI framework lists again
that'sthat's frequently used
additionally there are helper utilities
as well as tools to manage events so for
example if you are building a book
reader and the user swipes on the right
side you want to be able to detect that
so that is what event management does
for you so let us take a look at some of
the components we do not have time to go
through all of the components but I will
highlight some of them so let's start
with the page and a dialog a page it's
basically what you think of a page it's
what you see on the screen it is the
fundamental element what jQuery allows
you to do is to show a single page as is
or if you have multiple pages it lets
you treat all of those pages as a single
page so that when you transition from
one page to the other page it doesn't
feel like you are browsing a website it
also it almost feels like you are
flowing from one screen to the other so
that is the kind of effect it brings you
and it does it automatically for you so
all you have to do is link the second
page from the first page and vice versa
and you can have a very smooth
transition I have an example I will show
that you
so to build a basic page you need a
header header and a body so a header
basically okay so even before we talk
about the header the first thing we need
to do is define this as an html5
application and the way we do that is to
set the dot type to HTML so anytime you
set doctype HTML it means we are talking
about an html5 application and then
there are three essential things that we
need to do to take advantage of jQuery
Mobile one is to import the stylesheet
so here I am pointing to the content
delivery network on the jquery mobile
site but you can ship it local you can
download it and ship with your mobile
application the second thing you need is
the core jquery library itself and i am
using a min ified version the third
thing you need is the actual jquery
library the jquery mobile library
additionally what i am doing is I am
setting a property called a viewport and
I am setting it to say that scale to the
width of the device so this way when you
change from portrait to landscape or go
from a smaller device to the bigger
device you do not have to hard code the
dimensions of various things the
application automatically scales so that
is the header and if you look at the
body there's only two two essential
things that you would need to do one is
two
create a div and assign an element
called data-role equal to page we will
talk about the data attributes in a
second but whenever you say data-role
equal to page that means that is the
container for for the rest of your
application to the Sidon and within the
page really all you need is the content
and that is where you put your main
application content header and footer
are obviously optional but that it is
helpful for navigation and informational
purposes so coming to the data
attributes it's a new new feature of
html5 it basically lets you define the
the look and feel as well as the
behavior of certain elements of any
element that you want but do it in a
descriptive way rather than a
programmatic way so it is just like
setting a property so you do not really
have to do anything for example when I
say data-role equal to page i define all
of the styling in the style sheet so I
do not really have to do anything
specific inside my HTML code for the
styling or the behavior or anything like
that I do not even need to write
JavaScript so for example there is a
data attribute called transition so when
I say data transition equal to flip when
you click on the element that has that
transition it flips when you click on it
so the point here is you don't have to
write JavaScript corporate you do not
have to write any code for it all you
have to do is declare that it it is a
data transition flip and you are done
so there are several transitions fade
power flip you you must be familiar with
this when you play with your smartphones
and tablets but the point here is if you
use this framework you get all of these
built-in so let us look at an example
before we get to a dialogue
so what I have here is a row elements to
application or a Rhodes application and
I am looking at the index dot e RB file
so all i am doing since since this is a
static application i do not need any
model or controller i am just going to
show everything in the view the idea so
i generated a basic roads application
the same you can do the same with raw
elements to and then under app i am
editing the file called indexed or be so
inside the file what i have done is I've
stripped out whatever was auto-generated
and I wrote my own code so i defined
something called data-role equal to page
and i gave it an ID of home we will talk
about why i gave the ID home in a second
but let us focus on data roll equal to
page and then i defined that my page has
a header and I gave it a title and then
I said there is something called
data-role equal to content and inside
the content I have two links one is to
contact us and one is to know more about
us and again for when you click on or
tap on contact us I am saying show the
other page but flip do a transition do
the transition through a flip and when
you tap on about us I am saying the
transition should be pop and then I
defined a footer and that's it so here
for the contact i defined i have given a
link to contact us and i have referenced
it through the I
II so if I go to the contact so again i
have defined one more page called
contact us and so for me to be able to
reference this page i need to give it an
ID and so i gave it an idea of contact
us and this is exactly the ID that I
refer to when I tap on the link from the
home page so i didn't have to include
the second page within the same file i
could have done it in a separate file
but just to give you an idea of the the
point that I am trying trying to drive
here though is even though you have
multiple pages what jQuery Mobile does
is when you tap on a link it doesn't
actually replace the first page and load
the second page it just does a dom
replacement so it it almost feels like
you're loading within the same
application it does not feel like a web
application where you are going to an
external link and bringing it does not
feel like that same way i have defined a
third page called about us and then I'm
referencing that third page from within
my first page and I am going back and
inside the second page as well as well
as the third page i have a link back to
my home and since i need a way to
reference it and the reference for d ID
for the first page for the home page is
home that's all I am referencing it any
questions before i run this example
so I am going to run this on an iOS
simulator
so this is what I was talking about so I
have my title I have my body I have my
footer and two links contact us and
about us and so I said when I tap on
contact us flip and show the contact us
page so even though the contact us is a
different page it does not feel like we
are going to a different page and if I
click tap on about us it pops up
questions
ok
so a lot of the examples that we talk
about our most of the functionality that
I am going to show you today are going
to be enabled through the data dash
attributes so we have seen data-role now
let us talk about data rell so you can
find all of these in the jquery mobile
documentation and i am going to give you
references to it but here if you want to
enable if you want to enable a dialog
all you have to do is say data dash rail
equal to dialogue to any link and when
you tap on that link it shows up as a
dialog so one of the more common
features of a web application or a
mobile application is the ability for
users to interact with your application
through forms and jQuery Mobile has a
lot of support for enhancing the look
and feel as well as the behavior of
forms but compliant and conformant to
the restrictions of a mobile device so
so what it does is it makes the
checkboxes and radio buttons bigger so
that you can tap on those easily when
you click when you have a select select
item it pops up a box I'm sure you are
familiar with it if you use an iOS
device I'll show you examples of those
so that you can easily pick your choice
then there is support for on and off
switches search boxes sliders that's
that's again mobile device specific and
then
you can actually group all of your radio
buttons or check boxes so that it is
very clear to the user that they belong
to a they all belong to the same
category and then by default it makes
the corners rounded so that it looks
good by the way speaking of rounded
corners the way jquery-mobile implements
this is through css3 transitions so it
doesn't actually use any images it does
it through css3 mechanism to do drop
shadows and rounded corners the reason
for that is obviously speed and then
again to to make your radio buttons or
checkboxes belong to a group all you
have to do is say data-role equal to
control group and then all of the items
that you define within a control group
become grouped let's let us talk about
each of these through an example
so again i created a basic roads
application i stripped out everything
that was created by default in the index
dot e RB file and then I I basically
created these form elements that I just
referred to so here I have a page I
chose not to use a header so inside my
content I have something called field
contain so data-role field contains so
anything that you define as field
contain so what jQuery Mobile does is so
here we have two elements that we are
displaying on the page the user's name
and their age so because we define these
with infield contain what it does is it
aligns the labels and it aligns the text
boxes we talked about control group so
I'm using check boxes in this example
and as I mentioned before when we have a
control group it it groups all of the
check boxes or radio buttons within
within a certain group
and then here i have a slider so if i
say input type equal to range I get a
slider and this is an on/off switch and
so the way you code for it is say
data-role equal to slider and then give
the options that the slider should show
so in my case I am saying yes or no and
then here I have a multi drop down a
drop-down selection so oh so so here's
the thing so you don't eat it you don't
have to do anything special for
dropdowns there is no data role or
anything like that for drop downs so
drop downs are automatically enhanced by
jquery mobile so if you do not want this
this is one of those special cases where
you if you do not want it you turn it
off so let's run this and let's switch
back and forth between the code and the
example
so I am not running this on an android
emulator because it takes a while to run
on it
and this time let me make this run on
the ipad instead of an iphone just so
that we can see it more clearly ok so
here we have the user's name and age and
like i said because we defined the name
and age with infield contain the labels
the name and the age as well as the text
boxes where I enter my input they are
aligned I didn't have to do anything for
that and then if you look at the check
boxes so I said for check boxes I want
them within a control group so I gave it
a data roll control group and so what it
does is as you can see all the three
selections they are grouped together
there is no vertical space between the
elements and they are squished together
visually they look like they belong to a
group and the next one is a slider so
for a slider all I had to do was say
input type equal to range and give the
maximum value and minimum value so if I
drag this slider it goes up to 31
because that is the maximum value i
define and then next I have an on and
off switch and again to enable that all
i have to say is data-role equal to
slider and give the options finally I
have a drop-down and so this is what I
meant by a pop-up appearing when you tap
on the drop-down list so this is the
default iPad behavior if I ran the same
thing on a knife
phone the behavior would be slightly
different so so this type of a pop-up
comes up the point is you don't have to
do any of these it's already done for
you and if you ran the same example on
an android emulator it would behave
exactly like a drop-down would behave on
an Android device and so as I said
earlier just to reiterate for a
drop-down you don't have to do anything
different just code it like you are
coding any regular drop down in HTML and
jQuery Mobile will enhance it for you
automatically if you do not want these
enhancements set data-role equal to none
this is one of the few where you have to
turn off enhancements if you do not want
them and then i have my submit and
cancel buttons those are standard submit
buttons we will talk about you I block a
and you a blog be in a minute the other
commonly used user interface element is
a list and to get the enhanced list
elements all you have to do again is it
set data dash role equal to listview
wherever you have an ordered list or an
unordered list there's different kinds
of lists I don't want to bore you by
talking through all of these but
basically you can have simplest list
with a right arrow at the end which
indicates that it's a that it has a link
it is clickable then I am sure you've
seen split button lists where there is a
list and there is a vertical divider and
you can perform two different actions
depending on which section which segment
of the list
element you click on oh here is an
interesting feature so if you have a
very long list you can filter or search
through that list to narrow your
selection and to enable this all you
have to say is data filter equal to true
on the 0 l or UL tag again i will show
you examples on all of these count
bubbles for your inbox or your voice
messaging system you've seen count
bubbles how many new emails you have how
many this folder how many in that folder
so that's that is where count bubbles
are used typically and all you have to
do to get that feature is to set ull i
count the attribute ull account for a
list element to jazz up your less so
list don't have to be boring to judge
them up you can place thumbnails or
icons
so let us quickly run through the list
example
and let me also open up the code so that
we can look at it simultaneously again
same thing I have a basic road job or
raw elements to app so let us walk
through this quickly in the interest of
time so this is my basic list view and
so this is how it looks like I said data
inside equal to true what it does is it
squishes the list away from the edges a
little bit and it makes them all group
together so that it looks like they
belong together if I so in the mobile
context whenever you see a right arrow
in a list it means it is a it is a link
to do that all i have to do is give a a
space h ref to the list element and
automatically i get these arrows and
then if i have a list but at the same
time I want to do and different action
so if I click on for example if I click
on the name of the book I want to see
the details of it but if I click on this
blue icon if I want to buy that book so
all you have to do is give two links to
two links within a list element and so
when you specify those two lengths
automatically puts a JK the framework
puts a vertical divider and gives you
two elements so click on the name it
tells me who the author is and more
details about it whereas if I click on
the blue icon I've coded it to give me
the price of it
and then I also set data filter equal to
true for this list so I can assuming
this very long list I can quickly narrow
it down and then it searches for you so
I didn't have to do anything so it comes
for free one cool thing is you don't
have to this the search term does not
have to be at the beginning or the end
so for example if I search on the letter
C it brings it narrowed the list from
four to three and then if I do give one
more letter with narrowed it down to
time machine so it is a very powerful
search feature so and then we saw this
and so how to do count bubbles all you
have to do is inside your list element
you define one more element with a class
of you ll I count and then the actual
count so if you are if you hooked it up
to a model the count would come from
your model I have hard-coded it here but
essentially this is what it would look
like I know it's too small so let me
so this is the count
the other aspect of the framework is
being able to theme so you can set your
own companies or organizations color
schemes your logos your icons and then
for each theme you can also specify what
jQuery Mobile calls as swatches so not
only can you theme but inside the theme
you can define up to 26 colors so you
can say my primary color is blue because
i am from motorola and my secondary
color is black and then my tertiary
color is something else and so on so you
can name these swatches a through z
there is a very nice website called
theme roller so what it does is instead
of me talking about it why don't we just
look at it
so
instead of you hand coding every single
element of your application to conform
to your needs the theme roller what it
does is it lets you visually set your
font family what the corner radius
should be what the different colors for
each of the swatches should be and
things like that so there are two nice
things about it one is you can start
with the theme roller generated
stylesheet so at the end of the day when
you do all your modifications you can
export the output of this as a style
sheet and then you can place that style
sheet in your application folder and
then your application becomes styled
according to this theme and then further
down the road if you made any changes to
it and you now want to import it into
theme roller because you want to make
large-scale changes you can import your
stylesheet make large-scale changes
through this again export it back to
your application so so this is a pretty
good tool especially if you are working
with a designing company where you are a
development company but you you are
working with a third-party designer so
this is a good interface between the two
teams
as I mentioned earlier jacob with jquery
mobile you can get access to the events
that are the take place for example
swipe our tap in the interest of time
let me quickly go through the other
tools so roads and roy element support
jquery mobile JQ mobi and sencha touch
so you you have a choice of using any of
these frameworks that you would like for
for your visual needs JQ mobi if one of
the biggest selling points of this is
its speed it is blazingly fast and the
library is very small the downsides if
you want to call it is it turns only on
Android iOS and blackberry no windows
mobile it doesn't support all of the
features like for example carousel or I
scrolls and things like that that the
jquery mobile framework supports so your
choice in the elements visual elements
is kind of limited there is also no
support for theme roller so if you want
to work with a designer you kind of have
to exchange the style sheets between the
two of you and you have to hand code the
various elements of the style sheets and
it's MIT license so there is a fair bit
of flexibility in the usage sencha touch
this is a commercial software it this is
also based on html5 its selling point is
that it uses an MVC architecture just
for the JavaScript aspect of your
application so if you are using this
with roads or row elements
do not confuse with the MVC that wrote
itself supports but this is another MVC
just for your JavaScript the one thing
that I like about sencha touch is the
you is that it produces they look really
really elegant so this might be a good
option for for some of the enterprise
applications the kind of downside is
it's slow it's not as fast as jquery
mobile and definitely not as fast as JQ
mobi but it's still pretty good it works
on iOS android and blackberry again no
support for windows mobile and you can
either purchase commercial licenses or
release it as GP GPL licensed version 3
the good thing the one of the plus
points for this is there are tons of
plugins available so almost any visual
metaphor that you can think of it
already exists so here are the resources
in case you are interested in learning
more about any of these products if you
are going to work on jQuery Mobile I
definitely would advise you to take a
look at the theme roller and play with
it it's going to save you a lot of time
ok thank you very much
