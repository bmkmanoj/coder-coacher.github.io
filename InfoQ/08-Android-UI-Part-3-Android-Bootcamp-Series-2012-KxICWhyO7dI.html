about colors right now if I look at my
file here you know I made like for
example like let's say I have the status
update piece of text right I may do some
more customization you like you guys may
say oh I want the padding to be you know
20 DP right something like that to give
it a little more space or not 20 but
maybe 15 right you may say you may say
like certain things like that okay now
if you have that's okay if you have a
single screen but what if you have now
for five screens and you want to have a
consistent title across all the screens
all the activities how do you do that
right because if you look at if you look
at this now look how many properties it
kind of set up on this particular
weather you can control shift F to
reformat it so I set up a lot of
properties on this tiny little piece of
text so here are 15 screens I would have
to copy pasted it everywhere right I
also if I care about 15 screens you know
I want to make a change in one place
don't care to go and make change in all
the other 14 places right so that's a
that's a drag doesn't work very well
all right how do you manage this in a
web I mean isn't this an old problem
yeah you carry your style sheets right
you put it in a CSS so you can actually
do exactly the same thing in other words
so there's something called a style
right so a style is a resource it works
exactly the same way as as everything
else so for example I could click on
resource I could say file new Android
XML file I could say you know I'm gonna
create my style on on my style today and
I would say it's a
hmm no it's a should be a value yeah
should be a value but it goes into the
values folder right
it's a values and then my style ready
got it
so click on finish and so now yet
another screen that looks exactly like
arm you know our strings and our colors
right just another XML file with a bunch
of resources inside of it so you could
add a resource called style slash team
right sometimes the code style sometimes
they're called teams usually if you
apply a style to a wedge it of you it
becomes it's it's referred to as a style
if you apply to entire activity or an
entire application it becomes a theme
right so the theme is just a bigger
style right so you can give it a name
and you can optionally inherit from a
parent in other words you can do the
cascading styles right that's the
cascading is right in character more
parents we may have basic style style
for you know screens 1 through 10 styles
for admin screens blah blah blah right
so they could inherit from one another
just like an exercise in CSS so I'll
give it a name you know my style for
example in know Penn Save now what you
would do is you would now copy certain
things or let's say I supposed to my
style or call yeah that's this is gonna
be title style style for title title
style there's gonna be my title style
like for the title of the app right
so what you can do now is you can add
items to this time yeah
and items are now name value pairs that
specify the value for that right so it's
kind of that's that's with this right so
for example um if I had in my status I
had see which one padding right so it's
actually and it's kind of confusing the
name is gonna be the right side of this
so it's gonna be padding and the value
is gonna be the life
yes it's gonna be like that so if I want
to outsource it to this file I could say
planning 15 DP right you can do other
things I can add another item for
example we had gravity there's another
item so I would say gravity Center okay
make sense so now you save it shouldn't
be saying this anymore but saving is
important right together save everything
so this resource now has a style if
could actually hear multiple styles you
could have a style for tidal styles
style for buttons I said there's that
all right you go crazy with this stuff
so um now back to this guy as opposed to
as opposed to referring car coding all
these values like gravity and starring
right I could just I could remove that
and in a in instead of that I could
basically say style is at a style /
title right so for my title I actually
apply also it / yeah so / title star
very seasoning
not complaining here yeah that's
confusing okay I believe that's how it's
like but the name of my title is title
style right so so back here so it's that
/ - that title underscore style right or
if you don't like typing like this right
if you like prefer the graphical layout
you could just select your title and
then you could go
actually can you right-click here this
is new you can right-click and you can
say other properties recent or defined
by text view or by name so you can find
it either this way or you can just find
it here whichever way works for you
right there's like they're about three
ways to do it so you could click on
style here we can daughter dot and pick
title style yeah our parent a parent I
think it's just a bug with a clip so you
can you can do source reformat and that
seems to get rid of it yeah
okay take a look so to try if you still
have the tax it seems that this cows
putting and droid : right okay so try
that
and so yes the best practice would be to
move all this stuff or almost all this
stuff like layout to add gravity I mean
everything that is sort of dip that is a
common across all titles you should you
should cut out of here like with five
gravity text the text appearance
well tax is actually unique right to
each one so now that that's the text
size padding all those cosmetic things
should go into a stop mixer so that your
next title looks exactly the same
because you're applying the same stuff
so that would be the best practice um
you know if you have to do some a little
bit of our stuff we're there so you know
I could cut it out of this and then my
style you have to kind of wrap it and
stuff so little work right
and son
that would be that would be sort of
extracting almost everything right from
from that guy yeah I wouldn't extract ID
in a wouldn't strike title style right
hmm and one thing that I would extract
is the text the actual text right
because that's gonna be that's important
right
so first again
okay let's see a better way of doing the
same thing this is kind of like a lot of
work right and lots of work leads to
lots of typos there's actually a way to
do this by saying extract style so for
example I selected a button right i
right click and i say extract style and
you give it a name and what do they call
the previous style it was a style title
or title song that was star okay button
but it's not selecting with that you
know it's supposed to extract that in a
style it doesn't seem to work always
that's why I cannot tell you that
afterwards if I do hear a nice extract
style how this one does notice it right
yeah so if I say edit text style right
so this is now gonna create a new style
extract it and possibly pull it into my
Styles you know actually create a new
file called styles.xml gives its default
but that's what my style is it extracted
those things right
that's this was done automatically right
and it's great when it works
ah then you do what you just did
previous in anyway right the other day
it's just the piece of text so it's it
attract certain things it doesn't
extract others so it doesn't seem to
wanna extract with light weight ID and
hint that makes sense why it's not but
I'm not sure why these don't get
extracted I would imagine there would ya
there will be nothing to extract so
that's a neat little feature of eclipse
- to help you with that
yeah so you don't say for style you
don't say Android column style that is
different I don't know why but it
doesn't get the namespace almost
everything else if I could think of does
have the namespace okay so now that I
told you about how you can create your
own styles if your simply extracting
them let's take a look at some of the
system stuff so just like you came your
own styles system ships with a whole
bunch of styles so for example you know
if I look in my stylist activity like
wouldn't be cool if I was able to just
do something like this apply a theme to
look example make it look different I
like to look to make it look like light
see how this like changes the look and
feel of yeah yeah themes
so using this tank here themes right
so I can basically just say you know
let's change it team talk toast and
there's some things don't make sense
right but usually the team that
I use especially when I use a projector
is a team delight because it changes the
it's basically becomes white text and
black so black text and white background
which is tends to be easier in projector
so that's what I typically them now just
changing it here doesn't do anything
this is not going to accomplish anything
it's nice that you change it and you can
see how it's going to look differently
but when you run it nothing happens
right so what do you specify a team well
just like a style is something that you
apply to the entire natal widget theme
is something you would apply to an
activity or a entire app so as such you
could actually go into the manifest file
enough Y there right so what I can go is
I open up a manifest file right and in
the manifest file I'm going to go into
applications and then there's something
called Fame
so far so good so you could go ahead and
create your own team or you can actually
refer to one of the system teams so just
like we have our own strengths and draw
walls and other resources and styles and
scepters cetera
system ships with its own stuff so if
you want to refer to a system-wide
themes and its built in where they came
with Android you see Android kong-style
slash team dot light
so now I applied this theme dot light
from androids built-in style to the
entire app so the entire app is gonna
look specific way
yes so you can cascade cascades down so
you can basically apply to the op level
and it's gonna cascade down just like a
cascading stylesheets man so the
property that's closest to the actual
drawing right so the property that's on
the widget itself always takes
precedence so this is this is now a
theme that's applied to everything right
um there's a new don't quote me exactly
but I believe this is Ice Cream Sandwich
you're supposed to use you must respond
to theme dot all or dot light and tingle
power which is basically the bluish
gonna theme right so your app can have
other things but it must also support
that theme something is something of
that nature because that's they're kind
of trying to standardize old it in the
look and feel so they're imposing some
goals there right so teams are good so
this is the easiest way just apply to
the whole thing now the question is what
is this theme where is this Android
stuff you know we know where our
strengths are where our themes are the
other areas folder in our project or
where's the system stuff
yeah so one of the directories that you
have in you as decay remember our as
decay one of the directories you have is
this directory called data and inside of
that directory you have another
directory called re s so I'm basically
in SDK / platform / pick your platform /
data /
right since / new searches again so this
is a started assistantships with you
guys who are asking about you know
colors do you have to remember colors
and stuff well not really I mean these
are some colors there's you know that
that already pre-configured right
primary tags dark sable only blah blah
right so this is some color selector
right and so on so you were asking about
let's see the actual color color values
under various colors you know so these
are the system colors that are defined
right the color white black transparent
background dark dim background light
blah blah blah right so these are the
colors that's already pre-configured so
if you want to refer to them you would
say at Android column color / you know
transparent for example make sense you
also entered also ships with a whole
bunch of images right so you if you for
example want to see some of the images
you can slash data / R yes so these are
system images these are things that ship
with Android in terms of the actual
things that that you can you know find
in there and there's just a small subset
that was land
let me see high density so you know so
these are some standard images you may
be familiar with right these are my
favorite right so you get the idea
doesn't that's where the images alone
questions
so I'm gonna leave my team dot light
there I'm gonna run it and see what
happens
do I have a product there
I thinks it's a to console
soft project clean up this particular
project
so this is a this is a hell you said
this is a common yet card to find there
so my product it wasn't building I had
them all read acts here right then they
don't tell me much more than that so I
was like okay I'll just try to clean it
so clean my project now my java doesn't
compile my job doesn't compile because
it's can't find are right you may do
ctrl shift o to try to fix that but that
doesn't really do much so you're like
okay so what else could be going on
since that that is not a flying it's
just that it's not be fine okay I know
that's a problem but there's something
earlier than that that is upon as well
it's in one of the XML files hard to
find it's maybe this doesn't expect
doesn't really do justice telling you
okay so me see if gives me some idea
okay so I don't know we'll just Cap'n
I'll do the clean again but my R is not
generated okay but they still have a
problem with Java wine it says you can't
find it now if I look at my are like I
told you you don't normally look at it
but in layout status does exist so why
is this guy saying you can't find it
it's there our layout status is there I
fix another problem and ultimately I fix
that problem but it's there our layout
starts no no it doesn't it does compete
with something but not any team no we
fixed it there was an error yeah it
turns all the byproducts it deletes note
resource file but our file hard to find
huh so here's what happened and this is
one of those like you know you could be
like staring at it until 5:00 p.m. and
you know I'm gonna find it's actually
the answer is right there on line three
so what happened was I get a problem
right the problem and the problem so
remember the build system sort of builds
this way okay that's how the build
system built so if you have a problem in
XML right and usually if you have less
information about problems in XML
because it doesn't Eclipse isn't tell
you as much all line such-and-such that
was such such problem I think it's much
trickier to find X and others but that
if that fails that prevents our from
being generated to the RS there
well I couldn't figure out my XML
problems I said yeah I said clean right
which is what you would normally do so I
did project clean dad got rid of our
right now I went to this file and I was
still still wasn't compiling I was like
huh
so I did what I normally do is organize
imports right there's a really useful
feature in Eclipse called source over
organizes imports and figures out you
know if something is missing it goes in
figures out the references and just
plugs it in right
it's actually organizes your import
statements right and it actually keeps
them closed
right normally this case I was kind of
lucky that this was on the top but if it
was like this it'd be even harder to
find because you usually just keep this
collapsed you're not so later on it
somehow figured out what the problem was
with the XML or fix that i alternate li
got our to generate so I didn't make my
built through here but I was like why is
it still not compiling right what's
going on and that had to do with the are
not being our are but being Android dot
R but since we import it if it became
our right so when I say our dot I'm
actually not looking at my are right
here but I'm looking at some system R
which is referring to those system
resources excuse me right yeah I
shouldn't if I remove this line
everything's nice and dandy right
organized imports yeah yeah because they
organize it port said oh look you're
looking for are well the only are I find
is Android at all and actually there's
no conflict because you don't have
anything local that's competing for
attention right because that's those
after I did a clean so it's it's a
really common and card to find air so
watch out for Android at are you almost
never should be including it right you
only refer to system you know -
explicitly say Andrew dot R in the post
be important
so far so good
so fix that make sure it turns no this
is again the problem with the fact that
ADB doesn't find my thing no devices
obvious it's here but it will be lost it
so you try to do kill server and try to
do start server and hopefully that
reboots the connection there it is so
now if I say run
there's my humble so far so good
okay so do you guys get this whole thing
of how about widgets work how sad
properties and widgets work and views
yeah okay so let's do something let's
let's call it done with the well the
this part right so let's say we are done
with this for now we can always come
back to it so let's switch over to job
ultimately we said Java does the show
right that's what the process is the
body okay so let's take a look at our
Java our job is over simple right eleven
twelve lines of code right so we have an
activity the two subclass and call it
status activity we override on create we
call it super and then we say set
fountain view to our layout status I
talked about this line before I said
this is the line that there's a lot of
work right it does the actual inflating
of XML from from the resource file into
the Java so what this line is actually
going to do is it's going to look up its
status it's gonna use our to look up
status X enough nothing graphic of your
work in actual source but then what it's
going to do it's going to go through
this file line-by-line
right so for every element it's gonna
create a Java object so this becomes a
new job or linearlayout for every
attribute like what it's gonna say set
the worst to fill pant set the height to
fill pencil the color to my blue so that
we orientation to vertically right then
is gonna say add new text your Sat ID
set style subtypes
and so on and so on so basically that
innocent little line of code is actually
going through this XML parsing it
inflating it in gel memory space and
creating all the objects along the way
if you have a style and you want to
override one of the fields some stuff
yeah I mean cascades down so if you
style since background color is blue but
then the actual widget says okay I'm
gonna use that style but and background
color is gonna be yellow it's gonna be
yellow because it's closer to the widget
so if cascades down yeah yeah you can
overwrite stuff yeah mm-hmm absolutely
okay so so this process is called
inflating from XML right so let's take a
look so if I go into status activity
right um what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
define my widgets that so after this
line I actually have all my widgets that
they care but in general memory I just
need to refer to them the question is
which was the actually care about
graphical which of these widgets do you
actually programmatically care about
yeah so you care about the button you
want to know when the button is pressed
and you care about the text area because
you want to know what what kind of text
is entered right that's it in this case
okay so that brings me to one of the
remember we talked about the commonly
use properties one that we didn't talk
about was the ID right so ID is how
we're gonna identify a particular widget
right on its it looks similar to
everything else you've seen there's the
only thing that's gonna new is this ad
plus let's add plus ID and then some
kind of ID maybe s what the significance
of the pluses guys so we decided to show
this over its entire summer
it's implicitly kind of defining it
because this ID is not it unlike string
or style or colors or anything else it's
not gonna exist in some file the moment
you say that pass ID you're like saying
let there be this ID somewhere you're
not really referring to another resource
like when I say a string / kilo I'm
referring to strings.xml a line item
that says you know named all the various
calories all right and I mean you know
it's it's actually not any rate it's
just gonna be a flat list yeah yeah it's
actually gonna be implemented in R so
it's gonna be just you know a pointer
essentially a number assigned somehow so
wedges that you care about
programmatically you should assign them
ID it's the easiest way to refer to them
so what we're gonna do is for this guide
the button you can go this way I'm gonna
right click on the button and you can
give it an ID you know it collects
almost always already gives you ID but
the idea clubs gives you it's kind of
like you know generic button one ID
button 47 ID doesn't really tell you
what it is so I'll say something like
button on this corner update click ok
the other component we kind of care
about programmatically is the text so
same thing I'm gonna right click say
edit ID and I'll say edit status
yeah now if you open up actually a
layout so the outline it actually shows
you the properties and their
corresponding IDs so the status button
update in textview one so this one
doesn't have anything this one has
textview one is my kids but not Datanet
it says yeah yeah now what I also like
to do is things that I don't care about
programmatically I actually go and
explicitly remove their ideas I consider
that clutter right so like for example
that button a textview one well I'm not
gonna programmatically be changing the
title right I mean you could but that's
not our case so because of that I would
actually remove it so so I usually do it
like from here to here and I'm just kind
of like remove it it's for less so
texted now does not have that clutter
now keep in mind this is not updated for
whatever reason but you know it's not
perfect price is right
um if you don't need it you just delete
it yes yeah yeah if you want to if you
want to put some logic there yeah you
need an ID so um and by the way another
thing that I wanted to point out about
IDs is that they also don't have a
namespace so the pretty it's gonna be a
flat list so we already have two IDs in
this tiny little example which can
quickly glow to 2,200 right you get the
idea you can have a lot of things all in
one big flat list so you kind of want to
that's another reason why we want to
remove clutter and also you want to
think about the naming convention right
like I said you could do what it is
underscore the name or you could do name
on the score where it's a four it just
creates whatever works for you alright
so I usually say what it is like button
and then underscore update right I could
have called it status underscore
but no new updates or something like
that right different people do different
start but you should be consistent
across organization I guess so
so far so good on this one the IDS don't
have to be unique um but if you have it
if I am on a status activity and I asked
for button update I better come only one
but not they I sure don't know what's
gonna happen if you have to maybe
whopper me just return the first one so
or you know whichever one so if they
don't have to be unique if you are gonna
have a an update button every single
screen right you're gonna call it
whatever and then on that screen it's
gonna refer to that button so that's
fine
yeah question it doesn't tell you so
camelcase vs underscore it doesn't
really tell you anything about a
parameter are different they're not very
consistent um I used to use camel case
then I switch to underscore because I
saw Google's do a lot of underscores so
I kind of took it from the source on one
thing to do worry about is your your
file names are not allowed to have I
believe capital letters or numbers right
just underscores ain't your neither fund
names nor properties are supposed to
have dashes right so for example if I
wanted to call this button - update it's
gonna go up question is why
well let's look at our so remember the
moment you change something in resources
and save the file save the file
right R gets regenerated so let's take a
look at all right now we change the
button in the underscore updating button
- of this so what did we get yeah so you
can obviously in job because it's gonna
become a Java variable you're not
allowed to do things that you can have
in Java variables so be mindful of that
it also gives you a cryptic error
message since only and then followed by
a regular expression he's a lot right so
how you guys only do regular expressions
so so yes it'd be mindful of that um so
that's why I stick to underscores yeah
all right so let's switch to Java at
this point so our Java is still
helloworld.java right it's super simple
nothing that we've done now you guys
said we care about button and any tags
programmatically so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna define them so I'm gonna go
here I'm gonna say
button button update you can say edit
text edit status
just creating some variables point right
now why is button and any tax on the
line thread yeah you got the important
so the quick easy way in Eclipse all
this is source over got over organized
imports control shift oh right damn them
it just does it control commando I mean
command shift
now after we loaded everything in Java
memory space we can now look those
elements up right so what I can do is I
can say button update so for example
like this button update is a button but
I'm gonna find it and to find it I'm
gonna go to control space control spaces
you're like those of you new to eclipse
it's your Universal sort of you know
context-sensitive shortcut so it figures
out context you're in and you can just
start typing find view by ID there BAM
it's very helpful especially because in
Eclipse I mean and a lot of these names
are very very long so you don't want to
tighten those typing leads to typos that
means bad
now you want to know there's a handful
of shortcuts we did ctrl F to format we
talked about organized imports we are
now talking about control shift oh sorry
to control space to do completion they
may be and there's probably one or two
more so now it's asking me for the ID of
that budget but that's not a problem we
have our for that so r dot and then you
go down to I V dot and then you find
your button of it
nice
so I'm a big proponent of actually using
the Eclipse Kent folding to kind of like
complete stuff for you because that it's
kind of like checks and balances that
you don't do typos you know stuff you
typed and it's like yeah referring to
what okay so that's the button we found
it
are you guys do the addict status and
yeah and it sucks same thing yeah you
always get a cast because what you get
back is a view or just a generic view
the view sort of like the smallest
component that you can put some string
so so yes so in this case it would be
ended status is an edit text right fine
view by ID r dot ID dot you notice that
I did not type here I cannot sit here
wait for Eclipse to offer me choices
yeah uh-huh
there's an added sense now I'm certain
that that tax actually that I do have to
tidy that was all saved and in compiled
and blah blah blah right you want that
so first again so we now have found a
reference to those two elements now what
how would you have it you can you
abutting clicks in standard instead of
our listeners yeah canler cell listeners
so what's very similarly in Android so
for example so after I found my but not
that what I could do is I could say
button update dot set and then on one go
listeners and then in this case will be
the on click listener
so I'm now saying when the button update
is clicked it needs to notify one of its
listeners that's sort of that's the
design pattern there's four so what
would be a good listener it needs to be
something that hears to on click
listener interface yeah you could do an
anonymous class right here but that
would probably confuse the rest of you
for not Java developers right how many
of you don't know what an anonymous
inner class is yeah so we're not gonna
do that because of that yeah it's very
common and it's one of those things that
have people think it's the greatest
thing ever the other half think it's the
most horrible thing ever invented right
so it's you know pick your camp right so
the out of all evils one of the easiest
evils will be to make this be the
listener so basically I'm saying I'm
saying this for those of you new to Java
refers to status activity instance right
first to this object itself so saying
let let notified this guy that that's
the case right into the button gets
worked yeah now it collects complaints
and says hold on one second like whoever
you're gonna notify needs to be a it's
needs to be notify a ball needs to be
something some of the improvements
onclicklistener
right so not no big deal you go and you
put a mouse over it right like that and
then you can scroll to the bottom of
that list put the mouse gently right you
go to the bottom that list and you say
that status activity implement the
onclick listener you're looking for the
item on the very very body right so in
other words what we are doing
watch line eight what we are doing is we
are inserting the statement that we now
are a on
listener so stylus activity now says I
too can receive notifications when I
collect cabbage right so now it clips no
complaints this fine you claim so but
not really
you're really not adhering to the
unconditional interface right so you put
your mouse over the next there right
yeah and when you see when you see an
option add unimplemented methods it's
usually the first option it's almost
always the option that you want you're
missing some kind of callback not so the
nature of and reduce that that's how we
do it it's almost always you want to add
unemployment methods so you say okay so
we now have a placeholder or to do to do
something with that button right there
to compile everything SCAP but you guys
noticed at all dance with a you know
eclipse right okay eclipse you can't
Bali right so you make one error
you let the clips fix it then you create
the second error then you let Eclipse
fix it then by the time you do all that
you got your placeholder to do something
so you're gonna you're gonna see a lot
of code actually ends up being
auto-generated like some of the
something else just writes code for you
cool so now that we have a placeholder
that the button is gonna call us back
this is gonna be the view be it's gonna
be the button that falls back right we
can do something here right you could
say alright you know thanks for
notifying us what do we do next
we could but in the spirit of keeping
this call and complete and growing it
organically let's do the simplest thing
possible that would be two types it into
a log this is no opportunity to also
kind of show you how a logs work right
okay
so Android yes a plea cool login
capability you can log from anywhere in
the code as a matter of fact it's the
same log system works for C and Java C
the entire platform goes to this log
file it's actually circular log files
you can don't worry about it ever going
to a large right so the access to that
is via a static method called log dot
and then you pick a severity so like for
example D will be debug you say
certainly this locked up game and then
tag comma message alright so ty could be
anything it could be name of your class
or name of your app whatever you want to
use for tagging like for example status
activity right and message could be you
know on clicked so I know that you got
correct
what actually imported locked nice if
log is underlined red you type in ctrl
shift o or command shift uh and that
would import your log yeah good point
everyone so I don't know why them show
me that normally I get the same error
but let me remove my import so it
doesn't know more about my lord
control shift oh there we go so guess
what log is a common name right that's
what you get for having something name
three letters right so obviously there's
an ambiguity so it's like okay I want to
import log but which one right so this
is what you guys kind of gotta use your
common sense is it gonna be an Android
log or it's gonna be a patchy log yeah
thank you
yeah so that that takes care of that
that is noon in San Francisco so don't
go running I thought it was on
Wednesdays but so what what is the dot d
dot deep near the log can print in two
separate you can filter it based on
severity as well so you have for example
dot I is info dot E is error the W is
warning there's actually even this one
dot WTF I'm not making this up and it
doesn't stand for what you think it
stands for it stands for what a terrible
failure basically the same thing so it's
basically an error should not give
Caprica
and this gets a funny
okay so so far so good so you can fire
it up right click on run BAM
the question is now if I click on update
update update what is the log off
well obviously log goes into a locket
maybe not so obviously there's something
called the locket so you can click on
log log log couple of the object ugly
ugly a couple of times we have some
noise but longest remark at sea so what
is a locket um a locket is your friend
you a locket is basically this thing
that you can open you can open it from
in this perspective it's pretty common
you can open it from this perspective
you can actually uh usually people use
it on the DDMS and you would open it up
there's a lock yet now for some reason
standard Eclipse puts it in the bottom
which doesn't make a lot of sense
because it doesn't give you a lot of
space I usually you know if I use it
here I move it up here so I get more
space right right
but this is my locker you trust me
what's going on with my device it's
usually the bottom now it yeah it it may
be that you don't have a cat at all like
you know you just blew up a window BAM
gone right
whenever you're missing a window window
show view and then you define it here go
around and read it right
damn right back now you guys got luck
out there huh yeah so you gonna get
really familiar with lock yep because
it's super useful
lockup is basically you know system
level logging capability and it can be
as such it can be a very noisy place
right you could have a lot of stuff
going on at the same time so a useful
thing to do is to filter it so for
example you could filter it based on
severity but I only care about errors or
you may say I'll keep everything but I'm
gonna fill to only create a filter like
this right so you specify filter name
could be something like oh not
interesting right and then you can
filter based on tag message PID the
application name etc right so I could
say I'm gonna feel through based I don't
know this works Yamba I don't think it
does
yeah it doesn't so I'm gonna edit it but
it does work if you filter based on tag
so time status activity yes yeah so
there it is for me so if I go if I go
here and I go next next next you can see
how you can click you can see that it's
actually logging
so first again you can give it anything
you want so yes you can have multiple
you can have anything you want and then
you can filter based on that mm-hmm
the tag is just an arbitrary name you
can tag it Bobby
no so this is how you use lock yet in
Eclipse like I said for everything that
there's a button in Eclipse there's also
a command line tool right so remember
our ad be right ad be one of the things
that ad be also forces axes to lock cap
there's my adb logcat all right so just
click like click and you can see that
this working
make sense
yeah
so I just typed internal command line I
said it'd be a lot yeah if you do run it
on command line what you should know is
that you can also filter and
documentation says you say what you the
tag you on a filter for column severity
so for example if I wanted to filter for
everything from status activity I would
say a DB Lockett status t-bone star so
it's gonna give me everything from
status field except that's actually
gonna give you everything together like
other tags as well what's not documented
very well is that you also have to tell
it what you've done to one another I'm
silly but you gotta say everything else
silence for whatever reason that's what
works and so now I have my
signal-to-noise ratio just
got it pushing point to this
okay so now if you got that
let's do one better on this now we want
to get the text that was typed in the
text box and actually print it out right
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do I'm
gonna go into my on click I'm gonna get
my edits Dallas alright so I'll say edit
status and I'm gonna ask and status for
its text get text nice string status
text is gonna be so far so good on that
okay so now we can print it out I can
say on clicked write text
sex but I'm this in see what happens
hmm I have social in this way okay and I
open up my mic on so I'm gonna say hello
you can update and that is um click to
text color that seems to get worked okay
so let's do this I want to I want to
show you a simple way to do this not the
same thing
like did complex first and then do a
simple second right so let's do let's go
back to status right remember in status
I have to give my button an ID then I
had to go to to my status activity and I
had to define that button right and then
I had to find it I'm gonna get to set
the listener then I have to do this then
I have to do that make sense so the
steps were and the steps were that we
basically define ID I was kind of like
there was kind of like one right then we
would define the bottom here we would
fetch it find that right then we would
assign the listener then to for this to
be to work we had to basically say this
then we have to basically provide the
implementation so one two three four
five steps right so let's make this
simpler so here's another way to do this
you can actually get rid of the idea of
the button altogether and instead you're
gonna say control space Android on click
there's a property called on click
inside of this property you specify the
name of the method to call like Bobby or
Tommy or on click right so we already
have on clicks I'm just gonna use the
same name just the name of them
the callback method of pop so far so
good now on the other side in Java
you just have to have that method that
accepts of you which we already have
that's that matter that I'm gonna change
anything there right so you can now get
rid of anything to do with the button
okay this declaration you can get rid of
button object so that's two lines down
three lines down right and then you can
get rid of this coming chopping right
yeah
and by the way this override here was
not correct to begin with because we
weren't overriding we were implementing
this is jealous six wrongness right well
so we made this line much this code much
smaller yeah so how does the plumbing
how does this work
it's using basically reflection so it's
basically looking up it says okay i'm
i'm i mean flagging inside this class
what does this class have doesn't have
something that matches that name
but we can all be casted we're talking
about enough casting anything this is a
project trained I'm not sure why
there are tests between save the day I
say hello again we can update and that
is right there so I think work the same
and dramatically made our code simple
right the question is well why didn't I
show you this right away I mean it may
just like don't like you guys or
something so I'm like trying the hard
way in the first of the easy way uh the
easy way the problem with the easy way
is that it only works for the button and
the other the hard way works for all of
the other lessons like you may be
watching the things like text change
listener like if you want to keep the
count of coming along to sleep in fact
in and so on right so this is just a
shortcut it works just for buddies the
other approach is more Universal if it
only works for buttons or use well it's
useful for buttons I mean yeah I mean if
you just want to use it for buttons just
get let's you knock it out faster yeah
no I mean you could have an app to
Jessica's buttons like our abs just as a
button right now yeah so you have no
idea if you're reading the Java code you
have no idea what this on click yes you
have no idea what this view is why it's
there and so forth there is not the
current documentation is defined so
that's a convention
so yeah so that's that comes to be that
any other questions to comments on on
this one the button or the bundle what's
going on with a bundle let's take a look
now that you guys know about log right
if I can say something like this log dog
and by the way you don't need to do this
this is just experimental code what they
usually do do however I usually define
static final string tag here just I have
a easy way to tag that's just something
that I do own all my code for whatever
reason right cuz I like log a lot so I
use that for quite a bit so may say log
B tag comma right so as opposed to
typing this long thing I just died so
umm if I do I can say tag and I can say
on click clicked with bundle and then
I'll print out the bundle right the
problem is if the bundle I guess I can
just say bond oh sorry another bundle
but save instance state that described
Fontana puts in nature is part of that's
right so as to string getting some data
we call this bundle make it shorter
again don't you don't have to do this is
just to illustrate so I could do a
bundle this example actually spins out
yeah so if I run this
it's the first time around we got
nothing
bundle is now I just started me out
right what happens to failure like for
example go to home screen and now I long
press this to see the running apps I go
back to my okay so on click the end even
happen right not sorry it wasn't on
click on create right today I make
happen but if I do this from control f11
see this time around bond logic has
didn't right so so that's when that
swings being used that's what we talked
about yesterday as sometimes this
doesn't return back properly
yesterday's no sir right so changes in
state save some information whatever
that information is some primitive
information so that's like any other
questions on
you can actually change that like I
mentioned that in like in a manifest
file I could say that I believe it's
part of the application
that's not part of the applications part
of the manifest maybe no part of the
activity AHA it's part of dictator which
makes me screen orientation specific
orientation huh you can say big changes
so basically you can define specify one
or more configuration changes that
activity walk handle itself so if you
don't want system to do it for you
you specify this property then in here
you can say orientation yeah so
basically what I'm saying now is you
know what thanks for doing this
automatic stuff but I got it right so if
I around this I may have to implement on
configuration change listener but let's
see so so it's created with the empty
bundle right so control shift F another
so did rotate the screen but it didn't
call it didn't destroy my bundle right
you didn't go to the whole lifecycle so
you can kind of you know handle yourself
account you can change that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
