breaking open angularjs with me is Misha
go he's the founder of a angularjs
project thank you for having me so makes
you go tell me a little bit about how
our angularjs came to be angular just
came to be because you know I kind of
got tired of building web applications
if you think about what a web
application is it's a one big marshaling
problem you know how do you get from the
database to the user and back to the
database the data has to flow this
particular way and when you build web
apps like it's all about you know
copying data from one object to the
other object and getting into different
layers and different protocols and just
finally showing the user where the user
to modify something and the whole thing
goes back so I wanted to kind of see if
we could simplify the whole problem and
the original goal was actually slightly
different than a framework and I've
never had the intention of building a
framework what I actually wanted to
build was a way for somebody who's not a
web developer rather a web designer so
my head understands HTML but maybe not
programming to be able to sprinkle a
little bit of extra magic but extra
attributes into HTML and have it persist
on a server so the idea would be that
there would be a persistent cloud that
you can acquire and then a key token or
something that you could drop into your
statically served HTML page and all of a
sudden the form would come to life and
so just by having a form and having a
Save button on a form it would persist
update the URL you can change the link
you know to somebody so how did you how
did you realize you had a framework on
your hands right point did I become like
a separate spin-off project and not so
that was making of what I was working in
the free time and during the day at
Google I was working on a Google
feedback which is an application you
might have seen it where if you're on
Google property you might put this
button that allows you to highlight the
page and say this portion looks weird or
something's not working any kind of keep
very bad Google and so we had to build a
administer of the UI internally to kind
of manage this sea of data coming at us
and this particular thing was built
using traditional methods of building
administrative UI's and so we were about
three of us on a project and six months
into it
so Ethan mainland's so so traditional
you mean like generative on the server
or HTML pushed out to the client I know
it was more of a client so things like
good closure etc okay sure
kind of traditional way of building
single page applications it's about
three months six months into the project
which is only 18 months many months
because of three people I were getting
very frustrated productivity you know
our future callosity just wasn't there
and so we were wondering you know what
could we try differently and so in my
frustration I kind of made the claim you
know with this project I'm working on a
side I could have this thing done in two
weeks and you know they called me on it
it was a bluff and they called me on it
and I said well if you think you can do
that go ahead show us prove us wrong and
so it took that took me three weeks not
two weeks so I failed a two weeks test
but three weeks later we basically had a
rewritten them what was interesting
about the rewrite using the angular was
that we went from 17 thousand lines of
code down to 1000 lines of JavaScript
for the same application same behavior
so some people specially start to pay
attention and say hey you know this is a
fraction amount of code that you're
talking about here and it was written in
the fraction amount of time how can that
be and so ever since then you know the
future philosophy was awesome and people
just enjoyed building things with
angular and this is where kind of it
slowly turned from me building a product
to me just maintaining it as a phrase
yes so what was the status of angular at
that point it was a side side project
was already I was in source project at
that point already it was a side project
that I started in my free time but and
he basically slowly became Google
sponsored because I was working at
Google and shirking my full-time job to
just kind of work on this and support
all the other projects of Google using
it so working on angular is like part of
your day job at Google now so right now
there is about almost 10 people working
on it full-time ok that's a lot of
people and not all Marcille are they
yeah are they are they Googlers are they
all doing writing code most of them are
Googlers we have few interns and
contractors who are eventually going to
hopefully become Googlers so they're
working on it but you know couple of
people working on documentation and
things of that sort sure but about thing
about five core
engineers who are working on this this
is a full-time job nothing else so the
people who are who are external to
Google are participating in more minor
role most the people who are like
involved in a real active way in terms
of writing code are all kind of internal
to Google Mozilla internal the people
who are external they tended to be
people who were active in the community
in the past and we just thought that
they were doing such a good job that
yeah I said you know you're doing all
this great work for free maybe we can
just kind of pay you a little bit to
kind of just say thank you for the cool
yeah I'm curious about the community
around angular so if you're the founder
did you deliberately set about building
a community or did people just kind of
discover you and pitch in we were trying
to build the community there was a guy
who hired early on Igor you know her who
helped tremendously with building it up
and so we were actively kind of working
on building it up and getting it going
and what does that what does that mean
any problem mailing lists answering
questions you know going to conferences
talking about it you know showing the
value of it which actually is quite
tricky when they talk about it later is
because it's fundamentally a different
way of looking at building web
applications but at some point it turns
out that there were people from the
community themselves who kind of stepped
up and they just started answering the
questions and so over time there was a
less and less of a role for us to kind
of manage and it became kind of a
self-managed community thing which is
awesome like that's the measure of
success right yeah you know I have to
push it anymore there's there's people
who just take the bone and run with it
talk about talk about Google's
participation in angular a little bit is
that is that important to it as an
open-source project is it important that
it has you know Google Google's backing
how how big of a role does that does
that probably in angular 2 it's a very
good question because I've seen a lot of
people saying oh look it's the Google
project but really think about it he
didn't really wasn't like a Google
initiative or anything like that it kind
of just so happens that I work at Google
and therefore Google is kind of
sponsoring it but it was really an
open-source thing that I started on the
side in an independent fashion so it
wasn't per se Google in that sense but
you know because we work at Google we
get to take advantage of a couple of
awesome things about it so you know
Google is is active in pushing the the
browser's
into engine limits which you can do in a
browser
so there's standards and so things like
web components things like
object.observe model-driven views do all
of these things you know are kind of
outgrowth of either of directly of
angular or are heavily influenced by the
learnings of angular and so we get to
push these into into standards and once
the standards coming to be you know
angular can be better all right you know
what a lot of more of what angular is
could be pushed into the browser so
hopefully the future of building web
applications is gonna be more
declarative and I totally I totally want
to come back to that point I wondered
about that you know as a as a JavaScript
framework maker who also works for a
company that makes a browser if you if
you have any unique insight or maybe
even unique leverage and in the direct
and web apps are going I'm not sure I
have any unique leverage but or inside
for that matter but you know it there is
an advantage there's a lot of people who
work on these things that whose
day-to-day job is to kind of figure out
how to make the browser better and who
are connected in the in a standards
community and you know we talk to
Firefox Microsoft sure I mean WebKit to
kind of bring this to be and so once the
a we have an idea in angular and say hey
you know it turns out that this
particular paradigm works really well we
can go to the the team within work who
looks on the the open-source standard to
make I'll take it to the next level and
bring it to the other browser makers and
things get built and incorporated are
you making a tool that Google uses
internally I'm an act I kinda have this
mental model of a you know you guys in
the dark guys I'll lobbying the Gmail
team Deana use my product or something
it does Google use angular internally it
does but you know what it's a very
interesting thing because angular
started externally so in a strange way
people at Google who use angular use it
because of the open source community
sure so we were open first before we
were actually inside Google and you know
because of the strong outside community
and strong answers base and the usage
and the pickup it almost makes it easier
to for Googlers to go to their team and
say look at this
new unique thing which happens to be
built by a Googler that you get to use
on our products as well and so because
of the open source community actually a
lot of new projects are getting started
in Google that actually use this and
have a couple of big ones on the most
notable one which is already public is
the double-click for advertisers which
is more of a it's not an end product so
most people are not familiar with it but
advertisers are familiar with it and the
other one is dealing back YouTube
interface which is actually available in
a couple embedded devices like for
example the the gaming console is going
to give me the Sony gaming console
whatever that's called sure PlayStation
I wonder just in terms of the community
I mean one one a marker of the size I
guess is the number of contributors and
the volume of the mailing list and that
kind of thing but what about like usage
statistics do you know like how many
projects are using angular or are you
mentioned a couple of a couple of large
use cases do you have any I know and I
don't think we actually track it because
you know how it was one track how many
sites use you so I don't actually have
the numbers and some numbers I would
like to get my hands on what I just
don't have them but I can tell by the
community in terms of the search queries
on Google or non search engines also the
the amount of traffic on the mailing
list the Stack Overflow traffic the the
Twitter traffic etc we can kind of judge
us to our usages and it seems to be
pretty popular so we're very happy about
that well and there seems to be emerging
buzz about not just angular but you know
there's you've got some competitors that
are essentially in the same space and I
don't know what to a MVC client
frameworks I mean what should we call
the the Ember knockout yeah they're all
framework so this we have for the
biggest one are angular ember knockout I
don't think I'm missing anything there's
backbone but a little less lower levels
I don't think I want to include it in
the framework category in that sense
it's a lot more low level I think of it
more as an assembly I mean it's it's
four kilobytes right like it's it's it's
a different sure not that the size
defines how good you are but it's a
smaller thing and it's got different
goals but within those frameworks that's
kind of what I consider the the class
and you know because we're pushing so
much of these into standard
like we're actually interested in making
sure that other people can build other
frameworks and can benefit from this
thing so for example object.observe if
it goes into the browser then other
frameworks helps all the exactly sure
everybody gets help the other thing is
da mutation observation
it also helps other frameworks as well
and so the idea would be that you could
build a site so that you could say oh
you know I'm gonna use angle for angular
for my maybe for my controllers but I
will use this particular widget which is
done you know graphing widget library
but that happens to be built using amber
and they should be able to live together
one on one and clobber cooperate and
work without it because right now it's
not quite thoroughly different piece all
different bees are not possible and I
think what's needed is some of these
underlying primitives to be incorporated
into the browser so that the way object
observation is performed and the way da
mutation is performed is consistent
between the frameworks and then the
objects in the Dom becomes a
communication channel for these
components and then it simply makes no
difference in terms of what each
component happens to be implemented in
and then everybody can coexist and build
them better I'm a more open community
right yeah
because because the the ideas are sort
of the same I mean the the simplest idea
that the HTML should automatically
update based on JavaScript objects I
mean the the core idea a lot of the
frameworks are the same but how they're
actually implemented is drastically
different do you guys do um I mean do
you pay attention to how ember does
stuff do you do you pay attention their
design philosophies we learned I mean
other projects unfortunately I have
never used amber or knockout or any of
those things and so it's hard for me to
judge or anything like that I'm just a
strong believer that you know an open
source world there's this healthy
everybody gets to do and then the ideas
win totally and everybody wins as a
group you know rather than one versus
the other so I'm all for having a lot of
different frameworks cooperating
together and building different things
and this is what I think the primitives
are important for that pickle
point the the thing that's unique about
angular from all of the other frameworks
is that we do dirty watching versus
everybody else basically wraps your
object it's I know kind of a special
model thing so you don't have to inherit
from an object or you have to split you
special Gators or setter methods right
or something like that and I think that
goes back to our core philosophy which
is that we want to have essentially zero
boilerplate like I am very insistent on
the simple thing is that I should just
be able to say what I mean and it's the
frameworks job to do the heavy lifting
right and so when you force people to
developers to wrap things into these
special objects all of a sudden it's not
the simple thing all of a sudden it's
like well you got to understand them my
cycle of this and it's just a different
beast all of a sudden and so this was
why I want to keep it simple so I can
see I'm cooperating with the other
frameworks and in some ways like the
changes that are happening in the
browser maybe justify some of your
design decisions but they benefit all
the other frameworks as well but what
about what about somebody like Dart I
mean that's another Google funded
project that in some ways is really
similar like declarative HTML and get
you know data from from your code
automatically into the browser how do
you how do you relate to those guys you
see them as a competitor do you see like
Google having to pick between them you
know what's your relationship to the
dart project you actually look at it
slightly differently so first of all
angular is a philosophy of building the
web application you know the fact that
you have declarative the fact we allow
me to extend HTML vocabulary it to us
that's a philosophy right that's not a
specific language and so we work with
JavaScript CoffeeScript
I'm script or you know what have you
what else did that comes along the way
dart is slightly different because there
have a it's kind of fundamentally
different VM it doesn't compile to
JavaScript but we're looking into
incorporating them as well because we
really want to focus on the philosophy
rather than on the implementation
details of a language you happen to
choose so that's that's kind of where we
go in and if these philosophies of
building an application like declarative
mode ends up in built into the browser
then dart gets it automatically right so
in some ways you can think of angular
the test bed of crazy ideas right wing
week if you throw all these ideas in
there and see what sticks and the stuff
that is really working well we then pick
and choose and go to the standards body
and say hey you know you should consider
about incorporating this and the browser
because it'll help everybody so is that
process like underway or their specific
specs that you guys are pushing besides
just some of the like observing the Dom
for instance it's like what would you
like to see the browser do that makes it
easier for JavaScript frameworks so I
think all of these things that were
already talking about Arabic underway so
observing the object heap which is
object.observe that's already on the way
and I think it's already implemented in
well I can't I know many of the browser
vendors came on board and said they will
implement I just don't remember who
already has done it the other one is the
object mutation observation sorry the
the da mutation observation which is
being able to know when sometimes
changed in the Dom it has changed in
there has been the synchronous version
of this particular thing already
implemented and it's kind of deprecated
because the synchronous has implications
in terms of performance browser vendors
don't like probably see reasons and so
the so the new one is essentially the
same idea but in this time it's a
synchronism because it's a synchronous
can be batched together and it's a lot
faster so we we think that all these
primitives of watching the dom watching
the objects and also packaging your
components into reusable declarative
things like web components it's already
underway and so it's just a matter of
time before before it comes to the
masses and so due to me this is
basically how to travel in the future we
will be building web applications and
and the web component thing gets more to
the HTML side of things right I mean I
think one of the talks I watched maybe
you said like angular is is HTML the way
it should have been if the browser
makers were thinking about about
applications so is that like browser
support for the the concept of a
template that's one of the things yes
templates but if you step back like
browsers are really awesome out of
rendering static documents right a lot
of things there's a lot of it is
declarative you can say I want to Center
something and it is so right it should
be read you know blinking whatever just
magically happens but when it comes to
imperative behavior rights at the
we can statically describe the document
also imperative ly not so much it's this
complicated set of like well the list
its events that happen and these
callbacks and you have to know how
internally it works and so there's a lot
of abstractions that can be had and
simplifying it so for example things
like simply just ng-controller just the
simple concept that there is a behavior
waiting behind a piece of Dom that you
can call and then having the methods be
scoped to the controller rather than the
global window object you know minor
things like that turns out to go a long
way to just encapsulating the logic and
being able to to to help the developer
and kind of thinking about the problem
and you're like I I come to this as a as
an educator I mean what I do is is teach
and that frequently means the first
thing out there be a student and you
know forgot new technologies and play
with them and see if I can understand
them myself and messing with the these
like MVC client frameworks and you know
learning jQuery was just like learning
an API for stuff I knew how to do
already right if you're already doing
Dom manipulation and selection and
events and stuff and I get into angular
and there's so many more concepts and
I'm okay with you know
model-view-controller but then there's
filters and services and directives and
transclusion xand do you consciously
think about them you know easing the
learning curve for the beginner if it's
HTML the the way it's supposed to be is
there is there a hello world of angular
that's yeah that's really some problem
doesn't Paul this concepts in you know
anything that'll like next necessary
complexity is there a way from it we try
a lot to simplify things as much as we
do I mean we have endless discussions
you know yeah members you know how do we
make it as simple as possible and yet be
able to be express old as powerful
powerful as and at some point you know
you have to just invent new concepts
like scopes etc they don't describe this
particular thing and part of it is then
if you mean even if you look at HTML or
CSS like there's a lot of concepts in
there that people have to learn it just
so happens to be internalize them and we
learned it a decade ago said yes seem
complicated it doesn't seem complicated
anymore so the same thing with it with
angular just new concepts lumber there's
a fundamental difference
doing things but I want to make a
distinction between libraries like
jQuery and frameworks like angular ember
or a backbone
that's our knock out sure which is that
you know in the framework world the
framework is in charge and it calls you
when it sees necessary right and so you
have to implement these hooks bit by
which you get called at the right point
in libraries that the world is the right
the other way around which is that you
run full of control and you get to call
the library whenever you feel like
oh and because in the framework that
it's the other way around
the framework out gets to will have
opinions and it has to get to share
these opinions with you and so you kind
of have to play alone with the opinions
the framework has and this is the simple
trade-off that you happen to have which
is that you can be more general but do
less or you can do a lot more but you
have to say okay be more opinionated be
more opinionated you have to do it this
particular way in order to play with our
philosophy that we happen to have sure
so that's just simply trading off
different frameworks and libraries that
just just exist for anything like that
and at least some of you know explaining
your opinions was data documentation and
I hear people complain about and I think
is maybe like inherent to the problem
space but like about all the frameworks
you know the documentation is too
confusing too complicated or you know
yes is that is that something you
personally work on who writes the doc so
yes I personally wrote many of the docs
but the rest of the team writes a lot of
ducks as well it is something that we
struggle with because you know we're
engineers we're not that good at writing
this stuff and we are aware of this that
the documentation is kind of the weak
point in the chain over here and so we
are working actively and improving it so
we for example just recently added a
button on each page we can click and it
says you know you want to improve this
doc click here and it takes you directly
to the github I saw that age where you
can go and edit whatever you want and
hit submit button and then we get to
review it and say yes sounds good and we
can approve it and it actually turns out
that a lot of things a lot of minor
low-hanging fruits or a fix in this
particular way and so this is just an
example I wanted to do this but also we
have we're finding people in the
community who are just passionate about
this and who are good at teaching others
and we're having them read blogs and
also having operated documentation as
well so this is something that would
it's a constant struggle you know they I
think every framework has to go with
absolutely if anything you know angular
has a bit of a harder job because it's
trace further from the the mainstream
right you know he has crazy concepts
like okay you get to invent your own
HTML like I don't think most other
frameworks have this concept there most
other frameworks basically these is the
vocabulary that you can put anything
online it's fixed sure angle you can say
well make up your own so there's a whole
set of complexity around that angular
has dependency injection again most
frameworks don't say anything about that
and so these higher-level concepts are
powerful but they also have to be
explained and so it's a trade-off and it
seemed like just kind of reading through
your documentation getting a feel for
the for the project philosophy some of
the some of the complexity or maybe just
some of the concepts come from your your
background your interest in a testing
approach are you is that is that your
job at Google I saw like you described
as a new coach or something but you're
but you're really interested in testing
and I mean the dependency injection at
least comes probably from that point of
view and there's like a testing
framework built into angular we have a
separate project that for testing
purposes yes so there's a lot of so
testing is a big thing because I'm a big
fan of that's driven the opened yeah
and so a lot of decision actually in the
framework were heavily influenced by you
know how easy it will be to test and so
if you know if your imagine yourself
your new path of building something you
have a choice to make
we almost always side with the choice of
testability and it really shows on the
end product no we have become bundled
with mocks you can test our controllers
without the UI we have an end-to-end
test runner we have just basically the
whole nine yards to make sure that no
that's not just a test your code the
framework but the testimony right you
thank you framing it out you know a lot
of frameworks have internal tests but
then they're like oh you want to write
your own application and you figured out
you figured it out sure
and so that we feel like this part of
the open
and I think one of the things I would
like to try try to do with the
open-source communities to kind of
change the way the community operates
and say you know if you're gonna build a
framework I fully support that and I
think it's an awesome way to innovate
one of the things you should do is also
think about the people on hand the
developers and how they're gonna test it
so it is your job not only to make life
easier of others but also to share you
know this is base maybe the best
practice and testing my stuff so if
you're gonna build an app using my
awesome library framework whatever let
me show you how that this thing happens
as well
what it looks like and what's the
developer workflow I don't look like
exactly as you build it interesting so
um where do you see angular going I mean
like what's the future I almost get the
sense that you almost wish you could go
away like the browser could implement
enough stuff that this would just be the
way people do do apps and you wouldn't
so does a burden question let a lot of
people ask that you know will eventually
angle it go away if browsers incorporate
all these things and it's kind of funny
because for a while I kind of operated
under the assumption that yes angular is
just a very fancy shift that eventually
will disappear but it turns out it won't
because angular has many opinions that
the browser vendors are simply
uncomfortable for very good reason
because you know there have building a
general platform that has to be as good
for for crud application as it is for
building what is the game where the
birds fly over angry angry yeah so you
want to make sure that you can build a
game as well as a credit application in
there and so the goals of the browser
vendors is to support the widest
possible use cases so when you come to
things like very strong opinions about
well this is how the application
assembled it turns out that the browser
vendors aren't interested in these
things because well to some degree it is
an opinion and they shouldn't be because
well if you choose this then you are
doing it at the expense of this other
thing and so what the browser vendors
rightfully do is they look for the core
primitives you know what are the
primitives that we can do that will make
building these kinds of frameworks and
libraries successful and if you look at
I think a good example of this is no GIS
no J's if it's core it has essentially
nothing and it basically says look
you're the community you'll figure out
what the best
way of serving files as sure etc and so
then you have wonderful frameworks with
express that come out of it and the
package management system etc you just
needed a fast and efficient enable that
sort of exactly and so I feel the same
way about the angular and the browser
and the frameworks in general which is
that I think browsers job is to just
enable these ideas and then it should be
the frameworks that they try to
experiment with these ideas and see if
these ideas indeed are something that
the community wants or if it's something
that's useful right and then you know
through natural process of trying
different things you know these better
ideas appear clearer to the top and
other frameworks implemented or maybe
they grow this way and I can see that
from the from the browser makers
perspective you know you have to have
support old-style web application
exactly but maybe I in there you just
can't take it from a web developers
perspective is there still a place for
me to write you know old server
generated HTML pushed out to the client
static style web applications when do I
know that I need you know something like
something like an angular what's there
what's like the break-even point where
the right it is no complexity make sense
so what I like to argue that that's
actually simpler to build a angular app
and it is a server-side app but there's
places where server side apps are
important so the biggest one is crawlers
right web crawlers so if you want to be
have your site indexable by a search
engine you know search engines today
don't support JavaScript now I'm hoping
that that's gonna change in the future
but as it is things right now that's
just simply not the case
yeah Australia I mean in some ways it's
almost like the some of the projects
Google is supporting work against their
own best interest in terms of making it
easy for them to index all the content
on the web with all the content does
live in JavaScript you know does it does
angular help me to make a site that's
both dynamic and indexable is there any
specific thought about we were kind of
experimenting with be having this idea
of a server-side pre-rendered content
the idea would be that the server could
generate the content so that the crawler
can come along and see it but at the
same time angular couldn't connect to it
generate it so you can run like
server-side angular it's kind of like to
kind of get it going and then once it's
delivered of the browser the browser
came attached behavior to it and it
could become them and then it makes an
open application
interesting but it gets complicated very
quickly so I don't know if it's
general-purpose system that can be built
Island and and is I mean you said you
see it as easier to write the the
dynamic application with angular than
server-side so do you see everybody
moving moving in that direction and if
that's the case you know are there gonna
be emerging standards for for people
like a little bilder to find the content
have like a particular URL for a
particular location so there is a really
good standard where if you have an AJAX
application was a special URL the peaks
crawl engine search engines the crawlers
can go down bang and upon banking yeah
and then what you can do what I've seen
other peoples do for example I believe
HBO started with this is they actually
run their sides through the headless
browser
Wow anyways they generate the HTML they
cache the HTML and they serve it up to
the parole or so the crawlers basically
see the static content but if if a
regular browser comes in then they get
to have the dynamic content and the
generation is done in automatic fashion
so that you know it's not extra burden
it's for the developers which feels cool
but also somewhat perverse it is you
gotta run the whole site to a client and
or if you think about it I think what a
long-term an avoidable thing for the for
the crawlers is that the calls are
become a lot more like in browsers where
they have to start executing the
JavaScript and see what the rendered
page looks like
Wow from that perspective then actually
you could be you could be working on
Google's best interest right they've got
the smartest engineers you're gonna be
able to have the the crawler the best
emulates a browser and lots of browser
engineers man the search engine of the
future is gonna be more complicated yeah
so specifically in terms of angular's
features you don't see it going away
don't you don't see all of its
functionality is kind of provided by the
browser well it provides things like
dependency injection
is unlikely to be browser right it
provides things like filters to filter
expressions testing philosophy and all
of these things are marks etc all these
things are things that will be opinions
and it's unlikely to and you're only
interested in moving like kind of the
general philosophical components that
make it easy to write the framework into
the browser and not you don't see like a
you know chrome and give our plugin or
right built into chrome angular
implementation or anything right what
I'm interested in is that if I want to
build a web app and I see a cool
component that does charting and it's
done in angular and I see this other
thing that doesn't also bar chart or pie
chart or like everyone there want to
talk together on the same thing to be
able to talk to each other sure without
there has to be a hard choice to double
press to make oh I have to use this
framework the Frank you don't get to use
all those widgets or something like that
like it should just be you know very we
know everybody just loves each other and
place together absolutely that's a
that's a wonderful future to look
forward to I I hope it comes true hey um
thank you for coming in to talk to me
Google IO is coming up it's busy time
probably and hopefully we'll get that
we'll get to see you there and hang out
a little bit more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
