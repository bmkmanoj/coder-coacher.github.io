websites i was i was intrigued by HTML
and just putting something online having
people being able to visit it so i
experiment with geo cities in the
beginning and then front page i'm pretty
sure i learned how to how to actually
build a website the only promise i had
no designs to work off which is why i
started designing and then became a web
designer and I one gowalla hired me rest
in peace I started focusing more and
more on on mobile because the iphone was
such a great device like when it came
out it was it was the thing we've all
been waiting for four years and it
transformed the way we look at mobile
devices today says that's pretty damn
cool after iguala I joined Instagram at
that point the app was designed by their
CEO Kevin Systrom and I came up with
this twelve-month plan to redesign the
entire app screen by screen not just
because I'm a designer and I constantly
want to redesign stuff it's more like if
we add a feature or if we want to tweak
something and we have to touch a certain
screen why not make use of that
situation and and redesign it screen and
that was why for a couple months the app
was kind of well one part was redesigned
the other part was still at the old
design but it was part of a bigger plan
so and gave me confidence to keep on
pushing and eventually we reached that
goal and I was that was pretty cool
along the way I learned a lot I started
as a freelancer just at home it gets
pretty lonely really fast i found some
developer friends just to rent an office
together and get some free but feedback
and actually talk to human beings but
right now i'm as you know i'm at
facebook I'm still at the Instagram team
so the Instagram team is a small part
inside Facebook and they call us the
best fun that startup because we we
still do
SVO what we want but at the same time we
have access to the resources Facebook
has to offer like they're they're
amazing campus their staff is amazing I
can walk over to their cameras to the
camera team and asking for advice like
how you guys tackling this or that and
they'll help us they have a translation
team which allows us to translate yep
and 25 languages so it was pretty damn
awesome and and at the same time our
team is growing like I said I started
out on my own and and like now like over
the past two years I learned how to
function in a team with a bunch of
different people who do a bunch of
different stuff after talking with
teachers like I learned that especially
students in the audience you have
developers designers office management
and everything and and it's funny
because if you take all those people
together you can actually build a damn
good start up because start it needs all
of that and and it's one of the most
important things that everyone should
learn no matter what your job
description is is how to communicate
with each other I don't know how to
write a single line of code I can do
HTML I can do CSS I can hack some
JavaScript together if I want to I will
probably break and half the browser's
but what I learned this by communicating
by we're learning how to communicate
with your developers and with other
people around you like my boss who makes
all the big decisions or business guys
who decide about that you kind of don't
have to learn how to code or if you're a
developer you don't have to learn how to
design but you just it's a you form one
big hole and you know you know exactly
what is expected of you and you know how
to communicate your stuff to your
colleagues I sit right next to our lead
iOS developer the lead Android developer
sitting right behind me and and we we
can't communicate constantly I don't
need to explain and how they need to
implement my designs i'll just give them
the assets I know like I know how to
slice the essence because I know how
they prefer to get em delivered they now
implemented they'll open my PhD look at
the
font size font color is everything and
animations we just like we talked for
five minutes and we make all these
movements with our hands and then we're
like okay yeah I get you and we go back
and we implement it so that's a lot of
fun evenly I have a colleague of mine in
the audience from saudi liege he's also
belgian by the way he's start working on
our ops team three months ago and and
he's been an incredible help so yeah we
have a very our team is made out of
different nationalities with different
styles and different characters of
people yet again if it forms one big
whole unit and it's great to move fast
and to know where you're going and know
that they're there all wish people who
have your back so I'm going to continue
babbling off like this until someone has
a question and then I'll probably
continue babbling about that or
something else and then I'll forget what
the original question was so at any
point raise your hand and I'll answer
that question we think that would be a
good time to ask a question yes aha
collaboration that's the next half half
hour Phil when I first started working
for for guala I worked as a freelancer
for six months while they were working
out the whole visa process and while it
wasn't impossible to do it it feels like
you're working at half the speed at
least that's my experience had the same
experience with when I joined Instagram
we lived in austin they were in San
Francisco and we just had a baby so we
couldn't move for three months and even
though yes we were constantly chatting
and a over messenger or skyping or
whatever it's not the same as being in
the office once you're in the office
you're twice as fast you don't need to
chat all the time to in fact you just
not and whatever or like someone looks
at your screen like okay I gotta do this
and then and then the they go off so yes
you can work from home I wasn't suited
for it because I I just like having
people around me to talk with but it's
possible so it's my personal take on
that we think what else kind talk about
how loud stuff to talk about just for
keep forgetting it see also being in San
Francisco is a really interesting thing
one of the reasons I wanted to move to
the US is because there are a lot more
job opportunities there are more and
more tech company starting in Belgium
but if you want to like just dive in at
a full scale it's definitely easier to
do it in the US one of the problems you
can't go to a bar in San Francisco we
got over her and over hearing someone
explain their idea for the next new
Facebook I'm like all right cool story
bro I'll go to the next bar but
something you learn how to deal with and
and just like surround yourself with
good people not just your colleagues
friends you can spend time with after
hours and and and be sure to keep in
touch with how the rest of the world
actually uses the internet or how they
actually uses use your app and I'm at
this point right now where ma I'm trying
to not design for other designers not
designed for other techie people but
just for people I don't want to use
fancy fancy names for certain features
and he's like you need to be able to
read it to see it and to immediately
know what it does which is sadly
something a lot of people here don't get
and they'll build something that's
that's awesome but you cannot possibly
explain it to your mom what it does
what's yet oh yeah I got a couple of
questions so I'm not surprised
when you started off at Instagram did
you guys have like a somebody doing UX
driving like you know how the user flow
is going to be the whole interaction or
you just created that how do you
differentiate between the design between
iOS and Android where I work we were
kind of debating you know a lot of apps
I see they're either like iOS stylish
and then they'll you know you know true
do the same kind of design on Android
looks kind of crappy but and then
there's also big debate going on between
iOS which is more skeuomorphic versus
flat design which is the new jelly bean
and probably key lime pie we're gonna
see an Ultron windows so so which one
what's your preference on that another
question might be like pants refers
transferred mmm already forgot the first
one it's about you x so no when I joined
Instagram at the same time another
designer from the Netherlands Joan
Michael lumens and we basically split up
task like he does everything web and I
do everything mobile both iOS and
Android at that point i only had
experience with designing for iOS which
is why the Instagram Android app looks
so much like an Iowa zap and I'm like I
have plans to like gradually like move
move more towards a more Android look
because I believe every every operating
system deserves decent apps they were
built for the operating system and
weren't just a copy from iOS over to to
Android and it's all about experience at
this point I have a much better
understanding of Android I'm much more
confident with what I'm doing but we
still have the split between mobile and
web we're hiring more and more designers
at this point and those designers would
probably work more cross-platform but I
remember one of your questions when we
started again the design was done by
Kevin Systrom he hacked it together any
it worked it worked great so when I came
on board I was basically responsible for
everything
at the same time it wasn't just just me
like I I was working on something a
developer came over and we talked about
it and he had some ideas and he asked me
questions and when I couldn't ask back
those questions I need I knew I needed
to go back to the drawing board and edit
a bunch of stuff and I I would
constantly show the design and the
progress of the implementation to as
many people as possible and to as as a
very like not just always going to
developers both of people the community
team because they they know how Pete the
people who actually use the app they
know how they would respond to certain
changes and stuff so yeah it's it's all
about getting a lot of feedback and
listening carefully and learning how to
deal with feedback a lot of designers
have an ego a thing that just comes with
the job I I think i lost my ego
somewhere between voila and Instagram
and I'm really happy about that and it's
all about listening to people sometimes
what they say makes no sense just not
and be polite but oftentimes you really
need to listen carefully abuse often
they don't really know how to explain
themselves and you can't have to keep
asking questions and questions and
questions till you get to the core issue
of what they're trying to describe so
there's that Oh final questions so you
know there were a lot of photo apps out
there and Instagram just revolutionized
kind of and and made it more fun to
share photos take photos what were your
thoughts behind that like can you when
you like approach design for something
like Instagram are you looking to create
something totally unique like new nobody
has done before or you look at that
popular patterns like how did you come
up with that and what's what's your
personal style alright so i think the
early success of instagram was partly
because it was really well timed at the
same time kevin and mikey and shane and
everyone they're working their ass off
to keep improving it it started out as a
as the app was basically a rapper
around the html5 app and that was their
preferred happiness how they launched it
and after a while they discovered that
it wasn't performing fast enough so they
switched it over to a native view I have
this philosophy like if if your app is
meant to be a fun app more like a
gimmicky app like you buy that you use
it once or twice go crazy with the
design and and and you can even even
over design it and that could be part of
the fun but if you want like the more
hours you want people to spare your app
on a daily or weekly base the less the
design should be there and and in the
end the goal is if you want your users
to use your app multiple times date they
shouldn't notice the design the at the
point where if they notice the design
you did something wrong it's about all
about taking a step back and making sure
the content shines and respecting the
content and respecting both the platform
you're designing for yeah it's almost
like a graph so there's that um yeah I
had another question I did Facebook's
acquisition acquisition changed anything
for you personally or in the company
know which to be honest it surprised all
of us I'm not going to say the
transition was was easy especially not
for me because I had no experience with
big companies I don't know anything
about politics and how to politely
communicate an idea to someone else well
it took about two months and after after
that we were like up and running and
better than before like I said we had
access to so many great resources and we
were allowed to hire people from inside
Facebook people from outside Facebook
say our team has doubled in size I think
we're about 30 right now and it's great
we still have the same vibe with all of
our team as we had before it's only a
commute is a bit longer now and I stood
on the shuttle two hours a day
Yeah right here you've tackled iphone
you've tackled Android have you thought
about designing an Instagram experience
for motion control after seeing the
previous demo I was thinking about it no
we like we're still 30 people for a
community of over 100 million active
users that's that's still a tiny team so
we focused on where the numbers are iOS
and Android that's currently all we all
we can cover so we don't do stuff like
that but luckily we have a lot of
developers who use our API to do stuff
like that and they've made some of the
coolest things from random screensavers
to I'm guess what you're saying must be
out there somewhere see that's awesome
we should talk yeah it's all about
picking your fights and and we could
probably do more platforms at the same
time but we want to we want to be great
at every platform we tackle which is why
we're doing I OS and Android right now
and we're proud of it we're also doing
WEP at the same time so that's ramping
up so the question was why did we wait
with Anwar and what why didn't we
launched it together with with iphone I
guess well I wasn't there when they
launched iphone I was a year before I
joined but it was just like we were all
working day and night on the iphone app
and at certain point were like okay this
isn't a good enough state that we can
kind of focus on on Andrew it for a
while and then we start working on that
like it was when I start working the
project they were building it they were
working on it three months on the back
end and we're making work on Android and
then in one month time we did the entire
interface both design and implementation
so we didn't get a lot of sleep but it
was a lot of fun yeah coming from a
development and designing standpoint we
were able to understand the two sides
when you're working with developers and
designers but what would be key for you
or would be the best advice that was key
for you to understanding how developers
coming
take it with you and how you could
communicate with them where you too can
have a really good synergy together it's
about being a good listener and being a
good communicator I've worked with
developers in the past who hadn't who
didn't know how to communicate what they
did to me I'm not a smart guy so they
need to like you need to really make it
really simple and experience like that
I've worked and I'm currently working
with developers who are great at
explaining what they do and how they how
they do things and how they they tell me
how I can make their life better easier
to work and and I do the same like it
like if I design something and they're
like sorry we can we can't do it I'll
ask him like why can't you do it what
can I do better like make my life easier
by telling me what my what the
constraints are so again communicating
listening very very important in a team
of any size so that's loud so I noticed
on Instagram there seems to be a lot of
content especially maybe in the last
half year that is not just like people
posting photos it's a maybe text that
they found in a graphic format somewhere
on the web and things like that and
those still show up a lot in the
featured or the what's hot you know tab
or whatever so I'm curious kind of how
Instagram is approaching that content
are you trying to guide users towards a
certain Instagram experience and and how
does that affect your design decisions
relating things like what's what's hot
or is it kind of just like whatever the
users want that's what's what's going to
happen yeah i think it's about ten
percent trying to make your users users
do something and ninety percent just
listening and see what what they do with
your product and you you have to realize
that what you built isn't isn't your
baby anymore where you release it at
that point it becomes it becomes a tool
for other people to express themselves
if they want to express themselves
through text and other stuff they found
so be it then we need to we need to move
with them you can be stubborn and
alienate your community or you can
follow
oh and actually make the tools adapter
tool so they become even better for them
we're very lucky that we have a kick-ass
community team started out as one guy
and I think they're at six or seven
right now and and it's their job to to
listen and see what people do with the
app they help setting up insta meets or
instil walks and and they'll give us
that feedback they'll tell us like if a
certain flow we thought was was really
easy they'll tell us when people have no
idea what's going on when they're just
like randomly tapping around and and it
surprised me when I want to join us ram
that a community team can have so much
value because there they are one of the
main reasons instagram is what it is
today that together with just a buttload
of work so
crickets
haha he asked good questions you can
keep asking questions so i can keep
talking maybe so i work at a large
corporation and you know when when
basically p and product manager will
drive like the new feature that's need
that needs to come out and we have like
a UX guy has got to talk we will have a
meeting and we'll discuss and then
define the feature set how do you guys
work at Instagram now that you're become
Padilla p.m. and UX and also when you
let's say you have an idea what I
sometimes feel there is no way to
quickly like prototype something because
we have like a big process is there a
way do you prototype the usage just with
engineer and just like hack something up
and see how it that looks how does a
floor work um it's yeah I basically sit
together with a with an engineer and if
he thinks my idea isn't completely
insane he'll work on it and it's evening
or weekend or when yes like five minutes
and we can only do that because we're
sitting right next to each other and we
understand the value of prototyping
certain things because you can have some
great ideas but they might be a hard
sell hi I want to say hi rap but like
your to your manager until you can
actually show it and and then they can
have like the lightbulb moment but our
our flow is basically like Kevin as an
idea of a feature he wants to do we'll
discuss it if we all agree we should be
doing it then engineering starts looking
at like okay what do we need to do on
the platforms like what are the
possibilities and then design wise we
just hired a design manager and we just
start whiteboarding entire we started an
entire flows and white board I'll take
photos of it I'll make more detailed
wireframes and we'll discuss the flow
again at that point I start jumping in
Photoshop but the key aspect there is
getting the flow right once you have
that you have you have a solid base to
work on
I used to just jump into Photoshop and
mock something up and then like we
looked at it like this is completely
unusable no so you sort already talked
about it but can you speak about the
website views and process behind out why
it's kind of been a slow rollout mmm
sort of and just anything you will talk
about that because there's one designer
and one developer working on it they're
working really hard and it's risk we're
we're figuring out what what to do with
the web like we have a lot of options
and again we don't try to try and make
it as good as possible I guess you'll
see a lot more over the next coming
months or 12 months I don't know it's
going to be going to be pretty awesome I
can't I can't talk a lot more about that
sorry Hey so there's a lot of really
amazing students and talent here yeah um
and you found a lot of really successful
teams and you know have come out here
like you said to really kind of dive in
what would you advice would you give
these guys that maybe want to move out
here what's the first kind of job or
team or culture they should look for i
would first advise them to find a good
wife because well without my wife this
this would not have been possible it
depends because I I know at the age you
guys are it's you might not specifically
know what you want to do so it might
still be a more exploring exploration
phase and it's hard to it's hard to look
at a look at a start-up or any company
from the outside and get a good idea of
how it is working on the inside so what
I would say is trying and get in touch
with people who actually work at the
different companies and email back and
forth or if you're if you're in the city
good go have a coffee with them and talk
about how it is to actually work there
and at that point you can you're free to
talk to all the companies you want go
for interview see see how it is on the
inside see what questions they ask you
the interview process it will give you a
pretty damn good idea
how it is on the inside and maybe the
first company you join might not be the
company you're looking for but then
maybe the second one will there are a
lot of opportunities here or in or in
Belgium whatever and the skills you guys
are learning today are very valuable and
every company is looking for people who
are good at that as long as you're
passionate about it and and you have
this ability to get obsessed with
something you're having like you have
any incredible value for any company out
there question my question is about
mergers and acquisition okay for a
company that's doing good there are
people or other bigger corporations that
are interested in your company could you
give us an insight on which corporations
are circling around and which are you
with corporations you are leaning
towards what do you mean from if I was
being acquired and I come I work for
facebook right now I I think you should
ask Mark Zuckerberg I'm in no position
and I I have no experience to answer
that question so maybe two more
questions
so was just wondering why you you came
here rather than doing all those amazing
thing in Belgium hahaha is my colleague
it was always a dream of mine to live in
the US for at least a couple of years
and really experience the culture it
might look like what we have and in
Europe and and the culture over here in
the US are very similar but once you
live here you you notice all the tiny
details and they ever I learned that
there actually huge differences in
culture which is really really
interesting like if someone in the u.s.
tells you like oh that was cool let's
let's meet up next week they don't mean
it they're like it's just there's being
polite and a bunch of our stuff you
learn here which is interesting so yeah
it turned out to be at to be a great
choice and moved over here we had a
beautiful daughter and and I'm enjoying
what I'm doing I'm enjoying my work I'm
enjoying my private life it's definitely
not easy being this far from from family
but facetime helps a lot yeah just one
kiss just one question but do you think
about a flat design haha I I saw the
whole schemer fig versus flat design
quibble design whatever you feel feels
best for the product start with looking
at the content then look at what your
target audience is and and used to use
those two factors to to pick your design
style and and and build it out that's
what we did with like a year ago
Instagram didn't have any design style
and now we have a firm style like
anytime we need to build a new screen
for something we just use existing
existing controls we have put it
together and actually every every time
we're like okay we need a new control
for this we need to stop and ask
yourself a question like do we really
need it what's wrong with the controls
we currently have
and it guides us to keep things as
simple as possible and make em don't
shove new controls into the face of our
users I've one last thing to say after a
question okay so why did you change he
said that you thought education was so
important what did you change your mind
on that for one seeing all the students
sitting here seeing the presentations
they gave they like they told me that I
did it in a week which is that right
amazing if you look if you look at the
design if you look at I was smooth it
works and the communication with the
server and all doing that in a week
that's that's insane I tried go to
college twice but I never I never found
a direction that that's felt like it's
it was made for me for what I wanted to
do with my life again what these because
were doing right now it's it's it's
amazing so yeah I would definitely if I
was 18 again I know where I would go
where I would go at school I'm being
pained paid in pizza right here so I how
do you see yourselves within 10 years 20
years I don't even know what I'm gonna
have for lunch tomorrow but not again
now this this world moves incredibly
incredibly fast you can't make any
specific 10-year plans or anything like
we live here we're healthy or join what
we're doing what I want to do is I want
to learn I want to become better at what
I do want to ever want to have a better
understanding of what the people around
me do and maybe like explore other other
directions but it's hard to predict and
the only thing you can be sure of is if
you're not flexible I don't think you
should be working in this industry
it comes with the job and if you accept
that pretty damn amazing okay so what
was question about education like and
you decide is say you would go back to
school so what kind of knowledge you
would expect to get from University
taking switch all changings of to
machining very fast blue crystal
fundamental knowledge it's all just
pretty much sum html5 or whatever all
this low level technology I I think it
kind of touched us this subject it'sit's
to the teacher should be teaching the
students to be curious and to explore on
their own and to become obsessed with
something I became obsessed with the web
and then I became obsessed with with
design and then and then with with
iphone and at that once you become
obsessed with something nothing can stop
you and there's no barrier you will find
the resources to learn what you want to
do and and the cool thing about this
industry is a long the way there are
plenty of people willing to help you and
you'll ask them questions and it'll
respond to you and they'll help you grow
even further and further and further
well we ran out of time first of all
huge round of applause for Tim beautiful
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
