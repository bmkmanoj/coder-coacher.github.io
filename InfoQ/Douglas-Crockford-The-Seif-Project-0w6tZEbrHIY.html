the software to make the web good and
not evil
ladies and gentlemen Douglas Crockford
I'm really happy to see all of you
equally so I've been for years I've been
spanning the globe and talking about the
web and things that are wrong with it
that need to be corrected and why they
need to be corrected hoping that some
organization or laboratory or company or
university or Somebody Anybody would fix
it that didn't work that didn't happen
so I'm gonna fix it so let me give you a
progress report on what I've been
working on this the safe project so it
starts with the web you all know about
the web the web has become the most
important application delivery system
the world has ever seen the reaching
capability of the thing is absolutely
amazing but it comes at a cost right it
doesn't quite work right and from my
perspective the things that are worse
about the web are the problems with
security that more and more of what we
do is in the web and the web was not
designed to do all the things what we're
trying to do and as a consequence it
tends to undermine us and it tends to
compromise us and create problems for
all of us so one of the problems with
security in the web is its reliance on
passwords we have a lot of history with
passwords in computing the very first
computers did not have passwords they
reap what they relied on physical
security there were men with guns who
were protecting those machines and that
worked that worked really well it worked
until disk drives were invented when we
have online storage and then when time
sharing become
an important way of sharing computers so
a time-sharing company would buy a big
mainframe and they would allow people
all over the country to connect to it
through terminals and they needed to
make sure that the people connecting to
it could not get access to other
customers data and they also needed to
make sure that nobody could connect to
them without paying for the time that
they used we used to charge people for
computer time so they used passwords and
passwords worked because there was only
one person or each person would likely
only have one time sharing account
people can reliably remember one
password so that worked when PCs start
up we completely forget all of that and
we go back to no passwords and physical
security and that works until we start
distributing floppy disks around and so
now we've got floppy born viruses and it
gets really bad when we start adding
disk drives and networking to the PCs
now suddenly everything is awful so
passwords come back in again your PC has
a password then the web starts and again
the web forgets all of that history and
so initially there are no passwords on
the web and then the first site that
needs it says okay we'll have a password
because we've got stuff and we need to
protect our customers in our data and
the second site that needs to do that
says well they used passwords that'll
work for us too and pretty soon every
site has a password now you're talking
to dozens maybe hundreds of sites and
each one should have a separate password
humans cannot manage that but that's the
state of the web so the first time we
see the word password connected to the
web is in RFC 1738 and it includes a
format for a URL that contains a
username and a password and this gets
sent in the clear
now at least one of the authors of this
RFC recognized that this was a really
bad idea and so he includes the sentence
the use of URLs containing passwords
that should be secret is clearly unwise
which is an amazing bit of
understatement but they didn't have
anything better to recommend so this
went out and there were people who used
it and they very quickly found out why
it was unwise so I'm gonna be talking
about what's wrong with the web because
we have to look hard at what's wrong
with the web if we're gonna fix it
because if we don't understand why it's
wrong then our Corrections probably
won't make sense and this is going to be
shocking and upsetting to many of you
that you have worked your whole careers
your whole lives with the web you don't
know anything else you rely on it for
your livelihood many of you define
yourselves as being of the web and I'm
going to tell you all that's wrong with
it I'm not talking about you ok this
isn't about you this is about the web
and what we have to the process we have
to go through in order to make the web
better so I'm there are a lot of things
that are wrong with the web but I'm
primarily focused on its insecurities
and much of its insecurity is a
consequence of its complexity that the
web started off as an amazingly simple
thing but we added a whole lot of new
stuff to it and we can't stop at those
standards processes are out of control
we're always adding new stuff and the
consequence of adding the new stuff is
the thing gets really complex and
complex systems are really difficult to
reason about particularly the security
of complex systems virtually impossible
to reason about and that's why our
systems are insecure so let's go through
some of the components of of the web
first there is HTTP the hypertext
transport protocol it's a request
response protocol that was designed for
retrieving documents and as a document
retrieval protocol it's probably not too
bad
you can look at it as being three
specific things all kind of mush
together the first is it's a data format
for key value pairs
it's a fussy kind of eccentric format I
think there are much better key value
pair formats in the world than that it's
a negotiation protocol so the early web
browsers were not competent about all
the graphic formats and other kinds of
resources and so there'd be a dialogue
you know I need this well I don't know
how to do that but I got that can you do
that compressed and so on they trade
things back and forth not so important
now the browser's have all caught up and
they're all pretty competent they can
handle anything you can send them but
that negotiation protocol is still there
and it's expensive then it's a request
response protocol you request something
you wait then something comes back you
display it probably it will disconnect
and then go to something else wait for
it to come back and that made sense in
the very beginning of the web but that's
not how we use the web today you'll load
a page in that page will contain
hundreds of additional assets images
scripts styles all kinds of stuff and
for each one you then have to go out to
that server again and go wait wait wait
for the next one then you can ask for
the next piece wait wait wait that's
hugely inefficient so one of the ways we
mitigate that is we'll have the browser
open several connections to the same
server so that it can get some
interleaving going on which adds a whole
nother level of complexity there's DNS
the domain name system this was a
well-intentioned thing to make it easier
for people to get to a computer without
knowing its IP address that instead
you'll type in a simpler name and the
world will look it up in a database
somewhere and direct you to the right
machine
this has some problems one is it is not
compatible with the trademark system but
we used only domain names like
trademarks and because those are not
compatible we find there are all sorts
of complexities and a lot of legal
wrangling and a lot of stuff which will
probably never be solved
worse than that there are security
problems inherent in DNS their DNS
poisoning attacks and other confusion
attacks squatting and all of that which
seem to be inherent in the system
there's SSL secure socket layer 'z this
was developed at Netscape because they
correctly recognized that we needed some
form of link encryption and
authentication in order to do electronic
commerce unfortunately SSL is a very
complicated protocol it's very efficient
and because of its complexity it has
terrible security problems we are still
finding tremendous security problems
almost every month in SSL it's been 20
years we've had this thing for 20 years
and we have not converged on correctness
yet one of the sources of complexity and
SSL is its reliance on certificate
authorities so the thing which will
associate a domain name with another
name is a certificate certificates come
from organizations like Verisign but if
you have a certificate from Verisign the
only thing you can really be sure of is
that somebody gave some money to varus
on it's not clear that the certificate
actually tells you anything more than
that and do I trust Verisign I don't
know who they are why should I trust
them I don't know I don't know who they
are I do know from reading Wikipedia
that they have been hacked and that they
were not still enough forthcoming about
what the hackage was or what was
compromised or what so should I trust
them
I don't like trusting anybody and I I
think I've got reasons for not wanting
to trust Verisign but worse than that
there are hundreds of other certificate
authorities and your browser trusts them
all equal
and many of them have already been
compromised we have seen the stuff and I
I don't like that I want a system where
I can have confidence in it HTML the
hypertext markup language is HTML a good
thing or a bad thing
what depends on what you want to do if
what you want to do is to markup simple
documents simple technical documents
that's the thing that HTML was designed
to do it's really awful it's it's
complicated it's fussy
it's ugly it's nasty it is why we
invented markdown languages markdown
languages do a much better job at
marking up simple documents than HTML
does now if what you want to do instead
is to deliver interactive applications
to the world it's really terrible
because it wasn't designed to do that at
all and it just does a really bad job of
it one of the terrible one of the things
I like least about HTML is that it
almost requires use of templating in
templating you've got some HTML with
some variable holes in it which will get
plugged in with stuff and that's how we
build applications
I don't like templating because it is
the major vector of XSS injection so
it's got inherent security problems it
is possible to do templating correctly
but apparently that never happens
because we still hear about new XSS
attacks all the time that it's just too
difficult to get this stuff right I also
don't like it because it creates this
dependence on HTML that gets into every
level of everything so everything that's
happening in the browser is all about
generating HTML everything that's
happening the server is all about HTML
going all the way back to the database
everything all wants to be about HTML
every and it's really a brittle thing I
mean it's gotten so bad that we're now
looking at doing client-side templating
which is nuts
you know we're doing it all over then
the the third thing I don't like about
templating is a trap
because we've got everything everything
is dedicated to HTML generation that
means we're never going to get free of
it we're gonna be messing with HTML
forever
there's the Dom the Dom is the document
object model it is the API that the
browser presents to JavaScript it may be
the worst API ever imagined it's just
awful it's it's brittle it's clumsy it's
at the wrong level of abstraction it's
not portable enough it's wildly insecure
it's just awful when you talk to web
developers who say they hate JavaScript
what they're really hating is the Dom
they just don't know what the difference
you know where the where the boundary is
the CSS crappy style sheets CSS was
developed for formatting of documents
and since then we have extended it
several times in order to give it
additional capabilities but it's really
complicated the style sheets that you
developed tend to get really complicated
they tend to grow over time and you
can't squish them down it's unreliable
in that one style rule can affect things
which appear to be unrelated so it's
it's very fragile
then there's JavaScript JavaScript is a
hot mess javascript was designed and
implemented in ten days which was an
amazing accomplishment but it turns out
you can make a lot of mistakes in 10
days and those mistakes are in
JavaScript and will always probably be
there standards can add new features to
the language and sometimes the features
are good sometimes they're not we just
keep growing it but the good news is
that there are good parts in this
language there's actually brilliance in
this language and if you're working with
those good parts programming gets easier
and the programs become more more
reliable
and when things are simple and reliable
it's more likely they're going to be
secured so there's some goodness in this
language and so I want to keep with this
part so I'm not the first to have
recognized that there all these problems
with the web there are many before me
who recognize that there must be a
business opportunity here because the
web is so damaged in so many ways
there's got to be a way to replace it
with something better and we can make
money off of that so Microsoft Adobe
Apple Oracle and many other companies
large and small have all gone after the
web in most cases the technology that
they offered was much better in most
cases what they offered was not open
that what they were trying to do was to
capture the web or displace the web to
own the web basically or to own its
successor and so that makes me glad that
they all failed because the thing I like
the best about the web the reason why I
want the web to survive and to continue
to flourish and grow is because of its
openness that with the web if you have
an idea and you want to present it to
the world you can do that and you don't
need to make a deal to anybody you do
not have to submit to anybody you don't
have to share your stuff with anybody
you don't want to share it with it's
open to anyone who wants to do that
stuff and I think that's great and the
web is the only global platform that can
do that and that's why I love the web
and I think the reason these other
attempts at capturing the web failed
wasn't because they were closed it was
because they didn't have an adequate
transition plan how do you get from A to
B and who do have to move from A to B in
all cases what they thought they needed
to do was to move you if they could
convince enough developers to move to
their platforms they'd win and that
turned out not to be the thing so it's a
different thing so what we so what I
want to do is up
the weather I want to keep it doing the
things it does well in fact the web does
some things very well and I want to
leave that alone I don't want to touch
it I don't want to make it more
complicated or harder it stays exactly
the way it is but the stuff that we need
to do which needs to be secure which is
important I want to provide a better way
within the web for accomplishing that
and I want to provide a transition plan
which gets us all there and my metaphor
for the transition is HDTV
high-definition television so it wasn't
very long ago broadcasting in this
country was analog using a system called
NTSC and the consumer electronics
industry decided that they wanted to
have a new television system because
that would allow them to sell a lot more
new television sets and that would
provide growth and jobs and all of that
and the government thought that's a good
thing too because all that growth and
jobs and new stuff means more taxes and
that's all good to so everybody got all
excited about designing this new system
the FCC granted new spectrum to the
broadcaster's so that in addition to
doing their analog broadcasting they
could also simultaneously be doing
digital broadcasting with the expection
expectation that eventually they will
take all of the analog spectrum away
from the broadcasters and relicense it
for new applications maybe internet or
public service or other things which
much of that might mean more money for
the government and the government was
really keen on that but there was a
concern that if the transition didn't go
properly that if they said on some day
and date on January 1st of some year we
turn off all the analogue transmitters
and everything is all digital now so if
you haven't made the transition your TV
is going to go dark and then the
superbowl happens and everybody misses
it and then there is armed rebellion
the government was really concerned that
that could happen and so they came up
with a transition plan so that that
wouldn't happen and in fact it didn't
happen and the transition plan was based
on a thing called the set-top box the
old timers might remember televisions
used to be in great big rectangular tube
boxes that were so big that you could
set another box on top of it and that
other box could do things which would
then affect what you saw on the
television set and one of the set-top
boxes so there are lots of set-top boxes
there were some that would connect to
your cable system your satellite system
or or you could have your video tape
system or your game system and there was
also a high definition set-top box which
would allow you to receive a high
definition TV signal and it would go
through your box and then get fed into
your analog TV so you could watch the
new shows and the government provided
these set-top boxes to anybody who
needed one for low-cost or no-cost and
it worked and so we switched off all of
the analog and we're all now on digital
and it worked so I'm proposing that we
do something similar for the web that
what what happened was they didn't they
didn't try to make the transition easy
for the broadcasters in fact it was
really hard for the broadcasters the
broadcasters had to buy digital
transmitters and they had to operate
them and all of the analog stuff and it
didn't create any new revenue that they
had lots of new operating costs and no
revenue to compensate for that they
didn't make it easier for the producers
of programming because the programmers
had to now go and buy better cameras and
better equipment for making their shows
they had
make their sets better they had to make
the costume makeup everything had to get
better and there was no new revenue to
pay for that the people they made the
transition work for were the viewers
they want to make sure that the audience
would be able to move into the new
system as painlessly as possible and
that worked so if you had one of those
set-top boxes you didn't even know if
something was a digital channel or an
analog channel you might notice that the
digital channels looked a little better
and you might have noticed that
switching between digital channels seems
to take longer for no good reason but it
does but otherwise it was a completely
smooth transition and I want to do that
for the web but for the web instead of
having a set-top box I propose a helper
app helper app is a component of
browsers the the first web browsers did
not know how to display all of the image
types they didn't know how to play
sounds there are a lot of things they
couldn't do so if you asked a browser to
do something that it didn't know how to
do yet you could have it start some
other program that did know how to do
that so if you try to display a ping
file in it in your browser didn't know
about pings it could open a paint
program and maybe the paint program
knows how to display the ping so it's
weird and annoying but it worked and it
turns out that interface is still built
in all the browser's and I think we can
take advantage of that so the new
capabilities that I'm talking about the
simpler more secure way of developing
applications using JavaScript we can put
that stuff into a helper app and anytime
someone tries to access one of these new
applications the sulfur happen helper
app will run and that will allow us to
to take advantage of the new goodness
now the problem with the helper app idea
is that this time there is no way we can
convince the audience to get one I think
I could convince most of you to install
a helper app if if what we're talking
about is really interesting but the rest
of the audience isn't going
to do that so the transition is going to
depend on us being able to convince the
browser makers so here is my transition
plan step 1 I need to convince one
progressive browser maker to integrate
the helper app so that it's built into
the browser so that when you try to do
this thing instead of running a separate
program instead it just opens up a tab
and it looks like it's in the browser
but it's just this new stuff this should
be an easy thing to do because all we
require is a rectangle that we can put
some pixels in access to UI events and
adjacent channel between the new thing
and the old thing it should be easy to
do who does it I don't know or care my
expectation is it'll probably be Mozilla
because they used to be a leader in web
technology and they've they've sort of
Lost's that initiative they might want
to get it back this might be away from
it to do that Microsoft the same story
they used to be a leader in web
technology and they've fallen way behind
they've done some amazing work in edge I
think edge is really impressive and it
seems that nobody cares but this might
be a chance for them to get you to take
another look at them step two I need to
convince one secure site to require its
customers to use that browser could be a
medical site or a financial site
somebody who has a real need for
security and who is scared to death of
having to operate in the current web
which they're doing because of
competitive pressure but they're really
afraid of what is about to happen
they're constantly in the state of fear
and so they may elect to say ok or at
least one service that we provide you
have to use this new browser with this
new safe capability built into it in
order to access us and I'm pretty
confident we're gonna find somebody to
do that then risk mitigation will compel
all of the other sites that have similar
concerns to do the same thing once the
first one has demonstrated that the
safe then I think many more will follow
because they need that safety it's
similar to what happens to penguins so
you know penguins are standing on the
edge of the ice floe and you know
they're looking down the water and
they're hungry because they've been on
the ice for four months and their fish
down in the water and they really want
to get down and eat that fish but they
also know their leopard leopard seals
and sharks and other things down in the
water that eat penguins and so they're
just looking they're really carefully
trying to see if it's safe and they keep
pushing each other and those and
eventually one of them falls in and then
everyone else and if he comes back up
they all go in so I'm hoping we can do a
similar thing like that then competitive
pressure should move the other browser
makers to do this - no one will want to
be the last browser to be able to do
this and since integration is real easy
that they should all want to do it once
there's demonstrated that there is
demand for it and then I expect the
world will follow for the improved
security and faster application
development
I don't expect everything moves in fact
everything doesn't have to if there's
stuff which works just fine in the web
the way it is which doesn't have these
reliability or security concerns
it can stay exactly the way it is I'm
not proposing to obsolete anything ever
just providing a new way of doing stuff
which is important and nothing breaks
we're not going to invalidate anything
we're not going to close anything we're
not going to capture anything everything
remains open everything just gets better
so the system I'm proposing is going to
have some strong cryptography in it
we're gonna be using elliptic curve 521
for key exchange on authentication we're
gonna be using AES 256 for link
encryption and sha-3 256 for hashing
these are probably all stronger than I
need but I want to be using these
because I'm paranoid and and I want to
have that now having strong cryptography
in a system is no guarantee that it's
going to be a secure system in fact
we've seen lots of cases of systems
claiming to have strong cryptography who
got broken because there are lots of
other things you need to attend to as
well but we're gonna start with that
there is a guy named Zuko who has a
theory of naming he says that any name
can have one of three desirable
properties the web chose meaning human
meaningful at least to the extent where
you think a URL is human human
meaningful but I'm more concerned about
security so I'm gonna be taking the
other two I'm gonna be making names
which are securely unique and also
globally decentralized so there'll be no
central authority issuing names anybody
can create a name and be confident that
it's going to be secure so we're gonna
the way we're gonna do that is we're
going to be using lip Deker 521 public
keys as unique identifiers and
you don't go to anybody to get one you
make one yourself and it'll be generated
randomly and because it's such a huge
number you take one of these in base 32
encoding it's 105 digits long that's
that's huge and if we generate it
correctly they're virtually unique and
that will work and that will become the
basis for how we authenticate in this
system so having that we're going to be
doing secure Jason over TCP instead of
HTTP Jason I think is a much nicer
format for expressing the envelopes that
we're gonna be sending the data in will
also be providing support for blobs
so if you have some big thing which
isn't easily expressed in Jason just say
this is a big hunk of bits and and we'll
send that as well and it'll all be
linked encrypted link encrypted and
secure and reliable
so this is a safe URL this is a URL that
we'll use for transiting from the old
web to the new web this is a really ugly
URL there's it contains stuff in it that
you don't normally see in in URLs
although you can so it'll contain our
public key which is again one hundred
five digits long I don't expect people
will ever type these in these are things
that machine's will generate and
machines will consume but I want to put
the public key in here because I don't
trust Verisign to provide me the public
key right I I trust whoever gives me
this URL and I think they're more
trustworthy and then we'll get the IP
address which in IP 6 is also a huge
thing so I don't expect anyone is going
to type these in but it is possible so I
want to make at least possible so that
you know the resistance you know when
things are going really bad you know you
type in 200 characters and you can
connect you know it's gonna be really
hard but but you know if you're
motivated you can do it but it also
means there are no passwords in the
system and that means there's no way
someone can torture you and say give up
your password because there's no way you
can recite the 105 digit number in
distress I don't think you could do it
even if you were relaxed it's just not
something humans could do you can't
possibly give it up and then we can also
provide a referral code at the end so
where do you get these so I don't trust
the Verisign I don't trust DMS which is
why I hard code these things in the URL
but I would trust Google right if I if
I'm trying to get to a site and I asked
Google you know how do I get to the site
and if Google returns one of these I'll
trust it I think they're good another
way we could use these is I could go to
my bank and my banker could give me a
card with a QR code on it which contains
this stuff and
furl code will be a capability that will
connect to my account so if I scan that
with my any of my devices then that will
connect me to the bank I'll never have a
password with a bank I don't even need
an account number with a bank I'm just
connected will also provide a trust
management system so all of the
relationships that we create in the safe
system we can keep them out in the cloud
but properly secured and so you can get
access to that stuff through all of your
devices also provide a pet name system
since you can't recognize a hundred five
character anything will allow you to
assign your own names to use things and
so by using those names you'll have
confidence that you're getting to the
right thing our model of computation
relies on a container that we call a vat
that is like a sand box except it
doesn't leak how to Kat so I can tell
you when the sandbox leaks that's a bad
thing
but of that is a good thing so nothing
can get in and or out of the VAT except
through Jason messages and and so we can
be confident that we can take any bit of
code and put in the VAT and allow to
compute in there but it can't cause any
damage all can do is communicate with
things which are expecting it to
communicate so this provides us a
computational model in which we can have
cooperation under mutual suspicion which
allows us to have multiple entities
multiple interests all running at the
same time for your benefit so you can
have one representing a merchant and
another representing delivery and
another representing payment and another
insurance and they can all be
representing different companies and
they can all be working together but
none of them have to trust each other
none of them have to worry about the
other one corrupting its environment or
or getting over on it which is something
we've always been wanting to do in the
web that's why mashups became
interesting but it was never safe with
this system I think we can make
safe so this is my plan
so step one is safe mode safe mode is a
module that you can run on any node
server which provides some cryptographic
services it will give you everything
that I've talked about it will also give
you some very nice random services
because we're generating globally unique
public keys we needed very good sources
of randomness and so in order to
generate good random numbers we need to
have good entropy so safe node will go
to the operating system operating
systems provide entropy services but I
don't trust them to be good enough so we
augment those with your microphone so
we'll turn your microphone on for a few
seconds and just get noise from it and
we'll use that noise to help harvest
entropy we'll do the same thing with
your camera we'll turn your camera on
for a few frames collect noise from that
and that will give us enough entropy
will then store that entropy away so we
only have to do that once during
installation and we'll be good from that
time on and that's available now so it's
on github you can get to it through that
silly URL and it's there it's free and
all of that stuff I think it's an MIT
license so if this is abuse to you
that's great if you want to look at it
and tell us how we got it wrong and how
we can make it better that would be
great too everything that I'm about to
discuss we're going to do the whole
thing in the open step two which we're
working on now is the safe protocol this
is secure JSON over TCP it is an
efficient session protocol it's not a
document retrieval protocol it's not a
ask weight thing it's just sends
messages and messages coming back so
it's it allows for push and allows for
interactive it allows for anyway it's a
very flexible protocol and again it's
all safe and it's all Jason so it's
really nice
step3 will be safe resource management
so that will allow for accessing
resources based on their cryptographic
cache if you want to get out an image or
a script or some other asset instead of
giving it a final name or a locator you
give it the public key or the hash of
the thing that you want to retrieve and
that way we can guarantee that we will
retrieve exactly the thing that you
asked for that you're not going to get
something else that it hasn't been
modified in transition or replaced with
something else it also allows for some
interesting performance possibilities
because it doesn't matter where you get
the thing from anything which matches
that hash is assumed to be the thing
that we asked for so we don't care where
it came from
so that could allow for new sorts of
networking services where somebody could
maybe have a business out of cashing
these things step four is making the
self the helper app so-called safe apps
it will be an HTML free JavaScript based
application delivery system built on
node and cute-cute is an application
system that was developed in Norway as
part of Nokia for a while but now it's
open it's really nice it provides a hard
way of building graphical applications
it can deal with various device formats
and layouts it's it's very elegant so
but we're gonna use it in a slightly
unusual way so we're gonna have node and
we're gonna strip node down so it's just
gonna be running the safe protocol and
providing state management and
application services workers and all
that stuff and then we'll couple it with
acute system how we're going to strip
cute down so it's just doing graphics
it's able to talk to GPU so you can get
very good for performing
and it's just going to be doing the
interactive stuff and then there'll be a
Jason channel connecting them so the
style of developing applications is you
will have an object which you will split
into separate presences and one presence
will run in the cute system where it
will display and interact with the user
and it can send messages to a another
presence that's running in node which is
dealing with local state management and
in business logic and it's then
connected over the network to your
server where there's another presence
that deals with the backend stuff I
think it will be a very nice programming
model it's going to have some very nice
security properties I think it also
compels us to finally partition our
applications correctly one of the
problems with the DOM is because
everything is happening at the same
layer application architecture gets
really confused
you've got widget level stuff and
application level stuff all happening in
the same mix and so by putting this
stuff into separate servers or separate
yeahthere's servers each running with
its own event loop concurrently in
separate threads we're going to get a
much better architecture much higher
performance then step 5 we we take that
out framework and turn it into something
that we can run in a browser and then
try to convince one or more browser
makers to install it as standard
equipment I'm hoping if they do that
they do it in the simplest easiest way
possible meaning they don't try to
rewrite it or change it significantly
that they just take it plug it in and
let it run if we can convince them to do
that that means about a safe application
will run in exactly the same way on
every server on every device how nice
would that be have you anybody yeah so
the goal of the safe project is to
provide safe and effective relationship
management on the web and not to replace
the web to allow the web to continue to
do what it used to do but allow us
another way of doing things which the
web does not adequate
support so the old web was great because
of provided promiscuity it meant that
you could go and connect to anything and
you're probably gonna be ok you might
get shocked and embarrassed but your
machine's not gonna get taken over your
your identities not gonna get stolen
that hasn't always been true but pretty
much the web can do that and that's good
because that allows us to get introduced
to things we used to call it surfing
that you could go from one thing to
another and discover stuff and start
forming relationships unfortunately the
same thing which allows the promiscuity
to work is very bad for dealing with
commitment so that's what the new web is
for you know once I have found my bank I
want to make sure from this point on I'm
talking to my bank and I'm not talking
to anything which pretends to be my bank
and there are still forms of confusion
and mischief that are possible but
they're not going to be able to do
things like steal my bank password and
use it against me because there are no
more passwords anymore all of those
sorts of confusion attacks now become
useless
and because we're now connecting things
forming relationships this should work
better for connecting people as well
right now we have to do we do all sorts
of terrible things but we can do safer
things now we can have committed
relationships between people as well as
between companies so developing anything
which claims to be secure is really hard
you have to ask does it do what it
should and more importantly does it not
do what it shouldn't and anytime you
make claims about the security of
software it's likely that you're going
to be wrong because software is
complicated stuff and anything with any
complexity is difficult to reason about
and so I expect when the safe component
says they're released come out I expect
they're going to not be safe
but I'm hoping that because of the
approach that we're taking making it
simple if making it minimal that
eventually we will converge on to
something that is I think that's the
only thing that works because we've
tried it the other way in that hasn't
you know again we've had browsers for 20
years and we're still patching them we
should be able to get better than that
so um I think because of the extremely
minimal approach that we're taking with
safe I think wolterman we get there
so there's nothing new here there's no
new technology no new discoveries this
is all straightforward stuff it's using
theory which has been around for decades
it's just a minimal application package
for the web inspired by television so
that's the safe project if you'd like to
know more about safe please visit safe
dot place also safe dot space will also
work and that'll just direct you to
github where you can see phase 1 phase 2
I'm not giving any dates because I don't
have to so I'm not gonna tell you when
it's gonna be available so that that's
so PayPal has been extremely generous in
supporting this work
and one of the best things about the way
we're doing this is well I have in mind
a schedule for when this stuff gets done
I haven't told anybody so it and so as a
result I can't get pinned to anything so
nobody can force me to release something
before I think it's ready and so I'm not
gonna release anything until it's ready
and I think that's how we should do
everything and I really do but um most
of us don't get that luxury but I'm
getting this luxury and so I'm not gonna
tell you when it's gonna be done but
because I have a theory of software I
don't think it's a theory I think it's
actually a fact that the development of
good software takes time and anything
you try to do to make it take less time
will make it take more
and the way we deal with the fact that
it didn't get finished properly is that
we ship stuff which is not secure and
and we all seen the consequences of that
so I'm going to tried to do it the other
way we'll see how that works out
so the meantime try that I'll be back
next year I hope until then thank you
