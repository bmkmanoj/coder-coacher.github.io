client now leaving Bonacci activity
which is going to eventually end up
using the fib lip but we want to make it
slightly more interesting for example we
want to make the UI allow us to select
the algorithm specify the n that we want
to get through Bonacci off and then you
know initiate some click some button for
example get the result
so the luggage start off by looking at
our layout which is right here and here
is our main door XML and here's a
strings of XML which defines its value
like for example here's the hello world
little string which will for example
change into I don't know get your fee
Fibonacci numbers here and so I don't
know maybe it'll capitalize this and so
now that I've you know change the string
if I go to the main dot XML you'll see
that's what that shows up and I want to
make it slightly nicer I can say okay
I'm gonna change its gravity to be
centered so gravity center okay so now
it's centered and maybe I don't know I
can also change the text size and we'll
just particle it here something like I
don't know 25 SPS and so now we have the
initial title so next what we want to do
is add some sort of an edit button sorry
form widgets that will the user will be
able to you know type in their their
number into now of course I always keep
forgetting where the Edit buttons are so
for some reason they're not under the
form widgets I was going to assume that
they're gonna be under here
so I just want to find for example this
one the Troezen the reason why I chose
that one is because I like number four
to now I just want something that only
takes in numbers so you'll see that
basically what happened is that this
became an edit text that
has the input type of number I can ask
assign this some sort of an ID this
would be necessary later on so I can
actually know what the end was so I
don't know maybe I'm going to call it
input that's it I don't have to get much
fancier than that that's that's the the
word user is going to type in the number
the next one is going to be some sort of
a maybe a radio group I want the user to
be able to select from different options
so I'm actually going to go back to over
here for widgets and here is a radio
button but of course I want to somehow
wrap these inside of a radio group which
I can never really quite find I'm not
sure where they keep them anyway so I
guess I'll just wrap it up myself
so here I'll actually just drop to the
XML you'll see that I have a radio
button that for example the text for the
radio button could speak say something
like this is going to be the strings of
fib
jay-ar that's the the first one that we
have here is an option which of course
doesn't exist and this is going to be
the radio we're going to call this for
example fib
jay-ar so that we know later on what the
user has actually selected or maybe just
for for fun because we're going to use
lowercase let's call this type fib JR
okay so I'm going to click on save this
is going to complain I'm going to go and
say okay fix it by going and saying
quick fix or command one extract the
another style I don't know why it's
picking a style that's a LOD it's
supposed to say extract text oh well so
I guess I'm going to go over here and in
my strings and duplicate one of these so
on my Mac can do command shift or
command option down to duplicate this
line and say this is going to be you
know kbjr you might as well go and
define the other ones these are going to
be the different titles the user is
going to be able to select so this is
the J
I the NR a oops n R and n I so just to
change these as well and I and our
whoops I guess I should really look at
what I'm typing and and I done so now
that I've defined these I can go back
here just click on save
this should whoops no wonder this didn't
work supposed to be a string not of
strings okay so now what I'll do is I'll
actually wrap all of these inside of I'm
going to say all of this we don't have
the other ones yet radio group and so
inside of the radio group I'm going to
have a lot of these radio buttons so now
I want to be able to select the or know
what was the selection which radio
button was selected so the way I'm going
to do this I'm going to basically assign
this sort of radio group sort of an ID
so for example ID oops
ID equals maybe I'll call it you know
type of course you need to go and have
it be created
so plus ID and I'm going to change the
default orientation because I believe I
default it goes vertically so I'm going
to change orientation to be horizontal
that the things should get the job done
and so otherwise I gets to layout with
wise I'm going to have it match the
parents so with or layout with is match
parent I'm using control space just for
auto completion and layout layout height
height is wrap content right so only use
as much space as necessary on this radio
button itself I gave it each boy this
button an ID I gave it some height I
actually want the I guess the height to
be
I guess match parent when the width
would mix make sense and on the height
so let's go and say match parent and
then on the height I can probably leave
it as as wrap content of course because
these are going to be greedy I need to
also add the androids whoops a layout
weight so weight of something like let's
say one so that they're all exactly the
same I believe this should be it
so now what I need to do is just
duplicate this four times or three more
times so I now have 4 radio buttons this
one is going to be the FIB JR will make
this bfj I this could be of course this
is going to say ji as well which is the
one we created previously this is going
to say NR this is going to say and are
again and finally we will have a version
that is ni for native iterative and and
I over here so that's it this is where
we are at the moment so we basically
have the title we have the number the
user is going to type and then we have
the four different radio buttons that's
what we've accomplished we only need two
more things we I want to have a button
the user is going to be able to click on
so let's say a button goes right here
and this button is gonna have maybe I
don't know we can call it say ID of
button for lack better better term width
we could have it be take up you know
match parent whoops I don't know what I
pressed so let's go back let's go back
here so match parent width is the same
and then the text I just don't like to
hard-code tasting so so I'm going to say
string slash add a button for the lack
of again better better or actually I
should say output because the other one
was no let's just call it button next
one is going to be able to
oh yeah so this isn't work so let's see
if this allows you to create a string
resource it does I'm just going to call
it get feeble Fibonacci get your
notching result something like that and
so now that we have that let's see what
this looks like that's pretty good
finally we need some sort of a text area
where we'll be able to you know drop the
the final result into so the here's a
text view maybe we'll give it we'll call
this the output that's where we're going
to write the result into so output and
we're going to have the width and the
height basically be both match parent so
take up the rest of the space and
there's not going to be any sort of text
we should probably just get rid of the
text that said let's actually just see
where it's going to look look like it's
going to sit right here I do want that
maybe Center this so for example Android
oops
Android's gravity whoops
Android : gravity we could say Center
like that and that should probably be it
I guess one on one one more last thing
is we can go and give it some sort of
text size to make it look a little
bigger and just so that it's easier to
see so something like I don't know 20 s
B would be probably good enough and now
we'd really don't need any sort of text
this is going to be the output of our
program so here we are I believe we have
the entire UI design so this is the
input this is a selection algorithm
here's the button and here's the output
now the next step is for us to go and
actually implement that people
