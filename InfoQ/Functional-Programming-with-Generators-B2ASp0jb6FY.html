of you guys a pair of generators sweet
alright we're all on the same page so
generators are this incredible new
feature that's being released in Equus
crypt 6 up until they were released some
of you may be familiar with node fibers
and for a couple of reasons I personally
feel that generators are a much better
solution for constructing co-routines
now what's really interesting is a
couple of months ago I was doing some
research on generators and I found that
there was no information out there I
mean there's a few little bits on how to
do the very very basics but I could I
was very very flustered trying to find
any practical applications so I did a
lot of soul searching and you know
experimental coding in order to come up
with the stuff that I'm about to present
to you guys so first of all of course
you need note 11 and before I go any
further let me just go through the
evolution of concurrency real quick
first you know we're all familiar with
this it's simple as fast unfortunately
you know you get callback hell I've seen
to get real bad that's the mountain of
wool from chrono trigger so promises are
really great it's a monad that allows us
to return something from an asynchronous
function that represents the reification
of that final computation and we can
compose these things pretty well now
that original code becomes this I mean
it's much simpler it flows a lot better
and if we have more and more of these
things as long as the asynchronous
functions all return promises we can
compose them way easier than you could
if you had to do everything callbacks
tile of course there's a limitation with
any promises you still have to rely on a
whole new call staff being generated so
every time a function is called what
ends up happening is you can recurse it
or you can go into it and the limitation
of promises is you can never return to
the original call stack so if you assign
variable is something you basically have
to create a callback function that has a
lexical reference to the containing
object so what's awesome with generators
and I'll get to how they're used in
co-routine soon but to give a brief
overview they're basically a function
with an eternal state for tracking words
in the execution so it's basically a
restartable function so how do you use
it you call it right so there's this
whole idea of a generator the generator
itself and an instance of that generator
now as you can see from my example you
have the generator which is listed right
here and you've defined it and
underneath you see I have VAR gen equals
gen and I'm calling it and much like an
object orientation you're creating an
instance of that generator now when I
call next what it does is it returns an
object that has both a value and a piece
of information that tells me if I can
continue calling next on it and that
value happens to be whatever's on the
right hand side of that yield so in this
case Val becomes equal to 6 now what's
really cool is when I restart that
generator by calling next on it I can
choose what comes out of that yield on
the left-hand side so that yield of all
right that's what's returned from next
it contains a value and it contains done
so if you are going through a generator
and the done returns true then that
means that you can't call it any more so
this is about as far as I managed to get
from my research reading tutorials on
the internet and I was really confused
like you know teacher Holloway chuck is
producing these incredible co-routine
libraries of it so I spent some time
really researching on this and I found
that the two major uses for this
particular object are as lazy evaluation
and co-routines
now lazy evaluation is a little out of
scope and I'm going to be focusing on
some current currents and a curry team
is a stack of executing code that runs
independently of the main thread and one
of the things that's really awesome
about generators is generators give us
to produce co-routines now that's not to
say you couldn't do it before using
fibers and relied on see extensions and
you could only use them on node now that
this is a part of that gonna script six
we're going to be able to write
co-routines right on the browser which
will make things a lot simpler I mean I
don't know about you guys but most of
the code that I've worked with with
asynchronous stuff is I am doing one
asynchronous thing and then I use the
value from that in order to put that in
the argument for another asynchronous
function so it kind of makes sense to
make them blocking but in node
everything is non-blocking by default
when it comes to i/o so in this case you
get a kind of a fine grain control when
it makes sense so how do you use the
generators of core team so this is
basically the pseudocode bones of a
co-routine module you initiate the
generator and then you take the you get
the first yield of lot of it now here's
what's really interesting while the
yield Abul is not done then you get a
new yield a bailout of it while taking
injecting back in the original yield
goals value and then when you're finally
done you return the final value of that
yield Imola so let's do this recursively
were you defining a next write and it
takes a generator an instantiated
generator a yield a bowl and a callback
and we see if the yield of all is not
done then assuming the yield of a value
is a promise so this is a really really
really simplified case an actual
co-routine function in practice would be
a lot bigger and take care of a lot of
edge cases but the basic guts are you
wait to let you liberal resolves at
which point you call next again on that
generator and you pass in the next of
that which gives you a new deal double
so it's kind of a recursive loop so now
you just have to kick started so we
defined Co and that function just takes
a instance or a a generator and as you
can see return a function that takes a
callback that will be given the final
value of that generator and this is
basically how most co-routines work if
you create a generator and you
the co-routine you can heal the promise
you can heal the thunk you can yield a
standard callback style note function
and you put in the code routine and it
will just take care of making sure that
it blocks when it hits the yield waits
until that values resolved and then
restarts it and what's great about that
is now you have a synchronous flow
control when it makes sense so for the
real world I would recommend using Coe
by 2g Holloway Chuck and it essentially
is a much better festive read version of
what I just showed you guys now here we
get to the really interesting stuff this
is the stuff that you probably haven't
seen before so I realized while building
out this basic function that generators
are first-class just like functions in
fact you can write functions that return
generators you can have a generator that
takes a generator and does something
with it and returns a new generator so I
want to make it really really simple
because I realized that this stuff was
kind of complex when you get the rules
but the rules themselves are very very
they just kind of fit together so how do
we create a function that merges two
generators together for instance Khoa
really awesome framework allows you to
have an app not used and you put in
generators and each generator flows into
the next one so first version as a
compose how do you compose these two
functions or two generators
so this compose takes two functions and
it basically returns a function that
takes a value that puts it into the
original a and then it takes whatever's
returned from that a inputs into B we
can apply the same idea for a joint
which is the code routine the generators
version of that so as you can see we
take a generator one in a generator two
and returning a new generator and then
inside we're returning a yield and what
we're doing is we're instantiating the
generator and we're passing as the
initial value the second generator
and if you take the generator itself
that whole thing and you put in a curry
team it will run through them and sync
with each other so the first value will
go through it'll yield and next is given
to the second generator so you can yield
into that in order to go into the second
part of the flow
oh so the reason I put it this in there
is when you do call you have to have
this and in this particular case I
wanted to make sure that if I were to
take that generator outside of it and
inject some context into it that that
context would be transferred through so
this could be anything basically by
default if you don't give any explicit
stuff it's going to be the global object
so if a generator is yielded it will
instantiate the generator and run it if
there's nothing left to yield it will
then return the value to the original
generator oh and if the trainer yields
to the generator the same rules apply so
it's very recursive in its way of
working if you want to compose three or
more generators it's complicated but and
I will cover this eventually but first
you know how many of you guys like
practical examples so I could go
straight into that but it won't make
much sense so I'm gonna introduce koa
and koa is a web framework that that's
based around the use of generators it's
really nice
you have full middleware so you can go
down and back up the stack due to the
fact that all returns have returned up
this flow in Express you're pretty much
stuck in a continuation passing style
where it just goes down so the handlers
are generators and the returns come up
the stack so you can write your async
code as if it's synchronous if you yield
a promise inside one of these kuru teens
then it will block right there until
that asynchronous event is resolved and
then restart it which is a lot simpler
than a similar case in express where you
would have safer response and in there
you have the next and you wait until
some event comes in on response for
instance data in order to run these
asynchronous in order to get the value
from an asynchronous event
so and to give an example you know you
have our co-equals require co-op and
then you pass in a function and you see
that next and that next is the second
one over here app data use function next
return all the world so it returns full
of world and then this stop body becomes
assigned hollow world so let's do a
basic to do app we want to post it to do
get back a list of to do's and delete it
to do so the modules that I use our Co
body Co a route and in Co is static so
let's start at ik files there's some
really nice middleware that they've
already written for it so these two
lines basically allow you to serve up a
public directory now if I have a router
I use color out and you see AB dot use
router get to dues it's all pretty
simple stuff all this does is make sure
that if you are trying to access slash
news that we definitely serve up this
generator and same idea with post and
then finally we can listen to it
generators
so it's bad basic authentication
creating a user and route pass and how
would this look like in middleware right
so ideally you know if you guys are
feeling with Express you have multiple
functions and you can lay them next to
each other so you'd have the auth
middleware and then you know your
handler but that doesn't work
Khoa only takes one middleware at a time
and I was thinking to myself a lot kind
of sucks
I would really would really like the
fact that an Express I can just kind of
put more than one function right next to
each other and it kind of flows and then
eventually got drops down to wherever
the next part is so I thought to myself
how can I make that possible now that I
figured out how to compose two
generators because if you compose to
those generators using that join it
works but I want to make a lot easier
for people to take just any two or three
or four or more arbitrary generators and
mash them up into a single generator
that I can pop right in so I'm just
using Shen and it's a library that I
wrote and it encapsulates does
everything that I've learned as far as
how to quickly put together generators
it's a toolbox for composing them and I
think that with this plus KOA you get a
really really nice framework for
composing your generators as middleware
as easily or maybe even easier than when
you work with Express and the best part
is a lot of what you know and Express as
a result applies so the API is that
you'll use the most are cascade and
branch dispatch cascade is basically
joined but it takes one or more and
branch and dispatch there are two
different functions branch takes three
generators the first generator is passed
to references to the second and the
third generator and based on whatever
conditional logic you want you can
choose which one to yield to and I chose
to keep the interface to these really
really simple so that people could build
on top of these things
so Sheng cascade you see I have a
function here next and then I console
dot log and then inside I'm yielding
next so what is next next is literally
the function I put in right afterwards
so if I return foo foo gets returned to
the console or log
it prints it out and branch similar idea
so branch takes that function path one
path to and I can deal to either the
path one or path to in order to get what
I want
dispatch is he forming more complicated
situations let's say I have twenty
different potential paths that I want to
take from a single area it's almost like
a map if you were to take an object and
you fill that object up with different
functions and then each one is a key
value and in the original function you
based on some value in that string you
can delegate it to one of these
different objects now you can do the
same thing with a co-routine flow so
with that in mind we've come back to
original problem how do we make that
middleware work well we can create this
pass or fail middleware and this is an
object and it says pass and fail and as
you can see if it passes it yields to
the next one what that next one depends
on where you pop it in
now fail you know obviously you want to
send down a 400 you want to say hey it's
not working and you want to return new
error now how can we hook this in well
first of all we have to write any new
function called authorize and we see if
blah is undefined as in we don't find
the user then we or yeah then we yield
to the pass and otherwise we go for the
fail so I can construct a whole
middleware using author middleware Shen
dot dispatch authorized pass or fail so
as you can see authorizes the first pass
function and then pass is pass and fail
is fail so what is that next become well
it depends where you want to inject it
in so I can take Shen dot cascade and I
can nest them together so all the
functions in Shen are designed so that
you can compose any of them in an
arbitrary nesting fashion so I can take
a cascade and I can take another cascade
and yo dawg i heard you like cascade so
I'd put a cascade in your cascade in
your cascade also there's a Shen in
there alright branch in there but you
get the idea
so now you have a Shen branch you have a
generator hole here that returns a
generator that generator then gets fused
with two other generators and then I
take that generator and I fused it with
two other generators all together and
the best part is these could be pulled
in from completely different modules
that don't necessarily know about each
other and now they're interoperating
with each other so can we just cascade
together authorization yes we can
so now what we can do is we just pop
right in there Sheng cascade middleware
and then our actual handler and now you
have an actual authorization system
really really simple and it only took me
three lines to actually hook it into the
system so if I want to remove it I can
just delete that whole part for testing
purposes if I want to so I want to give
a special thanks to kitchen logistics
it's where I work we're currently
working on our around and the super-busy
hack reactor as well because if it
weren't for them I wouldn't be in this
awesome position to giving an amazing
talk to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
