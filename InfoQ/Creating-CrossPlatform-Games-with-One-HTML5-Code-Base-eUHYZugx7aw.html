I'm Tyler Smith I am the lead game
developer and game developer evangelist
at at moby we specialize in porting one
code base of HTML html5 to multiple
platforms through our build system and
we also have an integrated development
environment for free to use for
developers this specific talk is going
to be talking discussing a lot about
creating cross platform games with one
html5 code base everyone knows html5 is
a buzzword and we all know it's awesome
but one of the main things is that it's
very versatile and the fact that when
you run it on one device that has a
browser or something to parse you know
HTML we can run on anything that can
parse HTML so this is a talk that's
really going to go over the process that
you should think before you create your
html5 game the different ideas that you
should really have in your mind as you
decide you know what gay mentioned to
use and I'm gonna use a lot of stuff
from a game that I was the lead game
developer on called boom town which was
a game that was created with one html5
code base and we deployed it to seven
platforms up all using the same code
base so I'm gonna be using a lot of
things that I learned from that
development process hopefully you guys
can get something from it so it's not as
rough and you don't has many caches that
that we did in our development real
quick overview first we're gonna decide
what game engine to use that's huge I'm
gonna assume that you already have your
game idea what do you want it to be you
know either a puzzle game or side
scroller and we're just gonna go into
the kind of thought process before you
start developing encoding deciding the
game engine is huge I'm gonna go through
a bunch of different reasons why but
that is a really big one optimizing the
mobile performance I'm sure everyone
here has heard mark zuckerberg mark
zuckerberg comment about html5 and his
performance on mobile regardless if you
heard the sentence before and after that
that stole was a big blow to html5 i'm
gonna show you a bunch of different
coding techniques that you can use to
actually get like 10 to 15 frames per
second up just by doing really cool
different things with software rendering
and GPU rendering what to look for
before we decide to develop for a
platform wanting to do android and iOS
is great but there's a lot of things you
have to come
sitter before you do it and especially
if they'll influence what game engine
you get though influence how you develop
your game and the touch controls and
everything that will go and in depth on
that browsers versus hybrid app
deployment because it's html5 you could
just run it in the mobile browser and
all of these devices there's pros and
cons to both I'll go through that I try
to be as objective as I can my company
does do hybrid app development so I
might be a little bit more swaying
towards that but i'll try to show you
the different things you should look for
while developing your game side which
way you want to deploy accelerating your
html5 game to look native there's a
bunch of third-party stopgaps right now
that take your game that might be
running at five frames per second and
gets you up to 25 frames per second way
to go talk a little bit about that the
development process and if it's gonna be
right for your game packaging and
deploying your game again if you're
doing a hybrid native deployment there's
a bunch of different ways that you can
do it a bunch of different build systems
right now and I'll go through all the
different techniques you can do that
with so first game engines how do you
decide first there well there's a giant
list of games here that I just exited
out over you open that window on github
if you the presentation will be up for
everyone to get later but you can see
that there's tons of html5 game engines
right now so your choices are pretty
widened so there's a couple things you
want to keep in mind and look for as you
are picking your game engine first thing
you need to know is does it support the
needed functions again you should have
your game idea so was your game going to
need collision detection or is it a
top-down puzzle game and you don't need
collision detection or you get a need
level creator do you want something to
create your level or you find with
writing into canvas element all the
different entities and where they're
going to be placed are you two need a
sprite animator do you want to make your
own or get to do some weird things with
your game that you want to change the
sprite animation so it multiplayer is a
huge one does it have socket i/o nodejs
input are you going for multiplayer are
you not these are all big deciding
factors on what game edge and you get
and a lot of people again like to either
make their own sprite animators or make
sure the game engine does it I
personally like the game engine to do
all the heavy lifting is all I have to
think about is tying into it and making
my game but a lot of people like dig in
so it's really up against your personal
preference one of them
biggest things I think 4d mention and
deciding which one you want to use is is
it maintained I mean you saw that giant
list of github of all the you know
different html5 game engines a lot of
people make game in my html5 game
engines and they go on to different
projects and don't maintain it anymore
and the last thing you want is a game
that you have half completed and where
the person who made the game engine
doesn't work on it anymore and it breaks
and then you have a half completed game
based on a platform that doesn't work
anymore and there's no one to help you
with so that's one thing to look for
forums always great is there a community
based around that you know engine
typically a bigger community means it's
going to have a lot more long-lasting
power I know construct 2 has a great
community impact Jas has a great
community and I think those are two of
the big ones are going to stay but
there's something to look for is is how
big is there going to be support not
just from the person who created it but
from other people using it as well
debugging tools that's kind of like a
cherry on top I know in pic Jas has a
great debugging tool it tells you a
bunch of things like it shows you the
collision boxes shows you the different
velocities and how fast they're going
shows you the frame rate it shows you a
bunch of performance layout in Peaks
when it gets too high when there's too
many entities so you can see where the
problem problems that you're having in
the game again that's a cherry on top
it's not something that you might want
to base your whole decision of your game
engine on but that is something if you
do like to have a really well performing
game and to get all the knowledge what's
happening in there that that's something
to look for cost I put it on here but as
this point most html5 given html5 game
engines are free and if they're not free
they're about under a hundred dollars
hundred dollars or less so that might be
a factor if you're an indie game
developer on the side and you just can't
afford it so definitely look into see if
it's cost or not but typically it's got
to be pretty cheap and you might want to
just bite the bullet and pay the amount
of money if you think it's a good game
engine for you personally I think it
doesn't run well mobile is one of the
biggest things there's a lot of great
game engines out there html5 game
engines but if they're 64 Meg's big it's
going to be problematic on mobile
especially if you do it through the
browser the browser is gonna have to
download all the 64 bags before anything
happens for the user so the users gonna
have a horrible experience it's not
governmental mobile and you just base
your whole game on a framework that's
not gonna work for you
so if you're trying to get with I'm
assuming that you're trying to get to
all platforms does it work well on
mobile is one of the big key items does
the game engine allow pre-rendering the
next slide I'll talk a little bit more
what pre-rendering is typically it's
another mobile performance issue it's a
way to make repeating background images
render a lot faster and I'll get into
that next slide how well does it scale
on different devices again since this is
one code base on multiple platforms you
have to plan ahead for desktop for iOS
on android kindle fire all the different
screen resolutions so if a game engine
has a problem with scaling to different
screen resolutions you're gonna have a
problem with that game engine to get it
to different devices it's something to
look for typically you can find that if
they do have a forums or just doing a
little bit of research putting it on a
device seen how well it does on the
android and iOS it doesn't have built-in
device detection that's kind of another
cherry on top there's a lot of
third-party api's you can use to do that
but I no impact Jes has a way that you
can get into the iphone using a you can
sense if it's an iPhone an iPad and then
rendering differently that way is also
with Android so that's just something to
think about doesn't support touch input
inputs that is a pretty big one again
for mobile if you're trying to get there
if it's not mobile ready it's probably
going to be problematic when you try to
get it on mobile and touch inputs you
can either work around it some have you
know onmousedown in detection such as
that but it might not be a hundred
percent native feeling to the user since
it's still kind of a hack around so you
really want to make sure that it's ready
for mobile and its ports touch inputs
and how big is the engine file size
again if it's 64 Meg's you're gonna have
a big problem trying to do it through
the browser or even on a hybrid app it's
still gonna have to render it to the
webview all right so this is a
pre-rendering background this is a demo
game from impact j/s game engine I liked
it because it was a really easy way to
show what pre-rendering really is
basically instead of drawing a pixel all
the way across the whole background
every time you have a draw call
pre-rendering draws a separate canvas
element and then it saves that as a new
image on the html5 context and then for
software rendering that the biggest
problem is is
for performance on mobile the biggest
problem is software rendering so instead
of doing a thousand software rendering
calls you only do about nine or ten so
that really helps performance I'll take
you anywhere from two frames per second
to 20 frames per second if your game is
really intensive on the background you
do typically need a repeating background
to get that performance bump but
typically if there's a blue sky if
there's something extra that you can do
to help pre-render that will help your
performance on mobile a lot and that's
an example of when it's being
pre-rendered you can see it's a
repeating pattern I show that it is a
pattern that's repeating but if it's
blue or something like that unbeknownst
to the user it will look really really
smooth and it will actually render a lot
faster for you guys manage draw calls I
had the unfortunate task of making an
html5 game work on a new color which was
not fun as a new color i think is
running 1.9 at least it was at the time
so we had a game jelly blocks it used to
be a popular web game i'm not sure if
anyone knows what jelly blocks is it's
sort of like the jeweled if you get
three next to each other they pop and
the whole thing comes down and we were
having extreme problems with latency and
stacking of touch events so if the user
would click here and drag it all the way
to here then the element would move
would be about a two-second delay
because we're trying to do html5 on
android 1.9 so we had no choice we had
to make it work so to get around that we
realized every time we do withdrawal
call we're drawing everything we're
drawing the key we're drawing the X the
sound we're drawing the whole you know
screenshot when you click down we know
that you're clicking this element and
the only thing that really needs to be
animated is a vertical and a horizontal
axis so we actually went into the game
engine and we tweaked it a little bit to
not do any draw calls or any updates
except for that role in that column and
we saw about a 15 frames per second
increase it was still a little laggy
when you clicked here to here but
instead of taking two seconds it was
about point two seconds somewhere around
there to the point where it looked a
little sluggish to the user but it was
still a usability and the user didn't
understand that I was html5 and it
wasn't native so that's something that
you should really look at if you're
having a lot of problems with
performance on mobile is there a way
that you can slow down draw calls like I
said software rendering is the big
gets inhibitor of performance on mobile
so the less you can draw two with
software to the screen the better so
that's something to look for if you are
having mobile performance problems we
also had a for boomtown we were told
that the make it has to be 15 mags and
when we were completely done the game we
had everything finished it was 26 so we
said crap and we went back to the
drawing board and we said okay so how
can we make this giant thing smaller the
reason why we wanted 15 Meg's one it can
be downloaded over not Wi-Fi on an
iPhone anything over 15 Meg's at the
time I think it had to be downloaded
over Wi-Fi I think that since been
pushed up to 40 Meg's I'm not under
censure and the second one again the
bigger your bundle is the bigger html5
game is the longer it's going to take
the load and that's that load time was
it was about four seconds for us and
that was too much so we needed to we
needed to slim it down we needed to hit
15 mix so the first thing we did is we
had a four minute mp3 looping background
track so we took that out um without it
was a huge about six Meg's we took tout
and then we dynamically cashed it based
on the device because if you are
developing cross-platform we developed
for the Mozilla App Store and that does
not support mp3's so the way that we
dynamically cashed it on device I have
some pseudocode this doesn't really mean
anything but if its mobile then at the
time all mobile it's until boot to gecko
which I'm not a hundred percent sure if
that will support mp3 format but pretty
much all mobile support mp3 format and
if not find out the browser name and
load up a noob file and if not we'll be
load up in mp3 so there's a way since
your base has to be able to be ployed on
all platforms the same exact way there's
going to be a lot of if-else statements
based on what what platform you're on
and this is just an example of how you
would dynamically load a sound file for
the background the other thing we did is
we use JPEGs instead of PNG's and our
graphics department hated us because we
had this awesome looking cool lil the
edges of burnt it's really awesome and
then we said no it has to be boxes so
that it did make a mad other than fights
with your graphics department so we we
took this this is a cool burnt edges and
you see the cool fades and everything
and I have to agree it looks better but
it still gets the job done and as an
engine
I think that's all that matters we we
saved a lot of space to we went from 232
kilobytes on this image to 21.7 so when
we reach ain't rearranged our whole UI
still leaving some PNG's in there but
all the ones that are non important all
the ones that are you know you I that
could be dumbed down a little bit if you
get there then you can save a lot of a
space a lot of Meg's I think we saved
about 10 megs alone by changing
everything from PNG's or have the UI
from PNG's to JPEGs yeah this slides in
here just as a sort of a reminder it's
not really that important but if your
game needs native functions remember
that from the beginning it helps to let
you know what game engine need and how
you got to deploy native functions would
be accelerometer if you have a Plinko
type game and you want to be able to
accelerometer or you know a racing game
Ian with the car to be based off of
movement of the device geolocation if
you have some sort of mafia wars thing
that you want someone to go to a certain
location to get you know a cache of
money or something along those lines
that's something to think about again
when you're when you're developing your
game camera if this may be some sort of
augmented reality aspect to your game
you need to know if you're going to need
that native function because I will
determine what you use to deploy context
not hun percent sure i'll use them maybe
you just take them all and put them on a
database somewhere i don't really know
but if you want to use contacts it's
something to think about and then
research supported platforms this this
is the biggest thing that we did before
we made our game we decided we were
going to research everything before we
did it and we we got a bunch of just
blank divs and a bunch of other daves on
top of it positioning them certain ways
to try to see if we can't get the screen
to fit on all the different devices
because again the aspect ratios are
weird but the first thing you need to
think about is that where the control is
going to be placement on screen if
you're on a desktop you're going to have
a mouse and a keyboard that's great so
you have XY maybe WASD to move him but
then when you move it over to a touch
device you have to think how is that
going to play out I was like wait a good
position on the screen you have to make
sure that when you do position it on the
screen it's dynamic absolute position
you know bottom 0 because if you
position it 655 pixels from the top and
relative
when you have a smaller screen size
you've got to cut off the touch input in
your users aren't gonna be able to play
your game so controls are a really big
thing to think about how are your
controls in the game idea you have got
to translate between each device and
each usability to the point where I can
play on facebook and I can play on my
iOS device and so yeah I just played the
same game you don't want it to be
intrusive and completely different you
want to try to keep the same feeling
because typically if users like your
game we've seen a lot of people play
boom town on a bunch of multiple devices
which we encourage so that that's
something to look at and will you need
multi-touch is another thing right now
Android webview doesn't support
multitouch so if you do it through the
browser and you have a jump and run game
you're going to have a problem so that
you have to keep these things in mind
what platform am I going for can you
develop for android if you have a
multi-touch game if not you could have
to go hyper adapt alone or something
like that so definitely something to
think about an html5 support like when
we developed for the nook where I was
running Android 1.9 we knew the support
was bad but we have to do it so it a
thing that you have to do or that you
can do is look at the canvas tag that's
the main thing most html5 games use the
canvas tag relentlessly because that's
the coolest thing from html5 it's pretty
much the golden egg so does it support
it that's number one otherwise you're
not going to have a good time on that
platform audio tag I'm assuming everyone
here understands html5 audio and the
problems that come with it I don't have
to go into that you just get one
handshake it's bad that's pretty much
how you can do it's bad but this is
supported that's still good to know if
you're trying to go through the browser
you still need to know doesn't support
html5 audio tag audio is extremely
immersive when it comes to gaming if you
don't have a gunshot when you shoot a
gun it loses like half of the coolness
of it so that will it support audio and
just typical html5 performance run a
couple performance tests on that device
to see if it's willing to do what you
want that game engine do when you want
your game to do just through maybe
spawning a bunch of entities on a screen
at once and seeing what the performance
is like and this is the worst one screen
with a knife thank you to all of the
Android or thanks to all of the Android
devices and all of the new resolutions
of the iphone
there's a ton of different screen widths
and Heights and then you have to factor
in facebook gaming chrome store gaming
and just basic desktop on the web gaming
so there's a lot of differences between
width and height than all those
different devices and you really need to
research the platform before you go for
it I'll get into that right now why
first thing that we've noticed is people
who are developing html5 hybrid apps go
for iOS first it's just what they do and
then they make an android version that's
well that's just what what people have
been doing so when it comes to a
portrait game it's not as bad since you
can see we on an iPad we have a 43 ratio
so when you have an iPhone or you going
to really have is a couple pixels to
play with maybe put an ad in there maybe
just put some bleeding background image
so that no one can really tell it looks
like some ambience on it and we get to
Android again you're adding space so
adding space isn't too troublesome that
I would recommend maybe because the
android doesn't make too much money put
an ad in in that extra space just don't
leave a black then people can tell that
you're you'll up to black and supposed
to be something there landscape is where
it gets really awesome because if you
develop for an iPad you're going to have
almost a half of the screen on an
Android device because it's ratio is 74
so that is a huge huge factor when it
comes to developing html5 games at a
cross-platform are you going to develop
for android and iOS with one single code
base because there is a huge gap here
even from the ipad to the iphone you can
see this giant chunk of gaps so that's
something to think about before you
develop and it's definitely something
you need to know on the platforms that
you're developing for what is their
screen width and height ratio the way
that we tested this for boomtown is
again we took all those html5 or we took
all of the divs and we just put blank
divs and we knew the positioning of them
and we had a readout and we said okay so
if i put a floating 500 x 500 x where
does it show up on this device where's
the show up on this device ok so we need
to make it smaller we need to float in
the middle and we went through a bunch
of different processes and this is this
is what we ended up with so at the top
you can see that's iPad we got the cool
cowboy hat we got horns we got sunset
it's a really nice background some
ambience got that whole barrel in there
see the cactus is nice it's a nice game
nice looking game but when you get down
to this Android you can still see the
whole game board you still see
leaderboards music everything that you
need to functionally play the game is
still there so we made sure that when it
floats in the middle on the smallest
device screen ratio it still works and
that was one of the big things and you
can see down here on the iphone cuts off
the cowboy hat a little a little bit of
the tip of the bullhorn but users don't
typically notice that when this is cut
off halfway they just assume that barrel
supposed to be cut off halfway because
it's cut off halfway so too then that
makes sense when they played on iphone
they might go oh whatever we never had
any complaint of that but that's one way
to get around the device problem is
float your game in the middle again
that's not that's not going to work for
everyone another way is if you have a
top-down shooter or if you have a jump
and jump and run they typically have a
camera following the user so if you make
sure that that camera is dynamic and the
way that it follows the main player it's
going to help you when you get it all on
these different devices instead of
making the stagnant 500 x 500 or any
ratio all right so this is a hybrid app
versus browser deployment for iOS
specifically and I had to cut them up
because they're different um again I'm
gonna be does everyone know what a
hybrid app deployment is we've got I got
to head not to know no nose so I'm going
to keep going first thing when you
develop for for iOS and you use a hybrid
app you're going to be making money you
can definitely sell it in the app store
when when you compile it or you can do
in at purchasing because it's a hybrid
app it's it's able to tap into that
native API of purchasing depending on
how you deploy it but when you're in a
browser you're not going to be able to
do that it's very intrusive to try to
get someone to buy something through a
browser that you might get us you might
get some payments but you're going to
have a lot of friction through it so and
something to think if you're doing this
for purely fun you just want to have a
browser game that's one way if you
really want to make this a business you
might want to go into to an appt a
native app but it's completely up to the
developer it's just the different things
form the one thing that I really like
because I'm when you make an html5 game
I want you to have the most native
experience i can give you on every
platform i want you to not know i used
html5 like a ninja html5 ninja you don't
know them they're one of the things I
really love about hybrid app deployment
is you have Navy native functionality
through JavaScript API is for facebook
and twitter
and since everyone loves socializing
their games you can give them more coins
you can do anything about that if you're
on a browser and you hit facebook it's
going to pop you to a new window you
have to play it it in you have hit login
then you have to allow and then you have
to go back close the window out and go
into the other window if you use a
native API you get a slot you just pops
over to Facebook pops you back and
you're done it just posted for you so
the usability of it and and the native
feel of it is a lot is a lot more
stronger than when you do it through a
browser you get more screen space unless
the user saves it to the advice and then
they get the full screen which typically
users don't do for for browser games you
get more springe case when you go for a
hybrid app so that's another thing I'm
going to think about and locking
orientation it's a killer on a game
engine when you go from portrait to
landscape and then back to portrait so
if someone's playing on their bed and
they accidentally flip it and flip it
back in a browser game there's no way to
lock that down so you're going to have a
big problem with lag and then it's going
to be stacking and the user interface is
probably going to blow up and then
you're the person's going to delete the
game and never go back so that that's
one thing that's really important if you
require it to be in a certain
orientation which games typically do you
might think about hybrid deployment
there's no download time whenever you go
through a browser and you see you
download html5 game like i said you has
to download it all and then parse it to
the screen there's no download time when
you're on iOS you have to download it
from the store yes but then all the
files are locally on that device when
you bring it up it just parse it right
there just have to pull down from the
web and then you're ready to go so
there's there's a little bit of
advantage to that and then you have
access to hardware acceleration again
I'll get into that a little bit later
but you you can use third-party hardware
accelerators that get your game from
maybe 10 frames per second 240 frames
per second and if you really want that
native feel that might be something you
really need to do and internets not
required I beat up the browser a lot in
this slideshow so I want to I want to do
a couple things of why the browser is
better than the hybrid number one it has
nitro jas and iOS so the browser when
you when you deploy through the browser
in iOS you're going to have a lot faster
JavaScript parsing because you have the
javascriptcore there in the Nitra jess
the other is i try to remember these two
there's another one but I
I just can't for the life of me remember
it oh yeah and native sound again html5
audio is horrible when you do in a
hybrid app is horrible now it will get
better but when you do a hybrid app
native sound is definitely a plus you
can have polyphonic sounds you have
multi-channel sounds because you're
going through open Al and that it has a
lot more capability than through just a
web view and audio tag now we can do
android there's no multi-touch in the
android browser which is a problem again
if you're doing a jump and run there's
fragmented web views HTC likes to go in
and just make their web view a little
bit cooler by doing things I have no
idea but a break stuff and two other
Android companies do that hardware
manufacturers like to make that Android
version there's so when you're going to
different androids you're gonna have
more fragmentation of the webview you
don't get away from that from hybrid
apps actually because that still parses
in the webview it's just a problem that
you have to think about when you deploy
into Android how are you got to get
around this fragmentation and you've got
to have to buy about 300 devices um
Android you these are all the same ones
for the for iOS when you deploy with a
hybrid the peak performance I've been
talking about these cool edgy things
that make your html5 run so fast but
what are they basically there's there's
three right now that i know of that
there's more and i didn't mention them
sorry number ones direct canvas which at
moby makes cocoon j/s which luda makes
and ejecta which is only a dominick from
impact need and that is not cross
platform that as iOS only but i wanted
to put it in here because he did some
cool stuff but the graph acceleration
speeds up the html5 about 2 to 10 times
the way it does this is instead of
parsing it through software rendering it
starts doing it through hardware
rendering through the GPU so it's
actually a native view with a webview on
top of it well i guess from you it's a
native Native you with a webview on top
of it so you're actually seeing OpenGL
open or you're here in open al and is
parsing it way faster because it
actually can use the whole computer to
do it it's not software it's hardware
and then you get about 2 to 10 times
more parsley speed faster we
I have taken a game that was doing five
frames per second we got up to 40 frames
per second by using direct canvas so
there's it definitely is a giant
performance gap our performance leap
when you when you do this for direct
canvas and cocoon Jess you get
multi-touch support for android so not
only are you getting this acceleration
you're also getting multi-touch support
so you can do that jump and run game on
android and iOS if you don't do it
through the browser and you compile it
and and send it native so that's another
misspelled touch that's just how you
spell touch on the east coast yeah I
uses JavaScript core OpenGL and open al
to render you still write at once a
deploy everywhere I put that asterisk
because that is direct canvas I believe
kun je s when you when you compile with
it it will work in both france so that's
also cocoon jes not ejecta again that's
only iOS but so if you make your game
with direct canvas and you deployed iOS
you can also deploy it to Android in the
same exact form it is just using our
build system and then you can also
deploy it the Facebook chrome store
Mozilla store without doing any of that
we compile in the back end to make sure
that it's not OpenGL anymore it acts
like html5 but you don't have to rewrite
your code its exact same code base and
that's why we do with boom town ok and
then how do you deploy html5 build
systems first phonegap sure all of you
know who phonegap is yes yes ok they
have iOS support android support
blackberry which for games i don't think
that really do anything until 10 comes
out or 10 came out i haven't been able
to play with it if it did palm which is
you can you can develop for palm i'm not
sure if any new devices are being made
and Windows Phone 7 which four games
again I don't think windows phone 7 can
do gaming too well windows phone 8 I
know is working really really well
towards html5 gaming but I'm not a
hundred percent sure about Windows Phone
7 at mobys build system we have iOS
support android amazon store the kindle
fire store the nuke intel appup Mozilla
App Store Facebook and the chrome store
so those are all native compiled for you
in the cloud send it back down to you of
any deployed and all you have to do is
give us credentials before we make the
build
cocoon Jas that deploys to iOS and
Android again with that acceleration and
ejecta ios-only but this came out about
two days ago and I really want to
include in my slide my presentation
because he did something really cool he
got a really high frames per second when
even using things like three Jas and and
I think he even showed a demo on vimeo
of him getting 60 frames per second
while taking a 3d model and skewing it
with touches which I was really
impressed about it's really cool and it
does support more things than his own
game engine which is io r which is
impact jas i just want to put up here
because it is another accelerate that
you can use to get your device in the
app store and then also miam which
actually from construct 2 told me about
it's really cool you can actually deploy
your html5 game as an XE and a dmg i'm
not a mac guy is that the mac store yeah
and a dmg into the native mac store so
you can actually have an XE an
executable on your laptop that will pull
up your html5 game and play it in a
window so that I thought that was pretty
Nina should include that and I don't
know where I am on time but that is all
I have
