angular and we're going specifically
we're going to talk about testing in
angular actually one more question
before we get started
who who here works in angular who here
has heard of angular who here uses
JavaScript okay so I know some of you
are lying because you had you know like
there are people here who didn't raise
their hands who here owns a computer
okay who here has legs I'm looking at
you all right so we're gonna talk
specifically about testing and we're
gonna talk about testing on angular the
goals of today's talk is to answer these
questions what does it mean to test why
should you write tests what is a good
testing technique and how to test
different components of our application
unfortunately we don't have enough time
to get every part of your application so
we're just going to we're going to talk
about the different types of tests and
look at a few ways to write tests for
different components before we get too
far into that let's talk about let me
just tell you who I am my name is Ari I
wrote a book on angular actually I wrote
several books on angular I'm in the
process of writing another book
not on angular I teach here in the San
Francisco at a company called hack react
or a school called hack reactor and
various other schools here in San
Francisco and I have a background in
distributed computing and big data
processing and Infrastructure and I'm
really into deep learning which has
nothing to do with angular these are the
books I referred to cool and I'm also
kind of as a way to wrap in teaching for
not only the people that I can speak to
and in person I'm also doing webinars
and stuff online if you are interested
in there's no way we're going to get
through all the material that I have
today
I'm going to give a similar yet more
in-depth talk online and you can find
out more details at ng-newsletter comm
ok so back to the top the
today I strongly believe that testing is
a core component of development and I
actually kind of art even though I made
this diagram I kind of argue with this
diagram in the sense that I think those
two things are one in the same so what
is it what does it actually mean to test
and why why do I hold that opinion
testing itself is a way of looking at
our code and making sure that it runs
away that we expect it to run there are
always going to be edge cases when you
write code there's always gonna be the
case where your code just does not run
unless of course you're writing assembly
code in which case your code is always
going to execute exactly how you expect
it execute until there's a power surge
so specifically today we're going to
talk about front-end testing and testing
the front end testing our browsers has
traditionally been pretty difficult one
of the reasons this has been difficult
because there's a lot we have to do when
we're writing in front-end tests we have
to load a browser we have to set up our
JavaScript expectations first we have to
have a library to do to actually set our
expectations up and we have to execute
those exceptions capture the output and
then use the output to measure and
compare against our expectations and
then we have to in order to do this in
kind of a meaningful way other than just
pointing and clicking and making sure
that things kind of run when you press
Apple R and refresh your browser so we
have to do this all in an automated way
we'll talk about how we as developers in
2014 have it a lot easier than we as
developers in 2010 and before we'll look
at the different tools that we have
available to us today to handle a lot of
that browser automation and expectations
so there's two types of tests in I mean
there's a couple other arguably a couple
other ways of testing front-end code but
the two typical types of tests are unit
testing which is testing code and end
end testing unit testing is basically
testing small core small components of
our funko dan our functionality so unit
tests are particularly good for
developer they're like
the developer facing tests and the end
testing on the other hand is where
automating clicking on a site we're
automating loading the site submitting
forms to seeing if elements are there
seeing if the browser is doing what we
expect the browser to be doing and
lastly before we actually jump into
working on stuff today there's often I
get the question a lot I do a lot of
training for like I said in in schools
like hack reactor and asked to do a lot
of training and like the corporate
setting and a lot of questions we get
are things like well do you believe in
test-driven development
do you guys know test-driven development
is it's kind of like an old term yeah
it means writing your test before you
write your the functionality of your
code so I it's driven by the tests I
don't actually believe in TDD
I believe in test focused development
what I mean by that is that's in the
wrong spot what I mean by that is
writing testable code writing code that
you can come back later and write a test
on so you're as opposed to writing the
tests and then you know that your
functionalities done when you write the
tests a lot of the reason why I believe
that is because especially in the
front-end our API our developers facing
API is constantly changing especially
when we're prototyping and if you're
writing tests for an API that is likely
to change is going to change then you're
wasting development cycles on writing
something that is you're going to throw
away so I I believe specifically in test
focused development so what is tfd so
this is oh geez that is tiny can you
guys read that well if you have edu and
gras comm open on your screen you can
totally read it you might have a
function like this inside of your
angular app where you have a load
friend's function and you only want to
load the friends and you want to load
the friends in from your either from
your cache or you want to load it from a
service like your API service for
instance this looks like kind of a
reasonable function to do that right but
this is super hard to test
like that is like if you're writing a
test for that you are writing a whole
bunch of edge case tests that you don't
need to write you're like simply because
your code looks like this your tests are
gonna be are going to explode in terms
of size whereas if you write were to
write that same functionality like this
and in different functions and I'll be
at that this function right here is just
kind of a little bit too big for my
taste but if you're ready like this and
you can stub out those specific tests
when you're writing a test and test that
specific functionality for that test so
I say TFD not TDD I also do believe that
console log statements are okay as long
as you don't do a git commit with a
console log okay so when when should we
write tests we should write tests when
we're fixing a bug isolating an issue
adding a new feature when we're when we
bring a new developer on the project
tests are really good because when that
new developer joins and at some point
you may have been that new developer
you're like well what's broken how do
these things work especially in a large
code base having a test there to
demonstrate exactly what that API looks
like is really good so let's talk about
the process of testing the process of
testing is I believe in 4/4 steps we
want to isolate the functionality that
we want to test we want to set an
expectation for the functionality that
we're writing set the given conditions
for that functionality and this is this
is like an array by the way where you're
like oh I this condition this condition
this condition of this condition and
then you want and then the last part of
it is compare the given conditions with
the with the given output so for
instance we might want to isolate a
functionality like this we have a
function and this function does one
thing it says build full name based off
of the name off of a first name in a
last name so we in order to test this we
would have to set an expectation by the
way I didn't include the introduction to
Jasmine in this
because we just don't have enough time
we're using Jasmine if you're not
unfamiliar with jasmine it it's very
it's verbose its terse enough such that
you may should be able to understand it
if you don't understand it that's cool
to just join the webinar because I'll be
covering jasmine
okay so I'm using jasmine we would set
an expectation like this where we use
the key word expect and then we call the
function and we call the function based
off of a set of given conditions
for instance this given conditions that
we're calling inside of this test is
we're building the full name with the
first name in a last name and then we're
going to compare the output of that with
the expected output all right so for the
rest of the talk we're gonna be using
this code it's available here this will
link you to this and you can just click
on download zip on that page so it's um
j dot mp4 / ng testing all one word i
know it's so hard to click download okay
I'm gonna move on okay so the way that
we'll run our specs as you guys are
downloading that hopefully internet is
good enough for it not the Internet is
good the internet it's good enough guys
trust me though our access to the
Internet so we're gonna be using a tool
called karma the way that we install
karma is using the npm node package
manager binary we'll install that using
NPM install karma so in order to use
karma we need to give karma a
configuration file will give karma a
configuration file by using the karma
configuration generator we can use the
generator by using the command Karma
space in it
are you guys following a longer
shouldn't yeah okay this is recorded so
if you lose your place it's cool - great
so karma in itself will bring up a
screen that looks like this with a bunch
of different questions that you can that
it will ask you
I particularly press ENTER for every
single one of these questions regardless
of what I'm doing because manually
setting it up is way easier than not so
you feel free to do that too if you're
following along it will give you a file
that looks something like this
there - there are three things inside
this file you should pay attention to
one is the files array and the files
array basically taking a step back the
way that front-end testing works the way
that Jasmin works is we'll load up a
browser and inject a bunch of files into
that browser including including your
dependencies your application and your
tests and so this files array represents
the files that karma will inject into
that running browser instance so every
time that you have a dependency it needs
to be listed in here you can see we have
angular inside of here as a dependency
anytime that you have new application
code you have to put that inside of this
files array by the way this supports
globs as you can see here in our specs
so if you just thought that can have
direct mean you just want to be like I'm
just going to include all my app
directory then you can do that and then
this also takes all the tests that we're
writing so the second parameter that you
should pay attention to is the base path
this is just basically where to resolve
your files from this is particularly key
when you're developing modular based
applications and then the last one is
oughta watch Auto watch does exactly
what it sounds like it will watch all
your files and when any of them changes
inside that files array it will rerun
all our tests and that should say unit
testing all right so unit testing as
they already said it's it's really meant
for the developer the developer who sees
the code it's not meant for a user an
end user right I put this in the weird
spot lastly never mind unit testing the
superfast unit testing is really focused
it's really good it will save your life
you should totally do it are you guys
convinced
all right sweet so let's start testing
so the first thing that we need to do
when we're writing tests is to inject
our execution environment in angular
what that means is we need to in inject
our angular module because angular is a
modular framework we inject our modules
by using the before each I'm sorry by
using the module function inside of
abort before each block before each if
you're unfamiliar with jasmine does what
exactly what it sounds like it runs
before every test all right so let's go
do that inside of our code if you
downloaded that example I've
pre-generated your the karma config you
I've pre-generated the Karma config and
pre-populated or application or
application looks just like this this is
the weather in San Francisco right now
which has super hot cheese okay what I
guess it's ninety three point seven six
and that is Fahrenheit and be terrible
for Celsius all right
this is a super basic application and
it's really this application is really
intended on demonstrating testing not
necessarily demonstrating the power of
angular you want to know the power of
angular join the webinar I hate that
word webinar I just feel so dirty saying
it okay so we've already started I've
already started writing the home
controller spec so if you're following
along this is now is a good time to
inject our environment again the way we
inject our environment is by using the
before each function or before is by
using the module function inside of our
before each block and this module takes
a single argument which is going to be
the name of the module that you're
testing notice it says the name of the
module that you're testing if you're
testing other modules you can do this
without the modules you don't have to
just test the your main application
module by the way I believe our module
is called my app ray it is
all right so inside of just a little
exploration inside this application we
have a service and we have a controller
the controller does handles the business
logic of our application where we say
hey we want to make sure that we get we
have the weather that's available to us
and these service is a thing that
provides us with that data not terribly
complex so let's go ahead and test our
our controller let's talk about testing
controllers and then we'll test our
controller I jumped ahead I get really
excited sometimes ok so if you've played
with angular no doubt you've definitely
seen this example if you tried to
convince your boss that you should use
angular no doubt you see you've shown
him this example if you've been to the
angular home page angularjs org you've
seen this example this is a really super
basic example of how angular works where
we are we have a bind to an input field
and we have an output bind to an or we
have we have another binding to output
to the binding of that input
I said binding a lot there um the
controller that specific controller
looks something like this where we are
taking whatever we put inside of that
inside of that field and we're splitting
it by things on the strings hello
everyone and stuff and we're only
showing the first name so if this were
right oh I totally missed felt my last
name there we go can we edit that out
okay so basically the tests that we
would write for something like this and
by the way yes this is a good example of
something you want to write there are
edge cases where you may have a dash or
an underscore and that this is a good
case for writing a test despite the fact
that it looks kind of meaningless what
we want to do is we want to test that
only the first name the first name and
only the first name is the only thing
that gets out put it on there so again
we need to do is inject our execution
environment when we do that I've already
covered that like four times
okay so testing controllers inside of
angular basically if you think about
what a controller is a controller houses
the business logic for the application
so it does that by using the scope or if
you're using controller as syntax it
does that by using the objects but we're
not going to get into controller as
syntax right now because it's less
complex the more complex part is using
the scope you guys know what the scope
is describe that the scope itself is the
glue between the view and our JavaScript
code so we would put inside of here
instead of our first name we have a
function called scope dot first name we
can call first name from our view as
we've seen here because it's on the
scope so if you think about what a
controller is a controller is simply
just a house for that scope it's just a
container for that scope so if we have
access to the scope we can test our
controller we can test for what goes
from our controller to the view and how
we interact with the view which is why
you'd use a controller in the first
place so getting access to the scope is
the crux of how we test our application
our applications controller to test our
application or to get access to the
scope we need to do what angular does
under the hood when it creates a new
scope by the way
testing is also a really good way of
learning a framework and learning how
thing especially angular I can't speak
for other frameworks in this work but in
this regard testing is super good for
learning how angular does stuff under
the hood because it uses you have to use
the injector in fact we're going to talk
about that now the way that you okay so
in order to get access to scope
we're going to have to need we're gonna
have to store an instance of that scope
and then we're gonna have to use the
angular injector to get access to things
that will be injected into our angular
application the inject function is a
helper function for doing this
just like we do when we're writing any
other angular object we can use the
inject function to inject any injectable
object into our test in this case we're
using the inject function
inject function to inject the root scope
and the controller controller is a
service that creates controllers
so then we're gonna have to in order to
write our test for our controller we're
gonna have to create a new scope we can
create a new scope by using the root
scope dollar sign new function this will
create a new scope by the way this is
exactly how angular works under the hood
when our application is running the root
scope in this case is now the parent
scope for that scope object so you can
use another scope to call the dollar
sign new on that scope and create a
child link of that if you want to do
that and then finally we need to create
our new controller and inject our new
scope as the scope object of the
controller this is why dependency
injection is really cool by the way
because if you don't do this you get the
real scope thing and you don't you get
the real scope that angular will create
inside the view and you don't have
access to it however you can slide step
that whole thing and inject your own
injectables injectibles is such a fun
word to say okay so now we can do any
expectation that we want we can set up
any expectation we want on side of our
on our scope these are pretty obvious
so Jasmine has a bunch of matchers a ton
of matches the ones that we'll use the
most often or the to be function which
does a triple equal sign on your object
the two equal there is the to be double
triple equals the two equal which checks
for the object equality the exact same
object if you're unfamiliar and there's
many many more okay so we've seen that
we can inject actually I lied let's go
and write our test our first test for
our home controller so our first test
for our home controller specifically
will test that our city starts out as
San Francisco California so inside of
our home controller we can is this
that's the wrong test there it is
alright so inside of our can our home
controller as I said before will keep
access to will keep a reference to the
scope this should be like test level
then let's go ahead and write a
an injection function okay so the first
thing that we need to do is for anyone
who's paying attention just shout out
crane your scope yeah I heard somebody
say that illness that was me making that
up and then what we're gonna use this
scope inside of a what yeah let's go
ahead and create our controller suite if
you guys are following along now's a
good time to type this in by the way in
your browser's if you do have ET un gras
comm loaded you can switch between
slides while I'm not switching between
slides okay so let's go ahead and write
our tests that says the city should
start as San Francisco
so let's set an expectation on our scope
we can this is playing JavaScript we can
set an expectation on our scope by
calling scope and then whatever we want
to however we want to access add scope
in this case the scope would be what we
call it city I can never spell San
Francisco such as me okay
probably shouldn't have said that out
loud okay so if you're following along
how much times it when do I go till
hopefully it's not five minutes ago okay
maybe that's why so many people are here
oh that's it that's all I have holy cow
okay
write all this code will be available
online so follow along after you watch
the recording so how do we we can what
15 minutes Oh phew we're still gonna
skip the live phone oh we won't
since we already wrote the code if
you've written the code the way that you
run this is you type karma and you're in
your in your browser you type or in your
terminal any type of karma start
commerce start will what wrong directory
karma start will as promised before it
will start a live browser as you can see
I have another browser running here one
quick thing about this browser is if you
click this the bug function or that
debug button and then you open the
console you'll see that we have all
these tests the output of the tests are
available in that console that's kind of
neat I think it's gonna need anyway
great so we can use that object array to
inject other objects other injectables
for instance in our controller we're
injecting the weather service we can
create a mark of that weather service
and we can inject that into our
controller so that our tested controller
is using the mocked weather service not
the real weather services which is
really good for unit testing because you
don't want actual
HTTP requests going out because that
slows down your unit tests which equates
to slowing down your productivity so
there are cases where we want to
actually have a HTTP request going out
when we are making a test we are making
a test call we want to make sure that
like you write the appropriate request
is going out so how do we mock how can
we mock HTTP HTTP requests so the way
that angular works is when we're making
more making an HTTP call like we would
our application view looks like this
where we're saying okay we have my app
in a really light font and we have the
HTTP service and we're making a call to
that HTTP service to go make a request
right if you're shaking your head
ask me after or if you're if you're
nodding yeah okay so the way that
angular looks at this is it actually
calls out to another surface called the
HTTP back-end the htu back-end is the
thing that actually does the HTTP
requests for us not the dollar sign an
HTTP even though it looks like it what
this means is we can use we don't have
to change our angular code to support a
dollar sign HTTP mock we can simply
switch out the HTTP back-end mock that
makes the request so instead of using
the normal HTTP back-end we can switch
that out for something else and that's
how that's the way that we're going to
create an a mock for our angular
application so the way that we do that
is by grabbing access to that H the
mocked HTTP back-end this is what karma
will do this for us by the way get it
access to we can get access to the HTTP
back-end mock by the way this is how I
do injectors inside of tests it's just a
lot easier you don't have to change
functions it's really cool and then we
need to make sure inside of our unit
test specifically that all of our
requests have gone out and that we have
no more pending requests this is super
important if you forget this your tests
won't work
so this after each function is really
important
right so we can set expectations on our
HTTP back-end by using the keyword
expect and the Tet this comes with the
testing HTTP back in which comes with
the angular - mocks library so if you if
you get like in the error that's like I
don't know how to do this make sure you
have your angular - mocks library
included in your files array so we can
set expectations on our HTTP back-end
that looks like the for the first two
parameters are required in here by the
way the HTTP method and the URL to test
the other two are optional this is the
data objects especially that which you
would use if you're like testing a post
request for instance and then then
headers up these are optional headers so
if you want to send in like an HTTP
request or an HTML request versus a JSON
request so that will create an
expectation on the HP back-end but how
do we actually execute that function
this is this can be a little bit tricky
too so that looks like the expectation
that we set up previously and we might
say okay we're gonna now we're going to
call the function that calls that HTTP
request so we're gonna call API get user
which is presumably the thing that we've
been testing inside of this application
that's actually not going to send out
the request if you know how angular
works the digest loop when the digest
loop runs that's when the HTTP requests
will come back and that's when the the
promise will get resolved so in order to
actually execute this and test it we
have to call H view back and flush which
will execute the digest loop to run that
for us so a quick rule of thumb before
we move out of unit testing into
end-to-end testing is write a test for
any functionality and write it after
your API is settled huzzah all right
there are any questions hold onto them
I'll be hereafter I won't disappear in a
cloud of smoke that's weird so
end-to-end testing we're going to talk
about protractor protractor is a tool
written by the angular team and now
there is actually a protractor team
inside of Google to do
or to write to manage protractor team is
really smart by the way protractor is
basically a front-end for selenium so if
you if you have used selenium or know
what selenium is in the you'll know it's
power can run on like pretty much every
web browser known to man
maybe not breach because breach is
really new but maybe breach I don't know
enough about it anyway end-to-end
testing is not a replacement for unit
testing you don't expect to write your
unit tests and you don't expect don't
expect to write end to end tests and
cover your unit testing and testing is
like faking a user it's faking a QA
manager sitting at a desk clicking on
things and is one of the reasons is
because it's not fast it's really slow
to load a browser and connect to that
selenium webdriver and tenon testing is
really good for black box testing being
like I don't care how login works I just
want to make sure that I can log in so
you write that your log in end-to-end
test it right it logs in the way that we
install this is by using protractor the
if you're going to follow along or use
this angular application in the future
protractor is not included inside of
your inside of this example code so you
have to you actually have to type NPM
install protractor
oh that's making me nervous and then we
have to install a selenium I've already
included a configuration example and
that's how I did it just like that right
and you can look through that protractor
configuration file in order to actually
run protractor test we have to have
selenium running we do that using the
webdriver manager and then you just pass
at the start function I'll just get to
the crux of the matter
protractor gives us access to protractor
gives us access to this browser object
and this browser object is our is our
way to connect to the browsers running
instance we can use that browser object
to change the URL of plus you to change
the URL of our application we can use
browser to select element or the object
to select elements on the page although
it's easier if you don't type browser
dot do I have that in here I don't darn
and you can select elements using the
global element function given to us by
protractor and then we can use the by
object to target elements inside of
there I will cover this entirely in the
in the webinar so feel free to join that
too okay lastly the last thing that I
wanted to cover today was how using
continuous integration not really going
to be able to cover this in its entirety
continuous integration is super cool
it's really good for pre deploys which
means you pushed your application you
pushed your git repo and Jenkins or
whatever Travis will execute your config
your all your tests and be like okay
cool it's passing I'll deploy now don't
actually do it cap deploy if you're
using Capistrano or FTP drop because
that's just so 1998 you can run docker
on your local instance but I'm sorry you
can run Jenkins on your local box your
development box by using something like
docker docker is really awesome this is
a really awesome example of a really
awesome box that will set up Jenkins for
you and and I highly recommend you do it
even when you're testing locally ok I'll
leave this one up here because this is
kind of a useless slide so if you're
interested in if you're interested in
that webinar click on that link inside
of your browser if you're at edu
dygraf.com or just go to ng-newsletter
calm huzzah any questions I have like
ten for two maybe - oh wait five minutes
oh sweet I got this way fast
you guys actually want to write in a
protractor test yeah all right sweet so
let's see if it's still 93 yeah it's
still 93 ok oh why didn't anyone tell me
that up here I'm like sweating bullets
like running as fast as I can man am i
running it was really relaxing huh okay
okay so let's
right a test to make sure that our
weather actually comes back using an
end-to-end test using something like
protractor if you are following along we
have this this protractor kampf file
that is given to you with that example
code first thing that we'll have to do
is off to start selenium so the way we
start selenium is by using the webdriver
manager start function this is given to
us by protractor so if you installed
protractor with NPM install protractor
you can simply start selenium just like
that next thing is that we we will have
two loops
quiet type thin that was weird in order
to use the webdriver I'm sorry in order
to use selenium selenium has to load up
a file we can have selenium load up an
index.html file but I think that's kind
of hacky and it's not really good for
doing anything making any requests
locally so like if you have a template
file that your ex that you're writing if
you're using if you're just loading it
in in your browser as like file colon
forward slash forward slash forward
slash you won't be able to make that
request because of course because of the
cross origin resource safety that our
browser provides us so I like to run at
at I'd like to run a a what's the word
for this a web server oh my goodness I'm
like slowing down and so is my brain so
I like to run a web server it's if you
have a Mac or Python installed you get
this web server by default so that
allows us to take this file colon
forward slash forward slash thing away
and just head to our browser at what at
that route so now we can actually write
our our now we can actually write our
end-to-end tests so our end-to-end test
is going to do something really simple
are really simple and really easy we're
simply just going to load this home page
and make sure that this thing is is
actually getting filled out it's a
reasonable test
let's move this guy over here and move
this guy over here and guys that alright
sweet so in order to actually test this
route this specific route we have to say
we have to go get that route we can get
that route by using the before each
function again and telling our browser
to I don't know let's say go get that
route okay that was easy okay all right
hey and there was much rejoicing all
right what's that are you heckling me
okay so in order to write a test we'll
use the it function the it function in
Jasmine creates a test the it function
takes two arguments the first argument
is the a description of the test and the
next argument is the block of code that
we'll write to execute that test so
looking in our looking in our index.html
we see that we have a single binding
inside of our HTML not binding
corresponds to whether Tempe a we can
weaken by the way we can attack we can
target also attack weird we can target
this this this content inside of our
application in a bunch of different ways
you can target it using CSS if we were
gonna go grab the class of whether we
can target it using a binding I think
that's it actually we can target it
using CSS looking at the h2 tag etc in
this case we're going to look at we're
going to target when I say target I mean
select we're going to select this
element by using the binding of whether
day we can we can target it using the by
object as I like sped through before
when I didn't realize I had more time by
using the by object and selecting it
using the by binding object just like
that or a function just like that so
notice this by binding itself is
selecting on the the binding that we
have in the view
that is actually really cool like this
is this allows us to select something
inside an angular like select this
angular view binding and throw that in
our test we don't have to be like okay I
want to go get that CSS we don't have to
do like
h2 tag that has a class of weather which
is one of the reasons why I promote
angular in the first place is the fact
that you don't have to know what your
objects are you don't have to know what
your classes or your IDs are on your
object you don't have to know the Dom
structure of your application which is
one of the which is one of the powers of
declarative style is the fact you don't
have to be like oh no I don't know where
it is because my designer put in a new
div tag for styling purposes are put in
a new span tag for designing designing
purposes instead you can just select it
based off the angular idiom which is
what you want to do in the view anyway
so then we can just simply say we can
make an expectation for this and we want
to just our expectation is going to be
that this thing is filled out so we can
set an expectation that says our element
itself expect our element text simply
has a has the text or actually let's do
this
protractor is really cool because you
can do stuff like that like you don't
have to know the Dom structure anyway to
run this test it's pretty easy I think I
mentioned it before maybe I didn't to
run this test we can simply just call
nude modules protractor been protractor
and passing protractor the configuration
file this will load up my bed it's not
on the by this will load up a new
browser as you can see oh my goodness
the demo gods alright so this will load
up a new browser let's see if we can't
there it is
sorry that's this one okay this will
load up a new browser as you can see and
that browser itself executes let's try
this again that loads up a new browser
haha there it is that loads the actual
application and we'll target well we'll
run the application it's your full
application running in a browser in an
automated way it's really slow even
though that was really fast if you're
writing a second test it's gonna be
exponentially slower as especially as it
grows so it's really good to use
something like this is why the Jenkins
slides were in there is this it's really
good to use something like Jenkins or
Travis or whatever CI server you're
using
okay cool I'll be here for more
questions rain
