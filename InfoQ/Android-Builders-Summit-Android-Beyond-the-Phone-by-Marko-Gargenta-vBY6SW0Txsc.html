talking a little bit about Android
beyond the phone so what that really
means to me at least is the alternative
uses of Android so using Android in
places that are not what it was
initially designed for and I'm going to
be speaking mostly forum from my own
experience working with some project so
i'll tell you more about that as we keep
on going before we get started I just
going to want to get a sense of the
audience how many of you are Android
developers have developed something for
Android a nap or something so it's about
the quota of the room ok and the rest of
you are linux developers c c++
developers embedded systems that kind of
stuff right and ok perfect cool so so
that's that's a pretty typical audience
that that that i deal with and I'm just
going to share some experiences again
this is a little bit about myself I'm an
author of a book that just came out the
other week called learning android and
this is mostly about developing apps so
it's not so much about the embedded
Linux nor embedded Android so it's
mostly about the application development
but I have worked on many projects that
like I said are using Android in places
that are not what it was initially meant
to be used for so roughly what we're
going to talk about is why Android so
why are companies looking at android is
an alternative to whatever else is out
there so that's that's going to be one
thing we're going to discuss and then
the the other thing we're going to
discuss is basically some case studies
some some places that I've seen
companies take Android and make a system
out of it and make something useful and
you may or may not even know that it's
powered by Android at the end of the day
so that's roughly what we're going to go
from so the advantages of Android there
are many advantages of Android right
it's it's you know it's a portable
system it's open this does but the items
that I picked here are deities that are
relevant to use
android in places that are not
traditional users of android right so
we're not here comparing it to to iPhone
or Blackberry or something like that
we're really comparing it to and I guess
an alternative would be just using but
straightforward embedded Linux type of
system so one of the advantages is that
it's opens its it's an open platform
it's relatively easy to get to get a
source code to it's relatively easy to
modify second big advantages is that
it's got apps so Android has a concept
of application development and it's a
concept that sort of a lot of developers
are embracing and understand and can
build on top of that so we're going to
talk about that and finally it's a
complete stack so that's also an
important consideration so I'll talk a
little bit about that as well so this is
a this is what it means to be open how
many of you can see in this tweet from
andy rubin just couple yeah okay so this
was Andy Rubin is the guy who created
Android ink and then subsequently sold
it to to google and it's now a vp of
engineering at Google and probably the
most important person in the world when
it comes to android because kids running
the show basically and this is his
response to i believe Steve Jobs or
Steve Jobs saying how Android is not an
open platform and so this was just a
tweet so basically 160 character
definition of what it makes to be open
and what it is in a nutshell is is what
it takes to build an Android from source
so you make a directory you see the into
the directory you pull down the source
you run make and and that should be it
there there a couple of minor steps here
that are missing anybody notice is
anything that's missing is if the
gingerbread honeycomb versions sore
lunch anybody exactly so it's a couple
of comments are missing I don't know if
that would fit into 160 characters but
but it's still pretty cool so
nonetheless android is pretty open now
this is something that lately a lot of
people are asking
but well is it really because when we
think of a traditional open source
project we think you know github just go
pull down the source and I have
basically whatever was checked in the
night before in Andrew doesn't quite
work that way and the way it works is
not quite clear going forward we saw
that recently with honeycomb where the
latest version tablet version of Android
not being released or its source not
being released anytime soon so those are
some things that are sort of a you know
big corporations that are embracing
Android are sort of you know starting to
worry about this because they don't
quite know what the strategy is going to
be and it is a concern so that's just
you know you can putting it out there it
is something that people before concern
about the second second advantage of
Android was that it's got apps and what
what I mean by that is that a there's a
model for developing applications which
means they're thousands and thousands of
developers out there that know how to
develop apps for your new platform
whatever dead platform is so that sting
number one and thing number two is that
they are already so many other apps out
there that that are available now what
I'm talking about here is a android be
on the phone so what that means is we're
using Android in a non-standard ways and
I'm not concerned about passing the CTS
the basically the test that ensures that
your version of Android is not gonna is
going to run all the subsequent
applications so we're not concerned
about being by the book when it comes to
running everything in anything that the
end route has to provide but still many
many applications are there and they may
run on your modified version as well
which would be a big bonus so so that's
that's the whole point of them in the
thing number three is the stack so it's
it's the it's the entire stack or that
we need for an operating system how many
of you have seen this picture in one way
shape or another before most of you okay
so basically what we have at the bottom
of it as you know
we have linux so that's that that that
is basically the Linux part of the stack
now these lines are perfect and you know
in cutting and so forth but in reality
everything's sort of mixed up when you
start looking at the source code like
cream demonstrated earlier so when you
look at the source it's not so pretty as
it looks here the second layer here is
basically the libraries a lot of
libraries here are a copy paste from
other open source projects maybe
slightly modified but these are the
things that we needed to complete the
stack things that we needed to have the
entire platform running and most of
these things that I have sort of up to
here most of these things are basically
in C so this is the C C++ native code
essentially right everything above this
line is roughly Java right and what we
have above this line is we have the
application framework so the application
framework is basically what makes
Android app development so so
interesting because it's a very rich set
of frameworks it makes makes life of a
developer fairly straightforward you
want to develop an app that knows its
location you just tap into the location
manager and figure out your GPS
coordinates for instance so so makes it
makes it really straightforward to
develop user end user applications using
the the application framework and at the
top of the stack at the end of the day
we have apps so these are the things
that the the developers right at the end
of the day so that's what makes Android
a complete stack and I say it makes it a
complete stack this is unlike some other
you know alternatives out there that we
have job java and me for instance or if
you just take a plain old embed linux
sort of version and install it it
doesn't quite have all the moving parts
that make make it easy for somebody to
just adopt it and build apps on top of
it so that's one big advantage of
Android so moving forward what I'm going
to talk about our couple of case studies
of a flick of using Android in places
that are not phone a typical foam foam
things
and I'm going to basically talk about
the the enterprise you a version of a
tablet and how that works out I'm going
to talk about using Android in for
Public Safety so using it for connecting
various devices to ensure that we're all
safe in mergency situations I'm going to
talk about a little bit about the
military use of phandroid set-top boxes
there are couple of cases their cars
that one of my favorite and anything
else that may come come up that didn't
fit anywhere else so I'm going to I'm
going to talk about that now most of
these things are projects that i
actually worked on myself but because i
can't really talk about you know in some
cases information is not public i'm not
going to be sometimes mentioning the
company is in so forth so just just so
you guys are aware of that so so this is
a project where android was used to
power a multifunction printer scanner
copier right so it's one of those big
multifunction devices out there and in
this particular client basically wanted
to to create the entire user interface
using android so before that they were
they had their own sort of homegrown
system and they wanted to see to explore
how android would would fit into the
picture so what was appealing to them in
this case so what was appealing to them
in this case was that there was the app
for development framework in other words
why would they care about this is it is
it that we're going to go to our printer
and download some apps from the app
market not very likely so that's not
really what was gonna happen but what's
appealing about this is that a a company
can now create a development program and
can basically go out to developers and
say hey you know we have this device and
we have this framework and yes you can
also easily write apps for this device
so that's something that's very very
appealing to them and that something
it's very straightforward in the Android
model right because right from the
get-go it was designed in such a way
that we're going to have multiple
versions of Android right even in the
phone universe nobody gets a phone
Zoomer phone with the vanilla Android on
it there's just no such thing right you
have either a verizon customized phone
or t-mobile's customized form or HTC or
samsung or motorola and something like
that right so we all run customized
versions of rom on our devices as is
today and in this case that was one of
the important considerations as well
because the developers could now check
the printer and build their own apps on
top of it in a safe secure manner
because there's a model of how to do
that of course android comes to the
whole touchscreen thing figured out and
everything's there so there's not a lot
to that that needs to be the you know
the client needs to worry about in this
case it's got all the graphics so none
of that needs to be recreated it's
already there it D API is there the
framework is nicely elegantly packaged
and easy to use and in this case it also
had networking that was something that
was that was important so it's important
for the printer to be able to just
expose itself on the network be fun to
find a ball and and that it also works
with other devices on the network so
what was missing what were the pieces
that were missing when it comes to
developing a solution like this well
obviously they they needed some custom
drivers because they have their own
proprietary piece of hardware and now
there was a workaround around this as
well that for which they may not have
had to had custody so I'll talk about
those two strategies you know you know a
little bit they had some libraries
because they wanted to expose some of
these drivers to the developers so if
we're going to open up a printer to
developers to hack in a safe way we're
not going to expect from them to talk to
the drivers directly it doesn't work
that way the way it works is you
basically create your library in C
library and that that that's basically
what's what's a you know abstracting the
hardware underneath that on top of that
library you then build a set of API
extensions so that the app developer can
elegantly write Java code that talks to
the app extension the talks to the
library talks feel driver and I'll talk
about that on the next slide so you'll
see what I mean
sort of in lines and circles sort of way
so that's the framework support and
finally at the end of the day what we
need it is we needed a nap we needed a
single application that's going to run
on top of this this device in this
particular case it's done in such a way
that you may never know that this is an
Android device to you just looks like a
touch touchscreen you touch and that's
it and ultimately what it is is that we
wrote a whole map so basically just like
Android system boots up into a
particular home app may be your default
one called the launcher in this case we
created a custom home app they just get
buttons print copy scan for instance so
there's no but there's no navigation bar
there's no drawer for the apps there's
no shortcuts none of the standard
Android complex right so it was just
basically a very simple app and it was
also the home app so by just booting it
up it goes into that app and there was
nothing else on it so so that's sort of
that was the konala there was the user
interface in this case so this is a I'm
kind of like taking the picture of a
stack and kind of like pointing bits and
pieces that we might have had to modify
if we're if we're you know doing a
project like this and I'm not going to
get into any code there anything
anything like that in in you know 45
minutes but they're just going to want
to talk about conceptually how bits and
pieces fit together so like I said at
the end of the day we had a nap there
was an application which was the home
application at the same time we wanted
to provide a framework for other
developers so that other developers may
at some point create their own apps for
this particular multifunction printer so
to enable that we had to expose
something via the app framework so
remember this was the Java round so
we're basically creating a Java
framework that is going to enable enable
that on this this framework may or may
not be part of the system services
there's something called a system server
and I'm sure you guys have seen Koreans
talk on that and that's basically you
know you have these Java services many
of them are running at the same time but
some are sort of very important than we
call them the system services because
they they are what enables the system to
run so you may plug in your custom
services part of the system service or
keep it separate it's up to you there
again just in this than just do both
approaches so basically what we're doing
is we're enabling this app to talk to
this this service now for this framework
to to work this framework needs needs to
be backed by something that is native
ultimately right so in this case we
wrote an Esso a shared object to library
here so this is loading talking to that
library in loading that library up
alright this library may live in for
example / / external or it could be in
system lib folder or even better vendor
lip for the folder for those of you who
are here in the previous previous
conversation so if you're modifying the
platform you would probably put this
this librarian / vendor / lip that way
as the new versions of Android come
along your code would be future safe
future proof I guess in a way and
ultimately you may have some custom
drivers for your particular platform
that your library would ultimately need
to talk to to get a job done this was
one approach to doing this another
approach that they looked at is actually
using a web services to talk to their
custom drivers so basically they said
look where they built our embedded linux
realm thing that that powers this device
how about we just leave it headless and
expose it by a set of web services and
that way so basically in that in that
approach we may have a whole other
system running here and a mini cloud
that would basically do web service call
to to that embedded Linux system or it
could have been even this way for
instance right so that would be another
approach to completing to getting
something like this done right so that's
that's the multi-function printer case
here's another here's another solution
this is a sort of bigger solution it
involves many moving parts but
basically it's a public safety concern
right so it's it's a major I am
developing a set of systems for to
enable you know emergency crews in cases
of catastrophe and such to communicate
right so this is a life-or-death sort of
situation and you have a lot of moving
parts you have the trucks you have the
vehicles you have the people on the be
no emergency crew on the ground you have
the command and control centers so
there's a lot of moving parts and at the
same time you have a lot of different
devices some are laptops summer maybe
building fire devices some some are
mobile devices and so forth so we need
to connect all of these devices and you
also have a very non homogeneous type of
network so how do you how do you do that
what are the concerns here now what was
appealing again for android is that
again it's a complete stack so a lot of
things that we need already available
there we have the working networking we
have the working radio we have you know
the the screen we have the ability to
create applications and so forth so
basically the entire stack was was there
that was needed for this also there's a
big there's a lot of hardware of the of
the shelf that you can pick up for this
case in this case so for example if one
Police Department want to use one top
type of chemical radio they can another
another Department may may may choose
another type of manufacture and so on
everything works everything's happy and
it's also the application abstractions
so basically writing an application
doesn't interfere so much with creating
the other the rest of the moving parts
in this particular case so if you're
building a command and control center as
long as you know it's Android somebody
else can be working on the actual app
that's going to at the end of the day
you know run on the device because we
understand the separation model bit
between the app and the actual framework
because it's well known well published
so that's that's what I was intriguing
about Android in this case what was
missing was
a couple of things that you need in a
life-or-death situation so basically you
need a priority of services there are
certain things that just are more
important than others right so for
example radio must be up must be working
and it cannot be interrupted by say for
example some game or some notification
thingy or some SMS message or something
like that that's maybe more consumer
related so in other words Android was
designed for consumer for mobile phones
and now we're sort of tweaking it a
little bit to use it in a case where
certain things must have higher priority
so that was one of the concerns
understanding the prioritization of
internals of the system also
understanding what the critical services
are which services are allowed to run
which ones are not for example media
service is critical under standard
Android is it critical in a life or
death situation may not be right where
some other services may have to be more
important this is a pretty standard
missing piece for a lot of these guys
and that's basically control over apps
so now if you develop this up this
device and you give it to you know many
many different you know public safety
employees out there what's stopping them
from hacking it and downloading their
own games is suddenly you know taking
this like critical device and installing
games and other social apps that are not
so important on a device like this so
called you tighten that how do you
prevent apps from being installed or how
do you allow only certain types of apps
to be installed from a certain trusted
sources so that's another sort of
missing piece in this case and also
security how do you how do you make sure
that this is used in the way that it's
meant to use because it may have some
sensitive information on top of it so
the the solution sort of looked like
this so they're basically custom apps
that were developed that serve different
different purposes in different
situations so these are custom apps
again we understand this app building
model quite well so this is this is a
good big plus because you can just
outsource it you have somebody else
build it on
of your framework we modified the cut
the modify the system server the system
service right so basically certain
things were taken out certain things
were changed in terms of priority and so
forth and also it was expanded with
custom services so the sort of custom
services that are added to the platform
that enabled things that you may not
have on a standard device for example in
a GPS is not the only location mechanism
out there there's some other mechanisms
that exist as well so in the case of a
government maybe there's a way to plug
into certain infrastructure that's not
available to a regular consumer so those
types of custom services would be also
added to the device in that may require
modified libraries and custom libraries
because ultimately this is being served
by this guy and this is being served by
that guy and in this case they left the
Linux space empty because the IP the
idea is that we already just pour it
this to a device so we have a working
Android just to begin with so we're not
really doing anything in terms of the
customization of the driver space or
anything like that because it is a just
off the shelf device more or less it
might have might have been robbed so you
know for Public Safety use but to just
standard device so that's that's a
public safety case moving on a very
similar case this is the Department of
Defense and this is one that's public
information so basically Dr Dee was you
know came up and said hey we want to
give every soldier and every every DoD
employee a smartphone ten thousand
personnel right and they basically build
this lab right next to NSA in Maryland
and that was not classified and
basically said you know for
experimenting with different carriers
and different devices so everything from
blackberry to Android to to iPhone and
kind of looking at which solutions make
sense and one of the constraints that
they wanted to kind of address is that
they wanted the device that is again of
the shelf so they're not going to spend
you know hundreds of
developing a custom phone when they can
just buy one relatively inexpensively so
what was attractive about Android is
that you can buy this chip device you
can take this entire stack that's free
and you can just tweak it to serve the
purpose so this is an example of using
Android in a sort of modified way as
well it's more or less still at the
phone but it's a it's a very specific
use of such so again it's off the shelf
hardware open-source platform those were
the attractive bits and pieces big
developer base out there which means
it's relatively easy to hire if this if
this takes off inexpensive solution so
this was a big one because you know in
the past it used to be that the
consumers receive technology from the
government now it's going the other way
around the government is actually taking
a lot of solutions from the consumer
space and adopting it for their own
solutions so that's that's a good thing
for all for all of us so the missing
pieces here were device management for
instance now Android has been addressing
this more and more so since fri and
gingerbread but way back when I worked
on this project it was impossible to
wipe a lost device it wasn't possible to
track a device it wasn't possible to
enforce password security on a device
right or password nino policy and things
like that so these are all the sort of
enterprise things that are very very
important to the government use device
management and blackberry had that for a
long time Android didn't but androids
fairly quickly catching up in that realm
so obviously security is really
important to them and when it comes to
security you know such a big word means
and lots of things lots of things to
lots of people but what the government
was basically looking at is how do we
make sure that the phone is being used
by the right guy right how do we make
sure the credentials are there beyond
just username and password and ideally
they would just like to stick something
into a USB port to authenticate itself
right and or you know Plan B would be to
you something like Bluetooth technology
to have a wireless authentication that
is being used by the right person so so
those were some certain things that they
were looking at and at the time of the
shelf devices with off-the-shelf Android
did not have the USB drivers exposed to
the upper layers so basically doing
something like this would require quite
a bit of hacking and possibly modifying
the device itself so so so that those
were that was one of the concerns
priority of service same as a public
safety app market locking so how do you
make sure that the government phones or
government devices only receive apps
from the government approved store for
instance right there marketplace
whatever you want to call that so so
those are some some concerns they're
basically obviously interested in
developing some kind of proprietary
market a place where you can go and
download the apps now you're seeing a
lot of like sort of similarities between
Public Safety and DOD stuff but and
obviously there a lot of them are
duplicating the efforts which is not
necessarily a bad thing ultimately we're
going to get the safer solution but but
that's something that that was going on
out there so the solution sort of looked
like this very similar to to the public
safety so we had the modified system
service we had some custom services for
mainly to support device management like
I said so device management itself
package manager was modified to
basically prevent certain applications
from being installed or allowing others
basically checking the signatures and
things of that nature custom libraries
to support custom framework bits and
pieces modified lovers to support
modified bits and pieces in these
frameworks it's always like this this is
supporting that right and then
ultimately some custom apps that that
were that we're enabling the end user to
get a job done so that was the military
solution which brings us to another type
of using Android in this case it's cisco
how many of you are familiar with CS
project not many huh that's strange so
cisco is building this public
information sis Chris building basically
the ipad for business it's a tablet for
business it's essentially it's going to
be a just like the picture
look it's going to look like your phone
except you're going to go and you're
going to grab that thing and you're
going to take it out of its docking spot
right and you're going to walk around
and you're going to still maintain the
conversation with the person or you know
video chat and all that in real time so
and that's basically powered by Android
so so this is a this is one of the very
cool sort of enterprise uses of Android
in this case to to enable to enable you
know corporate America to basically use
it for business and in this case the
attractiveness was that its opening
portable so relatively is it to port it
to a new device new gear it's an open
platform and Kim can be modified they're
sort of rethinking this now that
honeycomb source is not going to be
available so that's actually one of the
concerns for a lot of people like like I
mentioned earlier what was attractive is
again complete stack so all the things
that they do not need to build or again
because it's already there available for
free in android so those are attractive
things this was also big deal having a
wide set of apps already available for
the platform makes it very very
attractive right so if you if cisco went
and created something from scratch they
would not have a developer support they
would not have the the app market
support out there like to do you know
just embracing Android so that's
definitely a really big deal in this
particular case and also developers so
having a lot of developers out there
making sure the things that more apps
are being created for this platform the
missing pieces were enterprise apps if
you if you compare Android to the other
two sort of ecosystems the iphone and
the blackberry and there it certainly
lacks in terms of the enterprise
applications it's catching up really
fast so the speed of change is really
good but the sheer number of apps is not
as great as might have been so so this
is one one particular place you know
where a lot of people are now swarming
and making things happen which is a good
thing device management again prior to
Gingerbread wasn't there wasn't wasn't a
par
now it's getting much much better but
but that's something that Cisco was also
sort of you know considering should we
embrace it and do our own version should
we wait for Android to come up with with
their own sort of building version and
this is where google is not really
helping by not saying what they're up to
for six months plus right so that's
that's a concern in an enterprise
setting security is a concern support
for enterprise market apps so basically
cisco is not building this too for users
just to go to your regular google
android market and download spyware and
things like that they want to create
their own enterprise market space and
which is going to vouch for applications
which are higher caliber basically
enterprise apps one of the interesting
change modifications to the basic
platform was the support for multi-user
I thought this was interesting
especially for you guys being embedded
Linux guys on because standard Android
doesn't really have a concept of a user
I mean we have it in the linux space but
we don't have it in the end user space
right so what Cisco was what was
interested in doing is creating a
concept of a user so you can actually
log in and multiple people can could use
the same device so so it doesn't mean I
thought it was very cool we did not have
a sip support in the in the older
versions of Android prior to Gingerbread
so that was something that was also a
missing piece in video conferencing so
now a lot of these pieces are available
in the newer versions of Android but
it's sort of you know it's one of those
if you're building something for the
future you don't know when Google is
going to come around in there not rly
announcing that Peter so that was so you
know the solution basically looks like
this a lots of custom apps device
management recreated communication
services added to support VoIP things of
that nature modified system services
custom custom services to support some
other other things and then obviously
this is built on a custom hardware so
that was a those a you know work in the
linux pace as well next what we have is
the second last week what we have here
is Android being used in the TV set-top
boxes
and I worked with at least two major
manufacturers on various projects that
are basically Android in three three
major manufacturers entering set of
boxes and this has nothing to do with
Google TV for those of you who are
familiar with Google TV as you know
Google TVs they are still not available
as as an API so we can't really do
anything as developers in terms of this
so the so basically TV chatter box is
using Android so the attractiveness of
this was that it's a complete platform
again so there are a lot of things given
for free that make it really easy for
developers to adopt this and create and
build a platform around it it's a quick
to market solution so it's a relatively
straightforward 22 port android to wrap
it up to create a solution to put it on
the market and I'm sure many of you are
seeing that we're now having a whole
slew of set of boxes being available on
the market that are essentially
android-powered in everyone's doing sort
of their own homegrown solution on top
of Android and nobody's still using
google TV other than the ones that you
know Google partner would such as sony
and logitech tried the missing pieces
were the UI for that was designed for
for the mobile wasn't wasn't
particularly friendly to users on a TV
right we had a different type of
experience different type of a keyboard
different type of a relationship to a
device and so forth so a lot of
manufacturers get to create their own
versions of the you ought to enable this
now the good news is that it's this is
relatively relatively straightforward
because from get go Android was designed
to support variety of devices so that's
a good news but the bad news is the
Debian had to create their own version
of of such a UI and now honeycomb
address is a lot of those things but
honeycomb wasn't available until them
and it's still not available in source
there are some other things such as
picture-in-picture that needed to be
addressed but there are solutions around
that streaming and drm support in
android is still not
par with what it needs to be for a lot
of these manufacturers so they invested
a lot of energy usually around this
round so adding more support for
managing the content because this is the
value-add so they're not hardware
manufacturers / save their solution
people so they wanted to basically be
able to provide more content for more
sources and that requires the RN and
streaming so again so in this case we
get some TV related services that we
added to the framework so that custom
apps can be developed again every OEM
would like to create a developer program
basically have other developers
contribute their own platform so you
need that's why you do not do this but
you do this you basically make it
available as a nicely packaged Java
framework again in this case we modified
some system services and we added some
custom services for various things and
finally one of the my favorites is using
Android in cars so basically this is a
project that was done by a company
called visteon they their spinoff from
Ford ability they make a lot of sort of
electronics in the cars that you may not
even know it's made by them including
stereos to such but this is a prototype
of a of a dashboard that was fully
powered by Android and it's actually not
just the dashboard but it's the middle
console as well so in this case we have
a multi-screen sort of environment now
what's really amazing about the car
industry is that I don't know how many
of you follow the whole Toyota fiasco
last year but basically one of the one
of the big things about the car industry
is that they do an extreme amount of
testing they do a lot of testing in
their systems and it's probably and they
kind of self govern themselves and
they're very very strict about their
their their testing so in this
particular case you know they had a
custom hardware and and that was one of
the you know concerns how does this
custom software fit into such a such an
important role powering some of this
dashboard in a car
so the the the issues were basically
developing a custom UI as you may
imagine this is not a standard DUI what
they liked was developed the developer
base so it's um not necessarily
developing apps but being able to hire
and go to market and basically you know
the stack has a lot of moving up bits
and pieces did they already need it too
we have this done reliability was a
missing piece testing this works in such
an important role support for custom
hardware so they have the whole thing
out sourced in and build by somebody
else in this case and support for
multi-screen so those are the things
that they were dealing with again we
have some modified live some modified
cut in custom libraries we have some
hardware services because we wanted to
add say support for other other sensors
tire pressure things like that modified
system services and then applications
that were built internally in this case
in some other non non non phone usages
of Android there's a company that put
android in the home security system
there's a company that put android in a
calculators to power their scientific
calculators there's even a company that
is using it for tracking barges up in
North Pole and the attractiveness of
Android is that these things sit up
there North Pole for months at a time
without with a very low amount of power
standard it was designed to consume very
low power and that was certainly one
attractiveness in this particular case
microwaves photocopier washing machines
these are all things that that now run
Android inside of them so basically at
the end of the day what's what's very
interesting about Android is that it's
open it's a complete stack and it's
something that a lot of developers out
there now have experienced with can
build apps can contribute to and that's
what makes it attracted to a lot of sort
of non phone usages of the system so so
that's basically that's basically all I
have thank you guys
so the question is above the set of
boxes how long it lives in a field a lot
of these set of boxes sort of here you
know they built built it in such a way
that you can push the updates to to them
automatically so the OEM can push an
update and that's actually a very
attractive thing about the Android
because you have a system to do that OTA
right to push the update of the entire
platform so what OMS are concerned with
is which version so we sort of know
what's coming up but not really with
honeycomb with ice cream and so forth so
if you're if you're an oem you're
sitting here today and you're like okay
are we gonna are we going to wait six
months three months whatever times 10 is
or are we going to stick to two
gingerbread or stick to stick to fry or
something like that right so those are
the concerns and there's a big concerns
because for example do we need flash
that's a big concern somebody's going to
know Scott to build you I in flash but
it's not available until this version
and so forth second concern is how do
you make your you're developing your IP
be future proof right so Google is going
to release the next version it's going
to have new features which are going to
be awesome we don't know what they're
going to be but they're going to be
great so how do you now plug your IP
back into the new version how do you
maintain the code base and that's where
/ mender for example comes in handy in
the source code so now they kind of have
that at least Google is sort of starting
to think about that that other people
may have their own code a part of the
source proposed so those are the
concerns in this particular case so the
question is about the licensing issues
and modifications to the code so if you
stick to I'm not an expert on this
disclaimer but my understanding is that
if you stick to the android open source
project you're basically dealing with
mostly MIT Apache type licenses so
modifications you make to the code you
get to keep and my understanding is that
a lot of concern stress from the from
the day one went into architecting the
platform in such a way that your
derivative work stays yours because you
know as you know Eric Schmidt right when
they acquired Android inc he said look
our goal is many many different devices
in
that decision trickles down into a lot
of technical things for example driver
model right like why do we have
libraries versus reading from a file and
that may have to do with GPL lgpl sort
of concerns as well but having said that
I talked to some people at the bleep
Qualcomm they have an entire division
which is just dealing with licensing and
apparently that's a big hairy beast
there there are hundreds of different
licenses going on inside of the stack
and navigating that is you know is a
full-time job for Ford apparently well
so in terms of the Linux kernel question
that's a great question it comes up all
is in and so people I work with all is
like embedded developers they want to
modify the colonel in things but
technically kernel is not part of
Android project it's there's a level of
separation right when you download the
source code you don't download the
source code for Colonel right you
colonel is a separate project you when
you download the source code from from
for Android as I said in that slide for
what it means to be open you're actually
downloading the pre-built version of the
colonel so as such we're sort of were
not we're keeping that layer of
abstraction between the colonel end and
the D&amp;amp;AD rest of the Android stack
because the colonel is your correct
there you don't have a choice that's GPL
code right so that's my understanding of
that so that's a lot of sort of
technical decisions with libraries
versus / dev and so on were done to
enable that so that we are not concerned
with Colonel touching the kernel code
too much but that's as far as I know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
