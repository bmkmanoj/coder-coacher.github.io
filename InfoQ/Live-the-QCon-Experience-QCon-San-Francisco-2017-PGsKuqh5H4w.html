scale and are thinking about growing in
any way like technical wise or people
wise and all that you want to hear from
the people who have had experience
already and those people are all here
the most important thing we can do as an
industry is share our experiences and
share those experiences whether that
positive or negative something that we
can take home to our shop and Ryan
implement the peer sharing aspect is a
huge part of DuPont and you know why I
think people keep coming back every year
welcome to Cuba
the software has become more and more
pervasive in people's lives and it's
having quite profound impacts on people
and what they do and how they experience
the world the vision for do policy the
conference where the team leads a senior
influencers to come and sample the best
ideas of all the major trends that are
changing enterprise software on
Wednesday do you think about what makes
em you and I think also what makes
kiplyn special it's that combination of
being very intentional about the kind of
content you have but focusing on the
early stage panels but then also having
the people that are writing and the
people that are speaking not being
professional journalists or professional
speakers but being engineers who are
actually doing this thing in the day
jobs
what makes Yukon difference is it's
organized by devs for devs
it's very important for us that the
experience for the attendee beyond the
content is one that is memorable is one
that enforces taken away the most
content that they can we want consistent
we want quality but we want new voices
and software as well so that's what we
look for
three days of amazing talks very
inspiring I was expecting to come and
see the new trends in technology but
it's definitely exceeded my expectations
I really enjoyed the entire experience
spend incredibly supportive right from
the start all these great companies hear
the beep ones like Netflix reddit
AWS and all of them and they're here to
talk about architecture how they went
from zero to scale and all of the
interesting things that you all want to
know about and so this was a great
opportunity a great place to ask those
questions and I got we've got really
great answers from them
I'm enjoying myself with kyouko and it's
been a very nice conference I've learned
a lot and gotten expired by all the
great speakers I would definitely be
back I think it's a place where you can
come and see what's happening in the
tech world and use those learnings to
take it back to your organization and
start adapting and learning from
mistakes but also from successes of
other early adapters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
