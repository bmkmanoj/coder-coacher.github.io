everyone this is from jQuery to flux
tell I'm Richard Feldman so we're gonna
be talking about these three different
technologies from an architecture
perspective today a lot of different
ways you can compare them today we're
just focusing on architecture and we're
specifically gonna look at four
different things validating inputs
testing logic rendering updates and
reusing interfaces I'm going to see how
these compare across the four across the
three different architectures and to do
this we're gonna make a band name
generator' this is our sample app that
we're gonna make here's how it's gonna
work the end user will select two genres
of music so hip-hop country heavy metal
things like that and then we're gonna
generate a band name for them so let's
say they select country and heavy metal
for example you might get a band name
like tractor demon which which might
have a hit single like save a horse ride
the lightning and so okay let's let's
take a look at what the UI for this
might look like this might be our dom so
you have a little select two genres
across the top I have two different
dropdowns for selecting the genres and
then when the user selects these we're
gonna validate that they didn't select
the same genre for both because if you
select country and country that's not
funny that's just the country band okay
so let's start by taking a look at how
these three different architectural
patterns deal with validating inputs so
a change event fired the user clicked
one of the dropdowns they selected one
of the genres we got a change event
question is what do we store
architectural e speaking what do we
store do we store anything so jQuery
says app state goes in the Dom that's
where it belongs
so to the question of what are we going
to store the answer is store nothing
well query the Dom later if we need to
the user selected something in that
drop-down fine if we need to know at
some future date what the value of that
drop-down is we'll just go ask the Dom
at that time this will save us some time
up front granted okay what is flux a
flux says app state goes in stores
that's where we're gonna keep our app
state so when we get this change event
we're gonna
affected and we're gonna update a store
with the value of the drop-down when
that event came in Elm the Elm
architecture says appstate goes in the
model so when we get is event in it's
very similarly to flux and inspect it
we're gonna put it in the model so Elm
architecture model flux stores a lot of
similarities there okay so so far we've
got this table of how each of these
three different architectural patterns
deal with just that one change event
coming in jQuery says do nothing well
we'll look it up later
flux says put it in the store Elm says
put it in the model okay so now let's
say we've got these selections these
genre selections and we wanted to
determine the validity did the user
select two of the same genre or are they
different so we'll write a little
function to check this called is valid
and it's gonna take selected genres as
an argument and return whether or not it
was valid okay so in flux
pretty straightforward we're gonna look
at the store say storage genres we
recorded these earlier when we got the
event and we're just gonna pass that
stored value into is valid that's gonna
give us our answer Elm architecture same
deal except model and set of store model
John Rah's passed that to is valid we
got our answer now in jQuery we can't
quite do this because we didn't write it
down in one place we actually have to go
do a query to get that state out of the
dogs that's where our app state lives it
lives in the Dom so we have to write a
function called something like get
genres it's gonna run a query for all of
the classes with the genre class and map
over the results to get back the same
answer that we already had stored in
flux and Elm and then we can call is
valid with the result of that so already
we sort of seen J queries chickens come
home to roost where we have this event
that we were able to ignore previously
but now we have to go do an extra query
where as flux and elm architecture can
just call is valid passing the value
they've already got stored jQuery
doesn't have that stored value so it has
to start off with a query before I can
call is valid okay what about testing so
we want test coverage this is an app
where we're making something for the
long term we want to test it question is
what does that take what is required if
we want to
test this stuff that we've written so in
the case of Elm architecture if we want
to test this business logic thing we've
written this validation rule it's really
simple we call is valid passing whatever
selected genres we want and just check
the result that's it
does it make sense if they were the same
did it give us the right answer
they were different did it give us the
right answer flux same deal call is
valid check the result done jQuery we
still need to do that we still need to
call is valid and check the result but
that doesn't give us complete test
coverage cuz remember in flux in elm
when we're getting out the value of the
selected genres it's just access just
storage on rosada LAN rus' there's
nothing to test there but in jQuery we
actually have something that still needs
testing this query function that gets it
out of the Dom so actually just
accessing our application state now
requires testing think about what
happens if this class changes what if
it's no longer a genre class we refactor
it maybe because we're intending to
change our Styles not even intending to
mess with our business logic and yet
we've broken this so because there's
potential for regression here we
actually have an additional test burden
here we have to set up a Dom and test
that query to make sure that it's still
working properly and doesn't have
regressions so now we see that whereas
jQuery started off with an advantage
where it was doing less work and getting
the same result now it's actually doing
more work to get to the same point so
because it wasn't storing anything in
that event not only do you have to do
more work to validate we also have to do
more work to test okay what about
rendering updates so we've now
determined if something is valid but we
want to show that to the end user we
want to render these validation errors
for them the question is who alters the
Dom I mean someone has to we have to
show this to the end user
that requires altering the Dom who's
gonna do that jQuery as usual has the
most direct answer we're gonna query the
Dom to find the particular nodes that we
want to mutate and then we're gonna
mutate them ourselves be as direct as
possible now with flux we have to start
talking about react because in theory
you can use flux with whatever rendering
system you want but we have to pick one
and we're gonna pick react because
that's the one it was designed to be
used with so react has this component
hierarchy and components describe the
desired Dom we don't mutate the Dom
directly we just say here is how we want
the Dom to look this is the idea of a
virtual Dom and then react takes care of
actually transitioning the Dom from
where it is now to the way that we said
we wanted it to look in our component
hierarchy Elm has something very similar
except it's just a view function it's
not a component it's just a function so
this is a lot like react stateless
components the idea is you give it a
model and then it returns a
representation of the desired Dom that's
it so we can see some interesting
characteristics here as well the render
process for jQuery is querying and
mutating with react and flux we just
results on a component because we've
already got the state we needed to start
with and an elm we just call a view
function now what happens if I found a
bug so if you have a bug that means that
the screen is not showing what you
expected which naturally begs the
question how did the Dom end up in this
state this is not what I expected how
did it end up this way and when you're
trying to answer this question of how
did the Dom end up here you need to sort
of step back and trace how things got
this way and at this point
reproducibility is incredibly important
you want to be able to go back to your
previous application States and look at
how they changed over time you want to
be able to say ok at this point we had
this particular application state and
the screen looked like this is that
right okay good step forward and then
keep doing that until you find the spot
where things went wrong so being able to
take your entire application state and
generate a Dom from it that you can look
at and figure out if that was the broken
state or not is incredibly helpful for
debugging and if you have a single
source of truth like we do with flux and
like we do with the Elm architecture
this is easy to do remember with jQuery
as we're going along we're making these
mutations
there's no way to record that state
along the way it's just getting thrown
out we're just mutating and that's it
but since we have the single source of
truth we can just record it as we go
along and then replay it to figure out
where things went wrong
and finally we come to reusing
interfaces and this is where things get
really interesting so let's say we have
a new requirement we want to add the
ability to select subgenres so not just
metal but maybe thrash metal speed metal
symphonic metal things like that so
we're gonna have an accordion instead of
a drop down and since this is not
something that's just built into the
browser we're gonna make our own custom
accordion it's gonna look sweet but of
course since we're gonna make this
accordion widget this is not something
that should only exist in this one part
of the application we wanted to be
reusable everyone lots of accordions
potentially use them at any point so the
user clicks to expand one of these
accordions expand a section in the
accordion the question is what state
changes what's different now
so in jQuery as is always the case
the answer is we change the Dom we're in
a toggle an attribute of some sort so
this might be a class maybe you click
and it changes the class to show you
that now we have a different class on
that that describes the accordion being
expanded or maybe it's a data attribute
either way jQuery says appstate lives in
the Dom so that's where we're gonna put
it
what about flux so so far every time
we've gone from jQuery to flux it's been
pretty consistent said jQuery likes to
go to the Dom and flux likes to put app
state in the store but the thing is
since we introduced that rendering piece
change a story is not the end of the
story because we're on reactant flux now
and react has its own way of doing this
so react is really big on drop-in
components these reusable components
that you can just drop into the
component hierarchy and they just work
they've got their own self-contained
mutable state that they can manage
themselves outside the rest of the
application and for this to just work
you have to be able to write an
accordion component like this that
manages and mutates its own State you
just pass it the contents you want you
drop it in anywhere in your program and
it just works so who wins when we
do either of these approaches I mean
either we're gonna put it in the store
or we're gonna put it in the component
state which do we choose I mean we can
do either the choice is up to us but we
have to pick one so this sort of begs
the question well if we only ever change
store state and flux I mean why would
react have that feature I mean all
components would be stateless this would
not be a new feature in react ODOT 14
this would just be the way things were
always done so we can kind of infer from
the way the libraries are designed that
sidestepping flux is the way to go it's
what the libraries suggest by the
feature set that they offer and this is
what tends to happen ok so we're going
to mutate component State that's the
answer that's how we're gonna make this
reusable accordian what does that mean
for reproducibility well the answer is
querying is back in this used to be
something we only did in jQuery is that
we would query the state on the fly but
now we have to we no longer have all of
our app state in stores if we want to
figure out what the state of our program
is because we're stepping back and we're
trying to find where a bug happened and
we want to recreate the Dom at each of
those stages at any given point in time
we can't just look at the stores like we
could before now we need to go ask each
of our components that are using this
local mutable state feature and say what
is your state right now what is your
state so we can write it down and then
serialize it again later in other words
we have to go around and gather up all
these scattered pieces of state in order
to assemble the whole picture when we're
trying to reproduce things so what does
Elm architecture do about this well Elm
architecture rule is if we need it to
render the UI it goes in the model and
that's it that's the end of the story so
yeah we need the accordion expansion
State in order to render the UI so it
goes in the model and if you're coming
from a react background you might say
you know that sounds weird that's that's
that's unconventional yeah it is but
it's got some great features for example
reproducibility still works and it's
scales no matter how big your app gets
you've always got reproducibility this
is how Elm can have a time
traveling debugger that just works
because at any given point in time if
you're trying to figure out what your
apps eight is and you want to get a
working Dom out of that you've got it
all in one place in the model it's not
scattered around potentially through
multiple different components it's
always in the model the other feature
that this gets you is simplicity you
don't need this whole toolbox this whole
tool shed full of tools you can just
have a nice simple toolbox compare how
these things ended up looking if you
look at that right column you can see
everything in the Elm side is just data
or functions the jQuery side we're doing
all this query we're interacting with
the Dom there all these different things
going on in the reactant flex side we're
using some stores which are more
complicated than functions we're using
components which are more complicated
than functions they both got some data
and methods going on and sometimes we're
using stores and components so this does
beg the question can we get
reproducibility and react and flux can
we can we get that I mean we used to
have it until we started doing reusable
stuff then we just have that the answer
is yes totally as long as you use 100%
stateless components including
third-party components so you can either
have total reproducibility this great
debugging benefit it's great testing
benefit or you can have components that
you can just drop in and they just work
you can't have both you have to pick one
and if you want total reproducibility
you have to be very consistent about
this you have to be very disciplined you
have to make sure that not only are you
not using this feature that exists but
also that none of the third-party
components you're using are using them
you so this is one of the benefits of
elam the language as opposed to just ell
me architectures there's no discipline
needed for this so not only is it
designed this way but it's all
guaranteed at Build time if you try to
violate this or you try to do a side
effect in a view the compiler will tell
you about it it won't let you make that
mistake it's pretty nice
okay so what have we learned in the
course of building our app first that
jQuery defers effort which makes it the
fastest to get something going on the
screen and full disclosure I love jQuery
for prototyping it's great I mean it's
as long as you're gonna throw away the
prototype and not have to maintain it
later
right for that it is the least
maintainable though reactant flux it's a
simpler system than jQuery is less going
on your state is more consolidated which
makes it more maintainable but when you
start getting into reusable components
it does tend to get more complex the
state starts to get scattered around
more and you lose some of the benefits
that you had at the outset the elem
architecture is the simplest system
might not be aware you used to but it
will give you the most maintainable
results if you'd like to get started
with them we're gonna company called no
red ink we are so hiring by the way we
use LM extensively in production and
we've got a blog post that called
building a live validated sign up form
in elm basically takes you through if
all you know is JavaScript it'll get you
from zero to having built something in
elm that works using all of the stuff we
just talked about start to finish and as
of this week I can announce that there
will be in the future another resource
you can use to get started with Elm
which is this book element action that I
am writing for Manning publications if
you'd like to keep tabs on that I'll be
tweeting about it thanks very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
