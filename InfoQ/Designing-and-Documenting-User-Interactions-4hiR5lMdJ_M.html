my name is Darcy Clark as Peter said
I've come a long way to be with you guys
here today and I think this should work
quickly
this is oh there you go I want to give a
big thanks to Peter Vanessa and Yelp
couldn't we give them another round of
applause yes so this is one of the
largest html5 groups or the largest
html5 group in the world so it's pretty
awesome that they're able to bring you
guys all here and there was five hundred
people or over that registered so I'd
like to meet all of you at some point
there's time after the talk if you would
like to shake my hand or say hi
so I actually saw this survey Peter gave
me a little insight into what you guys
like and I made another bitly URL that's
a little bit easier to get to I think
and definitely check out this data I
thought was really cool essentially
again it's sort of like a census of what
you guys like and what's sort of gonna
be trending in the next few months
surprisingly there was no like design
topics there so hopefully everybody here
cares about that stuff because we're
going to talk a little bit about that
and obviously documentation so I'm at
Darcy sweet right on Twitter yeah my
first name if anybody likes Jane Austen
you can refer to me as mr. Darcy that's
okay my best friends do yep
oh yeah dude I get that all the time
and the fact that you like hockey even
better we're hanging out but no I'm not
I'm not thirsty Tucker or window Clark's
son I wish I was Clark Kent and mr.
Darcy
so my names were switched around but
yeah so I'm at Darcy that's great
hash that our usernames have
unfortunately you get along miss tweets
so stuff like this people are like
asking my mom for feedback creeped in my
house when I'm not there
and this is my favorite apparently I'm
teaching kids to like techno this is not
me okay so just just watch out for that
so some of the work that you may know me
by if you're in the WordPress community
I started company three years ago called
themify its commercial WordPress theme
company it's still being run by my
business partner Nick law as well I've
worked with a bunch of awesome agencies
in the US and in Canada fi is probably
the biggest that's on there and through
those companies and also doing contract
work I've gotten to work with some
awesome brands like Google Microsoft
Nike Samsung I've also done a lot of
open source work I helped the jQuery
team a few years back when they were
trying to get the website redesign did a
lot of work with them done a lot of
plugins which you can go check out on my
github page and also if you guys how
many people know about the front-end
developer interview questions raise your
hand what how many people are front-end
developers in this room what who are the
rest of you
I'm scary how many designers are in
there okay okay I'm starting to figure
it out but that's a great resource it's
being translated to over 25 different
languages which is amazing there's about
a hundred 50 questions there you can
completely ignore it I've got a lot of
flack on reddit for like being like this
is what you're supposed to ask people
but yeah I've done a lot of a lot of
open-source work and the project that
you're actually gonna hear about today
is DSS and that's going to be probably
something that I'm working to into the
new year it's gonna be my baby I'm
Canadian
this is what Canadians look like there
was a guy from North Bay what is he here
is that you okay well he was like
registered and I'm from like a little
town that's close by called Sudbury so
as a true Canadian I have to apologize
for a couple things no I have a cold
I really actually have a cold I'm a
super stuffed up so if we're talking
later and I can't hear you and I have to
ask you to repeat your question I
apologize I'm actually super stuffed up
super like not here but here but that
rhymes with gold yeah no anybody hockey
okay okay but I saw this and that's
right you're keeping them right just
saying okay see they change the sign
after we've won the hockey game but we
gave you him we gave Bieber let's just
put it out there warranty included like
this and you guys
that said if you want to give us back
ryan gosling we will take him it's cool
so what I do essentially is I'm a
developer a front-end development and
yeah
not exactly like that but yeah I'm a
front-end developer by trade I went to
college for programming so I'm in HTML
CSS JavaScript all day I'm also a
designer right like Bob Ross and I
actually as well almost by trade I went
to a performing arts high school majored
in visual art got all my art history
color theory out of the way really young
and also started programming really
young so if you guys are 80s child
children 90s children you may remember
Fame it is a lot like Fame my teenage
years we're awesome people running
through the hallways and I'm a little
bit of a businessman as well so still
have I've created two companies still do
contract work so I sort of understand
the whole the whole picture when it
comes to building projects and working
with clients and and building products
so I like to take a holistic approach to
problem solving essentially what that
means is I'm able to understand the
goals having all that experience I may
be able to better understand the goals
or objectives of a project from every
standpoint the goals are objectives from
a design standpoint development and
business and he also means I'm able to
better communicate with people within
all those facets of you know a project
lifecycle and I also feel shared
responsibility because of illness in the
end result in each one of those each one
of those points in the project lifecycle
so I think this is really important a
lot of people would say I'm sorry for
jack-of-all-trades I would say you know
jack of all trades master of none I
would say jack of all trades like really
good at a lot of them but yeah so past
12 months I've worked on a lot of things
if you are interested in any of these
please come in and talk to me afterwards
but the key one here is documentation
last 12 months are really focused on
that with a number of different
companies and how to obviously get their
teams communicating better and to
document their libraries their
frameworks or their websites and also in
here is JavaScript video decoders if
anybody knows anything about that please
talk to me afterwards because it's like
crazy awesome the stuff that you can do
now with video so designing and
documenting user interfaces was actually
a talk that I took around to Prague
London and Toronto last year and it was
a lot of fun but it was a little shallow
this is sort of this talk is based on
this but I after I went and and
travelled sort of halfway around the
world I got some perspective when I came
back by reading two specific books again
that sort of changed the direction of
this talk so how many people have read
don't make me think a lot of people if
you haven't go buy it
the revisited version is amazing so
Steve Krug originally came out with this
book in I think 2002 it's absolutely
amazing I reread it I realized along
with this book and this one how many
people have read about face three a few
people this is also another one I
consider these two books to be like the
holy grail of interaction user
experience design and just understanding
how to create an experience and that was
the key I I read these two books again
and I realized I wasn't focusing enough
on experiences so that's why I changed
essentially the title to you know
designing and documenting user
interactions experiences is pretty broad
everybody throws UX around and it
compasses everything so interactions is
a little bit nicer and
it's a little bit more specific as well
so let's let's dive into this I want to
sort of look at the typical workflows
that you probably are dealing with in
your company within your teams and I
want to sort of vet a few things about
them and then look at some problems and
how we're going to solve them so
stereotypical workflow of a project is
going to be something like ia or a
strategy phase that leads into some sort
of design and development phase this is
a little bit different sometimes it
doesn't necessarily happen have to
happen in this order or in order
obviously if you're working with in
agile developments or if you're working
you know in waterfall development then
this is maybe a little bit different how
you do this or maybe you do this more
often
so there's some stereotypical
stakeholders in this in this equation
one of them is your he's got sultry eyes
right now your hipster designer right
he's got these guys Instagram photo
which you know the Pantone's aren't
showing up and then your developer right
with the sweet beard no that's totally
me in like never but yeah these are
typically you got a designer developer
working on the team sometimes you have
your project managers but we're really
talking about the design process here
and they the responsibilities usually
break down to a designer or many
designers will take over the strategy
and this includes things like wireframes
and i8 documents they also include site
Maps potentially and you might have many
designers you might have many developers
but this is sort of how the
responsibilities are played out so the
designer takes over the ia and design
and development takes over the
development phase whether or not that
includes prototyping as well so there's
a few problems with this and it's the
problem our our problems arise in these
gaps so the gaps are essentially
deliverables or actually gaps for
communication so between here there's a
chance for something to be passed off or
communicated to somebody different or
there's something to be created a
deliverable at these times and this is
where problems start to arise within
documentation and within communication
within your team so what can start to
happen is it feels like a vacuum effect
and these two people are like hanging
out together and nobody else can listen
into the conversation if you are working
with big team if you have a number of
projects going on what happens is
there's really no communication outside
of that team and they're essentially
siloed and you're not sharing knowledge
sharing amongst your teams because of
the way that you're communicating and
the deliverables are essentially become
stagnant and your static so
communication is broken so what are the
stereotypical deliverables from this
process it comes from there's a bunch of
things but there's things like sketches
paper prototypes wireframes site maps ie
documents Photoshop files and well the
final website so if you got budget time
there's a couple other things that you
could do like mood boards style tiles
which are essentially kind of like mood
boards and functional prototypes you
could actually get developer to do a
couple rounds of like creating
prototypes or mocking out interaction
and going even further there's been a
couple really good examples of what
could be next to help communicate better
essentially your UI your UX and
essentially how a user is going to
interact with a website or web app so
company that I used to work for a
fantasy interactive Fi
does anybody know who they're one guy -
good
awesome so we used to create and the
internal team created a few times
essentially like UI libraries PSD s and
at one point even HTML CSS and J's
version of UI components that could be
reused within our projects and could be
shared with other designers or
developers and then built upon and you
could have multiple versions of these of
these files and that was really great
because they essentially helped us
standardize the way they look good feel
is going to happen how everything
interacts with each other and and it
really it was essential to us launching
a project that didn't have a ton of
inconsistencies tnan lakhs is actually a
local toronto agency and they are pretty
well-known for the fact that they create
like this UI library every time there's
a new iOS update and it's really
thorough extremely thorough and it's
another great example of creating a
document that essentially has all your
views all your components living in it's
great resource and a great UI library to
be shared within your team and then
there's this trend and I'm sure a lot of
people have seen a lot of people that
are on dribble will have hopefully seen
it of actually animating their designs
and showing interaction and you'll see a
lot of anime gifts that now actually are
are literally showing you what they want
to happen when when somebody hovers
clicks and this is really beautiful
except there's some problems with all
these every one of these every one of
these examples I just showed you every
one of these deliverables the problem is
that they are essentially decentralized
there is you know a mock-up or PSD
sitting somewhere you have no clue where
it is if you've got a Dropbox account
it's off in the ether and they don't
reflect reality in every single one of
those contexts you're viewing this asset
essentially within
not the actual context of a browser or a
webinar an app and they are also all
static so they require manually being
updated and versioning and all these
things so that this is theirs these are
three big problems with all of those
deliverables so we need living documents
and we need living documentation in
order for us to solve these problems so
good documentation is going to be
obviously very concise this is
descriptive this is very common
standardized easy to implement and
maintain I'm I can't stand here in front
of all of you and tell you something and
and then you go back to your teams and
if if it adds too much overhead it's not
going to work it's not going to be
implemented so there needs to be a
solution that is easy for you to
integrate into your workflow so and
essentially it needs to add value at the
very the very end of the day
documentation doing this documenting
your interfaces your interactions and
what you want your user to essentially
see and feel needs to add value so a bad
documentation obviously it's going to be
aloof confusing wrong you're hard to
maintain like I said and but essentially
what happens when you have bad
documentation is that you lose trust I
remember about five years ago creating
Facebook pages with FB XML or FB XHTML
or whatever it was and I remember
looking at the documentation expecting
that it was going to be up to date and
correct and when it was said that it was
supposed to give back some sort of
truthy value instead of a false e value
it was completely wrong the API was
completely off and that I lost trust in
developing on that platform so you
cannot cannot create bad documentation
and you have to have up-to-date
documentation or essentially it's like
this right sweet good luck man
have fun I would never want to go
wherever that is and I have no clue
where I would go even if I did know
which Street was watch like what's that
is that just like right into like is
that doesn't even connect I don't know
so oh you're on a trip man did you just
try going here
did he just say GPS lost that's a good
timing so yeah why wouldn't I document
well essentially if your project
life-cycle if you guys all work on
two-day projects is it going to add
value no it's going to add overhead if
you actually go out and try to implement
something that is more is better used in
long-term projects also the teaming
reach if you are a team of one if you're
a freelance developer a lot of times
it's not going to help you sometimes but
not all the time it's not going to help
you to really document each project that
you do for later on now there might be
reusable components of you know work
that you're doing that is good but I bet
it's not going to actually add that much
value for you and of course if the time
and cost isn't there and that
essentially goes back to the first two
whether it's timely and it's costly so
challenges with interactive
documentation well the challenges were
going to face is essentially context so
whether you're in mobile context browser
contacts app context how do we fix that
as well there's a whole bunch of slew of
issues with inheritance also you have to
essentially interactive documentation
requires visual aids it's not like
reference api's for let's say backbone
or any of the JavaScript libraries or
programming libraries you've probably
seen they don't really need to give you
an actual functioning version of the
code now if you've seen something like
CoffeeScript where you are
I think you've in Ruby at one point
Ruby on Rails you could actually run
code in the browser that was pretty cool
that was like a visual aid of the actual
functionality of a snippet of code this
is a requirement in this case for
interactive documentation multiple
languages the problem is this also spans
more than just JavaScript more than just
Ruby more than just PHP this spans HTML
CSS and JavaScript so when we're talking
about front-end development so there's a
couple examples of great interactive
documentation and I'm gonna actually
show you how to do this so bootstrap
everybody knows knows it everybody loves
it or hates it and whether you like it
or not they've got some of the best
interactive documentation I've ever seen
and we're some of the first to actually
do it and it's beautiful you can
essentially see a UI component see how
it's going to be used interacted with in
the context in which it's going to live
which is the browser whether you're
using Firefox whether you're using
chrome opera or using Safari this goes
on alright alright well who's using IE
here right yeah nothing come on I mean
is there a Microsoft cut here I'm sorry
I'm sorry if there is I don't want to
call you out
but yeah so bootstrap was one of the
first foundation is also very similar
they essentially are showing you how
something is going to look when
implemented along with the
implementation details right there and
it's beautiful that's a beautiful thing
BBC is also has a great example of their
own now I'm not sure what they're using
or whether it's like the other two
but it's another again great utilization
or great implementation of you know this
communicating their to their team or to
their developers you know this is how
we're going to implement X feature
component or interactive detail so there
are still some more problems actually
with these
apparently amazing examples they're all
static if you go to a bootstrap like
that there's some but if you don't like
bootstraps github essentially all these
documents are built statically right
they are manually updated in like
markdown files or HTML files and the
examples have to be updated again in
sort of separate markdown or HTML files
and then this is a problem right because
we still want living interactive
documentation so I know that the guys
here are gonna love this right I I saw
it I saw it come out I'm not sure if
anybody else did but Yelp actually has
living let's let's see if I can get this
in focus
I'm get to like oh that's why I get for
using like backgrounds size cover okay
there we go okay looks like well okay
sweet so this is actually their webpage
not their web page but this is what the
design is up there living style get
essentially this is being created from
their CSS code and using comment blocks
Starbucks actually I was very surprised
I'm not sure if there's any Starbucks
developers here but they also have
something similar in which they have
sort of a living style guide that
produces something similar to foundation
are similar to bootstrap in that you see
actor actual components right alongside
the implementation and of course github
was the first one to actually do this
let me go fullscreen again yeah some
crazy scroll bars going on here to
github was actually probably one of the
first to do this because of colony
and they also have something very
similar to the other two examples where
you can actually see all these
components how they are implemented and
how they actually look and feel and
interact so how are they doing this how
the game is done well they're doing
essentially stack file analysis and if
you want to get down to layman's terms
it's comment block parsing so if you've
ever seen comment blocks in like
JavaScript or you know there's style
guides to how you should be writing and
documenting your code your functional
code it'll look something like this
right so you have like the name of
whatever your function or methods going
to be or your class and then you have
you know the fact that it's constructor
down here you know you have an example
of the fact that you're listing all the
parameters that your method is going to
take as well as saying you know what is
going to be returned so this all goes
right in line into your code essentially
and this is great because this makes
sure that you can maintain this
documentation as you're developing now
the key here for us as front-end
developers we already have tools for
JavaScript stack file analysis comment
block parsing key here for us is going
to be to focus on CSS sort of the Wild
West and we're going to tame the wild
west by adding more structure to it so
why CSS it has context it has pseudo
classes and States which essentially let
us know what the the state is of that
component it's inherently visual so it's
going to meet that you know visual aid
requirement and it produces the
languages write CSS is like the glue
between you know HTML and JavaScript
kind of you know it's this the the thing
that makes everything look pretty and
gives it style essentially
so there are tools out there do this
right now and these are essentially what
I want you guys to take away with you at
the end of the day and actually start
implementing and working with your teams
to help create better workflows and
better communication and better
documentation at the end of the day so
KSS is actually a project by calmy of
github I'm not sure if there's anybody
from github here but he's awesome he
started this project about year and a
half ago I think he named it kind of
after himself like KSS yeah there you go
Niall stylesheets so essentially this is
a ruby gem it was kind of just like a
quick little project I think he put
together without much thought to it
although you know he was trying to solve
a problem and this is actually what
they're using at Gap they do a lot of
Ruby development there and they're
actually using this to generate their at
their documentation and actually Yelp is
using the Python a Python port of KSS
right now to generate theirs I'm sure
anybody from Yelp will be able to tell
you more about their actual
implementation and experience with this
after the talk so this is what a KSS
style guide comment block is going to
look like so this is what you would
actually implement into your CSS and
through your component into your
preprocessor of choice and it's very
similar to the way that you would do any
sort of programming documentation in
line you say essentially what the
component is you list all the states and
then for KSS specifically you have to
sort of say you know where does this
sort of component live and how can I
access it so it says at the bottom here
style guide to 1:3 and that just gives
it essentially a numerical value that
will get parsed out and sort of
organized your your your components so
this is example again of what gets
generated this is pretty much the
documentation or the github style guide
which all their desires and developers
use it's a centralized resource for them
to know essentially how to get work done
so you can again go to works by out
column KSS and check out some more
examples so KSS has a couple ports in
case you're not a big fan of gem
installs know ruby gems there's again a
grunt of course grunt task grunt KSS
there is a gulp if you're like super
into the new and awesome
it's the Gump Gump gulp port and python
KSS like I said before is what our PI
KSS is what Yelp is using so the process
of actually using this is that he
actually dynamically generates like JSON
objects and enforces structured common
thing so that you're gonna get less sort
of cruft I feel in your CSS there's
going to be a lot less people rewriting
display:block like a million times in
your CSS if it's inheriting from
something else believe me it's not going
to happen
position:relative is gonna only happen
like three times I'm telling you if you
did analysis is on your current code
base you realize that there's a ton of
redundancies that get reduced I so
encourages documentation in the States
it reduces run done and see not only in
your code but obviously within your
documentation you don't have to update a
component and then go to some other wiki
and update the documentation there and
it works with sass less and s CSS of
course awesome
the cons because it's never ok there's
never like a hundred percent solution
right there it's very strict so the
comment block that I showed you before
essentially that's how you have to
implement it so it's kind of strict in
the way that you have to format your
documentation
and Static sections this means that you
actually have to write in you know style
guide 1.12 that's going to have to be
manually updated every time you know you
want to put something or reorganize
something so and it doesn't really
address context very well as far as like
mobile or some sort of responsive
component and it doesn't address
inheritance issues that you're gonna get
when something extends like one
component extends from another base
class right so I create a project right
yeah no DSS right it's not named after
me I'm humble I'm Canadian
it's documented stylesheets just so
happens with Dee right you know Darcy
document it's fun no but so I started a
project essentially was originally a
port of up KSS but I want to take it one
step further I want to actually solve
some problems that I was seeing with in
interaction design and with in
interaction documentation so what is it
well it's essentially a documentation
tool just like a SS it's a style guide
just like KSS has you know the format
your comments in this style and it's a
comment parser right so it's gonna be
able to parse everything out for you
great so the pros of DSS same thing
dynamically generates an object
encourages structured commenting now the
difference here is that it encourages it
doesn't enforce write provides API for
custom detectors parsers templates so
this is awesome
and I'll show you why in a second but it
essentially will allow your team to come
up with your own conventions that are
useful for you and add value where you
need it and encourages documentation of
states reduces redundancy just like a SS
works with any file any file so this is
actually not a shame we called it
documents style sheets it should be
documented any file daffy the
af not cool but you know works with a
boss so we're talking stylus SES s s SAS
less you could really be commenting our
comment parts comment block parsing
javascript files at the same time with
the same tool and it separated the
concerns so in case this is
implementation the comment parser and
the actual documentation generator are
all in one library we've separated the
two so you'll see if you go to npm J's
org package DSS the parser is there you
can do whatever you want with it like
create a gulp abstraction again we don't
have a gulp package yet we just have a
grunt task and the grunt task here
essentially consumes the parser and then
generates the documentation for you so
when you're including this into your
project all you do is include you know
the grunt DSS as a task and you'll
automatically generate your
documentation you know every time you
build a new set of code so this is what
DSS style guide looks like it's very
similar to actually the more program ik
implementation of comment blocks so
you'll see that where I'm actually using
parameters in every case and this is
where you're going to get the
flexibility because you can essentially
create any variable name that you want
and we will parse it out and you will
have that value there so you can
basically come up with your own
terminology within your team and your
own requirements for your team to
essentially add value to your
documentation so if there's requires an
image or a visual aide or video or a
reference link you can add that in here
at your need for whatever you need so
there are only four defaults that the
actual parser comes and comes looking
for and those are the name description
state and markup and those are the
defaults that are in KSS so
we just said have the exact same
defaults so this will automatically get
pulled out of your CSS comment blocks
and be provided for you to use in a
template which is right now just
handlebars but you can use mustache
whatever you want so this is what a
state parse the state parser actually
looks like internally and we are
actually using our the exact same API
that is exposed to you guys and what you
can create on your own for your own team
so here essentially we're just getting
an index a line block file my formatting
is terrible don't look at that but but
yeah essentially and then we return an
object for us to use later on in our
template so that was the default that's
native built in native but this is like
this is an example of what you could do
free team so here is a link that I think
you know two issues I'm getting use it
somewhere in my template or it's gonna
be potentially an image whatever it is I
all I have to do is go at link it's a
brand new variable name was there a
requirement before but now let's say my
team always wants to have reference to a
specific issue image whatever it is we
add that in and then I just create my
own custom parser right called link and
you get the same things past that
callback and then I can do whatever I
want with essentially the string that
the the line that's being passed through
to this parser and I print return
whatever I want to be used again later
on in template so essentially what gets
built once we parse out your comment
blocks is just a JSON object so what do
we do with that is pass it to a
handlebars template and that generates
some HTML CSS and JavaScript so this is
what it looks like you can see name is
button with this
in your standard form button and then
there's a whole bunch of states in there
they also have a bunch of Associated
data to them so this is what it looks
like it looks almost the exact same to
you know KSS or the other the other sort
of ports but there's a future here there
let me let me refresh this hide it for a
second there is a future to this project
I'm not sure if KSS is dead in the water
they're still making ports of it but
it's not really being picked up I have a
deeply nested invested interest in
making this work and getting everybody
to use this project because I think it's
important and so in the next six months
you're probably going to see something
come out that is a Chrome extension and
essentially what that is going to do is
be able to record events so you would
basically hit a like a play button on an
extension and it's going to court almost
like a session if you ever done selenium
testing or anything like that you'll
know that you can you know then replay
back a set of events on a component or
on essentially UI piece or HTML CSS and
JavaScript and what I want to do is get
to the point where you're looking at a
video of real HTML CSS and JavaScript
actually in front of you you're looking
you can press play button and watch an
interactive experience happen in front
of you that was documented in the way
that the developer designer had foreseen
it and wanted it to be implemented so
you could then have a whole bunch of
these sort of experiences in your
documentation to show how things should
be used and in the future we also want
to sandbox the components right now they
all live in the same Dom they should
really be living in little iframe little
iframe sandbox
contexts so that we can actually
showcase things like you know responsive
or different sort of mobile contexts to
give you a better sense of you know the
way that something's actually supposed
to look and feel in something other than
the current browser and current width
and screen width of your device so some
things to keep in mind the holistic
problem that I was talking about at the
our problem solving that was talking
about at the beginning if more people I
feel look at problems from a business
standpoint design standpoint development
standpoint it's easier to communicate
and that's the way I look at it and you
know I feel that that's adding value
focus on experience right and centralize
your documentation and resources doing
that will be easier for you to actually
maintain them implement documentation
tools like DSS KSS are their ports make
sure that they're actually dynamic user
maintained help communication increase
consistency and add value Thanks
so I've already knows but I will take
any questions I'm not sure how we're
doing for time here pretty good I will
take any questions yes sir
right so you're saying if you're sort of
generate are creating your code in such
a way and you're sort of enforcing good
practices within your team already that
I think that this can be be done slowly
over time you don't need to like start
this like from day one it's not like
sort of like you know you can start
adding documentation as you're building
out new components I'm not quite sure
like I think the problem is that you
aren't if you have a huge team not even
a huge team but if you have a team of
developers and potentially you're
creating again a you lot a UI library
are working on a product or project
that's fairly large it's going to reuse
a lot of the same styles it's it's
necessary for you to have a resource
that is centralized that essentially
shows you how to implement the button
and so that you aren't funding
redundancy or duplication within code
and it's very hard for you to once your
code gets big enough it's very hard for
you to know what's in there without
having to go then dig into or have an
IDE that lets you know every class that
is available to you I still yeah yeah
I'd love to hear more about what you're
thinking there sure
I think style tacos kind of limited
right but most of them are just doing
like markdown parsing they're not really
enforcing that much of it like I feel
KSS and we do to some extent although
I'm very like also encouraging the idea
for you come up with your own paradigms
for your own teams I feel like I think
style dokko is very more freeform right
so just essentially markdown that does
all the examples so most processors
actually take out comments so this
wouldn't be a problem so long as you
actually do the grunt test run the grunt
tops before you would run your let's say
your sass or your CSS or your stylus
compilation so that wouldn't be a
problem as far as minification and their
way a taint bloat and and really you've
seen this for a long time in the
programming world so I don't think it's
adding that much overhead I think it's
just you know whipping the sort of front
end designer you know front end HTML CSS
guy into shape a little more and
providing more structure to the work
that they're doing for the greater good
of you know your team but yeah you won't
add any fights or spaces if you're still
using some sort of preprocessor built to
all that work that will get actually
stripped out so does anybody know what
react is right angular right you guys
all know so that that was part of it I
saw in that survey if you guys go check
that out
really cool data that angular was really
high on the things that people want to
learn more about what you're starting to
see is a lot more components being all
centralized all the HTML the JavaScript
sort of be centralized into sort of like
these view or like these sort of render
methods so like react
for instance allows you to create like a
view or component just inside like a
return statement essentially and it
actually generates like an object but I
see essentially you adding documentation
at that level about the UI component so
that that's it's sort of like a win
because we as you're doing stacks file
analysis so it doesn't really matter
we're just essentially doing like reg X
on a string so you really you could do
it you could have this kind of parser
essentially look over at JavaScript file
PHP file or whatever you want but I just
I see it kind of incentivized by being
running it over JavaScript files when
you have sort of a a component that's
actually instead of you living in a
separate handlebars or mustache file
it's actually living in your JavaScript
I see that adding value commenting about
it at that point that so like we don't
we basically if you didn't using
parameters like the app variable
essentially doesn't enforce any sort of
style or paradigm whereas the way that
they KSS sort of approached it was much
like I think some other programming
comment block parsers and style guides
that you would have the first line be
the name so you wouldn't have to do at
name and that convention sort of to me
felt very strict because the first line
should be whatever you want to be so
that's why I mean by strict and I don't
I feel like we've sort of addressed that
like in the
and the that the way that you can
basically create any value is just by
setting like a variable it's very
flexible and in fact that you can have
any variable there yeah oh you have or
no right
so essentially KSS right the first line
is actually the name so that's like
strict the first the line in the comment
block is going to be the name and then I
think the last line is going to be the
style guide like number right right so I
would look at the guy that you're
handing the mic to right there at Peter
lubbers and I'd be like hey google
chrome's got this great emulate you know
essentially overrides functionality to
it right and yeah pretty much emulates
most devices in such a way right now
could you speak of maybe Peter a little
bit more how it's actually doing that as
it's just changing user agent that that
is an option at this point
but okay so but essentially there are
some other tools that can help you I
totally understand the context problem
and my solution right now is to
initially sandbox each component and
what we can do is essentially your media
queries will work but if you have
JavaScript in there that's going to try
to detect other things and do feature
detection that will change the way the
components going to work or look that's
not going to be implemented unless you
do something that's essentially
emulating that experience and there's a
there's only so far we could probably go
with showing you all the different
contexts of that component like in your
documentation without yeah does that
sort of answer your question no no yeah
like I'm I'm interested to try to solve
that I think with some help from actual
browsers when you're viewing you know if
there was a
Chrome experimental API that I could use
to turn on emulation of certain things
then that would be really cool and maybe
you guys could you know talk to some
Googlers about it but that that's
essentially if there was integration
with the browser to help with that then
that and that would be where you could
potentially see a really robust people
like working living component that the
that you can you know turn to you know
iOS 5 and you see what it's going to
look like and how it's going to react so
anybody else though this guy up front
yeah so perfect question that wasn't on
sort of the Future list it's definitely
like in like pretty much a branch
locally right now so it's it's gonna
come there and that is very useful so
that's a great question as far as
variables or anything that's specific
even CSS variables are going to be like
right around the corner natively you
know how that sort of comes along with
some other things that I'm trying to
address with pre-processors especially
like extending from certain classes so
I'm working on trying to solve that as
well as the inheritance issue so imagine
you have one you know grid component
that then and or you have a navbar
component which gets its insert into
like a grid component it's gonna
potentially inherit some styles and the
only way to really address that you
still almost do kind of like source maps
and then compile your CSS from the
preprocessor get the compute styles to
figure out what was actually inherited
from the browser and then do some cool
stuff so there's some cool stuff I'm
looking at to try address that spinning
up headless browsers and things like
that too to do that but yeah as far as
anything that's specific to
pre-processors like variables
mix-ins that's all going to be hopefully
addressed at some point and provide to
you in that JSON object so again it's
very flexible eventually you'll just
have potentially something that's just
like variables and it's going to show
you everything for that specific
component or that that component like is
using right so you can have reference to
this sure I was actually going to
include I had about a hundred and forty
or fifty slides and then I got them down
to a hundred and three so I had a number
of slides where I talked about stuff
like that there's being this ongoing
like I could probably like actually
reinsert them they're just like
commented out but there's being
obviously it was big hubbub of are this
I hate this this phrase designers should
learn to develop right no I hate that
right
why don't developers learn to design man
like no no I think that it's sort of
looking at from one angle I I think that
everything is designed essentially a
design is a really bad word to talk
about who it is you know developers
archetype or they design systems and
frameworks and and all these things they
design this stuff business models are
designed so so the communication I think
will only come when everybody starts to
understand each other's jobs better so I
learned a little bit of code you learn a
little bit about design and why it's
important to me and that's that's why I
think and I talked about it initially
about the way that I'm able to plonk
myself down in a position and talk to a
team I'm able to understand the goals
and objectives of everybody that much
better and so that's why I can get on
board on on new ideas and understand the
reasoning behind people's decisions and
then you get this shared responsibility
so a designer if they have a little bit
more
standing of code and you have a little
bit more understanding of design you're
going to work a lot better together be a
little bit more flexible and then you're
going to work together to meet a certain
objective so if one of those objectives
is to have documentation which is going
to help you know you the rest of your
team implement consistent you know UI
across the board then I feel like that's
and if that's a business objective then
you understand
the reason why you're doing the work
you're doing and why it's important to
do it and why it's important to you know
document you know your CSS if your
designers aren't coding and you're
essentially getting a handoff then
there's that gap that I was talking
about and that's going to be a lot
harder for you to because it you know
the responsibilities then just on one
person to come up with us though
