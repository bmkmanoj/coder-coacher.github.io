here at four GS I was actually in the
past one which was six months ago I
suggested Dave since it's one of the few
conferences that are done like twice a
year to use chamber so that they can use
like minor version for every conference
per year and every time they change your
major version or something like that
because it's confusing to have like two
conferences of the same the same year I
don't know anyway so I'm here to talk to
you about basically if reactive front
end and that means that i'll be talking
about observables streams and reactive
programming so hands up who has used
observables before ok it's not that many
that's good because that means that
you'll earn more probably so my name as
I was saying is marking on tonica's but
since we are in the tech world my
twitter handle is and bondo if you want
to follow me and increase my ego I would
greatly appreciate it so let me first
introduce myself i'm a software
developer from buenos aires argentina so
this is my accent I hope you can
understand it and I work at odds ero odd
zero is basically a SAS that helps you
with authentication authorization the
idea is that you pick an SDK for like
angularjs no chairs iphone android
whatever and then with a couple lines of
code you get authentication working with
username and password or social things
like Twitter Facebook get come or
enterprise providers like Active
Directory l-dub sam'l unfortunately I've
run out of t-shirts so I want to be able
to make you be my walking promotion
today but next time probably had some so
I used to be their coding JavaScript all
day long so this was me basically and
now i'm actually a developer advocate
and a lot of people ask me what does it
mean to be a developer advocate and
basically it's the same that i was doing
when i was 17 this is me singing in a
karaoke but instead of singing in a
karaoke and now speaking a lot
technology in different events in order
to speak you still have to learn and for
learning again programming so
this dog is actually about reactive from
them so let's actually start with that
but before starting I want to give you a
warning let me actually increase the
size this is the great thing about doing
presentations with HTML you just zoom in
and everything works so we are going to
learn a little bit about functional
programming we're going to learn little
bit about reactive programming what
we're not learning anything about
functional reactive programming if I say
functional reactive programming too many
times a castle programmer would come and
shoot at me basically so we're not
learning about that just in case if
somebody here is a helical programmer
we're not doing that so one question
that a lot of people of people ask it's
like why should we go functional so I
have a very nice familiar imperative
code like the one that we see here this
function is just basically checks for
odd numbers so it creates a results awry
and then it iterates over all day the
day they parameter that I got I does it
for each to that and then for every
number it checks if it's all and if it's
all it adds it to the results object
with some exclamation marks and then
returns the result something that we can
see here is that we're creating this
result object this result era in the
beginning and then every time we iterate
and we find an odd number we are
mutating this result and then eventually
returning so this actually works
perfectly this is nice so why should we
actually go functional why should we
learn functional programming and the
thing is that shallow script as you know
it is going to change very soon and why
is that because course aren't getting
much faster so a few years ago you were
actually coding an application for the
roaster in JavaScript I was like really
slow really really really slow so what
did you do to make it faster you waited
three months to release it and that
works because people CPU people's
processors would get faster so in three
months i'm the best programmer in the
world because now is like really perform
and it's working very well but
unfortunately we don't have that
advantage anymore because now course
aren't getting much faster so what are
escaping
now instead of having one chord we're
having two four eight sixteen twenty and
what that means is that if we want to
make our applications faster in the
browser we can't just wait now we need
to be able to write code that will run
in this super in this separate course
and what that means is that real
concurrency is coming to JavaScript so
this is the face the first time I said
this is the faces of the people like
really is real concurrency coming to
share a street what does it mean we
don't have to change all my code and the
nice thing is that it's not yet there
but that's the main reason why you
should learn functional programming
because functional programming actually
has goals that aligns with parallelism
so that means that if I'm writing code
that will run in separate concurrent
course functional programming is good
for that and that is because it embraces
in mutable state which means that state
cannot change and it also embraces note
side effect in order to explain no side
effects really really easy it means that
if I'm calling a function with X it will
always return why so that means that
whatever the function does doesn't
depend on external state and doesn't
modify external state if I find a
function that returns nothing it has
side side effect because it's probably
doing some change to some state so why
is this good for concurrency because so
who here has worked with red setter in
like java.net or something like that
hands up I'm sorry for you so if you
have done that you have used probably
logs or moot X or stuff like that
because let's imagine you have a thread
that writes one thread that reads and
they are both operating on some state
and if the one that writes does it
before the one that reads everything
works but if the one that reads is
reading something before it's written
well it won't work in order to make that
work I needed to add locks more eggs are
like nights and it was like really hard
but the thing is that if we now have
some state that doesn't change if we
come in new level state that means that
one through it doesn't have to wait for
another and
one curve race conditions anymore and if
a function doesn't change state and all
it does is given an extra quest always
return why it's much easier to devour
it's much easier than to maintain so
that's that's the main reason why you
should learn functional programming so
what does it mean to do functional
basically we can already do it with
JavaScript we can call this map filter
introduced methods and it works so this
is the same function that I showed
before and what it's doing is again it's
receiving an array of numbers as a
parameter it's then it's then calling
this filter method with a function and
what this does is when i call this
filter i'm sending a predicate that will
check for every number to see if it's
odd or not so we will iterate over all
the numbers of the collection see if
they are all or not and if they are odd
they will be added to a new arrive that
new array is returned from this filter
and then to that new RI i'm calling this
map function which basically iterates
again over all of the elements of the
array and it just returns that element
plus some exclamation marks it again
returns and you are right and then
that's returned so the main difference
that we don't have this results object
that we used to cover so we're not
mutating state we're basically creating
our rights on every step so this is
immutable we're not creating new object
so this will be much easier to paralyze
it will be much easier to work once we
actually have from currency in
JavaScript so that's it that's the end
of the top right and the thing is that
it's not because I had a friend who was
actually working at Netflix and he
actually encountered a problem with this
approach so let me first tell you about
the application they were doing an
application that's called Argus and it's
basically a real-time dashboard for
netflix what they were doing is they
have like all of the people that were
watching netflix they cut stats for them
like how many movies were they seeing
how many TV shows were they seeing how
much time where they paying attention or
not so we cut like docents of graphics
it has web sockets what it could get
real time information for people
watching netflix at that time and also a
lots of rich user
interaction which means clicking on a
button or things like that so this is
the app so as you can see you can it
have like a cross square you can zoom in
you can change like one day two days and
you can see in real time all of the
information that is fallen with lots of
graphics and lots of interactions so
they built it they use functional
programming because then they wanted to
paralyze this in the future and they
worked towards the first big demo and
they were feeling like really confident
because they created reusable components
for these graphics they were also
getting all of the information in real
time from the web sockets they were
using a very big test data and they got
all of the most interactions working so
they were really really happy they were
like this is gonna work so on a demo day
they decided to connect this to the
production database and well this
happens
yeah that's the thing with at escaping
after it broke so this is what happened
and why did this happen because they
were using too much functional
programming they were using a lot of
arrived map feature introduced and
what's the problem because let's if we
go again to the functional i showed you
before i was calling first a filter and
then a map how did it work the filter
iterated over all the elements of the
array that it got it checked for the
odds and return the new all right then
we call them up they map iterated again
over all the elements of the array added
! and return than you are right so that
means that every operation that I doing
here is first iterating over all the
elements of the collection again so if I
have filter map filter map I will
iterate over all the elements of the
collection four times and also each of
those return mu RI so in this case I'm
returning a function we don't need the
last arrived so i'll link them
intermediary arrays that are created for
the filter map filter map which are for
new arise I don't care about them but
they are created and they need to be
garbage collected and garbage collection
takes a lot of time if you have too many
arise and also iterating over eleven
also take a lot of time so that means
that nothing worked because they had too
much information too much intermediary
arise too much garbage collection and
this is when reactive programming
actually comes because what they
realized is that well we need stream
processing what we need is reactive
extensions of troubles so what is an
observable how do we use it it's
basically the same instead of saying our
I Peter map will you observe all filter
map so it's pretty much the same like if
you see the syntax but what it's doing
behind is very different because when
i'm doing the filter on map to the array
it's iterating returning new array when
i do it on an observable it's specifying
some transformation that i want to
happen so that means that when i do this
offshore oil filter map nothing happens
all I'm doing here is defining a
transformation chain that will occur
once I need to get the information and
once I need to get them
mention what it will do is it will
iterate over all the elements from this
basic observable and for each of them
first it will run this filter operation
we will say it is other and if it's if
it's ordered it will then if it Fleur if
it's not only will say okay I don't care
if it is odd then it will run it through
the map operation and add this
exclamation marks so no intermediary
array is created and I'm iterating over
the main collection this observable only
once and that's like pretty nice but the
question is what else can observables do
and it comes to the definition of an
observable and observable is basically a
representation of any collection of
values throughout any time so what does
it mean an array is a collection of
values at an instant time because right
now i'm creating this array with four
values and that arrived it's basically a
collection of values but that means that
this this is not only an RI it could be
for example Mouse events so Mouse events
are basically click click click it's an
event object so we could create an
observable which is a collection of
event object throughout time because I
click it now I click it in 10 seconds
again I click it in 20 seconds then so I
can cover an obscure all throughout
those 30 seconds I will have these three
click events and it's a collection of
values over sometime so that is pretty
cool and and the thing is that absorbs
can be merged concatenated and sipped
like any other collection so if you have
used lodash or underscore all of the
methods that exists there like gnarly
like this submersion or cabinet but
intersect union all of them that exist
there also work on observables you can
also run all of those operations in an
observable and also create your own and
the thing is that observables are
basically a pattern to do three things
first to start another dream is that a
stream so to set it up then to a meet 0
to end messages and those messages are
run through this transformation chain
and once that transformation chains ends
I'm tearing down this observable and I
can do some operation when I'm turning
it down so this is a
all that observable is we will see nests
in a minute in a few minutes like two
examples of how we can do that so that
it's not like this theoretical but
something is important and what is the
data stream and data stream can be an
array of data it can be mouse and
keyboard interaction Dom events network
i/o animation speech recognition choice
think input or anything anything that is
a collection of values through time can
be an observable that's basically these
are just examples of things that you can
do with that so meet while going back to
netflix ops Rawls actually solve another
problem for them and it's that sockets
die so this ticket is this application
this dashboard with what web sockets
connected to every customer day care so
imagine that I'm looking at the
dashboard and I'm like yeah this is cool
but I gotta move trailer building so I
closed the laptop lid the minute that I
close the laptop lid that socket is
killed and then when i go back i open it
back that socket has to be relieved
however it's not that easy because when
when you were seeing that dashboard you
were actually connected to 10 of
different web sockets each of those web
sockets must receive a subscription
message and then you got like different
messages from them which you didn't know
which ones you got until now and when
it's closed and reopened that means that
i have to keep state of which sockets I
I had called before at what state they
were where they didn't have the
subscription did I not and that's like
really complicated but this could be an
example of how we can actually use
observables to solve it so what they
created is first a socket observable and
what you see here is the same pattern as
before so in the setup of this
observable basically the web socket is
open then it emits the 0 to n messages
so it gets all the messages from the web
socket and once all the web or all the
messages are sent or if there's an error
in the web socket and a connection is
closed I get either than ever and it
closes the soccer the socket or I get
all the messages and again it close to
the socket so this is a basic of trouble
that rubs the web socket and then they
had a multiplex data
trouble built on top of that and what
that did is on the set up after the
WebSocket was opened its end the
subscription message then they filtered
out all of the results that they cared
and then once it when he was about to
tear down the socket it would send the
unsubscribe message and the most
interesting part of this is that
observables can retry so in this sale
decoder what you can see is that I'm
first sending the subscription message
that I am filtering over I'm getting all
their results from the rubble I am
filtering over them and then eventually
i'm sending this and subscription and
the nice thing about this is that if the
laptop is lee disclosed that socket will
error out and when that socket errors
out I can use this retry operation and
what the Richer i will let me do is we
try the whole of trouble again what does
it mean to retry the whole of trouble
again it means to open again the
WebSocket connection send the
subscription message and start getting
information again so i don't have to
code all of that redo and things like
that i can just use this retry operator
which will take care of actually
retrying until it works because the
dates observable is erroring out because
the WebSocket was actually disconnected
this is a pretty complicated example but
we'll see a more simple example in a
second so before continuing one fair
warning you should never trust the video
/ that has nothing but to say so in this
case what is bad is that our xjs so
using of troubles has a pretty decent
learning curve so in order to use
observables you have to change the way
you think about the problem because it's
different how to set the problem app
versus how you do it normally and then
there are a lot of operators that you
need to learn not only this map reduce
filter that you have this retry map
latest select latest there are a lot of
them and you'll have to learn a few of
them so that you can actually use them
what happens to me a lot is that I don't
know what an operator exists so I built
it myself and I'm like oh this existed
so why did i lose my time as well that's
like part of learning this basically
another thing for observables is that
sometimes they work a sink and sometimes
the works inc so for the dying that come
bring a few problems so before going to
the two examples i want to show one more
thing which is when we were coding
before let's imagine that we had a value
C and C depending on a mb so I have a
plus B and then eventually i'm doing
something with see if AMV change i have
to be aware of that change I can change
again see that means that C is like
completely coupled to a and B because
every time that a or we change I need to
know of that change so i can change back
see the next thing with observables is
that i can actually have an an
observable of day and after all of B and
I can combine them and create a new
observable of C and now I can work with
this absurd Loxy and whenever something
changes or on a or b that will
automatically change this observable see
and what that means is that it's not
coupled that now i only have to care
about this sea of trouble I don't care
with it where it comes from because I
know that I will always get the right
information but the question is like how
can we use this today what can we do to
use it today right now and for that
we're basically going to use our xjs
which is reactive extension for
javascript this letter e was created by
microsoft one of the main guys who did
it was a dick Meyer who is like a genius
in functional programming and of
struggles in general so it's a pretty
good library and for these examples i
will be using the angular toolkit so
this means that all of the examples are
angular code however all of all of what
i show works for angular works for react
works for jquery they work for
everything and reactive extensions have
toolkit for all of those frameworks
because the core is always the same they
just have like a little layer on top
that will make it to be easy to code in
that library or framework so let's
actually start simple let's imagine a
counter up a counter up is like the
hello world for observables so here I
cali bhutan and rittiman click on the
boot on the counter increases however
what you can see is that the counter is
not increasing always the same amount
every time I click it it chris is a
different amount
and that's because what I'm doing is I'm
going to a server I'm asking the server
what number should I increase the
counter when I get back the result then
I first knock that somewhere and then I
just increase this counter so basically
it's increasing a different number
because I'm getting that value from the
server so how do we implement this first
we have a button and this ng-click is
like an unclick it's basically an click
handler and what I'm saying is whenever
this is click call this function this
increase counter function and then i'm
just showing the counter value which
will keep on changing whenever I click
so if you write like regular angularjs
called a regular front-end code you will
have this increase counter function is
increased counter method which will be
the event handler and in there what I'm
doing is I'm first asking my API server
get the counter amount so I'm saying API
server how much should I count once i
get the value of how much i should count
I then log it to some other server
because for me it's important to log it
and once I get that back I just update
this counter object with whatever it cut
before plus what the server just
returned and that's what every time that
I click it that's what it's increasing
the number so this is how I would do it
regularly writing like normal javascript
code in this case with promises it could
be with coal box or with anything else
so how do we turn this to an obscure oh
and this is basically a code the first
thing that we're doing just because it
is angular is studying the module
dependency for RX if we were using
jQuery or react we would just either
include the script tag in the index dot
HTML or we would use like comment je s
or import system from atmospheric 6 and
we would import this rx dependency once
we have that RX dependency we're calling
this dollar create ops are all function
so what this is doing is every time that
this increased counter is clicked it
will add a new value to my stream to my
infinite list so this blur creative
travel function will return me an
infinite list of clicks at first it will
be empty but then
everything that somebody clicks in there
I will have a new value so imagine that
it's empty some of the clicks i get a
value right now five seconds later
somebody clicks I get a second value to
this infinite click 10 seconds later
somebody clicks then I have a third
value in this test so all this is doing
is creating this infinite list of clicks
and after this what I'm adding is the
transformation chain that I said before
so the first transformation that I'm
doing is I'm converting the clicks to
the counter amount i need to some on
each step so ekkada click click click
now i will get three four five and
that's because for each click i'm
actually converting that to a number
that i got from the server once i got
that i need to love it to a server and
that log server function is a function
that class a side effect why is that
because it returns nothing so I mean
that it's doing something that has a
side effect something that is cool about
observes is that we can use this do
function which let's be isolated side
effects so they don't bother the rest of
my goal so we here I'm just logging that
number and after that i'm using this
scan function and I'm it's basically a
sum its timing every new value that I
get to the one that I previously had so
again I gotta click click click let's go
transform two three four five and now
it's gets transformed the first value is
3 because it was 0 plus three equals
three the second value will now be seven
because I had the three I got the four
three plus four equals seven and the
last number will actually be at 12
because I her a seven I received a five
now I got 12 I did practice the math I'm
not that good at math I always come like
this that what does it mean that means
that i had click click click that goal
converted two three four five and that
now got converted to 3 7 12 and at this
point this is the point at which i want
to show the values in the UI this is the
point of this transformation chain that
I care about and that's when I usually
subscribe please subscribe
it's what changes this stream into an
observable and that's because it's still
an infinite list but now I'm observing
the value because I now I care what
value it has so this subscribe is the
one that is actually running all of the
transformation or they put before if I
only put before the flood map they do
one scan and I didn't have any subscribe
this would know nothing and that's
because as I said before an observable
is lazy and observable is just a
definition of transformation that I want
to apply at a certain time and this
subscribe is what is triggering these
transformations because I'm saying I
care about the values and since I care
about the values those values need to be
calculated and that means that these
transformations have to rerun so in here
and saying I clear about this 37 12 so
let's subscribe to that and every time
you get a new number in this infinite
list notify me so I get this counter and
then I'm just setting that to the dollar
scope doc counter so it gets shown in
the UI I let that sink for a minute
second parameter that we have here in
the subscribe it's a function that we
let me handle errors the nice thing
about this is that this error function
we let me handle errors that can't
happen either in the flood map in they
do in the scan throughout the
transformation chain whatever ever is
there I can actually cuddle handle it in
here in this subscribe and that's it
that's all I need I'm in this case I'm
showing everything because I converted
click click click 2 3 4 5 and then 2 3 7
12 then I'm saying okay I'm gonna show
that so i showed the three then s 7 10
to 12 and that will showed every time
that somebody clicked and the nice the
last thing is that enough soul will
always keep on running and that will
occupy memory so what i'm doing here is
that when somebody goes out of this
website of this page in particular i
need to dispose this of trouble so that
the memory is not used anymore because
this infinite list is infinite so it
will always be waiting for new values if
i'm leaving this page that means that no
new value will come so i need to tell it
disposed yourself so
but you can be garbage collected
basically so this was my expression the
first time I studies it was like it
seems cool but I'm not a hundred percent
sure that I'm getting what happens so I
don't know if it's because like I'm a
child inside and I like two years old
but I understand things with graphics so
this is what has been happening and
doing promotion to offer apparently this
is what happens we got first a click in
this case a circle and that went through
a box that is a transformation chain so
that click got converted to a three that
three is now this diamonds diamonds a
really hard word to learn in English
really hard so because in Spanish it's
rhomboids I completely different anyway
we got the cliq converted to the three
the three is this diomond and then we're
converting this dyamond to a sum that
Sam is a square so now I cut this some
again we had the cliq went to a
transformation chain three went to a
transformation chain 3 again however at
some point in time maybe in 10 seconds
maybe in 20 I got another click and then
that new click that I just received got
again through all the transformational
change so that clicked got converting
now into a 5 no sorry to a four and that
for got now converted into a seven and
then I want another click and that keeps
on happening so if I could be like I
don't know Superman or whatever and I
could be seeing this infinite list
throughout time so if I didn't know
exactly that time this would be what it
looks like imagine that this line is
like infinite it means like 10 hours so
throughout 10 hours I got 10 clicks
which God immediately converted to 10
numbers which then God immediately
converted to 10 sums and at that point I
care and I'm showing it so this is
this is the most important thing to
understand and when I understood it I
was like yay I got it but once I got it
it was like click on the counter are
very few events so why do I use observe
those for that
I was like yeah it's good but it's like
really not that useful so let's actually
do an example with more events so now we
have this for Chase is awesome and
whenever I move the mouse the forward
Jesse saw some texts will follow me so
if I move it fast it will follow me fast
and this is example at we're going to
will now something important for example
from when we see the code if I move the
mouse you can see that the letters move
one at a time they don't move
immediately after the mouse they move
one at a time actually the 100
milliseconds difference between each
other so how do we implement the photo
Chase is awesome because this is
obviously something that you would do in
production in every website rights so
how do we do it so in this case I'm
creating a web component with a
directive on angular it's not important
it's basically saying it will occupy the
whole screen and the text will be power
j s it's awesome and then i'm creating
this wave component in angular with a
detective it's not important how I
define it but the important thing is
this I'm having first a div which is the
one that occupies the whole screen and
I'm adding an event for mouse move so
whenever the mouse is moved through out
the window anywhere I want to be called
to this function is called mouse move
then I'm coming a deep which is called
text container and that deep text
container will have all these praise for
Jas is awesome and then inside there I
will cover sorry I will call once panel
for each layer of the phrase so one for
the f1 4014 aww and so on and each of
those letters each of those funds will
be absolutely positioned I'm setting
that position absolutely so that I can
move them around the window so this is
the template and we have right now now
let's see how we coat it with this
template so again first thing we do is
we call this dollar creative cell
function Mouse moved so what I am i
creating now i'm creating an infinite
list of mouse moons so whenever the
mouse is moved i'm getting a new event
new item on this infinite list and the
first thing that I'm doing is I'm
converting these mousemove events into
an offset so this is the text container
this is a text this is the mouse I move
the mouse in this precise moment there's
a difference between the position of the
text and the position of the mouse so
what I'm doing is I'm converting the
mouse move event 2012 to a list of
offset between the phrase and the mouse
pointer once I have this list of offsets
I actually have to convert that to an
upset / letter because I will need to
move each letter separately so I shall
one offset / / word / phrase every time
that the mouse is moved now what I'm
doing is I'm actually returning a new
are a new observable inside so what I'm
doing is I shall mouse move mouse move
mouse move I converted that to off set
off set off set and now each of this off
set off set off set will be converted
not to one value but to multiple values
it will be converted to one letter so to
one value sorry per letter that is on
the phrase so mrs. Cadogan must move
mouse move mouse move that will convert
it to upset upset upset now we'll have f
with upset oh we have set W with
opposite burn f wit upset oh it upset w
with offset all the rest f we'd upset Oh
would upset value with offset and all
the rest so now I'm having in this
observable one value per letter and
upset that I need to move and now it's
actually time to duel animation because
I need to move now each of these letters
at a different point in time so now
again I cut the text here mouse pointer
here I move the mouse pointer I got the
offset per letter but now I need to
start moving the earth so move the F
move the whole movie w and that means
that I need to move these values one at
a time throughout time because as I said
before I don't want to move the
more than at the same time each letter
moves differently and this is another
place where i can actually use of trolls
because an array is a collection of
values at an instant time but another
level is a collection of values
throughout time so what i can do is this
timer that you see here this timer
operator lets me add let me actually
convert one battle i had before into a
value that will be added to this
infinite list at a certain point in time
so i cut the f with the upset they all
with the opposite and the w with the
upset and now what I'm saying is now
with this our information send the f
with the offset right now send them all
with the offset that you need to move in
100 milliseconds send the W with the
upset that you need to move in 200
milliseconds and so on so we here i'm
doing a transformational is not only
transforming a value to another it's
transforming the time at which this
element will be added to the observable
and now what I got from here is the f
with the officer I need to move at the
CDO millisecond they all with the offs
that it needs to move in 100
milliseconds later the W with the
obsolete needs to move in 200
milliseconds and at this point again I
care about what's going on so again in
this case I subscribe and now i will be
getting the letter that i need to move
which and which offset and that's where
I move the letter i also will get these
values at the 100 milliseconds
difference so I don't even know it here
but i will get called to this function
with a 100 milliseconds difference and
that is what will be making this
animation work that is what will we what
will be making that whenever I move the
mouse each of the letters move one at a
time and then again a couple is posted
so after this it was like yay now I can
finally understand observers I can find
understand like the potential that they
have but if you just saw that I showed
you it's not that easy to understand at
first and that's what I meant when you
said that you need to change how you
think about problems because
just has tons of different mouse move
events we've eaten animation and that's
something that is not really easy to
make without observables with levels it
was easier it was just for
transformations and maybe six lines of
code / transformation but in order to be
able to read that you have to change the
way you think about the problem so it
makes sense in your head to actually do
that so something important is that this
is actually just the beginning chef r
cosine who is actually my friend that
works at netflix hissing the tc39 and
he's actually proposing of struggles to
be added to the browser like promises
exists now probably soon we will also
come up struggles in a browser so that
means that it's a pretty good moment to
start learning a lot of troubles because
they will actually be part of the
browser itself it won't be a library
they will be part of the browser that's
a proposal that he's sending to the feet
tc39 and also our thing is that if
you're using any other library any other
language and it's not gel script you can
still use it there's RX java RX net so
there's a reactive extension which is
the laterally that lets me to observe us
for each of the languages that are out
there so even if you don't do javascript
you can do this same thing because the
concepts are all the same once you
understand what observable is you just
have to learn the syntax but other than
that it's the same in whichever language
whichever framework which ever anything
so my proposal is basically to start
reacting to everything it's not react
from facebook is reactive one more thing
before ending let me actually zoom it so
in this link if you go there you will be
able to get these lights that I've just
shown you also all of the examples that
I've just showed you right now they were
actually coded they are not like the
document that doesn't compile they were
actually coded so you will be able to
get those examples from there another
thing that you will see there are some
additional links reactive regarding
reactive programming basically it's a
crucial occurs about reactive
programming by other ski and edit Meyer
which is absolutely great and an egghead
course out our xjs and how to use it
it's actually pretty good
so that's it
