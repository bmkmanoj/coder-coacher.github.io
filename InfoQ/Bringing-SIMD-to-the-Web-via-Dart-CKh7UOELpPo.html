my talk is going to be pretty low level
so I hope you enjoyed Seth's talk which
was nice and high level gooey stuff I'm
going to go right into the vm so let's
have some fun to give you an idea of my
background it's a little bit different
to be at a like a web development talk
when I was in university I wrote
something called inotify which is a
module for the Linux kernel that does
file system notifications so if
something changes on your disk an event
will be delivered to an application it's
used everywhere every Android phone uses
it every linux desktop of your linux
server is using inotify after doing that
I started working at PlayStation where I
helped port bullet physics which is a 3d
physics library to the PlayStation 3
which was a lot of fun because the ps3
has a very interesting cpu architecture
with these cpus called SPU's which are
they're interesting in that they can't
access main memory directly so it takes
a lot of juggling to get data and code
in and out so when that project were
kind of ramped down I started to just be
a go-to optimization guy so if a game
company that was developing for the
playstation 3 needed to make their game
go fast i would fly out to them and
spend a couple weeks working on their
code base speed things up and then come
back and then i can finally talk about
this now I spent a year and a half
studying the PlayStation 4's cpu and GPU
architecture before leaving for google
so it's a little bit interesting so here
i am at a web developers conferencing
and what brought me here in particular
it was dark I come from I am a C++
programmer just in my blood and
javascript is not that much fun for me I
I suck at it it's very difficult so dart
and it's structured approach to web
programming just it caught me right away
it was like flypaper and I'm
just stuck I'm there webgl you can do 3d
in a browser now html5 the browser to me
is an operating system that I want to
develop really high performance high end
applications in and I want to make that
possible so it's kind of like this
collision of two worlds i come from a
low level Colonel systems programming
background and now I'm coming to the web
and I'm trying to see how I can be
helpful and so I've been experimenting
with bringing simdi to the web and I'll
get into what that is and why it matters
so what is it about dart that I really
liked well first of all the structure I
love that it has a type system even if
it's only tool visible my preference
would be for a type system that's
available in the language but I'll take
a tool based type system / no type
system having the tools say hey you're
just called a method that doesn't exist
or you just assigned to some variable
that doesn't exist or you did something
silly and warns me right there before I
run the code I need that i'm a lazy kind
of sloppy guy and it's I make a lot of
errors tools are great it's class based
in object oriented which is I like the
prototype based language in JavaScript
but it's almost too flexible it's kind
of it's a lot of fun but it's this weird
sludge and I'm used to working in a
class-based world lexical this this is
huge every time I write code in
JavaScript I get bitten by this where I
because of my own ignorance of
JavaScript I get into the situation
where this is the wrong dis and in dart
that never happens to me so I really
appreciate this this is kind of a weird
one I love that you require semicolons I
get into debates at work about this some
people hate that there's semicolons the
language but to me it's awesome number
two performance and this is where like I
just love performance and this is what
really really attracted me to dart this
dart is designed to be less permissive
than JavaScript so that it can run
faster and anything that runs faster I'm
into and it comes with a new vm and this
is a new vm written from scratch
designed around dart and its
functionality and designed to run fast
and so I thought oh this is pretty
interesting this is opens up new
possibilities why don't we bring Cindy
why isn't simdi on the web it should be
so before i get to Cindy let's talk
about why dart can run fast so in dart
every object has a static shape
JavaScript you can do something like the
code up on the on the screen there where
you have your constructor for my class
and it adds the fields a and B and then
someone goes and constructs it and then
they just add another property to it
you've completely invalidated all of the
optimization assumptions around
instances of my class in Dart that's not
possible again dart is designed to be
less permissive guiding you to having
more optimized code whole free arrays
JavaScript you can do something like
this where you have big data it's an
array and then you add a bunch of
numbers into it and then somewhere later
on you add like big data at 20,000 at
that point the engine says you know what
you're not an array anymore you're
actually a key value map where the keys
are the indexes into the array and it
becomes sparse and your data is spread
all over memory it's very bad for
performance and it kind of sucks and
dart you cannot have holes in your raise
if you want a structure like this you
use a map there is a distinction between
global and fixed size arrays and dark so
if you know ahead of time that your
array will never change in size you can
go ahead and allocate it once and dart
will make better optimization
assumptions based on this fact like
hoisting and array bounds check outside
of a loop so that it happens before the
loop executes there's no prototype chain
this is a big performance gain in dart
so JavaScript if you wrote fool equals
new some class and you call some
function on it what happens is this you
say hey some class prototype can you
respond to some function no well let's
ask your parents unless that let's ask
your grandparent until you finally find
something in the prototype chain that
can actually handle some function in
Dart you just extract the class ID and
you go to the class and you grab the
phone
it's very fast there is a distinction
distinction between integer and doubles
so the key point here is that double
arithmetic is slower than integer
arithmetic and the table at the bottom
of the slide here is from a recent arm
processor showing you the cycle latency
counts for doing arithmetic on doubles
versus integers and you can see that a
double multiplication is three times as
slow as an integer multiplication and in
addition is actually four times as slow
so we're paying this cost every time we
do arithmetic in our programs and it's
unnecessary with the new VM and a new
language we can make better choices that
lead to more performant code so that
case dart has both double and integers
and it puts the control into your hands
and you can decide when it's appropriate
so that you get the most optimal code
all right so that's why this is really
like why I got into dark I love
performance the web is really attracted
to me i think the browser is a great
platform and it's it's just very
interesting so i wanted to try something
new and i wanted to try adding simdi and
bringing it to the web so what is cindy
i'm going to take a guess that how many
people in the room know it's india's all
right okay excellent i'm in good company
all right so before we get into simdi we
need to talk about sisti which is single
instruction single data and this is
typically what you're doing when you're
operating on data in your program you
have a single instruction like add and
you have a single piece of data you add
the two values and you will put the
other Cindy on the other hand is single
instruction multiple data so again we
have a single instruction add but we
have multiple data so you're actually
adding four numbers at the same time
with one instruction and a good way to
think about this this is a vector
processor this is perfect for doing 3d
math
so why does simdi matter well it brings
substantial speedups to 3d graphics 3d
physics image processing signal
processing numerical processing it's not
a silver bullet it can't be applied
everywhere but in the areas where it can
be applied the performance gains are
huge so why does it matter to the web I
mean that's why we're here right well
Cindy can provide substantial speed ups
to WebGL based games like hex GL which
is a pretty amazing game running in a
browser canvas animation other game
algorithms physics physics simulations I
want to see I worked on bullet physics
for like two years I would love to see a
version of bullet physics running in the
browser as fast as it does on a native
in a native application and simdi is
going to help us get there so again why
does it matter to the web here we have a
timeline of video game consoles starting
at the nes which was my first console
and i loved it all the way up to the ps3
so i'm drawing this line here and this
was console games in 1998 it's also web
games in 2013 we are 15 years behind the
curve we can do better than that so why
does simdi matter here is a CPU die
diagram of a recent arm mobile processor
dual core so you see it kind of mirrored
here right the top and the bottom are
the same same structure so this blue box
up here labeled core that's where all of
the integer operations are executed this
yellow box up here vfp this is where
your double arithmetic is executed and
this red box neon this is the simdi unit
that every single one of our modern
smartphones has in it and it just sits
idle it's doing nothing we cannot touch
it from the web so why does any matter
well Cindy requires fewer instructions
to be executed and fewer instructions
means longer battery life and we live in
a very mobile world I mean I I barely
make it a day on
on a charge it would be nice to make it
like two days maybe three days and
somebody will help us get here so here's
an interesting thing Mozilla is actually
attempting to use the simdi coprocessors
in all of our CPUs automatically and so
what they're doing is they're looking at
the the ast of your program and just
kind of shaking it and looking and
saying okay actually right in this one
little spot we could use simdi here this
is called automatic vectorization and
it's an open research topic it's very
difficult to get right and in cases
where it does get it right it works
quite well but it's based on pattern
recognition which requires you to write
your program in some way that the the vm
itself can detect hey here's a good
opportunity to use simdi I don't think
that's the optimal way to expose simdi
to the web I think the optimum way is to
really give you the developers the power
to do it yourself and use these
processors exactly as you want so this
brings us to simdi and dark which
consists of three new types dart has
types there is float 32 X 4 and that's
just for 32-bit floats packed together
there's a list of these and this is if
anyone does WebGL development there's
float32 array this is the equivalent of
that but for simdi values and there is
also UN 32 which is just for unsigned
32-bit integers tucked inside of 128
bits but the key thing here and the
difference between attempts at
automatically adding simdi to your
program versus doing it in a way that
you have control is that you are given
composable operations in dirt you get to
control how Cindy is executed where it's
executed and when it is so I've enabled
you know arithmetic operations logical
bitwise operators comparisons reordering
shuffling and I'll walk us through some
examples of how you use these this new
functionality so float32 cross for you
can think of it as split into four lane
X Y Z and W when the following the
operations that you can perform on
float32 explores are on the left the
standard arithmetic operations square
root reciprocal May and Max clamp
absolute values all the things that you
would want when you're doing anything
numerical in anything that is not
directly there you can build from these
very simple composable primitive
operations so here's some code so I've
are a dartle figure out the type of a
automatically and then say new float 32
x 4 and i pass in the values in there i
get a sim d 1 2 3 4 there's also a
constructor 0 which just gives you back
the 0 vector so how do you access these
individual lanes and modify and mutate
their values so here we have we've
constructed again our go to vector which
is just 1 2 3 4 and if we want to look
at the lanes we can just call a dot X
that's just a nice exit accessor for
each lane x dot y dot 0 w but if we want
to change one of the lanes the values in
the lane we call a method on a called
with X or with wire with C and pass in
the value and what that does is it
copies a and replaces the X lane with
the value 5 and returns a new sim d
value that might sound heavy I mean it
might sound like oh we're copying
something and allocating a new object
but when the optimizer kicks and none of
that happens it's all sitting in
registers it's all very efficient so
doing arithmetic it's very natural
constructed two vectors here a and B we
add them we had all four numbers at the
same time it's it reads very nicely i
mean VAR c equals a plus B it just
happens to be using a sim d unit behind
so let's look at a more substantial
example here so let's say we have a huge
list of numbers and we want to average
them right so the algorithm here is sum
up all the numbers and divide by the
number of values that you have so here
is the
scalar version so you know for II's less
than n sum it up and then divide and
return that so how do we turn this into
a cindy program well it's not much
different it takes a float 32 cross for
list and again we just sum them up in
the inner loop but at the end we have to
do this extra step because what we've
actually done is we've computed for sub
sums and we have to figure out the total
sum as one final step so everything up
until this line is executing in cindy
when we get here we we start using that
vfp that yellow piece of the cpu that we
saw earlier before that we're using the
red part of the cpu so diagrams help so
along the top we have our long list of
numbers and what happens is we end up we
add all the blue numbers together then
we add up all the green and the red and
the yellow and these the adding of the
different colored lanes happen
simultaneously it happens in parallel
this is a very limited form of parallel
parallel computation so at this point
we're done executing simdi code but
we've we've cut the number of
instructions into a quarter and we do
our final step where we merge the
results into a scalar value which is the
result of an average operation so in
this case we end up executing
seventy-five percent fewer loads
seventy-five percent fewer ads and
seventy-five percent fewer stores
drastic cut and we end up running four
times faster minimal change in your code
and the new features in the dart VM will
make these algorithms run significantly
faster so this is the only slide with
assembly on and I promise although I
encourage you to start looking at the
disassembly from your JavaScript engine
or your the dart VM because it's very
enlightening but see our inner loop here
where we just do some plus equals list I
when the optimizer kicks in this becomes
just a single load where we're loading
the earth element of list and then just
an ad it's all in registers nothing goes
out to
22 memory except the load of course so
it really gets this optimal you get to
write this code at this very high level
in this nice language like dart at a
high level and then the optimizer is
going to get it down to just two
instructions yeah so you're talking
about start p.m. maybe presentation that
we had before this it said that the dark
stuff we were doing compiles down to
JavaScript yes are you saying in this
case that the code the optimized code
where you act has an extra line of code
actually runs with a vm that's inside a
browser and with all browser all
browsers don't have that vm no that's a
great point so dart VM is a new vm
that's experimental so we've added it to
dart VM in the case where your program
is using Cindy and it's compiled to
JavaScript Java Script lacks simdi
support so we end up issuing for
operations in sequence and if you have a
smart javascript vm like Mozilla's it
actually end up it might end up
replacing those four operations chrome
does not ship with dart VM no so let's
look at shuffling we have these lanes
right and we want to be able to like
reorder the entries inside the lanes and
if you've done any WebGL programming
you're familiar with gle cells shuffle
syntax well we have that in Dart so it's
really nice so first we have our one two
three four vector and then we want to
assign b2b x x y y and we get 1 1 2 2 so
that single line has just like reordered
these values and it outputs a very
optimal assembly code and then we could
do www and it just takes the 4444 floor
or we could reverse the order of the
entries in snd register if this so these
are the these are these composable
primitive operations that you will use
to build larger real-world applications
from
so the tricky part with semi programming
oh there's a question yeah
yes
that is a good question and it's a very
detailed technical answer so we could
talk afterwards but yeah yeah I know it
would be better but you can't have
everything so let's look at this very
simple function here max it just takes
two values and returns the bigger of the
two and the code is obvious right if a
is greater than B return a otherwise
return b hey but how do you do the sinaa
simdi world where all of your variables
are actually storing four values and
this is where branching and simdi gets a
little little funky so let's say we had
a as one two three four and we'd be a
zero 3520 we said a greater than B like
what does that mean right because the
true maximum here is actually 1354 right
so you cannot just say like if a is
greater than B return a it's a
meaningless statement in a sindhi world
so you end up having to write a
branchless version of your algorithm
which is kind of interesting so we'll
walk you through it so here this line
here says you and 32 cross for typos
greater than is equal to a dot greater
than B and the reason that it's not the
greater than operators because it
returns something unusual so we wanted
to make it explicit and what it does is
it returns this bit mask to you so here
we say a greater than B and we get this
weird bit mask that says it's all f's or
all zeros depending on the true or false
value of the predicate that you just
evaluated so in this case we see that
one is greater than zero so we get F we
see that too is not greater than three
so we get 0 and so on which then brings
us to the next line of the program which
is select where we then take that mask
that 0f0 mask and we select between a
and B what that ends up looking like is
we say okay take the vector on the left
and select the lanes
from the column with F on it if the lane
has F in it on the left and then select
the lanes with zero in it otherwise so
you end up with the true lane wise
maximum of these of these two vectors
and this is how you would express this
type of algorithm in a sindhi world so
it's a little bit different but it's
it's kind of interesting there are no
branches here but somehow we've we've
selected and and got in two different
values but we never have an if statement
so how does the vm optimized for simdi
i've kind of touched on this already it
on boxes everything so unboxing might be
a new concept for some people typically
an object in a vm when it's boxed is
allocated in memory and it's this
heavyweight object with like a class ID
at the beginning and all of this extra
metadata associated with it but an
optimizing vm will actually unbox the
value and store it inside of a cpu
register and the second optimization
that we apply is replacing method calls
within lined machine code and that's why
that inner loop looked so great it just
had the load and the ad that's because
we've in lined all of the method calls
like add and go and load this value from
this array at this index all of that
gets replaced with just the single
instruction that can express these
concepts and this also avoids method
call overhead so we don't have to go
through the prologue and epilogue of
calling into an exiting from a function
so how much faster can things get with
simdi so four by four matrix
multiplication which is a fundamental
operation in 3d graphics and physics
gets about three times faster just it's
pretty sweet bulk multiply like an
algorithm like the average things like
that it can approach like six times five
times faster than doing it scalar and
that's the trivial algorithm to port
from scalar to sim decode to 3d boxes a
boolean intersection test do they
overlap it's about one and a half times
faster as does vertex transformations
and crack and blur the
exact algorithm that Mozilla is
attempting to automatically detect and
use simdi for you if you were to express
it in dart Cindy types and primitive
operations you can get a 50-percent
speed up which is pretty sweet so
wrapping up darts MD is landed it's it's
in the vm now so if you go and download
like next week's release it should be
there I put an asterisk there because
what has landed is the new types and the
new operations that you can perform on
them what hasn't landed yet is the
optimizer and that's coming in a week or
two so little pieces of the optimizer
we've been landing over time and these
algorithms that you write tomorrow will
start to get really fast just magically
simdi let's use your entire CPU you
execute fewer instructions you get
faster performance you get longer
battery life you get a better web the
dart VM in general stretches the
performance envelope and it's going to
make new magical experiences on the web
possible so why does simdi matter again
here we are back at this console
timeline and we can do this we can bump
ourselves into the gray area between ps2
and ps3 and start closing the gap of
what we can do in the browser versus
what we can do on a video game console
because if we want to be able to do this
in the browser and I do we need simdi
it'll never happen unless we start
exposing these very powerful pieces of
the CPU that just sit idle to us the
developers so just one thing I just want
to talk about the definition of fast
because I hear a lot of people say well
the web is really fast javascript is
really fast I don't really agree so this
is a a graph of box2d benchmarks that
was put up by joel lebaron his blog and
in december two thousand eleven post
it's a really interesting post i
recommend checking it out but it's
comparing the performance of the 2d
physics engine across all these
different language runtimes down on the
bottom is see it's about five to ten
milliseconds per frame
update up here 20 times slower that's
the web we have to collapse that gap and
close it and bring it down I mean look
at Java Java is only about twice as slow
as C but we're 20 times the slope we've
got a lot of room to get faster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
