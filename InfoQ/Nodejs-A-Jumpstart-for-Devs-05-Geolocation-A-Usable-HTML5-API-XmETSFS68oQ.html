client-side and server-side JavaScript
so well this is simple let's add a
geolocation API on the browser so that
our users can check in and they can tag
themselves wherever they are staying at
here's the code
I was magic I typed it really fast
really what I did was that cut and
pasted it but let's just quickly go
through this which is the geolocation
API is on the Navigator object we're
gonna check to see if it's here or not
and then if it is we're going to
essentially wait for the browser to say
hey would you like to give us your
location please and then we're gonna
embed in the forum the latitude
longitude of where the user is at and
make it available for the user to
check-in let's try this out first thing
we need to do is this magic code which
lives in the public JavaScript client
J's folder everything in the public
folder if you go with the build that
we're using with express here is
considered static files so if you make
an HTTP request anything that's in this
folder is eligible to be served we need
to go back to our views again and you'll
spend a lot of time in your views and
you're developing web apps we want to go
in our main handlebars and we want to
include the JavaScript whoops if I can
type in the Java scripts folder client
Jas and let's go see we can see that
note I should say Express is still
running and note is still running let's
rerun the page we notice that the check
in button was magically set and we can
post although it doesn't go anywhere
take a quick look in the debugger to
make sure our code works refresh the
page and we can see indeed my latitude
and longitude is being stored in the
forum we are ready for the next tab
which is figuring out where the heck I
am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
