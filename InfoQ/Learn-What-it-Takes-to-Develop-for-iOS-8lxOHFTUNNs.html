kind of show some small pieces actually
not going to spend a lot of times on
slides here going to focus on some
things that I think you would want to
know if you're a kind of entry-level
beginner also some things that trip me
up when I started so first of all the
requirements to develop you're going to
need a mac it needs to be an intel-based
mac and you're also going to need xcode
there are some actual alternatives to
xcode jetbrains has a ide that's in beta
right now and I think that's about it
but you still are going to need Xcode on
your system because it has all the
libraries and basically the package that
you're going to need to be able to
develop you can actually get Xcode from
the mac app store for five dollars the
way most developers get it is they sign
up for the iOS developer program which
is a ninety nine dollars per year you
get all the documentation you get Xcode
you have the ability to test on a device
and submit to the App Store so you're
going to need to do that if you're
really getting serious about this by the
way just going off the earlier
presentation my opinion is that the
documentation as part of this program is
is also excellent they have a lot of
how-to guides the API Docs and
everything there I'll probably show you
some of that in a bit so I want to start
out with some terms as we get into this
because also my opinion java and c sharp
looks somewhat familiar when you get
into this environment if it's new to you
some of it's going to seem pretty
strange
objective-c is like nothing you might
have seen before so there's Objective C
this is the language that we use you
actually can you c plus plus in there as
well you just need to tell the compiler
that you're doing so and this is
basically what you use for iOS and Mac
development it's a strict superset of C
so basically anything you can do and see
you can put into you can do an objective
C which sometimes gives you some choices
so for instance the via the framework
cocoa I'm going to talk about in a
minute has a something called NS array
which is an array data structure but you
could also in objective-c use regular C
erase like your we're used to doing if
you view seed before so sometimes you
have some decisions to make it's
basically a message based not the
language itself but the the frameworks
here and the the foundation is message
based so cocoa touch is the overall iOS
API on the Mac it's called Coco and it
basically adheres to the MVC
architecture will see that as we start
to develop some UI and take a look at it
cocoa-touch is made up of many different
frameworks so the foundation framework
is kind of the core that has all the the
data structures NS array I'm stiction
airy they all start with NS because it
came from the next step project that was
being done there it was brought over to
Apple so the frameworks are specific
parts of this thing so there's a
foundation the UI kit is basically all
of the UI and the things a lot of which
will be touching here as we go into this
on the on the Mac it's called app kit
and and then there's different ones like
map kit and and other things like that
ok so that's just
a little bit to to get us started there
with some definitions so what I want to
do now is go into the environment show
you some tooling yes I'm going to start
out with kind of the hello world thing
it's my opinion that's a good way if
you've never done this to kind of see
how it works see how it fits together
okay so before I go in I'm just going to
talk about some of the pieces I want to
try to cover here not sure how the time
is going to work out i'll show you the
ide how to start from how to go from a
template some of the classes and how the
UI is put together i'll talk about parts
of objective-c here and there although
we don't want to get too deep into that
will take a look at some of the controls
properties how to access properties of
the UI in your code and event they call
these outlets and actions i'm going to
show you how to do some basic animation
and then i'll talk a bit about sizing
and orientation which even though they
talk about on android how its fragmented
you have different device different form
factors it it is a much simpler problem
to deal with in iOS however if you think
about it you still do have some
variation there so you have iPads you
have I ipod touches you have iphones you
have older iphones with different
hardware you have a iphone 4 with a with
the high res display where the
resolutions actually double what it is
on on the older phones so there are some
issues to deal with and then if we have
time i'll talk about the instruments
which is some of the profiling and
profiling tools that you get and will
finally end up with some questions
okay so this is Xcode this is what you
see when you first launch it I've got a
bunch of projects here but I might want
to just go create a new one here and so
the first thing we did we have like most
IDEs we have some templates and we're
going to start with a view based
application of you it's actually easier
to describe this once I get into this we
confuse a device family here so i have
ipad and iphone and this will help it
decide what kind of screen layouts it
wants to give me from the beginning but
will show that we can deal with that
later as well it actually by the way
this is the new Xcode for its relatively
new and it's it's a pretty major
retooling of the IDE so you'll see here
i can even if i'm not hooked up to
source control right now i can create a
local repository for my projects so if
you're developing in eclipse with
android and you you kind of get local
history type functionality if you know
what that is okay so it basically
creates my project template for me and
it puts down some view controllers and
and views and so I want to describe what
some of these are I'm sorry I'm really
hard to video because I walk around and
I keep wanting to get a point into
screen and stuff but anyway so yeah I
think it was the the Android speaker
mentioned but the what he thought was
the main pattern in Android and what I
think is the main pattern in iOS is
something is the delegate pattern so
what they do is some some parent class
in this case I'm going to talk about the
application class
they realize you might want to change
the functionality of this thing but
instead of making you subclass they have
hooks in there that call out to this
thing called a delegate it's like a like
an interface type type of idea okay and
that's actually what you're seeing here
so there is an application class in iOS
but if you look right up at the top
there you see my app delegate and I have
a header and a dot M file which is
basically like the objective-c file so
here's the header and then here's the
delicate delegate and they put some
stubs in here for you so essentially you
don't need to subclass you just build
these delegates this one's done for you
and then right at the top there you'll
see the the main entry point of a of an
iOS application this set application did
finish launching with options I don't
want to get too deep into Objective C
but the name of this method is actually
it's actually not a method really it's a
message but people still call it that is
that application did finish launching
with options it's kind of hard to read
but what they're what this does is the
parameters are interspersed into the
name which is very weird but once you
get used to it it actually provides some
pretty self documenting and readable
code because you can see there what it's
doing what the parameters are but that's
something you're going to need to
remember because in other parts
sometimes you'll you'll define this
message and you'll need to remember that
the name is the whole thing not just the
first part okay the way the UI is put
together is they have the MVC model view
controller architecture however unlike
some other environments where you
actually have to build that yourself
they say it adheres to it in this case
they actually provide concrete classes
for this so
actually controller classes so for
instance here I have a view controller
and the implementation is basically
where the code goes and then the dot H
is the header so you can see here this
is a interface which means it's an
object that's inheriting from a
uiviewcontroller which is a baked in
glass into the framework so they have
specific classes for this stuff and
inside of those you'll see the templates
built some of the messages here for the
life cycle the life cycle in iOS is is
somewhat simpler than Android because
you don't have all the separate
activities it kind of the application is
kind of works as a whole but you'll see
some of the lifecycle things like view
did unload the memory warning here and
things like that okay there's a
viewdidload as well which hasn't been
implemented by the template okay so a
view controller goes with a view it's
pretty much a one to one although there
are a couple of secs exceptions that's
everyone who's seen the iphone you've
seen the little most of the things that
navigate multiple screens when you have
the back arrow at the top that's
something called the view navigation
view controller and it holds multiple
other view controllers inside of it okay
so there's some exceptions but pretty
much a view controller and of you are a
one-to-one relationship ok so we've
quickly seen the code but how does the
view map to this view controller views
are actually stored in something called
a zip or a nib file the zip is actually
xml-based although unlike the other two
platforms that we've seen it's it's
somewhat unreadable it's not XML that
you really go in and edit like you can
do in the sam'l or the or the XML for
the Android UI you pretty much do it
designer or create your controls in code
you can do that as well okay so this is
the view and it's actually tied to this
view controller here actually this is
the actual view that I wanted to show
there's also the main window which is
kind of be where you put your going to
put everything this you I use this
concept of these proxy objects so what
you're going to have is you're going to
have all these different view
controllers and view zip files for each
of your screens but then they all need
to talk to each other and navigate
together right so you're going to put
these proxy objects into the name into
your main nib file here too and this is
how you'll hook them all together okay
that's a little more of an advanced
topic but the point i'd like to make
there is it's correct to make separate
view controller and views and not like
jam them all into this one main window
or your iphone app is going to take like
10 minutes to load and probably get
kicked out of memory before it can even
do anything ok so I realize that might
be kind of a lot to digest right at the
moment but so let's go into something
I'm going to go from this view
controller here I'll take the header
file and hopefully I'm going to be able
to do this on the screen basically
basically just like in the other
environments when you want to use the
controls from your code you're going to
need to somehow map these to your
between into your view controller okay
and this isn't done automatically in for
those of you that know Android this is
bait what I'm talking about here is
basically your fine view by ID where you
go and get the ID of the control in your
code and now you have a reference to
that control that you can use ok the way
you do that in iOS let's take a control
will call say are our round wrecked
button we can size it here in the UI
it's basically the UI is absolute
positioning I'll talk about that a bit
more in a minute up here we can see
different attributes of it so I can go
and set a title here basically all these
properties are going to get freeze-dried
into that nib file when I set them here
in the in the interface builder okay i'm
also going to put a label here because
maybe i wanted to say something here you
know your typical hello world so what
you do in the iphone is we can we can
actually drag this thing here
and give it a name now you don't have to
do this with every control just the ones
that you're going to want to access from
your code here my things are just not
sized properly for me here so I can pull
the label over as well okay now this is
in the header file if we go and look in
the in here close up for a minute so
you'll see what it's done now in in
previous versions the Xcode used to have
to do all this yourself so now it's done
for you it's actually synthesize these
things these are properties so you can
access them with dot notation all that's
doing is behind the scenes it's calling
us um SAT method on this on this
property it's also done the releasing of
these for me so this is something that
lino likes to joke about a lot in
objective-c you you need to manage your
memory it's there's no garbage collector
it's it's not as bad as you know just
going allocating chunks and releasing
them it is actually reference count it
is the way it works objective-c actually
does have a garbage collector but it's
not available on iOS so the eye on iOS
its reference counted so when the
reference count drops to 20 it will be
collected but that means you need to
release things properly which actually
drops the reference count you can also
have the opposite problem where you
don't retain something which is
basically bumping up the reference count
and it goes away out from under you so
this has helped put all of that stuff in
place for us okay and so now in my view
controller I have something I can use to
program against those controls that are
on my UI okay in this environment that
they're called outlets that was on my
slide earlier and you'll even see here
this thing is called AIB outlet I be for
interface builder the next thing we want
to look at is an action or an event so
if we take a look here back at our UI on
the button I have a bunch of events that
i can use on this button and so I want
to say touch up inside right here and
I'm going to drag this over and say that
hello hello has been touched so in the
header it builds a this message for me
that little minus sign is objective
seats way of things is an instance
method if it's a plus sign it means it's
a class method okay so over here I
should be able to find my hello touched
and now i'm going to say self which is
basically instance of this view
controller and i'm going to say my label
text and i'm going to set that equal to
hello user group in objective c string
constants have an appt sign in front of
them
and I can run this and see if we did
everything correctly know what we didn't
I could click the button if you want to
see it crash but I won't do that that's
actually a good mistake because did
anyone notice what popped up in my
compiler wasn't an error was it it was a
warning so in objective-c you better not
ignore your warnings and a good actually
a good friend of lean oath and mine used
to even when we used to work in
languages where it didn't matter so much
he was adamant that our stuff compiled
with no warnings and I'm really enjoying
that lesson right now because
objective-c is very dynamic which gives
you a lot of power but a lot of things
that are warnings it means they're going
to be an error at at runtime so in this
case I was trying to set a piece of text
into this label object and I wasn't
using the text property okay so now the
warning is gone I click this and you
know there it is so not exciting but
you've seen the framework of an iOS app
and hopefully get an idea about views
view controllers okay so look to the
outlets actions I just wanted to show
some basic animations here and kind of
use that to touch on a couple other
things this is what they never talked
about in the demos and things like that
either but I guess windows phone doesn't
have the issue yet but you also need to
be aware of as the different SDKs come
out think some things are available
that that aren't that weren't there
before so it's not about this building
for like I want to support all the
phones 1.6 like they were talking about
with Android it's about you also you
might want to support an older version
but use something in a newer one if they
have it okay so this is one of the I got
sidetracked here because I'm going to do
some animes in the old way there's some
new ways of doing it with something
called blocks but you have to consider
all these things when you develop you
know what your target platform is it's
actually a lot more difficult to the
problem than just saying I'm going to
support you know iOS 313 so I just
wanted to put that out there so you I've
you have some class methods so notice I
don't have an instance of an object here
i'm just using a uiview so there's one
called begin animations and there's some
identifiers you can use here but I don't
I don't need them and basically a lot of
the properties in in the iphone sdk are
what they call animatable and you can
see all these in the docs that alpha the
location all that kind of stuff and so
what i'm doing here is kind of is
setting up block this animation
transaction and so i can set animation
duration to something here and then i'm
going to set some property let's do it
on this that's in seconds yes let's do
it on this label text i'm going to set
its frame property which happens to be
an anime double property and
let's just ignore all this cgrectmake
for the minute it's a it's a structure
that's a rectangle so I'm just going to
move this to a I of course could go to
the label and figure out where it is but
i'm just going to do something kind of
quick and dirty here instead of with an
ax and some height now I could actually
animate more than one property in here
as well and when I'm done with that I
commit my animations and this is using
the UI kit version one of the things I
like a lot about iOS is that there's
many layers for you to target developing
at and and I don't mean like you know
the colonel layer I mean even within the
application layer there's many layers so
I'm using UI kit here which is the
simplest one it's a wrapper around
something that's one level deeper called
poor animation which is more powerful
but if I don't need it I don't need to
go to that complexity but I can below
that there's poor graphic so I could
actually do all the drawing and
rendering myself and kind of animate it
around if I really needed to core
animation is pretty powerful so that's
usually not necessary and and finally I
could go to opengl if I was riding games
and and things like that this animation
here is not really for games it's for
kind of you know making the flashy you
eyes and things interesting in a normal
app like the iphone is good at
okay so we we said hello and we animated
the movement of this rectangles frame so
you could do that with you know alpha
colors all kinds of things you can move
stuff around you can do some pretty
complex things really easily let's see
if I can remember how to do this so I
could also apply a transform there's a
transform property which is also
animatable and I think I want that one
so if I want to do 180 degrees that's
basically a pie I believe we'll see what
we get at the same time it's doing the
animation of the other one okay so it's
pretty easy this actually gets run in
the background thread it's part of the
poor animation and you really don't have
to worry about much more so it makes
makes it easy to do these nice little
you is and things like that what I was
talking about earlier which didn't make
sense is there's a different there's a
different way to do this where you send
a block they call it blocks it's like
closures or lambda expressions where you
can send in a block of code but that's
only available on the iOS four point oh
so that that's an issue there if you you
need to know what you're targeting and
and do the correct thing okay I wanted
to talk about sizing a little bit and an
orientation type of stuff of course in
can I take questions at the end d my
course in iOS you we have the ipad now
as well and if you're anyone building an
iOS app is going to be at least
interested in building for that and and
what they need to do and there's
actually a few different there's i would
say three ways of doing it so if we just
run the app i just built on the ipad
anyone who has an ipad will of course
have seen this you get a little iphone
screen inside of your ipad right so you
know that's okay if you're really
building an iphone app kind of a next
level up which you can do is and this
goes for just an iphone only app as well
when you rotate it to landscape and
things like that you can use some of the
sizing things that are available in the
in the UI builder here so if we select
our button here actually I want to do
this I want to do this last because it
just works it just works that way the
other thing we could do is using the
iPad as an example if i go to my build
settings here so yes this is a c-type
stuff underneath so you have all kinds
of build settings and things like that
and i need to find the right one
you
I had it in my other I think my screen
size is so product I can't find it now
cuz my anyway targeted the face family
here it is somebody change this to I to
both iPhone and iPad okay so notice now
I don't get the iphone screen anymore I
just tains one setting right but what's
the problem here I built this screen for
a iphone size so even though it's
stretched my screen out and I don't have
the ugly iphone on the iPad you see my
labels aren't really where I want them
and things like that so now I can go
back to what I was about to show you we
go back to the interface builder over
here in the click this little ruler
these things have springs and struts
they call them so struts are on the
outside they kind of hold something
solid to an edge and then springs are on
the inside and they allow some
elasticity so here if I wanted to say
okay I really want to keep this button
at the bottom and then allow it to
stretch with the size of the screen
right so if i run this now
then okay you know you might argue still
doesn't look good on the iPad but you
get the point right so you can you
actually can build your UI this way and
get it to run on the multiple devices
including landscape and things like that
so the final option and then I'll i
apply yeah that I'll take questions at
the end so the final option here that
that's kind of a cheat in the middle I
actually did that with a simple app of
ours called falafel to go which just
looks at our blogs and and stuff and
some of the screens I did do a universal
app which I'm about to show you but some
of the screens I I use dual purpose on
both iphone and ipad and just set the
springs and struts so they looked
reasonable and then on the iPad stuck
them in and like a smaller window like a
popover controller type of thing so let
me just show you this and basically what
happens here and if I walk you through
the template you'll kind of understand
how it's working so I'm going to start a
new project and you need to go from a
window based application which is kind
of the raw one without the view in it
you're going to have to put the view in
and build your views in later but when I
do this you'll notice that I have a
choice to make this a universal
application and so when you do this what
you actually get is a Xcode graph so
let's try this again
alright this looks a little better okay
so what we actually get here you'll
notice we have two of these nip vials
and two view controllers and what it's
actually set up here is completely
different UI for the two platforms and
if you look one thing I should have
showed you but I didn't one of the
supporting files here much like the
manifest if you're doing Android
development is this thing called the
plist which is a property list and it
this is where you set a lot of the
overall app things like do we want the
status bar you know does it support my
escape rotation things like that and one
of the things in here is you can have a
separate need names for the phone and
the ipad so basically you can create a
completely different user interface for
each device and the framework will
figure out which one it's on and just do
the right thing okay so i just got the
time to wrap up sign so I'm going to
wrap up questions yes questions it's
this gentleman here I actually don't
know because I haven't gone in through
the C++ very deep I can find out and
Sarah way I can message the group or
something Bruno yeah yeah
yeah I'm not really sure another
question they're just like you wouldn't
see you can you can like extern them so
you can have statics actually it's one
of the things people often ask is even
though I showed you they were class
methods there's no class like class
level fields like you would have in Java
or something yes so what you do is in
here you can use the static keyword
which is something a little different it
has scope through the file and then yeah
you kinetics turn stuff in a header to
to get it to be global if you want to do
that or of course you can do something
more object-oriented and have you know
some kind of singleton something like
that that you can get from anywhere I
don't know what it is actually
ok the question was opinion on the
corona sdk I don't know what that is so
if you want to test for certain
functionality on yeah maybe available ok
I think I can show it to you so the
question was a good question by the way
and I hinted at it if you want to test
for certain functionality do you mean
functionality like device like does it
have a camera or yeah so let me fine I
think I have a piece of code in here
yeah so here's there's actually so first
I'll talk about testing for version of
the last type of things what actually
what you don't do is check for the
version of the OS you know you don't
write some code and say is this four
point four point three or whatever
there's kind of two levels you do it
this is showing one of them you can you
use a call called I think it's NS class
s string for name or streaming for class
or something no NS class for string to
test for the existence of a class right
so if you want to use some class you do
that test and then there's one other
thing you need to do and your frame
works here you have to weak link that
there's this there's a setting up here
i'm not going to dig around for it for
now because we're but you weak link your
framework otherwise when the app first
loads it'll try to load that class and
it will crash now that doesn't always
get you a hundred percent of the way
because sometimes and this thing called
the gesture recognizer was one example
two things can happen maybe the class
was there but there's like a newer
version or something
and in one case there was even something
where the class supposedly wasn't there
but Apple had added it before hidden as
like a testing and so all the tests that
I just described to you would have
succeeded and then you would have
crashed so the second level you go to is
this what you see on the screen here
this responds to selector which the
selector is what you're thinking of as a
method right so i can test against the
class and say does it have the selector
because i know that met that method or
message was only there in iOS four dot
three ok so that's how you would handle
something like that for this one you
don't need to weak link against it I
actually did this because they they
added this new thing called the root
view controller in iOS four and so if
it's not if that isn't there you have to
go back and do it the old way you the
other half of your question in that man
if in the plist i showed you you can
actually set some attributes like must
have a camera etc and that will actually
hide it from the app store completely if
someone's going in with a device that
doesn't have a camera or prevent itunes
from from downloading it so that's how
you would make a hard requirement if you
need some conditional stuff then yeah
there's a way to test for the device
there's a device capabilities that you
can test against and figure out what's
there if you want to go that way thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
