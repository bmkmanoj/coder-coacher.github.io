2014 San Francisco in the foyer of the
grand regency hyatt and i'm here with
dave smith with new circle he's our
android practice lead in fact we just
had a really great panel discussion last
night didn't lead a if we did we did you
guys check that out the meantime though
Dave why don't you introduce yourself
here to our audience and tell us what
you're passionate about sure well I've
been I've been developing Android for
about five years now with various
different consulting organizations and
stuff like that independent contractor
for a couple years in there as well I
prior to Android I really wasn't much of
a software developer actually my
background is in electrical engineering
and embedded systems so very recently
I've gained a lot of passion in running
Android in the embedded environment so I
like a lot of things dealing with
internals and the framework as a whole
as opposed to just the application layer
and it really anything having to do with
hardware at also Bluetooth USB
integration those things are the things
on Android that really excite me
excellent and what are you here doing at
the conference so I gave two sessions my
first one was on Bluetooth Low Energy
and some of the new features that came
in Android lollipop and how that's
really kind of pushed the platform along
in terms of bluetooth support and
compatibility and then I gave an
internal space talk the next day on the
Android startup mechanism and kind of
walking through the process of all the
different components that you can see as
you go from your power button to the
main launcher Oh excellent excellent so
like do you have a many people actually
building custom roms now and doing the
cyanogen modding and reading their phone
you know it's it's exploding you know
not so much in the custom rom because
that's kind of been a thing for a really
long time but as the cost of single
board hardware comes down and down and
down and and companies like Intel and
even Qualcomm are willing to give direct
support for these boards with Android
board support packages straight out of
the box you know really any of us can go
online get a super powerful board for
like 50 bucks and go get Android don't
even have to build it yourself just go
get an android image put it on this
device and you're ready to go so it's
this stuff is everywhere now and it's
just going to continue that direction so
speaking of that actually where do you
see things trending then do you see
these types of devices proliferating
the embedded devices yeah the Internet
of Things running Android yeah I do
definitely now I don't want to I don't
want to make that seem like Android is
going to be the embedded OS you know
that will take over everything I think
it has a very specific use case but it's
a use case that people are going to want
to see more and more you know I think
the biggest thing is Linux has been in
the embedded environment for a very long
time and I think it will continue to be
there but as people get more used to
touch interface with the devices that
they have in their pocket they want to
see that same experience out in the
world around them so you know as we as
we start to make things and machines
around us smarter and smarter along with
that comes the that human machine
interface that people are going to
expect to be able to touch swipe pinch
you know these types of interactions and
Android is just well suited for that
because it's designed around that
paradigm so the ability to not only have
a embedded linux based system which it's
a lot of people in better world are
already familiar with but add on top of
that this amazing software stack that
now gives you all the UI toolkit and
connectivity features that anybody can
write a simple application and get a
real great user experience in their
toaster for example that'd be really
cool so you talk about running Android
apps on a toaster or microwave do you
think that'll actually happen I do I do
maybe not in the next five years but you
know it's already in refrigerators and
washing machines and other appliances
like that so as miniaturization comes
along you know it'll be all over your
house eventually very cool something to
watch for so now this year there's
already been a bunch of announcements in
Android you had a bunch of announcements
about new technologies and Android
lollipop coming out and now here google
it and Devcon we're actually hearing how
all these technologies are playing and
rolling out what do you think is the
most exciting trend to come out this
year in android you know i think a
couple things come to mind you know the
the one thing that everybody really kind
of looks at because it's the most user
facing is this whole thing about
material design and i do think that's
interesting and I think it's a great
move forward for the platform it's good
to see the design evolving and it's much
simpler than it was before
for me personally though a couple things
that I find interesting our first of all
the google has done an amazing job this
time around with the app compat in the
support library this is probably one of
the first releases where as soon as they
introduced a bunch of new features in
terms of the design language at the same
time they gave you the compatibility
library that would take those features
as much as possible all the way back to
early early versions certainly long
before most of the versions any of us
are even supporting anymore so it's it
wasn't where we we had this new great
stuff and then said okay cool in five
years we'll be ready to do that and I
said no today you can do this in your
applications they've done an amazing job
on that team bringing app compat up to
speed the other really interesting one
for me that's really more hidden from
most people even developers is that
Android has this new runtime what we're
calling art and the that has become the
default now in Android lollipop and that
runtime is just an amazing piece of
engineering do this totally replaces
dalvik it totally replaces dalvik and
dalvik even be an option anymore on on
on Android lollipop technically speaking
I guess manufacturers could provide that
option but I don't believe they will you
know I art is so far advanced from where
we were in dalvik that it and it has so
many innovative features and just
creative ways of dealing with the trying
to keep the cross-platform compatibility
of what developers expect from a
java-based environment but then drilling
that down into true native like
performance on the device you know this
idea that you can take your your high
level byte code compile it on device so
that what you're actually running is
very specific to the architecture and
the whole process that they do that with
is just it's something I've never seen
before in a mobile device and I think
it's a little bit more how does that
work and how's that going to change the
development experience well I think the
good news is I don't think it's going to
change the development experience much
for most you know luckily that that
burden Falls almost exclusively on
Google and them developing the tool
chains because most developers are
developing their applications using Java
and the the beauty of the way that art
is designed is that art is designed to
take the output
of that build the decks bytecode and
convert that on device during the
installation time into whatever the
native Native binary code is necessary
for whether it's are more x86 or
whatever that specific device is so the
developer tools in that case don't have
to change the only developers that are
really affected by this or developers
using native code and the good news is
the NDK has been able to support you
know all of these new features for a
very long time and so with the exception
of maybe some minor tweaks to some of
the hackery that some native developers
have had to do to work around some bugs
that were in dalvik even most native
developers are going to be just fine
with the code that they have if nothing
else they may just have to recompile
with the latest versions of the ndk now
speaking to developers Android studio is
now out its ball it's beta but it's
getting much more mature when do you
think it's going to be the right time
for teams to start thinking about
cutting over to Android studio as that
time coming yet now now of course me
personally I would have said now a year
ago but that's just who I am we've been
using android studio internally you know
in all the projects I've worked on since
the day it was released you know I
previous to that that's partially
because I was a very big fan of IntelliJ
I think they have great environments and
JetBrains in general this does a great
job with their products so I was very
excited to just jump on board with that
but I do understand that in the early
preview daze it was a little bit
difficult and it was definitely a big
learning curve introducing Gradle and
all this stuff at the same time it
really when the when the beta was
released at i/o earlier this this year
and that was the point where I really
didn't have any reservations anymore
about telling someone you ought to be on
this system you know you the system is
stable enough changes may come but it's
stable enough that you should be
migrating your projects on to this
without too much headache and if you
don't start now you're only going to get
left behind you know after hearings a
number of Google engineers speak on the
topic they've made it very clear that
the Eclipse in the ADT environment is a
wasteland at this point you know they
will probably continue to do some basic
maintenance and bug fixes but they're
not going to do any new features or
anything like that
that that project had chip is sale so if
you're not on Android studio now you
ought to be and if for no other reason
the only the only remaining complaint
that I've heard from people as well I'll
wait for one point oh well one point 0
RC 1 was released yesterday so there
goes that you you got to get on this
thing or you're going to get left behind
now for companies that have an existing
code base and they're running right now
on ATT Eclipse and they say okay I want
to make this cut what's involved for
them how much effort are we talking
about what are the gotchas they got to
watch for and what are some of the best
ways to make the transition sure in my
experience the the developer tools
themselves have done a really good job
of easing that transition as best they
can android studio has a phenomenal
project importer that really is not an
import project as much as it is a
migration tool you know in the early
versions it really was an import where
they would keep an eclipse or ADT based
project in the same structure that it
was and they would try and manipulate
the Gradle files to work with that
existing project kind of trying to keep
it compatible so if you wanted to go
back to the old tools you can now if you
import a project its I mean it is a full
migration they take what was your
project and they recreate a new one in
the proper Gradle structure transforming
anything they can taking jar files out
replacing them with dependencies I mean
they really convert what you've been
doing into something new underneath the
new paradigm with Gradle so they they
that's the best tool that I've seen in
the only cases where that tends to get a
little bit hairy is in some of the NDK
stuff now with one point 0 they've made
some advancements here and I haven't had
a lot of time to test them but generally
speaking there were some edge cases with
NDK building that the Gradle didn't
fully support it in support very well
and so sometimes they would developers
would have to manipulate how their
project was set up to use the NDK code
in a prebuilt way instead of allowing
Gradle to build the native sources
alongside the job now a lot of that
stuff has been fixed and will continue
to get fixed but that may be the only
headache that some people still run into
and trying to move from one
so if you're not running native code it
should be a pretty easy switch over it
should be dead simple with them except
you got to learn a little bit about
Gradle yeah yeah fair enough now looking
at the companies that you work with on a
regular basis what's the number one
mistake that you see time and time again
the companies and teams are making when
it comes to android huh well you know I
guess I'd have to say that the primary
one or the one that comes up time and
time again over all the years even now
is a misuse of context context in
android is it's something that we all
kind of fear but is a necessary evil you
know it's it's it's sort of a god object
it's something that you need everywhere
just about everything that you use
either inherits from or has access to a
context and not everybody fully
understands the reasons why it exists or
anything like that you know I mean
activities our contact services or
context application is and anything that
isn't a context like a receiver is given
one you know so you always need it you
you end up passing it around like a
peace pipe I mean it's just it's this
crazy thing that someone who's new to
android doesn't fully understand and the
biggest problem with it is they assume
that all contexts are created equal
which is absolutely not true you know
inactivity context and application
context are not the same thing you know
they're essentially this implement the
same interface but underneath they're
not the same object and they don't have
the same capabilities I wrote a blog
post on this about a year or so ago
that's almost gone viral for the same
reason you know because people just
don't understand it and they're
screaming for good information so 70
wants to find that blog post what are
they Google for context Dave Smith or
even context Android at this point but
it's the the problem with it is one
picking the wrong context to use for
whatever your use cases but the other is
not realizing that because you pass
context around so much you may be
holding references to this object for a
longer period of time than you wanted to
and since many objects that are contexts
are very heavy weight like activities
and services that is a huge huge
probably the number one cat cause of
memory leaks in android applications so
watching those references and making
sure
you have the right one for the right job
very important what about for people
looking to actually manage the
relationship between their business
logic and their activities especially
when they're dealing with the fact that
activities are getting recycled or
they're just being recreated when
there's a small device configuration or
orientation change and people are
struggling with well how do I manage my
contacts my call backs my state across
this life cycle do you have any advice
for these people you know there's a
there's a lot of debate in the community
about what the right way is to solve
that problem I'm not sure that I
subscribe to any one theory it kind of
seems like with each application project
I work on you know one option or like
you know one framework versus another
might work better in this case but i
think that the overall the overarching
principle when you're dealing with that
is that separation is key and i think
that the the biggest thing to make sure
that you're doing in your application is
that your your business logic is
properly separated from or at least
loosely coupled to your activities
themselves you know the the best way to
think of an application design with
activities is that they they could be
taken out from underneath you at any
time you know and so the activity should
really do little more than dealing
directly with the views it's trying to
present you know anything beyond that
that has it has any sort of duration
whether it's accessing stuff on disk or
trying to hit the network or even just
doing some long-running computation
anything that you start in directly
inside of an activity is going to affect
the system's ability to manage its life
cycle now whether that means you move it
into a service or some type of a
singleton or you know there are these
reactive frameworks to try and mitigate
some of those things as well that I
think is still up in the air and maybe
even a little bit application-specific
but the the biggest thing to keep in
mind is your activity should be very
very simple and doing little more than
receiving information to put up on the
view this is where things like the
loader pattern became so helpful but
there are other issues with just
assuming you can shove everything into a
loader but generally speaking it's the
simplest way for most people
to get started by getting that feedback
or that callback input into their
activity in a way that allows the
framework to manage that disconnect a
little bit better so it's a good
starting point fair enough and do you
have any last parting thoughts here for
our audience before we wrap up and head
back into the conference you know I
guess the only thing that I could think
of to say would just be if you if you
are waiting to jump on the bandwagon of
to start using lollipop or start
developing for lollipop specific stuff
you know don't wait get in there now the
the app compat stuff and this the
advances that we see with art and all
there's this is one of the biggest
releases we've seen in a long time and
there's some really exciting stuff in
there that you don't have to wait until
eighty percent of Android users are on
this platform to get there and even
those that are there's some amazing new
stuff that they can take advantage of
that you can start building into your
app so it's if you're afraid and you
want to wait till things get a little
bit bigger just just take the plunge
