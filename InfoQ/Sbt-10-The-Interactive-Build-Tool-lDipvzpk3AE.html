say how many you guys how many guys use
SPT how many awesome okay how many guys
love SPT how many of you guys hate SPT
okay so I I am I'm the the product owner
of SPT at typesafe I I started out as a
hater
I'll be honest okay I was a big maven
fan and I really started out as a hater
and I have progressed so what I want to
cover quick before we talk about a 100
which is where we're headed
is what what was good about SPT what did
we what actually drew me to it and it's
basically two things one was plus
published this was a necessary thing in
the scylla ecosystem plus publishes I
want to republish this library against
multiple scholar versions right this
actually enabled us to get over the
binary incompatibility hump that we were
in or slump or whatever which was just
madness in the early 2.6 days
anyone remember 2.6 yeah good times
these guys here anyway 2.7 2.7 was still
bad it wasn't until 2.9 that things
actually started to stabilize and we
didn't necessarily need it but we still
use it to cross to ten to nine it's
still very useful yeah anyway it's it's
good when every release of every library
doesn't break all of your code this is a
good place to be the but the big one is
actually test quick so test quick
combined with Tildy is where SBT watches
your sources okay
it will incrementally recompile based on
the local change that it has it will use
the incremental compilation to look at
the dependencies of your unit tests and
try to figure out which ones to run ok
so that I think is the epitome of SBT is
we have by virtue of having not really
great IDE support for a really long time
in Scala become the developer experience
of Scala we are the IDE almost the other
thing that's been really great is a
really diverse plug-in ecosystem at SBT
the core
of it is a type safe key value map which
is really pluggable if you think about
it
and type safe so I think our plugins
have sort of benefited from that and we
have a ton of them very quickly we use
Scala as a build language which I think
is the main reason we exist in the Scala
ecosystem that's all I'll say about that
and the SBT one thing I think we learned
from maven is that having a standard is
important but actually being able to
customize that standard for your company
is also important and if you make one of
those easy and one of those hard you're
actually asking for pain later so that's
one of the fundamentals behind SBT you
get a default build which is right now
the open source standard of how you
should make an open source project and
then you can customize as needed okay so
that's the pet what was bad about early
SBT well yeah IV it's it's it's still
the best conceptual model for
dependencies out there it beats the hell
out of maven I wouldn't go to a third
and in fact we were in talks about
moving to aether I unless things change
I don't think that's gonna happen but IV
is that there's really no development
going on it and it actually has a lot of
integration issues with maven that we've
been fighting so we'll make a decision
about that later that's not a wonder
thing but we acknowledge that this is a
problem okay and then we had pretty poor
documentation the documentation is still
terse we at least have a getting started
guide that's getting up there but this
is there'll be a lot of investment going
on in documentation and then the really
ugly for some people perhaps we actually
just completely threw away oo I would
I'm gonna make this claim and I'm not
gonna back it up because I can and I
only a 15 minutes the hardest thing to
understand in Scala is trait
linearization they are the hardest thing
to reason about in your own code is
trait linearization so we had to throw
it out the window it was too much for
ourselves and for our clients to
actually deal with effectively a whole
bunch of just fundamental bugs that we
couldn't solve
so we
in a way for our core engine now there's
a lot of things in a build tool that you
have to worry about that isn't true for
a lot of other situations you could use
Daniels cake pattern things and deal
with the madness yourself
we actually just backed off on that the
other thing that we had was around the
time SVT came around there a lot of
symbolic api's how many of you guys know
what this line does the first line how
many just curious anyone yeah okay cool
yeah so that's we have this path API
that we tried to base off of ant and you
know there's there's the one thing that
people loved more than the XML of ant
was the symbolic paths so we got it
right anyway so we're listening if you
look at what we've done in SBT to try
and prove that we improved the build
format and 0:13 okay when we move from
oo to this key value mappings the first
API was all these applicative functors
on tasks we didn't call them that
because it still wasn't cool I think
it's okay here to call them applicative
functors I hope is it cool okay yeah so
we actually kind of stole some of the
json Zoggs time and a lot of mark harris
and got the same kind of async maccaroni
stuff going on in the SBT build file to
make the syntax look a heck of a lot
better the only thing that I'm noticing
that's kind of a concern is people don't
realize that this is still asynchronous
if you declare a dependency on a key
it's not computed right where you wrote
it it's actually computed asynchronously
somewhere else other than that I think
the syntax has really cleaned up a lot
of SBT build files we did a lot with ivy
a lot of little stuff that you probably
don't notice besides I don't have to
delete the ivy cache all the time only
every once in a while so that's good and
then we did a big revamp at the getting
started guide in 0:12 and with 0:13
you're seeing some new interesting
things come out such as dot previous to
define incremental tasks that'll be in
the 0:13 to release notes let's talk
about vision because that's I don't have
enough time for anything else ok so
future we're actually what we're doing
is returning SBT into a server and I'll
talk a little bit more about that and
we're trying to clean up how plugins get
implemented the 100 is we're taking a
lot of the cleanups we did in zero 13
and 0 12 we're going to leverage what
we're good at and get it to a releasable
point okay you're gonna continue to
enjoy the stability of binary compatible
incremental releases for a full year on
the platform so you shouldn't have to
upgrade SBT all the time as was common
in the whole scale ecosystem when we
were invented okay so let's talk a
little bit about the server what's this
all about what does it actually mean
there's a realization and build tools
where basically a build tool is working
against the file system and it's this
giant shared piece of mutable states and
shared mutable state really makes
software easy to reason about and figure
out what's going on so we've never ran
into issues so what we want to do with
this is we're actually we're at the
second level of tooling in the Scala
ecosystem and this is where things like
Emacs things like Eclipse there's an
there's this thing called activator they
are actually pulling in the SBT build
and we have a bunch of users who are
using SBT as their development
environment with tilde test quick all of
those features that we're delivering in
SBT we actually want to leverage
everywhere for everyone so what we're
doing we're working with the Eclipse
team we're in talks with IntelliJ
activator already does this but you can
start SBT as a server and execute
commands on it and get events back so
it's an asynchronous event-driven server
when you write a plug-in you're gonna be
operating not on a local terminal but
inside of a server somewhere and you can
connect back to the terminal have a
prototype if anyone wants to see it I'll
show it to you don't have enough time to
go into it but essentially all of these
commands all of the state of the build
will be in a single locked instance one
of the secrets of scaling first is to
limit your problem as much as possible
so it fits on one machine I recommend
with this
server feature to definitely limit the
size of your build to something that
fits on a single machine I know that
some people didn't and that is not
something SPT is designed for anyway the
goal here is since we're sinking the
state across all these different pieces
if I compile in the terminal I will see
it in the IDE okay and we're exposing
auto-completion api's we're exposing all
sorts of fun ways of interacting another
thing that we're trying to get to with
this and we're play is the experiment
right now if you have custom SBT types
and things that you want to expose you
do so through the SBT server and then
you can consume it on a plugin we're
already doing this with activator just
for really simple things like show the
play UI after it loads hopefully you
know this this will be open for the
community
all sorts of fun customizations but you
can see things feeding through this
server ok so recap what we're doing
event-driven API for on SB T's build
structure your builds actually don't
change the only thing you'll you'll need
to pull in is this thing called a UI
context in a plug-in or if you want to
read a line of input or somehow interact
with the user you have to go through
this if you want to fire events out
custom events you fight fire it out that
way and you can annotate serializers on
your task keys and you're setting keys
and then they'll get serialize doubt the
server so that's what the one dot out
changes other than that fundamentally
nothing changes the other thing is we're
going to be sharing our build state now
between
ites and SBT so SBT becomes your
development environment automation ok
it's an engine to build an IDE
all right auto plug-ins this is we're
rethinking plugins we call this project
nature's at first but it turns out that
we like types better than random strings
so what this becomes is now I can define
a plug-in called an auto plugin this
works just like SBT plug-ins today the
difference is this project settings bit
anyone remember when all SBT plugins
used project settings and they got
included in all of your projects no
matter what yeah okay that was bad that
was those terrible you just can't
willy-nilly include yourself in a
project
the fundamental thing here in SBT is you
include a plug-in at a build level but
you can have multiple sub projects and
you only want to include a plug-in in
certain projects ok you don't
necessarily want it in all of them so
what we have is a select clause that
says the PGP plug-in requires the
project and being attitude to be an IV
module plug-in project
I need these settings ok I need that
nature on this project and then your
settings get added by default to that
project what's interesting is I can also
define global settings in here that will
only get added if a project in the build
wants me they won't get at it if I'm not
needed ok
the other cool thing is since all of
this information is available like
statically it's not dynamically created
we can index all of the tasks in a
plugin and if you include the plug-in in
your plugins not SVT and you call a task
and it's not defined on the project we
have an index of all those tasks we can
say oh this is defined on this plug-in
here's why we didn't call it so we won't
just say can't find the task will
actually say here's why here's how you
can include it ok so it's really about
getting visibility and in defining
dependencies across plugins this is what
it looked like from a user perspective
if a plug-in can't just automatically be
added this SBT will by default have a
few nature's a few plugins we're gonna
split out defaults into plugins there'll
be a few on projects by default you can
remove them you can add new ones and
this will define how things
automatically get blended so if a
plug-in is automatically added that's
causing problems you can exclude it what
this doesn't solve is the whole can I
resolve a plug-in bit I think we're
gonna have to look into that separately
here's what we're looking at for
splitting out default settings
there'll be core settings that have to
be added to everything because they can
close they control the SBT engine and
then we have an IV module setting a Java
Scala setting and possibly tests I don't
know if we're gonna split those out as a
separate plug-in I don't think it looks
likely right now and then the idea is
that community plugins can directly
depend
via Auto plugins and automatically get
wired in so in the future when you want
to add PGP you don't write it in like
three places and the beauty of this is
if I'm in a IDE and I want to add PGP
related features to projects I can just
programmatically add the PGP plugin and
the settings get wired to the right spot
because the plug-in developers told me
how to do that so this is actually funny
enough this feature helps automation way
more than users it just happens that it
also helps you not have to write as much
in your builds so that's the last
feature you know IB will resolve
conflicts and dependencies in a binary
level auto plug-ins are just about
defining dependencies on project
settings and then beyond that there's
this notion of process management
attaching debuggers doing Auto class
reloading like you have in play for any
project whatsoever these are the kind of
things we want to go to write like SBT
becomes a dev tool it becomes the engine
for your developer experience that's
where we're taking it I really love to
have a hosted presentation compiler so
that all editors are an equal footing
for great giving you a really great
experience that's that will happen in my
dreams for now we'll see any-any I have
eight minutes so I can take our question
yes what I yeah so I haven't I haven't
reached out to the enzyme guys I would
love to have I mentioned Emacs because
the idea is we want things like enzyme
to be able to rip this in I do not have
time to write that integration I barely
have enough time to finish the server so
well and our team I should say one up
here okay
so the question is about SBT and zank
where does Inc fit in the zinc is just
the incremental compiler just the
incremental compiler SBT is all of the
tasks in automation you have about the
project including packaging and the idea
of hosting like the presentation
compiler that is something that is
specific to your build you have to know
all of the Scala arguments you want that
kind of stuff
Zink is literally just I'm going to
compile your code so in here we'll have
hooks to attach rebels but and all that
kind of fun any other question
yes oh what's the current state well
there's a there's a prototype it's kinda
it's kind of lame so it's there's a SPT
remote control package where you can see
the current state of the server it's
under a branch called whip Model View
server right now I'm just booting up
connecting to the SPT server and this is
my two hundred lines of really really
crappy Scala code to implement a
terminal on SBT on top of the server so
there's portions that we know are stable
and portions that are still experiments
so if you look at the code things that
are in the SBT package are firm things
that are not are not firm you can see
here I can run tasks it there's
autocomplete that sort of thing if I run
compile it compiles and let's start up
okay we'll start up another client just
so you can see this this is in the same
directory right now we do the server
locking of only one server per directory
so if you have a build to find added
directory that controls all of the sub
projects for that directory that's where
the server lives there's only one
instance of it ever you see that one
started up way faster because I'm just
connecting to a live server if I type
name that's it'll tell me the project
name yeah or it won't because I'm in act
oh hey there it told me the project name
on the other side yeah
thanks guys yeah okay and looks like it
looks like I have another deadlock issue
in my terminal because again the
terminal is this is a throwaway thing I
just wrote for a demo for today yes
do I see people running a server in a
cloud I am terrified of the security
implementations of such a thing right
now but I do think that that will
probably happen at some point yeah you
could run it in the cloud and then and
then send your things over the thing
about running in a cloud though is that
you need your editing then somehow
exposed via the cloud and you need this
like a way of syncing the files between
where you're editing them and the SBT
server so I did I think cloud is
definitely like on the path but I don't
think it's a wonder thing because I
think there's a lot of other tooling
that has to be built up around that
first it's definitely if you want to
talk to my vision for SBT - oh it's it's
even crazier but that's part of it yeah
yeah what yeah we have to replace ivy
but then I mean I mean the big reason we
have to replace ivy is because it
doesn't make me happy
so well that's so that's the reason why
we haven't switched yet we look I looked
into aether we did a bunch of
investigation into it I don't know if
you're familiar with IV it has this
notion of configurations that we
leverage heavily aether has you have
those maven attachments that you can
attach to artifacts but you can't
control the dependencies of the
attachments separately from the module
and so yeah the model just doesn't work
like we can't actually translate over so
then we were looking at Gradle actually
made their own dependency manager so we
talked with them a little bit that one
right now I'm not going to import all of
Gradle into SBT just to use dependencies
and it's all kind of together so we
tried to rip it out but it didn't work
yes so I want the the actual module
system as you saw in that slide oh let
me let me just show my deadlock here you
guys enjoy that that's um that's the
danger of live code if you saw in the
the server in the slide of how we want
to specify our plugins I'd really love
for the IV part to be completely
abstracted and have an IV plugin that
sits off of a generic I expose myself
somehow to the world interface
right that's how you should feel every
time you publish the maven central by
the way but yeah I'd like to be able to
do that so we can start experimenting
with other things the the reality is
that especially some of the advanced
usages that people are doing we're
really tied to Ivy's API right now so if
we swap it is going to be a breaking
change that's going to be a major SBT
revision and the ecosystem is not there
is nothing I can switch to right now
safely for the Wando so that that would
be a next step that helps but yeah I I
consider that kind of a orthogonal
concern to SBT core but that doesn't
mean that the SBT team wouldn't work on
it yeah
yeah so the the question is I'm totally
out of time I don't know if you want to
kick me off but okay this is the last
question about remote debugging so
they're basically two things that I'm
going to mention there one is I blasted
past it we're gonna have a remote a
process 14 API in SBT where you'll be
able to attach to the input and output
console and attach debuggers and we
might actually include a default agent
to do code reloading I don't know how
far that's gonna go so that that's what
the longer-term plan is for a 1 dot oh
this the prototype server will be
available in 0:13 shortly after 0 13 -
there'll be a binary compatible one that
you can start playing with it won't be
the default eat until one oh and one
auto the server will be the default
otherwise all of this falls apart
because all of that nice shared state
you have in the file system you start to
try to have multiple processes sync
across it and then it's madness just
pure madness so we have to go to a
single server yeah so I think that
answered both questions thanks
