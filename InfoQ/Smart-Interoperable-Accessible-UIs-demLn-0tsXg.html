toshe i'm at a developer conference i'm
not particularly developer i was in the
past but that was a long time ago what I
do today is I have been working on
accessibility standards for a long time
this is not limited to accessibility but
this is a session on improving
accessibility and your overall user
experience so I've worked for the last
14 years 15 years in accessibility in
the US federal government and I've also
worked with the w3c working groups
mostly under the way umbrella which is
the web accessibility initiative most of
you are familiar with so one of the
things I mean you know what your
challenges are in the mobile world where
you have things that are multiple
devices multiple channels your user
users are in various places and using
various contexts and they have problems
sort of getting the information they
need no matter who they are as a user so
we want to go through some things you
can do to ensure to the best extent
possible that you're going to be giving
people the best user experience moving
forward in these newer technologies in
our changing world where our wall is our
user interface and our car is our user
interface so here we go maybe maybe not
okay so yeah that's the stuff I have a I
have an image up here of a Christmas
present from my daughter she's 25 she's
an art teacher one of my favorite
sayings is from Helen Keller it says the
best and most beautiful things in the
world cannot be seen or even touched
they must be felt with the heart my
daughter made this for me two years ago
and yeah it's a it's a really cool she's
a abstract artist she thinks she's not a
good artist but to me she's awesome and
she's really good at inspiring children
and so this is a canvas with cutouts of
cardboard boxes with those words and
it's it's pretty neat and exciting for
me like I said I've been working the
federal government space for like 12
years and last couple years I got out of
that and got sort of more into the
private sector I work for a product
company that made a compliance tool for
accessibility of security and privacy
and I've my second stint with JPMorgan
Chase and the awesome team that your
host here at least your personal host
John folio fall it however you want to
say I work with him on this team and
it's a great team so they are they're
doing this thing if you've been involved
with accessibility at all and it's
probably true in any other
implementation that you're trying to
work on is you give them all the
requirements and you tell them what you
need and they go now we can't do that
cost too much money we don't have time
and the accessibility arena this has
been going on I've been saying things to
my you know supervisors for years saying
we need to do XY and Z and they go yeah
well that's nice but you know we don't
have any money we don't have a reason no
business case blah blah blah well you
know what happens is these really great
people who are advocates sort of get up
there and take things to court it
changes the whole atmosphere right so I
mean without talking about any bank in
particular there was this bank that was
a really big bank it's been around for
over 100 years
and they had actually almost scrapped
their accessibility team a couple years
ago and then there are some suits that
came up and certainly went oh wait a
minute we need some people we need some
good people right away so they brought
back some people that they had let go
and the requirements of one of the most
recent suits became the requirements for
this particular organization to
implement which is you've got to have
training you've got to have a QA program
you could have all these things and so
all these things that the various
leaders throughout the years have been
telling them it accessibly they needed
to do and they said no we can't we don't
want to as too much it's not necessary
are now going we want this yesterday how
come it's not ready so for us this is
terribly exciting right so anyway we'll
go from there today we're going to go
over concerns responsibilities and Trust
which is most important thing as a
developer that you can do to be able to
be successful if you want to have your
work be implemented they have to trust
that what you're giving them is
something that isn't going to screw with
their excuse me can I say that it's
going to mess with their their business
model their reputation in various ways
and that matters for privacy and
security as well as accessibility device
independence is changing is the next
piece we're going to talk about really
quickly and then what we feel are some
of the ways that you might be able to
come out of this hole to make your life
a little bit easier with developing for
multiple devices in multiple places and
multiple user context so this is what
indie UI is about and that's one of the
things we're going to go over and then
we're going to talk just for a second
about the effort and what it needs from
you so concerned responsibilities this
is a seesaw and on the left side is an
icon for accessibility also transparency
also collaboration on the other side is
security privacy and data protection
would you say any of these things are
important to you in your work today
exactly right you don't have a choice if
you want to be successful you must
perform this balancing act
you have to make things accessible you
have to build transparency and you have
to work in collaborative environments
you want to work in collaborative
environments but at the same time you
have security concerns privacy concerns
and you're responsible for data
protection so there's a growing number
of privacy concerns and laws I'm sure
you're familiar with the Affordable Care
Act and things that go along with that
which is high-tech and HIPAA so that's
health privacy but there's all kinds of
others with coppa which is you know
children's privacy online you know you
think you're doing something innocent
and you put up an image for your
organization that's got a picture of a
child some cases that can be utilized in
correctly so these are these are things
that you have to know about otherwise
you're going to be providing you are
going to be providing content for your
organization and putting that
organization at risk and they your
employer's look at that as someone they
don't necessarily want to have around if
you're not aware of these requirements
then you're not as valuable to them as a
tool I'm not going to talk about it a
lot but in the United States privacy is
not as powerful or well defined as it is
in some other places in the world Europe
has a bit of a higher privacy bar then
the United States has at the moment they
also have a Data Protection Authority
which we don't have we have a federal
agency that's kind of taking the lead
it's not really their job which is the
FTC the Federal Trade Commission FCC is
doing some of that the federal
communications commission but in general
we don't have it we were left up to what
the FTC can do and what the original
individual state attorney general's can
do and they have their own laws to try
to protect people's privacy and I think
anybody in this room may be concerned
about protecting your privacy right
things things are getting use
inappropriately and as a web developer
you have a responsibility to protect
that data to the extent that you can and
to use tools and provide interfaces that
are don't put those those components at
risk so identity concern identity theft
concerns
another component of the privacy is we
need to ensure that I'm going to just
read this because i don't have my notes
and i'm going to pain we need to ensure
that we protect the identity of all
users especially persons with
disabilities identity theft this one's a
fastest growing crimes in america in
2003 13.1 million consumers suffered
identity thought fraud that's a lot of
people the second highest level on
record and that's only going to get more
and more and more so do the case year
after your identity thieves continue to
come up with new ways to steal using
your identity and well this is your job
mr. Phelps should you choose to accept
it you actually do have to accept it you
have to accept that that's a component
of what you do in your job is you don't
want to be providing content that is
going to be putting people's identity at
risk so they could lose their home they
could lose all kinds of things they
could lose their own personal individual
reputation forget about your
organization but that puts your
organization at risk some security
concerns so the proliferation of content
with dark data so you may have all kinds
of data that you're sharing through your
applications and some of that is is an
identity and a PII risk so you could
have say an Excel spreadsheet and
someone said well we want to not have
someone see the data in that so we're
just going to make the text white
instead of not have it available so
therefore that's something someone can
search for and find just because it's
not seen doesn't mean it's not data that
can be accessed so this is an issue it's
a big issue and people not really having
a true understanding of how to protect
data from bit from is use that insecure
content secure various security holes
cross-site scripting and web beacons
various things like that and that is a
big problem because organizations are
allowing you to use your own devices
which in some cases you really like but
that opens up a whole bunch of other
issues for protection and of course
social collaboration which is how we do
everything and how we want to do
everything and how everyone can have
access to so many things but this
provides incredible challenges as well
some of the accessibility concerns
there's increased regulation
enforcement in this area I'm sure you
all know that title through title three
of the ad a is not officially saying
that websites are required to be
accessible but in fact the Department of
Justice has come down on several
lawsuits and consent degrees including
the one that may have had something to
do with a bank that I worked for that
says that actually yeah websites are a
place of public accommodation they do
need to be accessible and so if your
organization isn't requiring it today
they're we're going to require it
tomorrow or the next day so this is
something that you need to take into
account there is a there are some links
here to the National Association for the
depth consent degree with Netflix which
so instead of just people sue them but
instead of just having to pay a fine
what they have is a consent decree they
have to do a certain number of things
one of the reasons that this is really
important if we go back to some of the
privacy issues is that if someone
violates someone's privacy and in this
case it's happening now with
accessibility the organization the
government organization or authority can
come into an organization and look at
its books in the case of privacy if your
books are not correct you're not doing
things correctly they can come into your
organization for the next 20 years and
you have to provide a report and they
can look at everything that you do to
make sure you're covering privacy
concerns and what you're supposed to
most organizations don't want anybody
any regulatory organization inside in
their books right so with that in mind
that model is probably going to start
happening with accessibility and that's
one of the reasons why based on this
2014 National Foundation for the blind
versus H&amp;amp;R Block regulation and consent
decree is so it's pretty much setting up
the expectations of those things of
organizations need to do and what's
going to happen if you don't we expect
this this and this you know every year
and if they don't get that they're going
to end up in this case I'd be the
Department of Justice and nobody wants a
department justice in their books okay
so i've talked about these various
issues and concerns which is about
vulnerability it's about the
organization that you work for that you
want to work for and you want to give
them your talents but they they have
risks and you have risks that you're not
even aware of this is an image for those
people can't see it of a big iceberg in
the ocean and above the ground above the
water is a small amount that says risk
awareness but below the water is this
huge boulder that says risk ignorance
and so vulnerability is about more than
what you can see this is a quote never
in all of history have we harnessed such
formidable technology every scientific
advancement known to man has been
incorporated into its design the
operational controls are sound and
foolproof this is what we think we're
doing when we're building something
that's really neat and fun that was a
quote from EJ Smith the captain of the
Titanic and he thought everything was
good he had the latest technology he was
doing this amazing thing and lots of
people died in a really horrible fashion
it is these are things that you need to
know about and be concerned about and
take into account with whatever you're
developing so to get specific about some
of those risks again for accessibility
security privacy and data really an
organization to reputation and that in
many cases is number one if they don't
trust you if your customers don't trust
you if your organization's customers
don't trust you they're going to leave
you and go to somebody who they can
trust that's important it's very
important if you'd find that you have a
social media site that you use and
there's lots of issues happening there
you'll move to one that you know that
has a better model for security and
privacy which then can affect
financially the organization right if
they lose their clients they lose their
marketing they lose their ad money
they've lost and they have certain
things certain organizations really care
about their brand
and their intellectual property they
want to be sure that that's protected
and then of course they're the legal
issues so users are increasingly aware
of their civil rights on the web this is
a thing whether its accessibility
whether it's privacy whether it's
security this is what oh I didn't
explain that sorry about that I'm sorry
I know I don't have an accessibility
community here a11y stands for the word
accessibility a 11 letters and a why I
think it came out the w3c because for
internationalization you've got i18n
right but it's a way to shorten a word
you say too much and write down too much
and I always misspell it which is pretty
funny so so so every single item news
what do you see at least every week
there's been a breach here there's been
this there you know so this is a big
deal users understand what their rights
are or they're becoming more and more so
and so whatever you put out there you
need to understand what their concerns
are going to be and what they're going
to be looking for and making complaints
about again lawsuits from employees and
consumers data breaches or leaks of PII
which is personally identification
personally identifiable information pif
I personally identifiable financial
information this can result in market
share which I talked about you lose the
inability to be a model inclusive
employer if you're if you're concerned
about accessibility and because of that
you can miss out an important business
partnerships if you have a partner say
Microsoft who requires three or your SLA
s your standard agreements that your
components will be accessible and
they're not and you can't prove that
they are then they're going to not have
an interest in working with you
collaboration data sharing third-party
products so if you're using a
third-party product and whatever you're
using you want to find out whether that
product itself is accessible if you got
all this trouble to make something
accessible and and watch for the privacy
and the security components and if the
third-party component that's the perfect
thing that you need that fits exactly
what you want doesn't do that and breaks
everything you've put
together this is a problem one it's a
responsibility of a choice that you make
of which technology you're going to
choose but it is it's it's a problem
it's a risk again and again increased
audit and oversight and stringent
government fines and consent degrees
which are just growing and growing so I
think I've beaten that fish but but one
of the things that not that there are
any CIOs in this room but if there are
or if you work for CIO which is the case
often Gartner did some research that
said in the next by 2016 20 percent of
all CIOs will lose their jobs because
they weren't concerned about these
important components of compliance of
accessibility privacy and security data
protection so that's something that your
boss is concerned about so what do you
need to do you need to build trust in
your skills in your products with your
employer for your customers and your
consumers your users whoever they may be
so one of the things that's going to
help you get there in the first place is
even though whiz-bang exciting things
are fun to work with you want to
continue to be sure that you are
embracing web standards to the extent
possible with what you're doing because
you're going to their lot of people
spending a lot of time trying to make
sure that the standards that they put
together are watching out for those
components that maybe you're not aware
of you don't have time to go read every
single law in every country that where
your work is going to be that's one way
because that that kind of information is
is built into standards to the extent
that it can be for security and
accessibility you have to even though
it's going to bother you embrace the
requirements that your clients have for
legal and organizational compliance
requirements for data protection privacy
and accessibility they're going to say
here's what I need you to do and these
are the things you have to comply with
this standard these laws and you'll go
oh my god and instead of oh my god you
need to say yeah as a matter of fact we
need to do blah blah blah this will
really raise your level in their eyes as
to whether what you have to offer them
is worthwhile if they know that you
understand what their risks are to this
organization because you build in
components that protect data privacy of
individuals and accessibility them
they're going to be happy about that so
your bread and butter could depend upon
it so overall there's a common theme
here whether we're talking about
accessibility collaboration transparency
privacy security all of this is that
information has to be made accessible
and available to the people who should
have access to it and protected from the
people who should not this is really
important and the other thing is that
because of the legal requirements this
data sometimes has to be documented
saved archived for a certain period of
time because they go back and look at
records and they say did you do XY and z
did you do your due diligence if you
have done some due diligence maybe you
messed up but if you can show a history
of we took into account privacy concerns
we took into account security concerns
we did these things that will help that
organization from when it comes down to
having suits and various things like
that so device independence is changing
what is device independence anybody want
to shoot at it
right that's a good thing so a lot of
people for a long time in my world
accessibility sorry about that what is
device independence the gentleman in the
front said giving a usable experience no
matter what site of what device you're
accessing a site from right so in for
many years what people would say would
say keyboard accessibility is device
independence in the accessibility world
because this is what we pushed because
in a desktop environment that worked but
we don't live in a whisk desktop
environment anymore right so before the
mobile web which is touch gesture haptic
and has speech events the LA community
used to used to say was keyboard
accessibility but in fact what it was
was keyboard dependence right but you
all have devices on you right now that
may not have a keyboard right you don't
access it necessarily with a keyboard
and so that becomes a problem the other
problem of course is that you're you're
using multiple multiple devices multiple
kinds of inputs and you have to you have
to develop for each and every one of
these modalities which is a problem
right is this going to work on iOS and
the touch is it's going to work on this
component with the keyboard is this
going to work on this component with a
gesture on this version of this you know
operating system it's too complicated
it's gone way beyond the browser you
know what a browser supports and goes
into all kinds of other really complex
components so we have these devices now
that aren't just things we hold its
things we wear their pictures here of an
automobile with its interface for the
web there's a palm with a light shining
on it
various numbers as a keyboard there's a
robot there's some something like Google
glass there's sort of a robot type thing
and so we have very different kinds of
devices that you're trying to build for
and you don't want to author you want to
use your enterprise architecture
requirements you don't want to author
something different for every single
channel and device you want to author
once so we need to address changing
interactions for the kinds of devices
the number and size and input modalities
with interaction parameters these things
have grown they're going to continue to
grow they're not going to get any less
which leaves you having to code
consistently to try to consistently
provide an interface across these
various things it's really really hard
so what do we need to do about that we
need something that's true in device
independence it's not keyboard
dependence it supports all applications
of platforms whether its native hybrid
or web we need simplified generic way we
need to reduce the developers burden
right to be able to code once that will
work on various platforms and devices
and in a range of various contexts I'm
not going talk too much about w3c but
for anyone who is unfamiliar it's a
standards organization and its run out
of various universities around the world
is everyone familiar skip it all
together okay so some of the some of the
things that w3c is trying to do is using
n DUI which is a new standard this under
development a coupling it with various
other kinds of resources they're trying
to come up with some strategies to to
make it easier for the developer and so
that's one place that you can go to get
some information what I'm going to go
into is what n DUI does it's a working
group to start in 2012 and its purpose
is to be able to make it easier for web
applications to work in a wide range of
context across different devices and
an assistive technologies and based on
user needs and the user can define their
needs so it's two different specs one is
more mature than the other I'm on this
working group but again i'm the least
technical person obviously and so the
first component is the event spec which
came out last year but it's constantly
updated if you haven't work with a w3c
one of the things that they do is they
publish their working drafts and they
want user feedback and this is something
that's highly needed right now for these
both of these specifications if you can
look at it and make when they put it up
for public comment which is true right
now for the user context
requirement it would be really wonderful
because they need some user feedback as
well as implementations so the the first
Beck is the event spec and so it allows
you to have to identify low level
interface events delivered through the
operating system to the web app it's a
abstract layer that's in between the
operating system and the web application
and it says I want to we go back to the
previous page I have an image that has a
web app at the bottom and then this
generic scroll events roll request event
and above that there is a someone
speaking for scroll down page down using
an arrow using the mouse using the
keyboard or with a touch event and it's
basically saying I want to scroll down
it's not I want to scroll down with a
mouse I want to scroll down with your
voice it's a scroll down event so that
when you're developing you only have to
say I want to scroll down and no matter
what device you're on whether it's the
wall you're talking to it or it's the
car and you're talking to it or it's
some other kind of interaction the
development process is the same you just
want to scroll down so as an abstract
layer between the physical device
specific user interaction of events and
inferred user intent such as scrolling
or changing values i want to make the
slider go up and down I want to move in
further on this map I want to zoom in i
want to zoom out it's an intermediate
layer between device and
modality-specific user interaction
events and the basic UI functionality
used by web applications user context as
a second one which talks about needs and
preferences so a person can get not just
subtitles or subtitles or captions but
you can get in the language that you
prefer because you've identified that in
your settings so it provides authorized
web applications access to information
about a user's relevant settings and
preferences to provide the best possible
optimized experience for users does
anybody here on a UX team so how
important is the user experience yes
right not important at all right right
exactly so I mean so there's so many
different levels of this it's not just
can they do what they want to do but do
they like it is it easy for them are
they going to come back are they going
to use it right I mean this really is
the basis for everything on the web
because if it sucks they're not going to
be here if it's they can't give a
presentation like me you're going to
leave but if you can't do that the right
way then people are going to go to
someone else who can offer them that
same service and not do that so this is
really really important the user context
even though it started out here in
accessibility it moves to I have a
screen I am outside the sunshine I need
to be able to see I need some higher
contrast I need some various things that
are going to make my interaction with
this application more useful to me on a
personal level I mean most of the user
interface organizations are getting into
personalities and all these various
kinds of things but it really is it
matters this is how we interact with
world today so one of the things that we
have to keep in mind based on the user
context is when you have preferences and
you expose them that can be a privacy
concern and a security concern people
can find out that you're using a screen
reader and then try to offer you various
things or take advantage of you in a
particular way and this is something
that we are very concerned about
something we've taken into account and
in a minute i'll go into what we're
doing with the privacy group about that
but we're going to make sure that this
spec is going to address that so
basically one of the major components of
privacy on the web is that a user makes
a choice they're given a choice they're
not automatically signed up for
something if they don't check X it has
to be the user intent to do this and
then they can control the level that
they're going to share of their personal
information and so that's one of the
components that we're working with the w
73 sees privacy interest group but let
me go back to the event spec so the key
benefits of the event spec is you as
content authors and developers no I no
longer have to worry about providing
events for multiple inputs for keyboard
mouse gesture touch voice and even
haptic events all you need to do is
provide one type of generic you I event
which is dismiss zoom in zoom out and it
will be able to be used by whatever
device is your you're using so an
example of this on dismissing a modal
dialog is to close out of a camp can't
pay a mobile application the code says
button you I trigger equals dismiss
cancel close button having to do that
instead of having to do that for each
and every type of device each and every
kind of modality is a whole lot easier
right and having to worry about again
the platform the device you know that
all of these things this is one of the
most important components of this I mean
it certainly is so the benefits this
benefits 80 users also but
just importantly all mainstream users
authors can focus on content which is
pretty much what everybody wants to be
doing so there are triggers there are
you I triggers in the spec you I
manipulators which is something that
needs the most work right now and we
would really really appreciate your
feedback there's a certain list of
events that are being put out there in
this one point 0 spec there are a lot
more that we have an interest in and
supporting but that's going to take time
probably come a little bit further along
and in some other components of other
standards some of these things are
already being worked on so we're working
with those groups like was web events
before but now its web components so we
want to make sure that we're getting all
the things we can but we didn't go too
far with this first one point 0 release
but anyways some of the things you are
requested vents are interface requests
event focus requests event manipulator
requests event you i scroll request
change value that kind of thing the user
context spect the other specification
the one that has to do with user
preferences the key benefits of this
spec is it defines a set of preferences
that users can choose to expose to web
applications and an API for user agents
to access the preferences and listen for
changes users can set preferences
currently for features such as screen
size font size and color but there will
be a lot more kinds of things that will
be covered in the future users with
disabilities can provide information
about 80 in use indicate the display is
an accessibility mode and indicate what
kinds of subtitles and audio
descriptions they may need web
applications can use this information to
optimize the presentation without a
requirement target a specific advice
device operating system or locale
there's just an image here of you know a
various devices in the middle and all
the various things that a user context
has which is marketing functionality
information architecture content design
these are input blah blah various things
but the whole point of the matter is
that we all want to get content the way
that we can best consume it and that's
what this component of the spec is about
getting content the way you want it and
the way you need it works for people
with disabilities but it works for
everybody else I don't want to see all
this information about something that
isn't relevant to me I want the
components are relative relevant to me
and so in my settings I can say I only
want to see the news or I only want to
see Fox News because that's who I am or
I only want to see you know CNN because
that's who I am so you can filter out
the ugliness of the world that you don't
really want to see some of the some of
the components right now again in use of
color settings user type and font
settings media settings and currently
screen reader settings right now this
spec works very tightly with html5 and
Aria and so currently it's mostly
supportive of screen reader technologies
for the server's accessibility goes that
is to be extended it just hasn't so much
at this particular point but it will and
again this is just an image of a a
mobile screen with checkboxes and having
to create that screen for just in one
way instead of for all the various
operating systems and all the various
browsers on operating systems is
something you don't have to do ND you I
trust privacy and ping so ping is the
w3c's privacy interest group and they
didn't want to call themselves pig so
they call themselves ping because it
sounds better and they're not pigs if
you have anything to do with privacy
most of the people who work in that are
attorneys in general so it's interesting
to have them mixed with the w3c
technology people but anyway so we have
been working with them they're reviewing
our specs to make sure that we are doing
the things that we need to do in fact we
went to them we tried for over a year to
contact them say give us your input now
they're like totally engaged and they
you know assigned a liaison Chavez to be
me and so we are making sure that the
constant
really really vital concerns about
privacy not only in the accessibility
space but it's important in the
accessibility space are going to be
addressed in this product II so forget
the bottom part of that all right so the
last component here is that we need your
input as I've said several times if you
have ever contributed to any provided
comments or anything for a new w3c specs
in if you haven't no problem I 14 years
ago went to a conference somewhat like
this and I had just become a 508
coordinator at a federal agency and you
know the day before the CIO says you're
it now there's this law go deal with it
you know and I walked into a room with
people in w3c and they said come join us
you having no you no experience at all
but your web developer will be able to
give us you know a certain kind of
feedback there's all kinds of feedback
of course you have people are very
skilled but your ideas are needed and
are useful to any spec being built
question okay that's not a question he's
scratching his head but does that mean
you're confused ok so the savoia matter
is is the way yes sir there is a real
question hello
yes right yes yes absolutely absolutely
so I guess again I do want to stress if
you feel like you actually don't have
anything to bring to the table you do if
this interest you if it's something that
you want to think about implementing
because you want your life to be easier
we want to see this happen then any
comments when they put out a request for
public comments is extremely helpful and
then on the other hand becoming a
working group member is awesome now I'm
not sure whether in DUI is open to that
at the moment I think they are because
they start out with a lot more people
and now they have a little bit less a
little bit less participation but the
participation in the UI currently is IBM
Apple surprisingly in some ways and
other ways no and yes question ok so see
I should have talked about the w3c so
the w3c is an international standards
organization that's been in place for 25
years about that and so yes so what
happens is the reason that you want a
standard obviously for everyone is for
interoperability of components and
various countries will point to a
standard and say you must use this and
so when everybody uses the same thing
then you have interoperability and it
works right so as far as accessibility
goes ok and that kind of thing is good
for web content you know user agent
accessibly guidelines is good for
browsers and so in DUI is a working
group of the w3c that is working on this
specification the overall way that India
that w3c works is I think there maybe
not 500 but they're about member
organisations and each organization gets
one vote in various decision-making
processes and one of them is certain
standards that happen and so they have
these working groups where their company
will task people to work on this
standard but at the same time they also
have people who are relevant and
knowledgeable in this whatever the topic
happens to be
they're it's you know voicexml or call
center XML or whatever it happens to be
and you can join as an invited expert if
you happen to be an expert in that
particular area and there's so many
specs that are being worked on and we
all want them to work together one of
the components of w3c maybe a quarter of
what they do is the web accessibility
initiative and so they review all specs
for accessibility just like the privacy
team eventually is to review all specs
for privacy and I guess security is
going to be a similar paradigm yes right
under the transparency box that I had
here yeah they do this in public so
people can see what's being done and so
that Microsoft is not porting this you
know and making it go their way or one
of other other companies making it go
their way this is vitally important for
having everybody look at how things are
being built did you have a follow-on
question to that okay um so okay
yeah so right now so what happens is
that the specification track the
standards track requires a whole bunch
of things and one of those things is
before you can actually end up with a
candidate for a standard is you have to
have implementations practical
implementations is that's another
component that we are looking for we do
have I believe three browsers that are
implementing but I'm i know that two are
anyway I'm apples of course one of them
but they have to have at least two
successful working implementations
before you're actually able to go on and
talk about it becoming a standard but we
also have to have really useful
information in there so if you happen to
have information about a particular
component or a particular browser or you
know anything you feel is relevant to
this effort then you know your voice is
helpful so it will be it's going to
happen but we're very much infancy is
but when if you want to build something
the right way you really need people get
hey did you guys think of XY and Z and
of course no that's why we need you know
people to come in and we try everyone
tries but you have a limited number of
people who can and you know you have
particular context that have may not
have been addressed so they do need to
be addressed so if you just do a search
in DUI you will find the links to the
various things you need Yanina cyka is
the chair of the ndu i working group and
i'm sure she would love to hear from you
but again you're welcome to just go out
and peruse the documents and and right
now again the user context spec is open
i think until august for public comment
so looking at it and going gee what
about this user context or what about
that it may be one that we're looking at
for another version or maybe something
we haven't thought about it all so we
really want and need that input
especially on the that one component i
talked about i came from what is but
anyway michael cooper is the w3c staff
contact each of these working groups has
a w3c staff member who does a lot of the
you know help interacting with the
standards organization so either one of
those people would be happy to hear from
you I
have my email information here which is
Katie hairy toes Shay at chase com or
rila dog at gmail and I have a LinkedIn
profile and this video is going to be
available and the the presentation will
be available wherever John puts these
things up so with that any questions
okay um yes where the user settings
going to be stored that's really
important question really important
question and I don't have the answer to
that but I know there is an answer for
that in the spec but that's something
that's been thought about and talked
about quite a bit so there is there is a
way to do that and maintain anonymity
which is what you need to do and it you
know in in general what's going to
happen is when someone is going in and
using an application and there they want
to have their user preferences exposed
they're going to be asked a certain
number of things it's going to be like a
pop up in any of your browsers that you
have today this application wants you
know access to your you will say yes no
yes no whatever it happens to be but
where that where that data is stored
matters a lot and again I don't know I
know that we've thought about it and we
have an answer for it I don't have to
have it that's the plan that's what you
want to do to to to keep your anonymity
right there's some kind of an anonymous
instance you know conversation that
happens with the server yes sir
but that's not most people don't know
they can do that and also that's not an
elegant way to do it and also a lot of
information actually can't you can't get
you know subtitles and language you want
the font size that you want that kind of
thing and so this is a richer version of
that and so and it allows that
particular application coming to you
from Target or you know that's by or
whoever it is and bringing it to you in
the way that you want to see it and
doesn't look like a mess because you
made this this interesting change right
it's it's keeping the integrity of the
data of the user experience not giving
you some ghetto view of something but
giving you the view that you want that's
rich and interacts appropriately the way
that you need things to interact yes
another question you can you can because
it's only for the session it's only for
that session I mean if you want to save
it if you want to allow it if say you're
always using this particular banking
application or something like that and
you have these particular settings that
you want to have there may be a way to
store it on your own but it's not stored
in the server nothing state is stored on
the server only in anonymous instance
exactly i mean this is this is vital
it's vital in so many ways yeah we want
to make it easier but we also don't want
to make it we want to be sure that we're
doing with things that we need to do to
make it safe for everyone and I mean
it's a you know two-edged sword make
your job easier and make the user more
satisfied and and less work sounds like
magic probably is magic but eventually
we're at the magic today right we're
magic with the technology you all have
in your hands that five years ago didn't
exist 10 years ago was unheard of so
we'll get there but we would love your
participation yes sir yes
no problem so because we are very much
in touch with this that particular group
of people in that organization and so
all of these things are it's kind of
working in concert it's not like
happening in a vacuum one of the things
someone brought to us the other day
Cynthia Shelley from Microsoft is that
some one cook one part of w3 is working
on only accessible text editors and they
want to ask certain things of people and
they want to use the indie UI paradigm
and so so we're continually having these
conversations that are going to make the
whole thing richer and certainly work
together and where we don't need to do
something we're not going to do it and
where we feel like you know the other
component the Devi Sri is handling that
part we're going to do that in some
cases we're going to probably be
adopting some particular things a lot of
things are happening with web components
and polyfills is something you were
talking about so yeah all of this is as
part of what you know we're working on
but again your input would be awesome
looking at what we have there and saying
hmm how come you don't do this would be
great anybody else well thank you very
much I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
