talk about flexbox so the slide deck is
up my name is Estelle and my github is
Estelle because there aren't that many
people named isto under the age of 80
and I hear there aren't that many female
web developers over the age of 80 so I
get my don't I get my name sometimes so
today we're going to talk about flexbox
WTF I don't know what you thought WTF
meant but it means wonderfully terrific
features but we are going to cover some
what the fuck's and also we're going to
have unicorns and a few kittens that way
it's a technical talk and we're all good
a little bit about me because the reason
I do this is because I'm a twitter whore
and I want you guys to follow me on
Twitter and if you look at the book on
the way left I'm in the middle of
writing that so with the definitive
guide so I read the spec and I'm going
to explain to the spec so you don't have
to read the spec because it is a yawn er
um so what problem it does flexbox solve
flexbox solves a lot of problems but i
think the main one that we really like
is a headache of the multiple column
layout with all of the columns being of
equal height it was actually really easy
to solve with with CSS if you like CSS
but someone called it crappy style
sheets this morning and that is the
opinion of some people and they are
completely wrong but but now look at
this this is two lines that made these
three columns the same height and we
could have made him fall into place much
nice oh you know it depends what you
want your layout to look like but that
is how easy flexbox is a three-column
layout equal height equal width with two
lines of code so a big whoopty-doo this
is about six lines of CSS to get a home
page layout so notice the module
first of all there's the navigation it's
on the top right here it will switch to
the bottom when we are on mobile device
or narrow mode and those three buttons
are all lined up on the bottom with no
absolute positioning and about six lines
of CSS here's the mobile version of that
page it's actually not a mobile version
I it's a completely different version of
the page I'm cheating a little bit but
notice the navigation right there above
the footer I didn't have to change the
underlying HTML I just changed put in
one media query in this case right here
we have our kittens because you have to
have kittens I have all these divs that
are all the same height this row is all
the same height the height of the
tallest one and these are all the same
height also the height of the tallest
one notice that they're a bit taller if
I change the width I'm and make this
narrower they shrink a little bit and
then they pop and then shrink in the pop
and I'm always nicely lined up right
there that's about five lines of flexbox
and there are no media queries it just
dropped when it wanted to drop so i use
min and max with simple solution to what
used to be a really complex problem and
then the most hated thing of all which
is the sticky footer and sticky header
figure it's not the most hey the sticky
footer is we're going to pretend this is
a mobile device and we're going to
increase the font size so that it
actually looks like there and the footer
is going to stay at the bottom right so
I have a sticky footer again one line
three lines of CSS so let's go back to
this and make it a bit bigger and then
go on to the next one in here in the
upper right-hand corner there's a little
circle on each one of these those are
links to the actual document that is in
this page so that when you click on this
you can actually play with it if you're
playing along at home and then this one
a button with three parts this is an
inline flex item nicely centered and the
height as tall as it needs to be to fit
the text on the right and everything's
nicely centered again just a few lines
of CSS so let's learn that CSS oh let's
not yet let's talk about browser support
browser support is nicely green except
IE pretty soon I don't have to say that
anymore I hear rumor that I use not
supported anymore so we're talking about
edge so ie11 does support it I you tend
to support it with an older version of
Microsoft of ms prefix and then Android
34.3 or earlier does support it as well
there was this old syntax which you
might want to use for your old android
i'm not going to cover it but i kept it
in the deck just in case you have a p.m.
who's an idiot and wants you to support
devices that are like six years old
there's the IE only version and this is
not let's not blame ye we can blame
internet explorer we could blame them
for everything that they ever did wrong
this is not one of them they implemented
the 2012 spec and the spec was
completely rewritten so we are now at
the final flexbox version and is it
final it's in candidate recommendation
mode and it went into a recommendation
mode on january fifth and all the
browsers have implemented it there's you
know still a few quirks that we're
changing like a few months ago i'm in
fact i had to redo the whole deck but it
seems to be it seems to be there so how
easy is it i didn't show you a new code
yet so here's our first line of code
this is a navigation bar and all i have
to do is say display flex i can actually
get rid of these three things and it
still looks like a navigation bar and if
i want to be a prettier navigation bar i
can just say flex auto and each one will
take up as much room as it's a lot to
take up and we're good how hard was that
okay
so not really i'm going to show you one
more example then we're going to dive
into some properties and values so here
is the the holy grail layout you have
the header the footer the r and then you
have the main area with the article
navigation and aside i basically say on
the body display it flex on the main
display flex so you can have a flex
container inside another flex container
so the body is displayed as a flex
container and then one of the flex items
inside of it which is the main is also a
flex container and it has three elements
inside the navigation the article in the
acai and they line up nicely if i had 40
lines of code in 12 lines of code or
markup in the next and a large image on
the third one it would be the height
that it needs to be and i could actually
say take the minimum width that you need
or to take the maximum width or make
this one larger and these two smaller
and i'm going to show you all of that i
just want to show you how easy it was
before we got started so now we are
getting started so we have there's
basically five steps you have to create
the something you couldn't create
something into a flex container and then
once you have a flex container all of
its children are flex items on then you
set the direction or the flex flow which
is the Flex direction and whether it can
wrap so which direction you want to go
up top to bottom or left to right or
right to left or bottom to top if you
want to alignment you can say that you
want the elements to be stretched across
or you want them to be on the left on
the right on the top on the bottom or
lined in the center ordering you can
actually say i want the seventh element
to come in second and then flexibility
you saw in those examples I'm sorry my
voice I'm sick then the flexibility you
saw in that one example where I said
take as much space like based on content
versus make them all three lined up on
that's the flexibility of the items so
let's sub covered some of these these
are the properties we're going to cover
today display I'm not going to read it
you guys can all read English
there's a few that are kind of weird on
there there's minimum height and Men
width and display and those are already
three properties that you know about
they've been around for a really long
time display we have two new values and
men with and min height when it comes to
flex items it has a different default
value so that's why they're here so the
first step is to create a flexible
container and we do that by saying
either display flex or display inline
flex all of my examples were display
flex except for the button with the
three options inside where the check and
then agree and then you're signing a
life away for no apparent reason those
were that was the only one that was
displayed in line flex what's nice
though we don't really need this anymore
is you can actually use CSS as a
modernizer to say hey just my browser
support flex and the CSS for that here
can I use prefixes flexbox is not going
to show me so I basically didn't at
supports and it's tiny and I think
everyone in the back row likes tiny text
it basically says do you support display
block if yes make it read that way you
know it supports a the display the
support at supports rather and then I
said at supports display flex if it does
make the body green so you can actually
use CSS kind of like a moderniser and
that's a little bit of a wonderful
terrific wonderfully terrific feature in
CSS a few people use but you can
actually use the add supports and I'm on
the wrong deck it's right there okay so
you can use CSS kind of as a moderniser
okay so display property we have display
flex and we have display inline flex I
can say flex 200 pixels and that didn't
work because I put a mistake right there
there so there i'm basically saying make
all 200 pixels the is actually
overflowing its container because the
container only needs to be the size when
it's in line flex it only needs to be
the size of the elements default value
not the flex places that will come into
play later on but basically we have
display flex and display inline flex do
I need to reiterate that or did everyone
get those two new values we're good okay
again this is display inline flex if I
had said flex we would have had that and
if I didn't use any of them this is
actually what i did i created a div with
the checkbox a label rather with a
checkbox an H one that says agree and a
paragraph that had the the label okay
okay so what exactly is a flex item I
said any child of an element that has
flex display flex or display inline flex
and by any child it includes generated
content so if you create a flex
container the before and the after will
actually be a flex item any child node
will become a flex item as long as if
it's absolutely or fixed position it has
a few of the features but it's basically
not for the sake of understanding how to
lay at your page it's not really a flex
item a first letter and first line have
no impact comments and white space have
no impact but if you actually have a
text node that is not inside a child
element it's it's own texts known as
long as it's not empty it will become
what they call it an anonymous flex item
and you can style it it will be styled
exactly like we are styling all of our
flex items but there's no way to target
it because it's not inside a dom no um
did I say everything yep okay then
there's a few properties in CSS that
behave differently when they are on when
it when it has to do with flexbox the
first one is margin adjacent margins we
all know adjacent margins collapse so if
you have a top margin of 10 pixels and a
bottom margin of 10 pixels it'll be 10
pixels it won't be 20 when it comes to
flex items it will actually be 20 does
not collapse min with and min height
according to the CSS 2.1 specification
has a default value of zero in when
something is a flex item its default min
width is actually auto so it's a size of
the content disability collapse i'm
going to cover that later it's just
interesting what it does then there's
some properties that are ignored let's
say you have columns on you know like
you have this content and there's
columns it just ignores the columns it's
no longer in you know like you have a
div and you have content that will just
become an anonymous flex item it will
not have columns float clear both of
these so if you actually want something
to work in ie6 again because you have a
really stupid p.m. who's making you
spend hours and hours being backwards
compatible can you tell that I've had
bad pm's and float and clear are really
good fall backs so you can actually
still make things work in really old
browsers if you need to because when
they ignore the flex they will not
ignore float and clear but if they are
supporting flex they will ignore float
and clear and then vertical line also
has no impact because we have better
features and vertical line so the first
thing you wanted to clear is flex flow
which is the flex Oh after display flexi
or flexing in one flex you wanted to do
the direction and the wrapping which is
the Flex flow property its flex flow
property is shorthand for flex direction
and flex wrap the spec authors really
want us to use flex flow I don't use
flex flow I found it much easier to use
flex direction and flex wrap don't tell
them I said that they'll hate me but I
think I'm being recorded so now they
know default verge
value is Rho but there's also ro reverse
column and column reverse so let's look
at this in action here we have column
reverse the order is one two three I
made it simple for you guys because I
think everyone knows how to count to
three um so I reversed it I don't have
to reverse it and now it's in the order
1 2 3 so let's just go back that was
reversed it goes 3 2 1 if I do that it
goes 1 2 3 screen readers will still
read it as one two three even though it
appears it's going three two one it is
going to be read as one two three and
when you tap through it if you have
links it will go from one to two three
it will not change the order it only
changes the order of appearance and of
paint order it will paint in the order
that it will be laid out on the page so
then we have row which is the default
and we have one two and three and then
we have ro reverse which makes it three
two one um anything else to say here
writing mode still a prefix feature
let's say you're writing Japanese there
you go it changes it for you you don't
actually have to UM oh there's also left
to right it will actually change the
let's cover that in a little minute so
let me show you this example remember
this example that we had before so
column makes things into rows and row
makes things look like columns that's
the way I look at it so the the whole
pages of the whole body is a flex item a
flex container and we have the flex item
of the header the nav the main area
which has three articles in it and then
the footer so I didn't really need to
according to this I didn't really need
to declare this is flex with columns
because that's the way it would lay out
normally right but I did so that i can
use the order later on
and when it shrinks I can move the
navigation down then each one of these
three things each one of these articles
is also a flex container so it's a flex
container with that's within a flex item
and that is a completely doable so you
have the main area is a flex container
and each one of these articles is also a
flex container so in the main area
there's three articles and they're all
thirty-three percent wide and then
inside of each article is that way
they're all going to be the same height
because a flex item is going to be by
default it's going to stretch to be the
height of its line so here all three
have stretchable ahead of their line
then in each one we have three items we
have the image a paragraph and a button
and what I did is I said make the button
the size it needs to be and make the
image the size it needs to be and then
let the middle part grow so the middle
part is going to take up as much room as
a can and it's going to fill up its
whole space so that's how that one
worked so this is the most complicated
slide it is the ugliest slide and it
takes like 15 pages in my book to
explain so I'm going to try to do it in
one minute so what we saw was when we
were floating outros there was a main
axis that went in the right to left left
to right languages it went from left to
right so there's a main axis in this
direction there's a main start and main
end when you change it to ro reverse in
right-to-left languages it changes the
direction of the main access if I were
to do or right to left language that
would be flipped and this one would be
flipped and that's fine that makes
translating to go into Arabic super easy
you can use the exact same layout all
you have to do is change the direction
of property either in you know der
equals right to left or direction equals
article in rtl and then similarly
I don't know if this image actually
covers the yep and here we go just
because I like things that look
ridiculous when it has column the main
axis is going from top to bottom and the
cross axis is going from left to right
and when it's going this way the main
acts the cross axis is also going from
that way but if you change to left to
right language it will change the cross
access so basically we can download
translate into other languages without
having to worry about our layouts
because flexbox will take care of that
for us okay so right now we just saw one
line of flex items but you can have
multiple lines of flex items if you tell
it to have multiple lines of flex items
by default it will put everything on to
one line we have three values for flex
wrap we have no wrap wrap and wrap
reverse so here we have no rap in a row
and it's going across and it's being cut
off and it's actually it's big it's not
being cut off it actually would show if
the page was long enough but it's not
but I could just say wrap it and there
it wraps and I could say wrap reverse
and notice that it's reversing them wrap
it is wrapping it but it is starting on
the bottom line and then drawing as it
goes up that's counterintuitive to most
people would think they would just but
it's actually the wrapping that's what
being reversed not the the road that's
being reversed
so here remember when I said min-width
is by default auto it overflows I
actually have to set min with Auto and
we'll try to fit it all on to one line
so there it actually did it shrank them
and allow you to go down to toe till one
line okay so in this one I've used flex
wrapping right because we have cats and
we're wrapping them along many lines and
when I shrank it when your slide deck
works notice that it's the height of the
tallest one so this one fits in nicely
and these have extra white space and
this column is much taller than the
previous one because this is much taller
than the previous ones and then here
it's as tall as it needs to be to fit
the tallest one so when something wraps
onto multiple lines you'll have flex
lines and it's not something you can
actually target with CSS you can't say i
want flex line number two to have a
background of red that just doesn't work
there's no way to target with CSS
however the important thing to know is
that each flex line will be as tall as
it needs to be to fit the tallest item
within that line and then we have
properties where we can align the ones
that are smaller here I stretched it but
we could have made them smaller and
we're going to Center them or we could
have said just make them as tall as each
one needs to be and have a jagged edge
on the bottom okay so fact flex flow is
shorthand for flex Direction flex wrap
and this is what the spec authors
actually want us to use so let me just
play with this one here if I do row
before I did flex direction and flex
wrap remember so here I just do flex
flow and I do row and no rap and that's
default and it didn't redraw the page
for some reason um I don't know what
um that's not actually supposed to be
there that's my computer is five years
old we should a happy birthday and the
hard drive is dying um so if i do column
i said max width is 100 pixels and max
height is 300 i prolly should have made
it 500 i decided to grow anyways 400 100
so depending on what the height is of
the container the flex columns will wrap
in the direction of the cross axis so
the main axis is this way and the cross
x axis is that way but if i reversed it
the cross axis would be in the other
direction so flex flow is basically flex
direction and flex wrap together but
wait there's more add Valenti's the guy
who did the knife commercials i'm so so
far what we've done is we've just
basically laid it out but now let's
control the Flex items within the Flex
container but we're controlling it from
the Flex container so these are
properties that you apply to the
container to the parent we have
justified content which basically says
how do you spread them out if they're
smaller than the full width how do you
spread them out so we have five
properties we have flex start flex end
center space between and spaced around
so here is center that means space
between rather space around actually
makes it so that in between a and B it's
twice the size then between the end and
a and C and the end a space between
means put them on the ends and then put
equal space in between each one flex
start is this selects oops flex and is
that and center is putting them in the
center so um the navigation that I used
earlier before I actually let the items
grow we're going to cover that in a
little bit here i'm not letting them
grow I'm basic
saying please be a hundred pixels I
could just say be one and then it would
be all the way across okay a line items
is a top to bottom how do you want them
online so justify was left to right in
the row if it had been calling it would
been top to bottom so that's why I
showed you that complicated thing with
the cross axis and the main axis because
when it comes ninety percent of time
you're going to be doing row and column
so the cross axis and main access isn't
really going to bug you all that much
but if you're doing reverse languages or
if you're even doing columns it does get
a little bit more complicated so a line
items is if you're doing a row how to
align it from top to bottom if you're
doing a column how to align it from left
to right in a right to left or left to
right language so we have flex start
which puts them on top flex end which
puts them on the bottom center base line
and stretch the default value is stretch
here i centered them so each one is the
height that it needs to be because I did
not stretch them the default is what
we've seen so far stretches them this is
ninety percent of the time when you want
your layout to look like so you don't
even need to declare this product pretty
most of the time but here we've centered
it we could do flex start right there
all on the top we can do flex end
they're all in the bottom and then
there's a weird value called baseline
and that is why I change number C to
have a header that was much bigger
baseline if you notice all the headers
the base of that text is at the same
spot that's baseline never used it but
if you have a navigation and sliding at
a sidebar with a header that is the same
as your content header you might want to
actually use that so it looks like
they're lined up nicely okay that's a
line item so that's from top to bottom
this is what I want to show you
visibility collapsed um and I added this
slide because i knew i would forget to
tell you physical
so let's copy this so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say see all right so
here is see when I do visibility
collapse it actually maintains the
height of the row that flex row that it
would need to be when it becomes visible
again so if I had done be it collapses
it it makes it disappear but it
maintains the room it's kind of like
visibility hidden okay then we have a
line of content so far what I showed you
was when you have one flex line what
happens when you have more than one flex
line how do you align those items within
a container so we have the same values
except for there's no baseline so you
see the same things except for there's
no baseline in there 10 minutes okay so
here we have these rows and their
spacing between them because i said i
want the height of this document to be
two thousand eight hundred pixels
because i made that up and i and i put
space between but i could have put space
around and it puts half as much space
above it as in between each two lines i
could have put center and they're all
grouped up in the middle oops I think I
was on 46
ok if you have um basically close your
eyes
okay there we are ok so here it's in the
middle and and the default would be
stretch and it takes up all the room to
fill up the entire container so look how
easy layouts are it's pretty amazing ok
so we've been controlling the Flex items
from the parent you can also control
some aspects of the Flex item themselves
so we have a line self property so
before we aligned all of them to the top
to the bottom to baseline you can do an
override just with the align self so see
it's basically for one single element
and it's like the align items override
so here I line items center and then be
I aligned self stretch a baseline flex
end so you see I'm just aligning that
one element so that's a line self then I
have the order property so the order
property everything right now has been
in the code order we've been able to
reverse we've been able to reverse from
to top top to bottom we've been able to
wrap reverse but you can actually take
one item and say you know what I want to
make this the third item now you don't
actually want to do that most of the
time it screen leaders are still going
to read it in the source order so don't
try to use this to alter what your
source should have been make your source
logical but sometimes you do really want
your nav to be on top and then on mobile
to be on the bottom and you don't want
to change this the source order um and
truthfully that's the example I use it
it's not the best example and I'll
explain why in a moment so the default
value of all of order is 0 and then
they're grouped so if you say like two
things are negative 3 they'll come first
and if two of the items are negative 3
the first one in the source order with
negative 3 will come first and then the
second one with negative 3 will come
second and then all of the ones that
have no order because they have the
order of 0 will come after that in the
source
order and then anything that has a
positive number will come after that so
let's take a look at this so here they
are supposed to be alphabetical and as
you can tell i put every third one if
you had seen the examples before there
were three different color of gray there
was a darker gray medium gray and
lighter gray and they were just
basically in in that order ABC and Here
I am C F which is a third 6 9 12 and
then i have the 2nd 5th 8th 11th and
then i have the first 4th 7th 10th right
so basically switched the order of whole
groups of items by saying every third
one give it an order of negative 1 if i
had given it an order here of negative
17 a would ace 3 n plus 1 it's the first
one that would come first five and then
76 banana comes first because that is
not being hit by order so it has the
default value of zero so this is the
kind of useless will show it to you so
let me show you a better way which is
our actual example here in the source
order it says header nav main footer and
inside the main there's three articles
when i shrank it and i got rid of the
other unicorns just so that i wouldn't
have to go down the page too much here
it has header main nav footer so what I
did let me just make this a little bit
smaller there so I can see the whole
page there I gave nav and footer an
order of 4 why did I get footer which is
not out of sequence an order of 4
because if I had given only the nav in
order of 4 it would have come last
because footer now has a value of zero
so that's why did this this is a bad
example what I really should have done
is in my HTML I should have done header
article nav footer
and then move the nav up for screens
because for screen readers I would want
my nav to come a little bit later
because I want my content to come first
possibly maybe not um but order it
allows you to do that and grouping on
that's why we group them thanks I'm good
okay so accessibility the screen reader
is still going to read your original
source order tab order is still going to
be in the original tab order even if you
change the order of stuff it's still
going to tab through so if you're
putting the second tab on the bottom
it's just going to jump and you all know
tabindex really bad except for values of
zero or negative 1 and right-to-left
languages we already covered that okay
so the last thing that I'm kind of going
to cover is the Flex shorthand which is
flex grow flex shrink and flex basis so
you do want to use the Flex shorthand
but realize it's a shorthand for these
three properties growing is the item
allowed to grow so here we have this
right it falls in this place do I allow
it to get bigger usually yes especially
you know remember those snap elements I
wanted to grow bigger do I want to
shrink when we saw everything collapse
down to fit on one line we allowed to a
shrink generally that's not what you
want to do flex basis is what is the
basis by which it's going to grow and
I'm actually going to skip 2 flex basis
because it's the hardest one to explain
so I default you have extra room and you
can either say flex places of a number
or flex basis of auto so in this case
it's relative so I said flex grow us to
one and three so I'm giving the third 13
growth factors I'm giving the middle 11
growth factor and I'm giving the one on
the left to growth factors so it says
how much extra space do I have and how
do i divide it so basically because I
have one two and three so a total of six
one plus two plus three equals six
six growth factors so it's going to give
the first one to growth factors or two
parts of it the middle 11 and the last
13 so here in the top one it is the
extra space because I said Otto so it's
the auto it it says what is the text
that you need what size you need and
what space do I have after that in the
second example it says the basis is zero
that means take everything is zero
widths of wide we're just assuming
everything is zero wits wide I mean give
26 of the page to the first one 16 of
the page the middle of the width the
middle one and 36 or half to the last
one does that make sense to people this
is kind of a complicated thing and this
was the best way that I could think of
to explain it but flex basis is
basically when you allow something to
grow or when you allow it to shrink what
is the basis for that flex item that
you're giving it so here's another
example and this one actually has text
in it um by the fall what we've seen is
if you don't have any flex at all if you
just don't include flex there is no flex
basis or there is the the default value
and it takes as much width as it needs
to make all three items the same height
here we're saying instead of making all
the items the same height actually in
this one auto it's saying make them all
the same height because just basically
auto it and then whatever's left over
distribute it and here there's nothing
left to distribute though and this one
is saying give a two sections of the six
to this one 16 to the middle one so do
you see how that lays out differently
when you change the Flex basis so
proportionally I'm going to go back now
here a B and C have a flex growth factor
of 2 because I said flex 2 that means
grow it's the same thing as st. zero and
auto i believe yep nope
zero yep ok so it's saying flex growth
of Q factor of factor of two don't allow
it to shrink and the basis is 0 and here
i say flex one and that is why c is half
the width of a and B if I said for it
would be twice the width of a and B if I
said six it would be six times and then
it stops working because it actually
needs to allow for the the text the
content to work ok that's flex basis so
to summarize yep to summarize this you
can do with a layout I don't think i
simplified it that that much but now at
least when you look at this deck later
on because there's no way to teach
flexbox in 40 minutes especially without
coding but this is online it's at a
stove out github thought I oh flexbox or
it's the top link on my on my G H page
if you look at the code here by default
this is not what would happen it would
actually grow to take up as much room as
it could so how did I make these line up
perfectly on the last row because as we
saw in all the previous examples the
second the last row grew more I use the
same flex basis so all of them have the
same flex basis and then the other thing
is I put empty dibs here so this is a
little bit of a hack but it this is a
layout that so many people want to
figure out and they can't so what they
do is they always make things like they
always have 12 boxes or they always add
three boxes to the page but with this
layout you can grow and shrink the page
and it will actually let me see if I can
do that yeah you see how now we're at
down to four I was able to grow the page
and they dropped and if I go down it'll
still all be nicely lined up so it's a
hack but it's a good hack and I think
this is a solution to making a grid
layout a height where the height is the
height of its flex row but the grid goes
all the way down and
last year doesn't look ugly because the
last row looking ugly is a major issue
so um this book will explain all of this
in its it's a booklet like 140 pages on
the spec and the spec is 120 pages but
the spec has 60 pages of stuff that
makes no sense so I'm not saying you
have to buy the book everything in the
book is actually in this deck but what
I'm saying is the spec is 120 pages so
it's really complex you don't need to
learn everything but understanding how
that flex basis is distributed and how
those flex lines work will enable you to
actually make the layouts that you want
pretty quickly and then understand the
nitty-gritty detail that will take a lot
of experience so I hope that made sense
and thank you very much
