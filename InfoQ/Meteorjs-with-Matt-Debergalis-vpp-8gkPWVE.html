show you a couple pictures to illustrate
what I mean by that here's a picture of
what a web application looks like your
classic three-tier architecture and the
the two things I want you to see here
are we have a database and a CPU the the
app server that are physically close to
each other so they can be fairly chatty
back and forth think about like a rails
app or a PHP app and then we've got a
protocol that sends the output of that
application to the user who's relatively
far away so that's the high latency
connection between the app server and
your mobile phone or your your laptop
and the protocol we use of course is
HTTP and HTTPS built to serve documents
right it was a it was a document
hypertext Transfer Protocol so it's very
good at that
and and the rule here is that the web
server and this classic architecture
generates a page and sends that down to
the user who looks at the page every
time the user wants to do something new
the server essentially starts from
scratch and builds a new page we've all
heard this story right it's not what
we're building today right this is what
we're building today it looks a lot more
like the app server has somehow moved to
where the person is so we've got an
application running in JavaScript in a
browser or we've got an app written in
objective-c running on your iPhone the
high latency connection is now between
the database and the application and we
actually don't have a very good story
for what that protocol looks like today
we do it over HTTP or some strange use
of HTTP but we're using it very
differently right this is now a
bi-directional conversation it's
structured data it's not a CH
EML documents the application isn't
asking for finished pages from the
database it's actually getting little
pieces of data here and there so what I
want to talk about and show you is why
building an application like this is
fundamentally different it's not an
evolution from you know say PHP to Ruby
it's a JavaScript or from you know one
variant of Ajax to another it's actually
a fundamental shift in how we're going
to build and structure applications and
the reason I'm so confident in that is
that we can look to the past and see
something very similar before the web
grew up so if we go back before the web
and we draw a picture for what the
client-server era looked like when you
had Windows desktops and you had you
know enterprise data servers and you had
these protocols that the Windows
computers spoke you know NFS and IP X
and all these things it looks exactly
the same as what we're building today
right you've got software running right
next to the person because that's what
lets us build these really rich
interactive interfaces and your data is
far enough away that you need to design
a protocol and a transport that
effectively manages that back and forth
flow of data in fact I can go one step
further back to the 70s if you want and
talk about call it the mainframe era
which actually looks a lot like the web
way back then we had the CPUs and the
databases right next to each other and
the CPU generated a finished page now
back then it was like a VT 220 page or
30 to 70 or something right but very
similar model to the web we would
display a page the user would type a key
the server would update the screen so it
looks like what happens over time is
that the place the application runs
oscillates back and forth we've had
errors when it was on the server in the
data center and that we've had errors
and I think we're entering an era when
the application is actually closer to
the person and I think if we look back
to what the client-server era looked
like we're gonna find a lot of
motivation for what a new generation of
technology built around these rich
client applications is going to look
like
that's what meteor is designed to do
it's a departure from the the legacy web
stacks and an expression of what a great
software development environment would
look like if you just wanted to build
for this sort of modern application
platform so I could go on for a while
but I really want to focus on one piece
of what's different and that's the the
protocol or the conversation or the flow
of data and the reason I wanted to talk
about that today is because it ties in
with the security work that we've been
doing for the last six months at meteor
so HTTP I mentioned is is this current
protocol that we still use for the most
part to communicate between these rich
clients written in JavaScript and the
server it's the wrong protocol it's just
absolutely wrong HTTP is stateless
that's wrong right
HTTP is essentially unidirectional
that's wrong HTTP is unreliable that's
wrong if you look at how we designed all
of the RPC protocols in the 90s we got
this stuff right but when you try to
implement client applications over HTTP
you end up running into all of these
flaws and we can talk about WebSockets
and we can talk about these low-level
transports but what's missing in that
picture is what's the higher level
protocol what's the equivalent of HTTP
for bi-directional JSON data and I think
the answer is it's it's sort of
everything that HTTP isn't it's session
based it's something that has an
understanding of a connection and a
replay cache so that when a client asks
the server to take an action we can do
that action once and only once it's
something that has the ability to
marshal things like JSON data or other
structured objects without going through
all of the overhead of HTTP and the
headers for each document and so forth
so what we've done with meteor is
arranged our data transfer exactly that
way and rather than the rest model which
is designed around well you have these
HTTP verbs I guess we'll send some JSON
that way let's think about it from
scratch and the first thing you discover
is that in this new world you don't want
snapshots of data you
on an ever-changing flow of information
being sent down to the client and one
way to think about this problem is that
when your whole app is written in
JavaScript or in cocoa touch
you're not going to refresh the page so
the server needs some way to push
updates and we all know this right
because we're building apps this way but
we're doing it ad-hoc and and the right
way to do it is to bake it into the
actual wire protocol that that the
client speaks so if you think about what
it looks like to have a subscription
then you need a place to put that data
and so you end up building a cache on
your client to hold all of this data
that the server's been pushing down and
again people are building this in an ad
hoc way so backbone collections for
example is sort of like your poor man's
cache on an html5 app so we'll take a
page from the 90s if we want to change
data it's pretty clear the clients gonna
have to ask the server to do that let's
just call it an RPC because that's what
it is and we have one cute trick we can
play that I'm going to show you in code
I won't talk about it too much but the
point is we can work around the latency
of the connection by simulating what the
server is about to do without waiting
for it and that's what makes
applications written in this style
magical because you can take actions on
the screen that are very fluid and
responsive without waiting for that
lengthy round-trip maybe over an
unreliable cellphone network or whatever
you're using for the response so here's
an example of what that subscription
might look like I put a couple of bits
of code on the screen let's say you're
writing a blog engine in this new style
and I've written three JavaScript
functions these would run on the server
and they would define an endpoint a
subscription for data you can think of
it the same as like a get in a rest
endpoint except that these are always
sending the results of the query so as
posts get written and these are in Mongo
syntax or if the author I'm looking at
writes a new post then the server is
going to push an update down to each
client corresponding to the query that's
up on the screen yeah
so so the question is if we're gonna
replace HTTP what do we do about the
fact that HTTP is really friendly to
networks and proxy servers and firewalls
and most other stuff isn't I mean you're
absolutely right so I think the future
is clearly WebSockets I think there's a
panel this afternoon about the future of
WebSockets I think the future is strong
but in the interim will will use hacks
so we'll run you know all of the ways to
simulate a WebSocket over HTTP meteor
actually doesn't use WebSockets we have
found in production that they don't work
very well one example just to digress
completely you can't compress traffic
over a WebSocket right you could do it
in JavaScript but the the native
transport doesn't handle compression the
way that HTTP does so if you're sending
a lot of JSON back and forth we actually
find it's more efficient to pay the
overhead of doing long polling or some
other HTTP technique because your actual
payloads get much smaller over the wire
so it'll be a transition right but I
mean web browsers are gonna get the
ability to open sockets and it's it's
gonna connect I mean that's gonna happen
I think pretty clearly so I'm more
interested in what happens above that
transport layer let's assume you have a
reliable stream and the question is what
do you send over it does that answer
your question so on the client we just
told the server we're interested in one
of those streams so here's an example of
subscribing to the three endpoints I
define and this is kind of interesting
because it suggests that a client can
subscribe to overlapping sets of data
right I might be interested in being
up-to-date with well all public posts
all posts that a particular author wrote
and all posts that I wrote and if you
looked at the previous screen carefully
you'll see that my posts they don't have
to be public the way the other two do so
you can imagine that there are documents
that are matched by more than one of
those subscriptions that's fine this is
the way a modern client assembles the
data that it needs and the goal here is
that once I've got that data in my cache
I don't have to wait for the network
anymore so I have a fast local
B of all the data I'm interested in the
server in the background is keeping it
up-to-date but when I do a query and
this again is meteor code and I'll do it
on the screen for you when I do a find I
don't get back a callback or some kind
of promise or anything like that I get
back an array of data immediately right
without any blocking for the network
without any round-trip latency to the
server and again that's how you make a
responsive application so that the
applications job is to tell the server
what its going to be interested in so
that it can always be responsive with
what is putting on the screen and then
when we do an update we want to be able
to make the update using the same
database API and the same syntax we're
comfortable with so in meteor when you
have a client you can do for example an
insert and and again I'm going to show
you this the cute trick here is we can
do it right away on the client and then
figure out whether or not the server
decided that was ok and I'll show you
how that works but again it makes for a
more responsive experience because you
can avoid waiting for the server's
response which we call latency
compensation all right
let me show you just a couple things
here so I've defined a collection called
circles in my program and this program
is very short it's only 60 lines of code
just to draw the d3 circles so the the
really key line is this definition of a
circles collection and by default in
meteor when you define a collection to
your point earlier we're gonna cache
everything in the collection on to every
client so this is think of it like
scaffolding in rails it's just a way to
get started very quickly so that means
in my browser and I'll use the console
to show you this so I'm just
Oh what my window go
I can run database command so for
example I can insert a circle document
and I'm using Mongo so I'm just gonna
give it a JSON document and in my little
setup here I just need an X and a
y-coordinate so I'll say two hundred and
two hundred and I think it was like a
radius of like 20 hopefully I'm doing
this right and a color of zero and when
I run that insert d3 maps that XY color
choice to a circle on the canvas I
actually have an event handler so I can
also double click on the canvas and the
client code will run the exact same
insert it's gonna pick I think a random
radius so here's one and here's one and
I double click twice I can also do you
know circles fine dot fetch for example
and there's my local database query that
returned an array of objects so each of
these objects is one of the circles
that's on my screen and if I look at one
of these I see I've got a primary key
this looks like a Mongo ID kind of thing
and then I've got my my different
properties of that object what's really
cool is that I have the whole Mongo
database here in the client so for
example I can do circles dot update and
let's use the Mongo syntax for update
every circle and maybe I'll increment
the y-coordinate by 50 pixels and I'll
say multi true so that it affects every
matching document and d3 moves all three
of my circles down the screen 50 pixels
that's kind of cool but we can do a lot
better because it turns out all this is
persistent and in a totally different
browser connected to my server I can get
the effect of having these nice
subscriptions so let me increment Y by
negative 50 and you see that both
browsers are gonna dutifully move their
red circles up on the screen at the same
time so this is a transaction in one
browser that's going back to the meteor
server but because both both clients are
subscribed to the set of circles when
there's a change in any of these
documents that change is reflected on
all the other screens and then d3 takes
over and does that nice animation to
actually show us what's happening um I
have another event handler where if I
click a circle it will rotate through
some colors and again if I click on a
circle in Safari the same result in
chrome and you know I can play this game
all day but it's a really nice
demonstration of sharing data back and
forth so the question this raises is you
know what stops some guy from opening
the console and you know circles dot
remove and you know there's the end of
the party so up until now my answer has
been sort of wishy-washy and complicated
but what we can now show you is
something a lot more pleasant about how
security works in an environment like
this so I'm gonna just sort of zip
through a tour of what's now possible
with the kind of technology that we have
in the upcoming release so the first
thing I'm going to do and again please
interrupt with questions it's it's
really a lab course the first thing I'm
going to do is put a circle back on the
screen so let me get a couple of circles
here if I go back to my terminal let's
remove the insecure package because that
seems like the first problem and I'm
gonna run the same circles remove
command and I get an access denied error
and if I have that other screen up I'm
sorry there's so little real estate here
you know obviously my command did
nothing now it did nothing everywhere so
the server is now rejecting my request
because in secure mode it now enforces
some sort of permission checking on
these updates and I have to write a
function that explains what I'm allowed
to do so I can write that function and
what I can do is I'll just add a little
stands of JavaScript where I say circles
which is my collection dot allow and
allow takes a dictionary so there's
different operations we're interested
we've got insert and update and remove
let's let's let's make a low if we'll
just do the remove action so remove as a
function and it's gonna take a user ID
and it's gonna take I think a set of
documents that are proposed to be
removed and I can just return true and
if I remember this syntax
I've now defined a rule that says
clients are allowed to issue a remove
command so I'm sort of back in the the
Wild West where if I come over here and
and I do a remove all my data goes away
again so I'm now under this sort of
manual control of what each client is
allowed to do let me add one more piece
of manual control so I'm also going to
remove the auto publish package an auto
publish is the other half of scaffolding
it's the piece that automatically keeps
all the clients up-to-date with all the
data on the server which is great when
you're playing around and not so great
if you're building something at internet
scale so now I have to go back to what I
was showing you before about
subscriptions and having the server
publish sets of documents so let me
write what that looks like so again on
the server I'm gonna define a publish
and I'll just call it all circles
publish is a function that's going to
return in my case a database query so on
the server I'll do circles dot find and
balance all and so now I've defined a
document set write an endpoint that a
client can connect to to retrieve some
data and it has a name which is all
circles and then on the client I'm just
gonna subscribe to that so I do meteor
dot subscribe all circles and if I save
that that should put me back where I was
I actually don't think I have any
circles in the database so let's oh so
if I double click here here's an
interesting example of that latency
compensation so watch the screen I
double click and my double-click handler
inserts a circle object so it puts it on
the screen d3 dutifully renders it where
it's supposed to go but very quickly the
server says no no you're not allowed to
do that
so my cache gets fixed to reflect the
real servers database which in this case
means there's no circle so on the local
client I get this funny effect where for
a split second I have this this strange
extra result but the other client never
sees that so as I double-click to make
these circles you notice they never
appear in Safari they're never in the
server's database they're not being sent
to anyone else it's just this temporary
effect on the client most of the time
you're not gonna let your client do this
right you're gonna impose rules on the
client that you know the server is going
to agree with so a well-behaved client
won't get you in this position but it's
a good demonstration of how we can
speculatively do work on the client
without waiting for the server hoping
most of the time that you get the right
result so let me go ahead and add an
insert rule and insert is gonna take a
user ID and the proposed document and
again I'll just return true to allow any
client to insert a document and yep now
we're back
and what we now have is where we were at
the beginning except that each client is
manually subscribing to its documents
and each client is using the rules for
updating objects and it looks like I
have one more right eye I can't change
the color of a circle because I didn't
allow an update and so I can add that
update as well update I'm not sure quite
what it takes but I think that will work
and now we're back to where we were so
in this application if you want to think
of the client and the server is speaking
this protocol or having an API between
them the way we can think about security
is actually very clear and the rule is
the server gets to decide what the
client can see that's a published
function and the server gets to decide
whether or not the client can make an
update that's the allow function that's
it right there's nothing else the client
can ever do I can write all the rogue
code I want on the client I can go to
the console and type any JavaScript I
want maybe I affect the client screen
briefly like we saw before but
fundamentally there's nothing that
client can do now other than
specifically what the server chose to
allow it to do and that's the the the
foundation of security in a rich client
application and and what we've done here
is create a framework that lets us think
about that in a really structured way
and I can show you examples of like what
happens when you when you play with that
so for example I can turn off that
publish on the server and if I go back
to my web browser all the data is gone
the server stopped providing that data
in fact it removed it from its cache and
if I do a database query for all of the
circles there aren't any on either
client because the server chose not to
provide them anymore or maybe the server
is only going to provide a total of two
circles kind of a weird thing to do but
let's just imagine I can write any query
here I want so we come back over to our
clients and they both have two circles
right so we're under complete control of
what data each person is allowed to see
so now that we have the primitive I want
to take that one step further and I want
to actually create some sort of login
systems so that maybe I can vary the
behavior of the app based on whether or
not I'm logged in or I'm someone that
the server knows about yeah what happens
if I create a circle at this point what
do you think so if I double click here
actually let me let me do an insert just
to be really explicit about it so I'll
do circle dot insert and let's just say
x0 y0 color zero radius really big okay
so what's gonna happen well that insert
is going to immediately change the cache
on my client so I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna get a big circle on my screen
right and it's gonna send a command to
the server to add a circle to the
database which I'm allowing right
because I'm the clients are allowed to
insert records so there should be four
circles in the real database at that
point but the server isn't going i'm not
subscribed to all four I'm only
subscribed to two of them so what oughta
end up happening is that I'll still only
have two circles on the screen which two
I'm not sure because the query I wrote
wasn't very well-defined right I just
said give me two circles
I didn't sort them so let's see if I
could type right and there you go so
same thing latency compensation the
client simulated what it thought was
gonna happen
surprisingly that's not actually what
happened to its cache and the server
resolved it to where it is now but of
course those circles are in the database
and if I get rid of this goofy limit and
I just go back to publishing all the
circles to the
there they all are right so the
primitives are really solid now I admit
this is a little bizarre because who
cares about managing circles but let's
let's just play along for a second so I
want to show you how easy it is to add
logins to an application like this and
then vary the behavior in a slightly
more useful way let's say and to do that
I'm going to use new packages that are
part of this security release so I'm
going to add accounts UI and accounts
password
so the first provides me some chrome
around a login system and the second
provides me an implementation of
accounts that are backed by username and
password sorry and then in my HTML file
I'm gonna add a login buttons helper
which is something that the Chrome that
counts UI package provides me and I save
the file by the way when I save files in
meteor clients automatically update so
you're not seeing me refresh the browser
we call that a hot code push it's really
helpful for development but it's super
important for production because if you
think about a production application
that's written in JavaScript reloading
the whole browser is sort of like
rebooting Windows 95 when you installed
a piece of software right the user is
probably in the middle of something what
if they have a dialogue open and they're
halfway through filling out a form we're
all fans of continuous deployment so we
make our change to tweak the color of
something and this whole new set of code
gets pushed out and the guys work gets
lost right so there there's underlying
technology to make these sorts of
applications work really well that turns
out to be important and that's that's
one example of it so I saved that login
button helper and now I have this little
sign-in thing and I can yeah
I was talking about continuous
deployment and
yeah
the question is can you do how code
deploy if you do meteor bundle I sure
thought so I'm only like 90% sure we can
talk offline let's talk after yeah I
just kind of detailed okay so chrome
gives me the sign in box I I don't have
an account but I can create one and I'll
just say I'm I'm mad at meteor and my
password is one through six or something
like that and now I'm logged in as mad
at meteor well here's what's interesting
about being logged in is I can run this
command meteor user in the console and
my client returns to me an object which
is it turns out a collection of users
and when I'm logged in the server will
publish me the record or the document
for my user so I didn't write any code
but I'm now logged in and I have this
record that I can work with and bury it
in here is my email address that I typed
in the same information is available on
the server so let's take advantage of
that let's say that you only get to see
green circles if you're logged in
anybody can see red circles but green
circles are special and you got to be
logged in to see them so that's a very
simple change I'm gonna go back to my
publish function and I'm gonna check to
see if the users logged in so if and I
have access to this dot user ID on the
server I could probably write this more
elegantly but I'll just do it the dopey
way so I'll return all the circles if
there's a user ID and if there's no user
ID then I'll only return circles whose
color is zero which i think is a red
circle that makes sense so I saved that
file and I go over to Chrome and there's
nothing different
and that makes sense because I'm logged
in and so I should still see the whole
database but if I go over to Safari that
green circles gone and if I sign in
there's the circle so the server is
aware of the state and I mentioned
before and it wasn't really obvious why
I thought this was so important but I
talked about how this protocol has to be
stateful because in a rich application
like this it's it's not you know an
occasional conversation back and forth
there is a continuous stream of data
going back and forth and the content to
that stream the result of a query from
the server is a property of the client
and it's a property of in particular who
I'm logged in as so if I log in I get
all this data if I sign out the server
is gonna remove data from my cache and
then D 3 you know beautifully zooms that
down to nothing and there's sort of
funny consequences here right because if
I click on a circle I'm gonna change its
color well that's gonna remove it from
the client I think I had an overlapping
circle there you know same story there
right I can do a little bit more with
the login system so suppose I want to
instead of having this username password
business maybe I want to use a login
provider like Google OAuth or Facebook
OAuth that's easy too so I can do meteor
add accounts Google for example and I go
back to my application and let me sign
out as a user and I now have this Google
login option in addition to my password
but it's not configured yet so there's a
little wizard that I'm gonna get that
lets me configure it and if I click on
that I get this this little dialog that
sort of explains to me what the drill is
if you've used OAuth this is gonna look
really familiar you base it with OAuth 2
you're gonna get a client ID which
represents the the application on the
provider side and you're gonna get a
secret that's only known to the
provider and to your application so you
can go to code.google.com and create a
new project I like Google because it's
very easy to do some of the other
providers are hard to follow I am going
to I stashed away my existing apps
information so let me just copy that in
here so again just the identifier for
the OAuth app that I have at Google and
the secret for the app at Google and I
save my configuration and now I'm all
set so now I can sign with Google so I
click sign-in I get to pop up you've
seen this before
I guess I'm already signed at his meteor
now I'm logged in and I got my green
circles back it even knows my name right
because both providers give you certain
data as part of the OAuth process I
don't know any other framework that lets
me log in quite this fast right and the
cool thing is the same logic I can use
to inspect the state of my login status
on the server the way that published
changed behavior based on who I was
applies to both the username password
style that I used as well as the the use
of another provider right so I can I can
vary my whole application based on this
yeah the question is about the wizard
you can also configure that in code I
think like WordPress or someone a long
time ago sort of started this trend
right the first time you deploy an app
it gives you that magic configuration
box I think in most cases that works
really well but you can turn that off if
you're worried about yeah I mean
presumably you're on the ball right it's
your app and you're you're the one
deploying it but no it's it's fair
question so you don't have to use that
wizard but one of our philosophies is
let's make it really easy from for
people to get started let's not let
things like oo off is a pain or you know
I don't want to have to worry about
security when I first build my app I
just want to like play with an interface
because it's gonna take me a while to
even understand what my data model looks
like it's why we like Mongo because you
don't have to define a schema and you
can play with different ideas very
flexibly and I think you know the the
meteor d3 Mongo combination even as
goofy as this is I think shows you sort
of how interesting it can be to work
with live sets of data that are changing
where you have different permissions or
different sets of users that can see
different information the question is
what are the dependencies for meteor so
we implemented support for Mongo first
just because of its popularity there's
nothing in meteor that requires Mongo in
terms of the architecture we just
haven't written the connectors for other
things so I could have done this whole
demo typing SQL queries in the browser
and talking to a sequel database here on
the screen
we just haven't built that that binding
the sequel implementation that will let
you do that so you know sequel Redis
dynamo all of these things I think makes
sense
it's just that Mongo is such a good fit
and when we first don't meteor we wanted
to pick the one that was was most
helpful in terms of other dependencies
we try to keep it pretty self-contained
we use a lot of technology but meteor is
a one install thing you don't have to go
find a bunch of stuff so no js' of
course which is the server JavaScript
environment handlebars I mentioned for
templating the Mongo database comes with
meteor I mean this demo itself has d3
and jQuery and a couple other libraries
and those are all included as packages
so there's there's a large set of things
that we use but we try to make the
development experience very simple and
contained ah okay so the question is
what are we doing a jaco deploy if
basically you pull the rug out from
under the user it's a good question so
I'll show you the way that's implemented
just just real quick so on the client
you have a session object and session is
just a basic dictionary that you can get
and set data from so I can do session
set you know example
to be ten and then I can do session dot
get example and I get back ten right
very very simple it's not persisted on
the server it's not copied to any other
client if I went to Safari and did
session get example it would be
undefined because it's separate if I go
to my app and I just make a change in
save and I do a hot code push and you
saw the browser flicker right the only
way to do a hot code push is actually to
reload the browser right now there's
something that will change eventually my
session is still 10 so session is a
module in meteor that cooperates with
hot code push to serialize all of its
data before being reset by the browser
refresh and then reestablishes those
values that's the core piece that you
would use to implement a modal so you'd
have a dialogue and you'd have a session
variable that basically said whether or
not the dialogue is on the screen right
so typically in a hot code push if the
dialogues up on the screen browser
refreshes session variable gets
reestablished the templates that look
for that session variable or redraw and
everything is as it was if you just
outright remove the template then you
know it it's whatever your app would put
the user in with that state so that's
that's just an application decision but
again I would stress how important that
is because you know you think about a
modal and think about you know someone's
in the middle of doing something and all
of a sudden they're not right that's
that's not OK in a world where we're
trying to deploy every hour the question
is about statefulness on the server so
the real state is in the Mongo database
and what I've been showing you in fact I
I cannot resist doing this demo because
it's just it's so much fun so ok my app
is still running I'll go back to
localhost
I forget what bizarre state I've left
the world in ok I can create some
circles and they appear on
safari at the same time okay
I'm gonna kill the server I'm just gonna
kill the node process completely first
interesting thing is I can still create
circles why because number one my app is
running on my browser so it's unaffected
the H a story for a client-side
application is really interesting right
because you have brains on the client it
can make some smart decisions so I can
still take some actions and I'm
simulating remember what's really
happening is I'm doing an RPC to the
server to insert a new record while I'm
simulating that on the client so the
client merrily goes along assuming the
insert is gonna succeed which it will
and goes ahead and puts that circle on
the screen of course that is not
reflected on the other browsers because
there's absolutely no connection and I
can even I can do meteor dot I think its
status dot status this is sort of an
embarrassment okay and so the status of
the connection is waiting I'm no longer
connected to the server and then I can
rerun the server and again there's no
state left over and what's gonna happen
here is that the browser's are gonna
there they're checking every so often
it's like an exponential back-off like
you'd expect but if all goes well what
you're gonna see is
let me just force it and there now all
the data's been saved to the server and
transmitted over so so the question is
what happened on that reconnect and
again that gets back to what I was
talking about having a stateful protocol
so a couple of really important things
happened in this demonstration with that
protocol one is that the clients retry
our pcs and they're reliable
right so until they hear a result from
the server they're gonna hold on to that
queued RPC and we had three or four of
them queued up with the each insert
until they were finally reconnected to
the server and and ran right and the
other half of the question is you want a
stateful protocol and that protocol has
to survive transport failure so the in
this case I'm not signed in so there's
not a whole lot of clients state
actually but we could have done that
demo I mean I was logged in on the left
and that survived the reconnect so thank
you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
