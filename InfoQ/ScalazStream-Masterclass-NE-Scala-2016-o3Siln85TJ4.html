talking about scholars estrine this is a
library for streaming IO for Scala this
is going to be sort of an introduction
to this and then tomorrow at the
unconference I'll do sort of like a
hands-on workshop for those who are
interested well this is gonna be sort of
the overview high-level overview about
this library so scholars history or fs2
so it's being renamed in the this is a
streaming IO library for Scala and so if
his Tuesdays were functional streams
first column which is the new name this
is a library that so I work at Verizon
labs and we use this library a lot for
for streaming things for example we're
streaming telemetry data from servers
and from deployed services at a rate of
about a billion data points a day and
it's like totally fine it's a little bit
of a disclaimer that this talk is going
to be about the current version of the
library you might have heard that
there's going to be a new sort of
redesigned version of this library which
is going to be called FS 2 but this talk
is going to be about scholars at stream
which is the current version 0.8 and it
has a dependency on scholars at 7.1
whereas the next because you know so
right so again it's a it's a streaming
IO library for Scylla but it's a purely
functional streaming IO library for
Scott what that means is that streams
are immutable and referential a
transparent that is you know they're
purely functional alright so so you just
have really sort of a description of a
stream that doesn't actually sort of do
anything until you run it there
essentially so a stream essentially you
can think of it as a lazy list and it's
a lazy list that can contain both data
and effects so at every sort of step of
the list or every time you pull from the
list you're going to get either some
data or you're going to get some effect
that needs to
happen and this makes it sort of
naturally pool based so it's you're
constantly pulling from from these
streams so design goals of the library
design goals of the library are that it
be compositional and expressive resource
safe and above all comprehensible and
that's sort of my goal here is to
demystify so everything in this library
I can be understood right there there
are some simple concepts and there are
some simple ways of combining things and
if you understand the elements and then
you understand the compositions then you
really can understand like everything
that's certain in this library so a big
thing about this is that it can be
understood compositionally and that is
more true in fs2 in the next iteration
of this library than it is in the
current so your code at the end of the
day when you use this library is going
to look something like this it's going
to have you know you're gonna have some
stream that you're building up as sort
of a an expression like this so you
import scholars that stream and then you
import right now right here I'm working
with scholars at concurrent tasks which
is scholars at sort of i/o type so this
converter is a task which when run at
the bottom will actually do the stuff in
between it'll sort of execute this
program okay so you can think of the
task is sort of like a first-class
program which then when run at the
bottom actually makes the side-effects
happen ok so let's look at what this
thing does right it's so IO is a package
in scales a stream that gives you
facilities for doing reading from from
i/o streams and reading from files and
things like that so I know that lines
are says I'll open this file and you
know stream the lines from it they're
going to be separated by new lines and
then I'm saying filter out all the empty
lines and lines that start with two
slashes and then I'm saying for every
line so math over the stream for every
line
convert it from Fahrenheit
Celsius because you know Fahrenheit is
updated and then we intersperse with new
lines so we put a new line after each
string and then we pipe that to a an
encoder a utf-8 encoder which is a
stream transducer that turns the stream
of strings into a stream of bytes and
then we say to to send it to a sink and
we say IO file chunk right which which
will write those bytes and chunks to a
file Celsius DSD and then at the end we
say run to basically compile this stream
to a task so that turns into a single
task that we can then run so it's sort
of like that run dot run which is kind
of weird so let's start by looking at
tasks so what it what is tasks so it's
Bella's at the current task is a purely
functional data type for talking about
IO in Scala it is asynchronous that
means you can do asynchronous i/o it's
compositional I mean if you have two
tasks you can compose them and so you
can think of a task it's sort of like a
first class program it's it's a value
that you can manipulate in your code you
can also think of a task as a list of
instructions that need to be executed at
some point in time and task is also a
monette for those who are familiar with
monette so it supports but importantly a
task doesn't actually do anything like
while you're looking at it it doesn't
actually do anything until you call run
on it all right so you can pass them
around safely and do stuff with them but
they don't actually execute so then how
do we can start tests well there are
three basic ways of constructing tasks
we can say task delay which takes an
unloaded expression and will capture
that in task so here for instance I'm
saying task delay read line and read
line is just like read line from this
Scala library and so that would be a
task which when run will read a line
from the standard input and return it
return the string super simple but
importantly that red line is not
evaluated right there
it's not evaluated until you call run
okay that's thought now says evaluate
this thing right now and then capture it
in in the task so it's that's eagerly
about it if you say that now so it's the
prison is 42 thing is a pure value but
if it had some kind of side effect that
side effect would happen now that's that
fail will construct a task that fails
once run they will throw this exception
all right
there's another way of constructing
tasks so the you can construct sort of
asynchronous waiting tasks so for
instance if you have like a callback api
if you have like future for instance as
a callback api Scala concurrent feature
in the sense that it has a non complete
method and so you can register a
callback with future such that when it
completes it will call your function
alright and that function is that
callback function is on complete sorry
the register function so you call
feature that I'm complete to register
your ball back but this async
constructor in task allows you to do is
to pass the the on complete or the the
registry function to this to this
constructor to capture this idea in a
task so then where as future done
complete would take a function that
receives an nth now this task async
thing is a task which when run will
return an int it will go and register a
callback with the future wait for it to
finish and then return the end all right
now what's on the previous slide doesn't
actually compile so you have to actually
do it's a little more involved so you
have to actually say you know TAS that
async
you pass it a function that receives
another function so it's a high order
function so it takes that function takes
another function K which is the
continuation and then you say you know
register a callback and if that callback
gets a success then I call K with right
to the bay otherwise if it's a fail then
I've called K with left of the air and
this backslash forward last thing as
scholars EDS either type so it's it's
going to be either an error or about you
okay so so here another way of
constructing sort of asynchronous tasks
is to explicitly say like I want to
schedule this task on a thread pool so
say you have a task a which is you know
some task and you have a thread pool and
you want to say I when I run this task I
actually don't want to run it in the
current thread I want to run it on a
different thread and so you can say
attach that fork to schedule a task to
run on a different thread all right so
that's less constructing tasks so
combining tasks so now that we know how
to construct tasks let's talk about how
to put them together so one way is like
imagine if you have two tasks and you
want to run them simultaneously with the
run them both at the same time so you
can construct the tasks of the pair a
and B that will do a and B at the same
time just by calling both and that's a
method on non-determinism of tasks for
some reason so and non-determinism comes
with a whole bunch of other methods like
you could spawn a whole list of tasks
rather than just two of them you could
have a list of tasks and then say
non-deterministically all of them
another stuff
another way of combining tasks is to use
flatmap so if you have a task of a mm-hm
and then you have a function that can
receive they can receive values of type
a so we would receive the result of that
of running the first task and you can
construct this composite task that will
you know do a and then pass the result
of that to F and that will be a
composite task that returns and that
allows us to sort of nest these things
or sort of put them one after the other
and that allows us to use for confer
engines and for comprehensions D sugar
to calls to flatten up so that allows us
to do things like write imperative
looking programs all right so note that
this is this is a data structure like
it's a first class it's a first class
object like this doesn't actually do
anything but it looks like an imperative
program and so you can say you know
that's delay print line something and
then delay standard in red line and
assign the results to N and then we can
you know hello so we can write like an
imperative looking program but
importantly this whole thing is just a
task which one run will do all these
steps okay and it doesn't do anything
before that so running tasks if we have
a task okay you can call that run on it
and it will do all the things and we'll
wait for the so you can get your a out
of the task by running it you want to do
this sort of at the last possible moment
like you want to do it at the outside of
your sort of at the edge of your
programs because you could always like
math or flat map over a task you don't
really have to run them until you're
really sure that you want the effects to
happen so this run async thing is like
run but and so we can say run async on a
task and give it a continuation and so
that will actually start running the
task and return immediately
so we'll start running the task and if
it was scheduled to run on another
thread it'll schedule it to run on that
thread and then
turn control to you so this is a way of
sort of running a task asynchronously
without waiting for it and you give it a
continuation K which will then receive
either the value it will receive the
value of type a that was in that task or
it will receive a throwable if that task
through an error so you run it and it'll
it'll like make it happen
how to handle errors so you can handle
errors in in tasks so if the thing that
you delay if the expression that you
delay actually throws an exception then
that that exception watch will be
captured in in the task it'll be the
same thing as saying like toss stop
failed and giving it the exception and
that will construct the task which when
run will throw that exception okay
so it captures the whatever errors were
whatever exceptions are being thrown in
the code that's that's captured and if
you want to handle an error you can say
attempt so you have a task can you say
it's an attempt that will actually
convert that task into a task of either
an error or n/a so when you run team
that attempts it will not throw an
exception if T through an exception T
that attempt to not for an exception but
it will return the exception as a value
is that and so you can flatten up over
that in order to get at the normal value
so that's super helpful okay so that's
task right so pretty straightforward
listen I'll talk about streams which is
the the real meat of this alright so
streams are represented by this time
which is process and it's a process of F
and eight so the the f-type here is the
effects type so this this type herbs as
a stream that has values of type a that
may produce values of type a and will
have effects of type F so it's a lease
list and at every step it will either
have an effective type F will have a
value of type and most of the time this
effect type F is going to be specialized
to tasks that's sort of the common use
case so this is a stream with stream of
tasks basically and ace in equal measure
we can construct streams it essentially
only three ways that we can construct
sort of primitive streams so these are
these sort of atoms of this thing
there's the empty stream which is halt
that is just a a stream so it's a
process of nothing nothing so it has no
effects and it has no values and there's
a mint sorry there's a mint which will
emit a single value on the stream so
emit Oh will be a process that emits
that OH
and has no effects it's just a single
value on the stream there's a weight and
this is where sort of gets interesting a
weight will say okay I have an effect of
type F like imagine if F is task right
so say there is some task that I want
you to execute a weight will so the
stream will contain a task right that
needs to be executed by whatever is
running the stream by the interpreter of
this thing and once that task is run
there will be a value of type I and then
the receive function will receive for
that value of type I and then continue
the process so this is saying like
weight on this task or on this effect to
happen once it has happened take the
value that it gave you and and continue
the process okay make sense so then you
can actually take an F or an effect
let's say this is a task so the same foo
is a task obey then you can say well
turn that task into a stream by saying
process eval so you can sort of turn two
tasks in two streams of tasks so this
this thing will be a stream which does
foo and
and then emits the results I feel
another way of writing the same things
to say foo and then emit okay for
example here is a process that reads a
single line from the standard input and
emits it so we just say toss delay read
line and then we evaluate to turn that
into a stream and that stream will just
have a single string on it and that
strain comes from the standard input now
we're saying in practice we're saying
eval delay a lot and so I like to have a
little Combinator or a little helper
function called
I call it I you know which takes an
underrated expression and then we'll
eval that to turn that expression into a
stream that executes that expression and
returns its result it's the result on
the stream so it's a single element list
stream so then combining processes like
where you know how to do one element
streams we know how to do sort of a
single effect on a stream and we know
how to do the empty string so let's now
talk about how we combine these into
larger things they're basically
basically only two ways that you can
combine streams and or a two basic ways
so we can append one process at the end
of another or one stream at the end of
another actually process of being
renamed to stream in the next iteration
of this and that's makes it easier to
talk about so if you have a stream p1
and you have a stream p2 you can append
p2 to p1 and that'll do Pete one and
then do p2 so P 3 will be the you know
everything that people does and then
everything that p2 does and you can also
say append for example if you wanted to
read two lines from the standard input
you could say read a line and then
append that to read another line so now
you have a stream that will contain two
lines from the standard input stream we
could repeat a process indefinitely by
appending it to itself so here is
representing the standard input stream
itself as a stream of
which at every step will execute the
task to read a string from the standard
input so so this is now the standard
input stream another way of doing the
same thing is to say repeat so if you
have a stream I process something you
can say that repeat on it and I will
repeat that process indefinitely all
right so this is now the standard input
stream so we can write you know like the
UNIX utility cat or sort of a baby
version of it where we say oh yeah so
okay flatmap sorry flat map is another
way of combining two streams all right
so if you have the stream standard in
which is the stream of strings you can
say flat map to say for every element s
in that stream insert a whole other
process in its place in the place of
that element and that will allow us to
do things like like this where we say
you know standard in flat map and then
for every element s I want to print that
to the standard out and then the result
of that will be a process and task of
units because the result of printing a
line is unit right you can read the same
thing using for comprehension so you say
well for s in standard in do the IO
print line yes
it reads sort of nicely as an imperative
program as well but it's important to
note that even though this looks like an
imperative program it's really more like
a list comprehension so we can write
like the unit's utility grep or a baby
version of that we the process or the
streams they come with a lot of methods
that you would expect to see on lists or
collection type of thing and so filter
is one of those things and so here I'm
you know take a regular expression and
then I want to filter the standard input
with the predicate that I construct from
that regular expression predicate it's
just a function took that returns a
boolean so it compares the string to the
regular expression and then I say
flatmap out
say for every line in the standard and
that matches that is not filtered out
send that to the standard outfit alright
so now we were in the graph so it gives
me two running processes so we now we
know how to construct simple processes
we know how to build sort of more
complicated processes let's talk about
running them so to run a process really
means to sort of collect its effects
right so you'll have a process as a
stream of effects and you want to say
well I want to collapse them all into a
single thing like you imagine if F is
task for is this then you have a stream
that make emits and tasks and I want to
collapse all of those into a single task
that I can then run so if you say
process that run then this F thing has
to be a Mona and Mona it's just the
fancy way of saying accumulate the
effects and you there's even they so
here F also has to be there is there's a
way of accumulating into a list so if
you want to do something with the
elements so one day so if you say dot
run it'll give you like a task of unit
so you don't actually see the elements
what's expected is that you know you you
flat map over it and you know you
actually put your effects or whatever
you want to do with the elements in the
stream itself right so this so then this
thing just returns a unit yes but if you
actually do want to look at the elements
if you want to run the stream and see
what the elements actually are then you
can do run log and it'll give you a list
of the elements I don't recommend doing
that and like production code because
you know lists are you can also collect
using mom would so if you have a process
of a so you have a stream of A's then
you can if you can map that into using a
function f
as the bees then you can collect using a
monitor and mono it is just the fancy
way of saying collect the elements so
you add all the elements together into a
single be using if you expect the
process to be nonterminating right you
should write yes that's this a good
right you should not use your not run
log or run fold map a process that you
expect to never terminate you should you
know flat map and have an effect inside
of the inside of the process so whatever
you want to actually do the elements you
should put that in the process itself
like you should put tasks okay so that
gives me two pipes so if we have a
stream of A's and we want to sort of
pipe that to some other thing then turn
that into a stream of peas that sort of
does something in between then we use
pipes so the primitive way to create a
pipe is the that transforms one stream
into another is is a weight one so
process not a weight one is then a sort
of stream transducer which will ask for
a single element from a stream and then
it will emit that element and I don't
know why this is called process one so
the process one of a two a is a is a
transformer that will take a stream a
base and turn it into another Serio base
I don't know why it's called process one
it really should be called pipe but so
it's yeah it's a stream transformer for
example you can write a tape transformer
which will take a number of elements
from another stream so this is now a
process one or a pipe from eye to eye
which when given enough when given a
stream will take n elements from that
string and it'll do that by calling a
wait 1 followed by take
yeah and if you know if we reach zero
then we halt and it's the empty string
so the way that you use a process one
use a pipe you pass it to the pipe
method so if a is a process or a stream
of a and P is a process one or a pipe
from A to B then we can say H pipe e to
turn that hook that is into a process so
for instance if it's take then you know
a is pipe take four will be a stream
that contains the first four elements
today's another example is there's this
thing called chunk which will so process
one is an object it's a it's a package
in the in the library and it contains a
lot of these pipes a lot of these
process ones are useful one of them is
chunk if you want to chunk your input
into into vectors of some fixed size so
you have a process of a base and then
you say you know pipe that to a chunker
that produces chunks of size 10 and that
will now be stream vectors okay and most
of those crosses ones or pipes actually
have convenient methods so there's
there's syntax sugar for that on the
actual stream and so if you say A's
chunk ten that's the same thing as
saying you know AIDS pipe alright and
you can write your own your own pipes
like for instance here I've written a
distinct pipe so this thing will be it
will take if you pipe a stream to this a
stream of A's then this thing will emit
each element in that stream only once
right so you start out with the empty
set of elements you've seen and then
what this process will do is it will
wait a single a and then for each a
that's seen that's black map if it has
been stupid I mean so for each element
that we have if it has been seen before
then you know we we drop it and we just
continue without it
otherwise we omit it and then we
continue adding the element to the set
of things we've seen right easy and sort
of behind the scenes so one of the
things one of the things I want to to
show is that none of this stuff is is
really like magic or special because a
process one or pipe is really just a
stream whose effect is to ask for a
value right so so you know you can
understand the the process one type in
terms of effects you know every every
stream is just the stream of effects and
values and process one the pipe just
happens to be a stream whose effect is
to ask for a value all right so then
there's multiple sources so that's it so
pipes you know you can have one stream
and even you can pipe it to another
stream so with multiple sources we use
something called a tea so then that's in
the scholars at stream tea package and
so so the idea of a tea is that you have
two input two input streams and you want
to sort of combine them into the one
stream and there are there is a number
of Combinator's on process one or a
number of number of methods on process
one sorry on process on the stream that
allow you to combine it with other
streams for instance zip so if I have f1
and f2
each one is reading from some file and I
do this type alias here so I have a
source of strings and another source of
strings which is f1 and f2 then I can
zip them together to get a source of
pairs which is you know it'll do them
both in lockstep right it'll take one
friend from f1 it'll take a one from f2
and it'll both of those and then there's
interleave we
we'll do them alternatingly so it'll
take one from f1 it'll take one from f2
and you know it'll emit front from one
and then the other so and that's now a
source of string straightens that
interleaves the contents of these two
files and there's other cool stuff like
until like we can say do f1 until f2
returns or f2 emits true and in this
case I'm taking f2 and I'm mapping over
to say well is it is the line that I'm
getting equal to stop and if it is equal
to stop then I stop the whole process
yeah
and this this stuff here is this stuff
it's really just syntactic sugar for
method calls to tea so the idea of a tea
is that it's it's a process that can
receive two inputs and so for is this
the zip is really a tea called zip so
it's T zip but that's sort of besides
the point but a tea is very much like
our process 1 or a pipe except that pipe
can have two inputs instead of just one
so if you have a z-- which is a process
process of days let's Rhema base and you
have B's which the stream of B's and you
have a T ABC then you can turn your your
hope you know both of these processes by
teeing them together using the T so I'm
saying T a lot so you can sort of teen
them together
and and the way that they are combined
is specified by the T and so so it will
always ask so it'll deterministically
ask for for them so the primitives for a
T is it's very much like pipe where a
pipe said like a weight one but with a T
you can say a weight left and you can
say a weight right so if you want to
wait like an element from the left side
of the zip
we left was the same way right for
instance here is a eighty that takes two
streams and as their elements together
sort of in a zip like fashion element by
element right so it'll take
corresponding elements from from two
streams from the left stream and the
right stream and then it'll add them
together by yielding X plus y and it
will repeat it will do that repeatedly
and then to sum the elements of P 1 and
P 2 we say P 1 T P 2 and T them together
with ad all right and the T again it's
not magic it is a it's a stream or
process whose effect happens to be the
ability to request an A or a B so the
effect will be on either a function that
receives an A or a function that
receives a B so we will be in a wait
left another way of doing these things
is to combine them with with a y another
way of combining two streams and a y is
very much like a tea except instead of
sort of deterministically asking for
like I want the left one or I want the
right one you can say you know give me
whichever one is ready right just like
one these two processes and then when
one of them emits an element I want it
and tell me which one it was and methods
on process that either you can use are
things like either so f1 either f2 will
return so at every every step it'll be a
sort of a stream there will be a source
of either intz or strings and at every
step it'll contain either an int or
string right and the int will come from
f1 and the string will come from f2
where f1 is the system input and f2 is

and you can also merge where if you have
two streams of the same time at the same
time you can merge non-deterministically
merge them together which is very much
like interleaf except that instead of
saying like I'll do this one first then
this one then this one or this one it'll
do you know it'll run them both as fast
as you can and then it will run it will
return it'll emit from them as they as
they appear on the string so let's say
you had you know like two network
sockets right you have both of them are
streams then you can merge them together
and things as fast as they come okay
and there's also there's other stuff
like for instance with the until you can
do the same thing with with Y's which is
interrupts like you can
non-deterministically interrupt a stream
like this where you know I can say you
know if there is anything on the system
input so I say map underscore to true so
if if there's any element on the f1
which is a system input so as soon as
there's any input interrupt this stream
otherwise keep reading lines from from
f2 pretty cool so yeah the idea is that
if you have a Y like this of Y ABC you
have two processes one that is a stream
of A's and another that it's a stream of
B's then you can Y them together like
this which means either two
non-deterministically
interleave them or non-determinism and
and the the actual method like what it
actually does is specified by the way
yeah so the implementation of this like
the oh wait you know you have whether
there's anything ready right so to it
once its halted its it's finished but
the implementation of the thing that
runs the why will it'll wait on whatever
effects are happening on either side and
so you know they're tasks right it's a
stream
- you have two streams of tasks and
you're taking one task or meet on one of
them and you're like running both of
them and then whichever one whatever
task finishes first that's going to be
your element and you're going to emit
that onto the downstream it's not
specialized tasks no oh it is
okay so so in the last in the previous
version this was specialized to task
okay okay so FS to makes this makes this
general cool yeah so and also why is not
really magic it's just a thing that can
whose effect it's a stream whose effect
is a triple and so the effect is like
you know here are three functions one of
them can receive an A one of them can
receive a B and one of them can receive
both an A and a B and like whichever
ones of these you have like call the
appropriate function like if you have an
a call this one if you have a B call
that one if you have both ready for me
call this function right so you know Y
is also just just a string yeah so then
another way of combining things is very
much like sort of flat map which is to
merge strings so and it works very much
like a Y except with any number of
processes so if you if you have a
process full of processes like if you
have a stream of streams you can say
merge them all together like all of
those streams will produce ace and what
I'm saying is non-deterministic we merge
them like just run them all really
really quickly and then if they emit an
a I admit that on the on this on the
street right so whole bunch of streams
you merge them all together yeah and
it's kind of like monadic join right
it's given the type signature right but
but the manic join would actually like
finish one process and then finish the
next process but this allows you to do
is like run all the processes
simultaneously and emit the results as
they become available and this actually
calls I think called enjoined which is
on this non-determinism package and that
gives you a little more control over
like how you're actually combining these
streams
so max open is the is the maximum number
of processes open at any given time and
max queued is the maximum number of
elements that are sort of queued on the
output before you actually block on the
input so this this is how you implement
sort of like back pressure it's using
oh yeah right so even though this looks
like a manic joint it does not okay so
that gets us to sinks and a sink is
really just a source of functions right
so if you have so here there is a a
mythical two so if you have a process a
stream of base and you have a sink that
receives ice then you can say X 2 y 2 to
stream to the sink and that is provided
by so there's a bunch of things that are
provided in the i/o package for instance
standard in lines is a it's a process of
strings and then standard outlines is a
sink that receives strings and then we
can implement cat by saying standard in
lines two standard outlines so that will
just echo the and the sink is just a
stream of functions that is its if this
it's really this type here so a sink is
a stream which can emit effects of type
F but it also can also emit functions
which receive A's and then those will
have some effect for example we can
implement standard out by just saying
emit this function which receives an S
and then prints that to the standardout
and then repeat that so that now becomes
a sink which is the standard output sink
channels a channels is a very similar
kind of thing except that it can risk it
can have a result so it sits like a sink
except that it doesn't just like it also
emits B's right so and then you say
through instead of two so X through Y
will take a process of a and emit the
elements through the channel Y which
will then receive the values of type a
and emit values of type
all right and again Astra channel is
just a stream of functions and so no
it's a it's a stream where you know it
has some effects type F and it will emit
functions that are sort of effect
felicia's and those functions will then
return f of B where it likes to say as a
task would be and then this channel will
emit the bees that are returned by this
function and in fact the sync is a
channel that specialized to unit okay
all right that gives me two cues all
right let's meet accusing signals so be
the scholars that stream async package
contains some really useful stuff they
used to check out cues and signals so aq
allows you to NQ and DQ and it's backed
by like an actual mutable queue but in
it presents the Q as a streaming
interface so there's an NQ sync that you
can pipe to and there's a DQ source so a
stream of A's so every time something
sent something to the enqueue sync it
will appear on the DQ stream alright
and there is a number of ways of
constructing queues you can strip bound
to queues unbounded queues and there's a
circular buffer which will overwrite
itself and there's a a another thing
super useful call the signal which is
like a mutable cell this will allow you
to get and set so you can get the value
that's in the signal this is an egg but
you get it as a task and then you can
set the a also as a task and we can get
a stream of the values of the signal
like as it changes over time and we can
get the discrete and continuous so
discreet will emit a value every time
the signal changes and continuous will
just you know it's just the firehose it
will like continue continually give us
or the current value of the signal as
long as we keep asking for it okay now I
was going to do a little demo but I
think I'm gonna save that for the
unconference tomorrow but you can sort
of check that out in the meantime here
take a question thank you anyone other
than Daniel yes sir
oh the question is can I give an
indication of what's changing between
this and Daniel is sitting right behind
you and he can definitely give you an
indication of what is changing but the
the the short answer is that resource
safety is being improved I mean it's
like actually becoming resource say and
the the way that you sort of pull from
multiple sources is also changing like
you know you don't need to necessarily
mess with like pipes and Y's and T's and
things like that that you know you can
you can express like how you pull from
various sources in a much more sort of
compositional way all right that's it
