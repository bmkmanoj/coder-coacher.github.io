looking at the crowd right now I would
say many many people if you are tired of
work and want to focus on fun excellent
that's what and not what it's about
so when I created this title this was
actually like a one minute thing this
was what I think about so I'm not
talking about not doing work I'm gonna
talk about how we can get rid of all
this really really really tedious work
that we do every day over and over again
and focus on the actually important
stuff I'm not gonna focus on important
stuff I'm kind of focus on the tedious
stuff well how do I get rid of so I
thought okay this is little long so I
went back to this let's focus on the fun
so who's heard about build scripts who's
ever used to build scripts loads of you
how many people like writing build
scripts yeah me neither but the reason
why they're there is because good
developers are lazy and the fact that
you all know about this means you're
really really lazy back out there
excellent it's a fact
this is one of my absolute favorite
charts I'm not sure if you could see it
well I try to get a little good contrast
in there it basically shows you that
everybody starts doing something over
and over again and then the clever geeks
at one point say this is tedious
let's write a script for that and you
keep doing it and at one point that done
and when they're done they win over the
one who keeps doing the same things I
hope we can end all being that clever
geek at the end so there's been build
scripts for a long time everybody who's
been in software engineering basically
used to do one some build that does the
compilation that adds all the
information stuff and there are loads of
them out there this is a really small
stuff that's the stuff that I used to
work with I used to work with make I
used to work at the break and maven
there's loads of them I guess you
probably know most of them and there's
loads of them and they're all great and
powerful and all but here but ugly they
look like this this is and this is doing
nothing but minimizing a little
JavaScript into something more little
and I've been writing this and it's it's
painful it's not fun it's really really
really bad who's writing who's who's has
ever been writing and scripts we do the
same thing again who enjoyed this
yes there's a good reason for that
because nobody really likes configuring
XML not at all
also I'm a front-end imminent developer
so I don't really write bash or shell I
mean it do it but I don't really enjoy
it
I like JavaScript in fact I loved you
ever script and I can't really get along
with like writing big amount of XML I
keep working with it and I keep breaking
it it's getting worse and worse don't
let me ever approach XML so and I only
realize this when I we prepared this
talk it's been just a year when Bill
Melman actually launched grunt and it
was a great favor to all of us because
JavaScript language I personally enjoy
writing and I looking at you you might
be the same kind of crowd so that's what
I did someone actually did a JavaScript
build scripts thank you very very much
and it's written on note everybody else
low note I've been using it for a while
so it's it's already on my computer it's
just there and it's rather easy to get
it's also using NPM which is the notepad
node package module manager my god and
which means it's really easy to
republish what you wrote for it and
which means in just that one year
there's already a massive publication of
really really good modules that you can
just use like that which means people
are using it one of the first ones
actually jQuery started using it before
it was released because he was actually
working close with a jQuery team so
everything that is in jQuery right now
is running through grants to build it
and it's being stitched together from
hand little pieces and it works just
fine modernizes doing the same thing
that Dobby has a tool as does it
Twitter's using a good Bower and yes I'm
using it internally as well
because it's easy so let's start setting
up the system and it's really easy you
download your node package from OJ's it
used to be hard it's just one little
compilation anymore download install and
it's done and then you can do this you
run NPM install grunt and you don't
install grunt anymore so I got to tell
you I only just rewrote this talk
because I wrote it about a month ago
when I thought oh yeah I'm far ahead
let's do this that's not do this from
last minute for a change and then note
run changed from 0.3 to 0.4 and the
whole API changed don't worry this is
not gonna happen again because the way
that I changed it right now is that it's
not gonna happen to again so basically
what this does is it's not installing
grunt it's installing the grunt
command-line interface and that is
basically just a pointer so you can use
the grunt keyword on your command line
and then it uses the locally installed
grunt version which is great and gonna
tell you why it's great the problem we
had before if you used grunt in a team
it said basically everybody could have a
different version of grunt installed and
when they run grunt against build script
that was there that might mean that it's
doing something entirely different for
them that for you by doing this your
point you to a locally installed grunt
version that comes with your source that
means no problems anymore yay
I heard that so let's keep on setting up
the project it basically needs two files
that are important first of course the
grunt file itself the grunt file GS is
the file that describes what you want
grunt to do the other file is a
package.json let's start with a
package.json
this is what a package.json looks like
it's taken from one of my open source
projects it's little tab script never
mind about that
and if you can see it's really just a
teeny tiny bit of JSON that defines a
couple of teeny tiny things first the
name damn this case must not contain any
spaces otherwise it's fine or special
characters really a version using the
semantic format so you can see where
we're going with that a homepage this
point pointing to github and then
everything else is really optional in
terms of the author that's just me being
vain here but in my name out there and
the last part that's the part that is
really very important for grunt is the
dev dependencies I'm gonna go into that
so what grunt gives you is variables so
first up this file can't you can load
into your grunt file and there you can
use every note in your JSON file and
play around with it you can render
things into your HTML into your jib
script let's just work and the dev
dependencies is what I just talked about
that will hold every node module every
NPM not looking cool that you added to
your grunt file allowing you to really
easily reinstall it which is good so
this is the same file again let's
install grunt and this is now actually
installing right what it does is when I
look at the - - safe def at the end what
this means is first installed grunt and
install grunt locally into my project
folder and by saying - - safe def it
means add yourself to my dev
dependencies so next time I'm gonna
install or maybe your team colleague
needs to install this they get exact the
same version and nothing's going to
break because then what's happening is
this it just edit itself to the DEF
descent penance this group with a tilde
which means it's smaller from 0.4
onwards everything that's new you're is
cool as well that's what it does by
default and everything that you add like
that a lot of
turn up here highly recommend doing this
because you never have to think about it
again
and I like not thinking about it because
I'm lazy so this is all I need to do or
your colleague in case they want to
reinstall what you just have it just go
into the same folder and run npm install
and everything that's in the dev
dependencies will just magically appear
beautiful now let's go through a grunt
file which is where the magic happens
yay okay so remember that ant file you
saw earlier that was minimizing a
javascript file this is doing the same
thing in grunt and I'm not sure how you
feel but I can read this and I could
have to stand what it says and it's
beautiful
so it's look a little into it again
remember you do remember right
yeah back to grant so this is the whole
file this is everything it needs in the
ground file but of course this is not
actually everything that you need to
write over and over again because what
we have here is the grunge wrapper so
what we're using here is a comma J as
module and you only need to do this once
you start your file with it
and you and your file with it and
everything else you can then repeat into
it and add keep adding more things it's
really really cool so it creates crazy
new module it in its grunt and basically
just keeps passing little modules like
this so what we're using here is amplify
a Corral is a beautiful little open
source product which minifides
JavaScript and it does it really well
and it has a grunt plugin which is
really nicely maintained so this is what
I'm using here and all I need to do is
I'm gonna load so at the very bottom
actually is we just the other way around
at the very bottom here I'm loading the
NPM task what happened here is by
installing the grunt amplify at the
grunt contrib uglify plug-in using NPM
like we saw earlier
we have a new folder that contains the
actual program you never have to touch
that ever it's just living there but we
need to tell grunt okay this is where we
load it this is the name of the product
just load it and then we're gonna pass
configuration in it and we're gonna tell
it okay I want to do some distribution
here and I'm gonna this is the most
simple configuration you can get it can
get much more complicated if you want to
but you don't have to so I'm passing the
file that I want to be may have minified
I'm telling where I wanted to end up
that's it it works then I define quickly
go back I have different tasks in grunt
that I use to do different things so in
this case I'm defining my default task
but a full task is the task that is
being called when you just run grunt
nothing else that's being called so in
this case I'm saying okay when I'm
calling grunt run occupy so occupy is
being called it knows buzz what is to do
it has all the files loaded and it will
work let's do this
make sure this is very much my face here
can you still hear me like this that's a
note yes okay so that's good and this is
readable is this still readable
excellent because the screen is much
smaller than sir
okay that's my example and you can see
it's completely empty there's nothing in
there let's go ahead and add some files
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna first
create my package.json and what I can do
is I can use NPM in it to create it for
me so they have to write myself NPM
again note node package manager is what
is actually meant for the package Jason
so this is what it gives me I'm running
it and gives me a lot of text I'm gonna
get a little smaller even so you can
read it better it's just still readable
I'm getting thumbs yeah that cool
alright so it first tells me what it
does and then it's gonna ask me about
the information that I want to enter
actually let me like this okay so it's
ask me for a name that what's the name
that we saw early in our demo so I'm
gonna call it it's often me examples I'm
gonna call it example there is example
and it's gonna be version 0 0 0 cuz I'm
just starting up description it's
awesome and just gonna have two entry
point we don't care about that we're
gonna remove this later on
and we don't need a test command either
we don't need a key proposes right now
we don't need keywords although I don't
care about license this is fine yes this
is cool
so this is what's gonna write for me
okay
so let's have a look
this is my example folder it created one
package file for me let's have a look
into it so there we are
that package Jason was just created for
me again it's much bigger than I thought
I need like this okay so it actually
created a couple of things that I've
done really neat I don't need a main I
don't really care about the scripts here
because I'm not actually writing
anything you know GS repository I don't
care or I don't care license disk Ares I
don't care either this is all I need so
far actually in the description is
optional what I'm gonna need though is
that dev dependencies so that's gonna
add that actually think it's gonna add
that for me as well let's be risky in
this case so and as you can see the
folder it's completely empty except a
package JSON so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna first install grunge into my
project let's do this install grunt I'm
gonna do the - - there save save def
right you can see how often I'm writing
this by hand basically never and I'm on
a standard Oh Stan system which means
it's not gonna run without sudo so let's
add sudo to that as well
and it's still failing because let's see
why it fails I have a trailing comma in
the Jason oh thanks for that yes
you're good let's try this again
and it's look adding warnings no it's
running now excellent first shock over
so that was good let's have a look what
we have now so now we suddenly have a
folder called node modules which
contains front and again we don't have
to care about this but we know it's
there and it's massive and it does
everything that we need so far it does
not do anything though what it has been
doing though
it added itself to the dev dependencies
like I hope too so now we actually have
grunt in our project now our project
itself it's not doing anything right now
because it's really nothing but a
package.json but we can change that
let's go ahead and see what we can do
first of all this makes me happy it just
works so it's easy to add more
so far we actually don't even have the
mini file that's what I wanted to do see
I forgot it already let's go back it's
grunt contrib up you fight let's install
that
any typos
dammit you're right let's do it again
okay there we are going back to the
project we now have uglify running in
here as well and we have another folder
that contains the full occupy including
all the binaries and scripts that it
needs to run beautiful
we still don't actually have a project
though never mind about that
let's go ahead and use an existing one
so I'm gonna have this bro check this is
the accessible tap that I was talking
about earlier and it's full of a lot of
script and HTML and I only just recently
edit run to it so it's a good example
and get this case
okay Anand accessible taps folder
so this is the father attitude and again
there's the package.json which contains
a little more what already added here is
ugly fine
makes me happy again and it's easy to
add more
I can go ahead and just add Jace hint
because there's a lot of JavaScript in
there and I want to of course use
JavaScript to work fine some adding this
as well
you already saw how it will look like
and there's a little better from the
contrast so let's look at it here what
it will do is in the most simple
configuration is it will go ahead and
where's my cursor okay nevermind my
cursor is not there so J's hint will
literally just look at every single
javascript file in my configuration here
this can be this is the most simple
configuration you can do you go ahead
and tell it to lift everything and it
will let everything you just need to
load the task and add it to your default
task in there so let's see how this
looks like default task is gonna run
when I run just the grunt command so I'm
gonna do this so and it is what happened
it's linters my javascript file it's
only one file in there and it's fine
luckily it Randi up to fight asked too
many for my JavaScript file it ended up
being one file it actually saved quite
something which is cool and then I did a
couple of more things I'm gonna into
later this is the most important part
it's done without errors this is gonna
make you happy when it works because you
just need to have one comma that
apparently happens to me and it's not
gonna work
so enjoy when it does
who's been this far so far it's not that
many how long did it take you to get
this far
add a couple of minutes because it's
easy that's cool so let's have a deeper
look so what you can also do is you can
load image information from the
package.json which is really really
handy because you don't want to write
over and over again what your version
number is and I used to do this from the
accessible tabs I basically had the
version number and documentation I had
it in the script headed in the minified
version and before I added a build
script I just had to do it over and over
again now I just read the information
that is in the package JSON which
contains the information about diversion
and I'm gonna use it and I'm gonna pass
it in to the app to file options so this
is the first option of you see the
occupy script here allows most as allows
me to define a banner and a banner is
really just a little text information
that will automatically paste on top of
your JavaScript file in this case it
will contain the name of the package and
the date it was created which is already
pretty handy and it gives you quite some
information if you download the file
later on so I'm also using this to no
longer have to write the name of the
file over and over again because I'm
just using it from the package I'm going
to add it to the JavaScript file so in
this case if I ever decide I need to
rename something in case I need to lower
case upper case or just rename it
completely this is what's automatically
going to take it over another thing that
I found really really handy is I can use
the version that I just created to pack
it in the file name as well which is
automatically helping me cache busting
because I'm hosting this myself and a
little static HTML page and people run
into and saying it's not working the way
it's described and then it was just the
cache obviously so this is something
that will automatically help you keep
always latest
version of the JavaScript right fresh in
your source and you don't have to do
anything for it so I love Chuck CSS is
there as well and I'm just pushing
through here because it's so simple
there's another module called CSS min
which I'm just gonna install using NPM
I'm going to install grunt contrib CSS
min and we're going to load the data
from the file I'm gonna register it to
my default task and it will
automatically run through configuration
as you can see it's doing the same thing
that J is mended occupied it
it used to be jasmine and it's gonna
take the banner information that we'd
already defined we only have to do this
once and then it's gonna run and take
all the CSS files and I got appointed to
I'm reduced manually here but I could as
well just define a Asterix dot CSS and
point it to a folder in this case
between manual because I want to define
the order that the CSS files are being
loaded into because you all know that
it's rather important to have the right
order of CSS files and it's going to end
up in one minute five CSS file that's
gonna be much much much smaller
really really nice in this case
excellent question I'm gonna come to
that the question was if it works for
less and says as well I'm actually going
into an example that uses exactly that
and yes it works beautifully going
further in the optimizations images of
course are a big thing as well and I
guess you all use something like image
up and files that you can use to come
from compromise every single file over
and over again you don't have to do this
either it's gonna do it for you and it's
working for JPEGs and P and G's in this
case so you only have to define didn't
file name that you that the name of the
image you want to optimize and you can
just override it but I don't suggest you
do that because you want to maybe have a
file that is a fibrous PNG that you
still keep working on and you just need
to translate it into the optimized low
PNG define a new disk source which is
what I'm preferring I have my source on
my disk and just copy them over in the
optimized version you'll always have two
optimized version in one folder and the
working version in the other one works
beautifully it offers you multiple
optimizations levels I found that three
is a rather good middle that actually
looks fine
Fiji's anyway and JPEGs as well and
you're gonna add it to your fault task
actually this is something I would
probably not put on the default task
because it would run it every single
time I'm gonna show you how to define
multiple tasks that are then allow you
to basically do this once on
distribution which is much nicer
so yes much much much more but actually
I'm rushing through here let's go back
to the project and have a look at the
grunt file
and the resolution is killing me okay
it's readable yes
so let's start from the top we defined
our grant module we initialize grunt and
pass in the following we load our
package JSON which we looked into
earlier actually it's open it at the
same time as our grunt file and our
package JSON is here so it contains all
the information that we defined earlier
and we only have to find it once when I
update the version I only do it in just
one location and it's gonna be published
into my JavaScript files and if I CSS
files and onto my readme as well and I'm
gonna define my banner up here now this
looks a little messy
but it really defines just the text that
I would like people to see when they
download my a JavaScript file and it's
really just okay this is the licensing
this is the version I'm on so they know
where to find it I'm gonna use this
banner to find it here I'm gonna use
this banner in the amplifier options so
even after minifying the file it will
still look fine let's have a look at it
this is my JavaScript file that my
JavaScript folder and you can see this
is the file that I work on it's all full
of information a lot of comments and a
lot of information that isn't really
needed when it's distributed and of
course it's not come compressed and this
is what ends up being published today
user and you can see it's highly
compressed it's down to one line and use
application to be as small as possible
and that's the banner that we saw and
it's that's probably hard to read over
bits it just tells on what link on
github between find it the copyright and
the license I'm using here so people can
use it for free
and this is done every single time I run
the grunt command it copies it and
minimizes it from the taps gesture
perhaps min-jae's just works like that
but it also does every single time is it
J is Lintz or in this case I'm using J's
hint because it's much more configurable
it's taste but it works so what I'm
doing I'm adding all this extra
information because I want it to be
rather strict about the way it Linz and
I'm also adding the jQuery global so it
doesn't rant about that let's see what
it would do if I wouldn't do this so I'm
running a grant command and it doesn't
care because I'm already pre defining it
that was brilliant
yes you can see I changed this massively
okay
okay what I'm also doing here for the
first time I'm in accusing watch and
watch is a separate task it used to be
part of grunt and now it's a separate
plugin and what it does is it allows me
to define files that are constantly
checked on and actually this is about
the time I'm switching to a different
project I have to apologize
I was basically working on this since
yesterday and it used to look better
okay
let's use html5 placeholder
thanks man okay
so this is not a project of mine annum
went a little further here so again I
have to banner
I'm concatenated files here because I'm
actually using more than one JavaScript
so this allows me using the concat task
again I'm using J's hint here here I
actually have to add two separate things
because I'm defining a amusing polyfill
here it's not automatically there and
I'm testing everything in JavaScript I'm
testing a grant for myself and so if I
would go and invalidate my grant file
this would finally yes there we are
give me a proper error and if I could go
back it would have work again there we
are
like if I spoke about seas as men we
spoke about I'm doing something here for
the first time that I haven't done in
the others I'm using the watch here it
is for good
sorry let's go to yet another one I know
this is terrible I apologize I'm gonna
shamelessly blame my newborn son who has
been sick all last week and I'm not
ashamed okay
last try
yes okay so this is my resume and it's
actually the most recent one because I
just recently worked on it to get the
job I'm on right now so this is one of
the most recent files that are used with
so this should work fine let's have a
look
so it's beautiful
this actually answers your question as
well
let's go through in this case I'm doing
markdown rendering so what I'm what I
have here I have damage okay I'm gonna
confuse the hell out of you
yeah okay and the polyfill I had to mark
done rendering because I was doing I
have what I'm using it for I have okay
for github everybody creates theory be
markdown file right so you can nicely
see what it looks like and on github
this works beautifully because github
does it for you
and so this is the project and this is
what it renders out of my beautiful
markdown and it's basically my full
documentation now I don't want my
markdown that I've write for github I
have to translate to HTML over and over
again so I was looking around and found
a nice plugin for grunt it was the same
thing for me and actually does it rather
nicely
it's the markdown package here and it's
called just grunt markdown it's a little
outdated but it still works beautifully
in the latest version so I hope it's
gonna be maintained for a long long time
I'm defining I'm gonna use my readme
file and I'm gonna also going to use my
version history which I just recently
made moved out of the JavaScript file to
work fine so this file is my version
history which is just keep longer longer
and married me which is this message
file so every time I'm going run grunt
on this it's also creating markdown in
this case nothing has changed but every
time it does this it's creating
beautiful HTML from form it and it's
using my template I defined which is
basically just my header and my body and
it replaces the same thing it does in
the grunt file as well so this is a
syntax here that you see in my grunt
file as well multiple times because it's
using basically every file that is being
touched by grunt beads in compression
beating a copy or beard in the in the
markdown compiler everything that's in
there will be replaced by the
corresponding variable that may or may
not come from the package.json or you
can actually define it in the grunt file
itself and modified as well like the
banner and in this case I'm using
it's to basically build out a website
which it was no really built for but it
works beautifully okay one thing I keep
running into I bet other people are
doing the same thing if I quickly debug
things and I keep adding little alerts I
keep adding console logs who else is
doing that
who else accidentally left it in the
code after the deploys yes
so as I'm keep running into this over
and over again I was looking for
something that helps me with this
because I'm stupid I'm also I'm lazy and
there's little package for that of
course tears and what I'm gonna tell it
is I'm gonna remove all the logging that
you find and again that's in the other
project
I'm doing brilliantly here Am I
say again
yeah there we are so I'm loading this
plug in here I'm gonna tell them okay
everything that you find in here that is
a log remove it yeah it's pretty clever
about that basically everything that it
finds that looks remotely like debugging
data it will alert so actually I left
one in here and it tells me every time
that it removed that let's have a look
what it did because I have so in here I
have my own little debug function and in
here I'm using one debug lab well it's
actually not really painful because I
did this because I ran into it all the
time it's not gonna lock ever however it
finds it and removes it so I'm safe I'm
also adding this every new project I'm
working on just to be sure because I
kept getting alerts from people on it
Explorer we don't have to console and
tell me it's breaking I don't know what
it's breaking let's have a look of
course the console lock
so finally your question from earlier
yes it works with sass and compass as
well in fact it even takes the
compilation out of your hands which
makes it really handy let's have a look
how this works and this is yet another
project
so i'ma resume again what I'm doing here
is I'm actually going a whole step
further so I'm using compass for it and
it's great fun and I have all my size
files here and I'm compiling it over
here beforehand I did this on multiple
different things I used live reload as
an application I used cut size and
compass on a command line and it all
works of course it's all extra things
you need to do and working on a team not
on my resume but a lot of things I've
ran into people having to reinstall
different tools running out of the syncs
files so we finally decided on using
internally one compass compilation and
use brunt for that for easiness all the
I'm doing here is I'm pointing to the
already existing config and Ruby I could
as well define everything in JavaScript
again but then again some clever third
party might come along and use a
different script that's not grunt and
all the configuration is lost so I'm
keeping it in the Ruby file as simple as
it is and just referring it to it here
and to make it even more beautiful I'm
also adding live reload using grunt and
which is the thing that makes me
ridiculously have because it really
really works beautifully and I never
have to run any third-party tool ever
again let's have a look how it looks so
I'm running round here and runt compiles
it compiled statically my CSS file from
one to the other what I want to do
though is I want to reload my page
automatically because let's have a look
how it looks
so this is my resume ignore you don't
have to hire me but is how it looks so
every time I'm changing something
actually its get rid of this terribly
ugly red that I created up here which I
just did for the demo purposes I'm
running round again it recompiles and
it's not that ugly anymore
wonderful so what I have to do this over
and over again I don't like doing this
over and over again so what I did I used
live reload and you know life reload as
a service as an application Wow
you should use live reload this is a
lifesaver I'm gonna tell you what to do
so usually this is just a little
application I'm going to show the lip
education first because it's beautiful
and the resolution is so little I don't
find anything here okay
I cannot actually reach it here
no I don't reach it nevermind I'm gonna
show you what it does in grunt so in
grunt it goes a little over the top
because what it does is it first creates
a full server for you it creates a
little CMS that delivers your page and
modifies a little JavaScript into it and
then it sets up another server that
serves a file that reloads your page and
what gotta go into details because you
can just believe me it just works but it
does here it just loads some extra
middleware from the files we installed
into the note first and then I am
defining the standard life without port
which is then admit all over the case
and I'm defining that I'm create a new
page using node connect here as
middleware and by doing so it allows me
to register a new task so remember we
have the default task here which is
nothing but J is hinting encompassing it
also now has a new task for server and
what I'm doing here when I start this
it's actually a long-running task it's
not gonna finish like the grunt task
just run through and stop this is gonna
start up and keep running and what it
does is it starts up my life reload
server it starts up my server that hosts
my page and it uses regard which is a
watch job so what it does is I have two
different things that I want to do here
first I want to detect if a JavaScript
file has changed and if that is the case
JavaScript hinted and do a live life
reload and if it sees as file has
changed or rather a SES as far as change
because I'm only doing this here and I
want you to compile it and do a life
reload so let's see how that works I'm
gonna do my rants grunt server
and it's falling apart can you believe
it no it's not oh yes it does
say again oh because I I started life
reload earlier didn't I
alright there we are so it's dead
hallelujah okay now that I killed the
application life load I can now run my
task life reload on grant and what it
does is it now watches my JavaScript my
CSS files and it also serves me a little
server on localhost
okay let's looks more like it so this is
the little server it creates for me
where it serves the files that I'm using
so yeah we are so it's not being served
through life reload and let's go over
here and do some changes that's gonna
add ste terribly ugly red beg in and
that's what happened
it automatically reloaded so let's
quickly look at what actually happened
behind the scenes after I started my
server
regarde stopped watching my JavaScript
my s CSS files and then I did my change
and it detected that my resume CSS my s
CSS has been changed it ran the compass
file it updated the CSS file and then it
ran the life reload so what this means I
can now go ahead and keep working and it
will just do everything for me yes
no it's actually running cess so you
install your compass and your sass
locally and it's going to use whatever
you have there very good question
yes absolutely in fact if I am probably
gonna do this in this case as well as
well as in the item l5 Pollock trap
because it really just helps for the
question was I can do this with markup
as well so whenever you I would now on
the other project would recompile our
markup just to write load as well it
doesn't matter as long as I would add in
a listener to the file and define I'm
gonna do the markup compilation first as
well this would work just as well so
what it also does is it takes away a lot
of the things that you need to do to set
up things scare falling
so besides grunge there's also grunt in
it grunt in it allows you to set up
projects in a very very quick way this
is also something that used to be part
of grunt but now what's moved out so it
can be to develop quicker on the side
and you don't have all those version
conflicts anymore so you install a brand
in it and this suddenly gives you
templates that you can use to set up
well grunt files
grunt plugins if you want to jQuery
plugins and noches and much much more
it basically allows you to create a lot
of things you can also create your own
templates so if you have a project that
you keep using over and over again
your basic thing create your own little
boilerplate actually there's a border
pie plug-in as well so let's have a look
kind of kill this again
and so I'm an example here
and it still has little left over let's
leave that first
because there's gonna be a lot more to
come in here
okay so I'm gonna do a grunt in it
jQuery because I'm going to create a new
jQuery plugin and it's going to start
asking me all kinds of questions so we
started earlier on the grunt file this
is going to be much much more again a
project name and we're going to call
this yeah another project title yes am I
going to use what he gives me
description of course is the best jrk
never it has a new version it has a
repository
it keeps asking and I can just confirm
because it's clever enough to take all
information it I have already defined it
make it configuration it knows me knows
my email does not know my URL and I'm
gonna define it's gonna be jQuery one
okay anything I need to change no I
don't
so what happened this happened
I created my full project scaffolding
for me now I gotta I mean actually using
this for everything that I'm doing in
terms of jQuery right now because it's
it's so complete in terms of things that
it needs so of course it created my
branch fell for me it created my
package.json for me and you can see all
the information I entered is there it's
all here but it also went ahead and
downloaded and installed jQuery for me
and the version that I find and it
created Java scripts a unit test for me
and downloaded E necessary library it
created already the jQuery scaffolding
for the module so I can just start it
right away
creating you actually already created
the methods for me as well and it also
created the tests for me which already
tests against this so this is something
that really pleases the lazy guy in
every one of us if you're writing jQuery
plugins you can actually focus on
creating your functionality rather than
everything
yes we did that this is what it gives us
