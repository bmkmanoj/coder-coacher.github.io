talk building a data science platform in
Scala my name is John digos and I'm CEO
and CTO of Precog and I look forward to
sharing our experiences over the past
couple years working with Scala on a
very large scale distributed project
first I'm going to talk a bit about what
Precog is so you can understand the
kinds of functional requirements that
went into building it and maybe a bit
more about why we chose to use Scala all
then dive into a high-level overview of
our platform's architecture so you can
see what's underneath the hood I'll talk
a bit about all the lessons we've
learned Precog is not a small Scala code
base as I'm about to show you and
building it we've encountered a lot of
issues some really great strengths in
Scala enable us to build code faster and
more stable and more robust and then
some other things in Scala or the
ecosystem kind of get in our way and
trip us up and I'm going to talk a bit
about each of those things in the
lessons learned section and then finally
I'm gonna conclude with sort of my
picture of what's on the horizon what's
the next step for Scala what's the next
step that would help us do an even
better job building Precog in the Scala
programming language what is Precog well
you can see there's a flashy graphic
showing a rocket ship
fundamentally Precog is a data science
platform what I mean by that well I mean
we make it very easy for you to store
data technically we deal with immutable
data so this is stuff like clickstream
data it's behavioral data transactional
data sensor data interaction data
activity data all that kind of data out
there that's measured or observed by
machines captured automatically as
opposed to human entered that is
persistent data and that's the kind of
data that Precog deals with and that's
very important because everyone's
probably heard of big data hype right
everything's big data every startup is a
big data startup everyone's into big
data these days but
never stops to talk about what is Big
Data
well if you go back 20 years the main
form of information was relational data
that humans entered into databases and
technically there's a name for this kind
of data it's called entity oriented data
it's immutable data it's like where you
live what's your credit card number who
do you report to in your organization of
course that kind of data hasn't gone
away and it's never gonna go away but
what started to happen around 15 20
years ago is storage became so
incredibly cheap or started becoming so
incredibly cheap that companies started
recording not just the current state of
entities in the real world or virtual
world but changes to those entities we
started recording when people click and
when they look at something when they
swipe an ATM card we started recording
when sensors are measuring things and
right now the majority of the
information created in the world is
actually not answered by humans it is
captured automatically by machines
machines who are observing us whether
it's your application or your phone your
web app your mobile app whatever it is
there's a huge amount of information
that's being created and and the reason
why this is rapidly exploding and soon
will account for most data in the world
is is quite simple because it's not
dependent on a human bottleneck so the
next five years the majority of
information in the world will in fact be
this persistent data records of
observations made by machines about your
behavior and the behavior of systems and
and so forth we make it easy to capture
that data we allow you allow you to mash
it up with other kinds of data I do
stuff like NLP or other kinds of things
that you might want to on ingest we
provide a statistic and implementation
of a statistically oriented query
language that our team don't call
quarrel that allows you to do data
science on that data without having to
care about the fact that that data may
be distributed on different clusters you
don't have to explicitly think about
your data science problems in terms of
how do I decompose this into efficient
operate
you can just concentrate on what you
want to do with your data and a large
part of our Precog code base is designed
to efficiently do that and then finally
we enable you to deploy that quarrel is
executable code inside your application
so you can build runtime features like
predictions or recommendations or
reporting or all kinds of interesting
things that you can do when you have the
ability to deeply analyze data why is
this important well right now with all
this data explosion of data it's really
really hard to analyze this data most
companies who are doing it are writing
code themselves on top of Hadoop
MapReduce jobs and using combinations of
law lots of different tools but this
needs to enter mainstream and it needs
to become far far easier to do this at
scale because data analysis will change
our world forever if you think of all
the applications from bioinformatics to
just on and on and on data analysis will
end up saving millions tens of millions
hundreds of millions of lives and
machine intelligence will change the
very nature of society in my opinion ok
this rocket doesn't want to go away yeah
ok so our goals in creating Precog were
to create something that's highly
performant massively distributed heavily
concurrent with a highly functional code
base because we like functional
programming it's easier to reason about
it's easier to test and then heavily
heavily tested because we're we're
positioning Precog as kind of an
operational data science platform that
you can count on to run 20s 24/7 the
correctness properties of Precog were
extremely important and we chose Scala
because it's a pretty good fit on just
about all of these goals we've had some
problems with a few of them and I'll
talk about my lessons learned section
but overall it's worked out quite well I
want to kind of give you a sense for how
big our project is so I've compiled some
basic statistics
40,000 mainline or 40,000 lines of code
in Maine 26,000 lines of code in test
about four years that's pretty big
especially when you consider that the
information density of Scala code is ten
times what it is in Java so you can add
another zero to all those numbers if
you're trying to think about what this
code base would look like in Scala oh
I'm sorry that's not Precog that's akka
which is a really great open source
project that we use the Scala code base
is actually quite a bit bigger and
created in less time these are the
libraries that we love to use we use
akka blue eyes daniels GLL parser
competitors SBT Scala Tech actually a
lot of our tests are written in Scala
check and that's worked out really well
for us
Scala z shapeless specs and spire this
is an overview of the architecture of
the platform we tried to make lists make
this design very modular and if you
caught Daniels keynote address earlier
all these are different modules actually
inside of every one of these modules
there's lots of different sub modules
and we essentially glue it all together
at runtime with the cake pattern which
has provided us an enormous amount of
flexibility were able for example to
plug in different backends so we have
Precog running on MongoDB and Postgres
sequel in addition to our own native
data store that's optimized for data
science so let's move on to the lessons
learned section lesson number one that
I'd say that that we've learned is that
Scala is a beast and I do mean that in a
good way it has a very powerful type
system one of our engineers for mark
that kind of once you get the type
signature right the function basically
writes itself and that's not exactly
true but I've seen and written enough
Scala to appreciate the sentiment behind
that oftentimes when you do write
with a complex type signature the the
definition of that function just falls
out naturally and so does testing it you
catch a tremendous number of errors at
compile time and that's very very
important the more errors we can catch a
compile time the more stable we can make
our platform of course you do have to
watch out for compiler crashes you can
Scala's type system is complicated
enough the implementation is complicated
enough that you can and in fact we we do
quite quite often crash the Scala
compiler that's something that you don't
often see in Java world the Java
compiler is very very simple compared to
the Scala compiler and it's rock-solid
as Daniel mentioned earlier in his talk
today Scala has a very powerful module
system that I really feel like it's just
being discovered it kind of takes a few
years before you know the idiomatic way
to do something in a new language and I
think we're still pushing the boundaries
of what's possible using traits as
modules it's a bit tricky as Daniel
mentioned earlier today with application
lifecycle management which we discovered
actually in the past two months and that
caused a couple weeks of pain and
suffering as we underwent a major
refactoring of the code base to bring
lifecycle management into the cake
pattern but I think we've got a grip on
that I don't think we've exactly figured
out the best way to do modules in Scala
but we've certainly been pushing the
boundaries and Scala has is has enormous
expressiveness so there's so many
different ways to do things and you can
do things so compactly you can solve
some problems just in a few lines of
code that would take you dozens perhaps
hundreds of lines of code in the
language like Java and on the drawback
side that kind of means that even if you
have a team full of Scala experts in the
building sometimes it's not always
obvious what the best way to do
something is and so we have to this day
actually we have kind of different Scala
code styles in our code bases we're
trying to converge on something that
makes sense for the whole whole code
base
okay so the Scala tooling is in need of
help and my first point to make here is
actually something we want to turn into
a t-shirt which is SBT lies and if
you've used SBT for a while you'll come
to appreciate its phenomenal incremental
compilation which saves you perhaps man
days Man weeks man years of of your life
compiling your Scala source code files
but at the same time it doesn't always
get things right it doesn't always get
the dependency resolution right and
sometimes SBT clean doesn't clean stuff
so we have wasted a huge amount of time
tracking down errors in our build system
our build which should be green and is
green sometimes sometimes goes red for
reasons that we can't control and we
trace a lot of these back down to SBT
the builds are slow Scala compiler is
not a speedy beast and if you use the
traits as modules as we're doing and you
use it extensively over your entire code
base you will find oh and hire kind of
types and all the other software using
you will find that compile times are
extremely long actually it takes longer
to compile our codebase it takes to do a
full compile it takes I can't remember
the time but it's many many minutes it
takes longer to compile it than it does
to run through quite literally tens of
thousands of tests including many
scholar check tests but you know on the
other side we really haven't noticed the
pain of being without an IDE in Java
I cannot cannot imagine life without an
IDE because every time you want to
rename something or extract some code
out it's like so much boilerplate and
you end up doing that a lot and in Scala
because the way encourages you to design
your code is this object-oriented
hierarchy but in Scala you design things
a bit different in a way that turns out
to need a lot less refactoring and you
have a lot of power available to you so
most of the members on our team actually
haven't missed an IDE all that much we
have people using VI people using Emacs
people using sublime
x2 Daniel of course uses J edit one of
the two users in the world to use J edit
for Scala but it's worked out really
well
another very interesting thing
especially probably for people coming
from a functional background is that
Scala is very good at functional
abstraction you might not think so but
you can actually do a lot of functional
abstraction in Scala we use
Scalzi our Scala said because it
abstracts out a lot of the common if you
will design patterns in functional
programming the documentation admittedly
could improve the naming of these
esoteric things could perhaps be
improved but the reality is when you're
doing functional programming you
encounter these patterns quite a lot and
it's nice to have ready-made
abstractions as well as implementations
for Scala said all over the place
so we we heavily use Scala Zed whenever
we can and whenever it makes sense to do
so and and we have several scholars that
committers on our team that said Scala
Zed is not designed for performance and
it makes the choice to use laziness
everywhere as well as it makes the
choice to write code or the
implementation of Scala said is written
in a very functional way which means
almost no duplication and use of you
know every every ounce of reusability
and abstraction you can find which is
great except that does have runtime
overhead so you have to be careful where
you use Scala said you use it in an
inner loop I can promise you're not
going to be writing performant code
higher kind of types have have proven to
be indispensable because they allow
abstraction at the type level and we use
that in numerous places we there's one
thing I'll talk about in a second
actually number three monads are
powerful our entire evaluator for
Quirrell which is the statistically
oriented query language runs in a monad
and it has it has been tremendously
useful we can swap that monad out
our test suite versus our production
suite so in our tests we can make
everything synchronous for example and
in our production code base everything
is in synchronous and uses lots of
threads and and and whatnot but for for
testing it's a lot easier to do it in a
synchronous fashion monads themselves
that despite their scary name and you
know the scary three Monad laws and all
that they are actually quite powerful
and very useful even in Scala which is
perhaps not the best language in the
world for monads we found that even the
IO monad which is how you do
side-effects in Haskell can be useful in
Scala and the reason for that is we have
a largely functional code base you you
kind of get in the mindset of thinking
that all your code is functional and so
if you start calling some function that
has a side-effect something bad will
happen probably I almost certain to
happen and one way of dealing with that
is to use the IO monad because it serves
as a reminder to a programmer that hey
this code has a side-effect and I'm
gonna have to run that at some point or
compose it together with with other
monads and eventually at the end of the
world run it it's very very useful and
we've actually eliminated a number of
bugs by using the IO monad just because
it enables you to more easily reason
about your code that said I don't think
the IO monad is the ultimate ultimate
solution for side effects in scallop due
to performance reasons and we at least
at this point in time monad transformers
even have been used extensively in our
code base and they'll allow almost a
form of aspect-oriented programming
where you're weaving features into your
code remember I said our evaluator runs
in a monad the entire thing runs in a
monad and we've been able to
independently add features just by
modifying the monad snack so for example
we wanted air handling we got we added
an error monad to that the evaluator
didn't change well it changed modestly
almost no lines of code were changed we
wanted the ability to inter
to query midway through the process we
added another monad to do that we wanted
the ability to run this synchronously
well that's just another monad so we
were able to without changing the
evaluator independently we've these
different features into that codebase
and it's it's beautiful it's extremely
powerful and youyou would not be able to
do that in in Java world without I mean
perhaps you could do it with aspect
oriented programming but even then it's
completely untyped safe and it blows up
run time for strange reasons it's hard
to do that at the statement level what
monad transformers provide you a way to
do is a way to weave all these different
features into the background of your
application without changing the code
and in a completely typesafe way and
yeah there's a little bit of boilerplate
there's little monad syntax is clunky
and Scala there's some type inference
problems but boilerplate that you can't
get wrong that the Scala compiler will
complain if you get it wrong is in my
opinion harmless boilerplate okay
Scala is good at functional abstraction
but let me tell you this the JVM is
terrible at functional abstraction first
off the JVM hates hates hates with a
passion functional composition and the
main reason for that is the so-called
mega morphic dispatch problem what
happens is if you're calling a function
in Java and that function is part of
some interface and there's only one
implementation let's say of that
interface then the JVM will eventually
learn that whenever you call that
function you're referring to a
particular concrete implementation and
it will be able to take the body of that
function and inline it into your code
this does two things it eliminates the
overhead of the virtual dispatch but it
also by bringing the body of that
function in into surrounding context it
permits the JVM to do optimizations
because it knows what's happening on
inside there and and it becomes suddenly
this black box thing that you
can't do any optimizations to something
that you can parallel lies and reorder
instructions and unbox do all these
really interesting things that you
simply can't do without it in lining and
unfortunately all Scala code bases that
are using functions are pathologically
mega morphic because all functions
inherit from function or function to or
function 3 or function 4 etc and there
are millions and millions of maybe not
millions but certainly tens of thousands
of these things in your Scala code base
and it completely prevents the JVM from
being able to optimize these things but
functional composition is is kind of one
of the pillars of functional program so
the JVM is saying don't don't write your
programs in a functional style
unfortunately similarly the JVM also
hates abstraction abstraction is all
about removing duplication and operating
at a higher semantic level but the more
abstraction you have in the JVM the more
overhead you have for example boxing is
is actually an artifact of abstraction
you want to be able to uniformly treat
int with float with other kinds of types
in your type system and if you abstract
over that the only way to do that on the
JVM is is to boxing so in summary even
though scholars is quite good at
functional abstraction the JVM is
absolutely terrible at it and it
actively rewards bad behavior and
punishes good behavior the better code
you write from a functional perspective
the worse it will perform on the JVM
which is very very sad in my opinion so
how do you live with the JVM Scala does
not have an alternate back-end it runs
on the JVM it'll probably always run on
the JVM how do you live with that
right now with tools and technologies
that exist well we found the following
pattern to work very very well in
production and it's to have a functional
composable top of your program so the
higher levels of your program everything
is purely functional and it's very very
composed composable you can compose
those units together but at the bottom
kind of in between and all your
different units of copies
everything is imperative or or
everything that needs to be is
imperative exposing a purely functional
composable interface and that's very
very fast it's it's highly optimized
handwritten code but the point is you
don't notice it a whole lot so when
you're working in the higher levels of
the program things are purely
declarative you can compose this compose
this and no side effects will occur but
as you dig deeper and deeper and deeper
you're gonna find yourself kind of in
traditional Java land where yes there
are side effects these things are being
wrapped up as pure interfaces and that's
pretty much the way you have to do it we
found this to work very very well over
the past year and a half so another
thing that you should be aware of is
that hiring for Scala is tricky of
course hiring for any software engineer
is tricky right today anyone can get a
job pretty much by snapping their
fingers because there's so much demand
for a software engineering talent but
hiring for Scala is even trickier I
would say number one you can if you want
hire Java engineers they'll know that
JVM and the JVM is its own is its own
thing you have to spend a lot of time
just to become good at writing software
on the JVM so that Java experience is
very very useful but it doesn't always
work out well and my experience here is
that longtime Java developers have the
Java programming mindset and the Java
programming mindset is kind of diametral
diametrically opposed to the Scala
programming mindset and if you hire a
Java programmer and you will write Scala
like he writes Java so what I would say
is if you choose to go down that path be
very careful and closely supervised and
closely supervise the that developer
unit you end up hiring and and don't
allow him to infect your codebase
because that that has happened to us
so Scala unfortunately has
a large ramped up curve just by itself
so I used to think that you know the
developer could probably learn Scala in
six weeks and then I bump that estimate
to three months and now I'm considering
bumping it up to a year to two years and
that's to achieve you know reasonable
proficiency if not be an expert in the
language I think that's much more
realistic now combined Scala ramped up
curve with the ramped up curve for
functional programming and and you're
looking at even more time so if you hire
a Java developer who's been writing
imperative code all day long and it's
gonna take even more time and then
finally there's there's always gonna be
something about your domain that's
probably unique to the developers you're
hiring unless you're just hiring
developers to do something that's very
very common in in industry like build a
website
um and that domain knowledge is yet
another source of ramping up and and for
us the domain knowledge is database
design theory and distributed systems
and concurrent programming and
programming language design and and all
these complicated things the ramp-up
curve for that is measured in months to
years if you add that to the Scala
ramp-up curve and the functional
programming ramp up curve
you're looking at a long long long time
ramping up so what I recommend well
first hire the Scala experts if you can
because they already know Scala they've
been through this they know how to write
Scala code idiomatic and hopefully
perform it too and necessary now keep in
mind if you do hire Scala experts you're
still looking at the massive domain
ramp-up curve for us that's massive for
some other companies it's probably not
going to be a significant factor my
second choice would be if I can't get my
hands on someone who's actively program
production Scala I'd hire a functional
programming engineer now I think the
drawback is if they've used for example
Oh camel or Haskell or languages which
don't penalize you so heavily for
functional programming then they're
gonna come into Scala and just be
shocked when they
right relatively simple program that
does not complete in the lifetime of the
known universe so but the functional
programming experience will be
invaluable it's an entirely different
way of thinking about solving problems
it takes a while to master so the other
option I'd say that as actually worked
pretty well for us is to hire smart but
very very junior engineers who don't
have a lot of real-world experience so
they're smart they learn fast the
biggest thing about them is that they
don't have to D train when you hire
someone who's been doing Java or
JavaScript or whatever imperative
language it is out there they've been
doing this stuff for years in some cases
ten years hire an old Java guy you could
probably find one who's been doing it
since the dawn of Java and every year
that they've spent writing code and that
style is another year they have to
unlearn so we've actually had good
experience hiring people who have not
written a lot of code at all but who are
really really smart and we found that
the Scala ramp-up is faster actually
than the old Java guys so what do I see
ahead for the future well I'm really
excited that supposedly Scala 2.11 will
be focused on performance looking
through the the tickets I don't see any
game changers in there but still it'll
be nice to have a release that squarely
focused at improving performance because
I want our team to be able to write more
functional code not just way up here but
but also down here because functional
code is easier reason about easy to test
fewer bugs it's more compact easier to
maintain but it's impossible to do that
pervasively and consistently in Scala so
I'm really excited that that finally
we're in ever release that's dedicated
to improving performance I'm also really
excited about improvements to the JVM
itself I think one of the biggest
benefits is just going to be lambdas in
Java because over time that's going to
yield lots of libraries using lambdas
which will in turn lead to performance
problems in Java and performance
problems in Scala like no one really
pays attention there's not
money behind that but performance
problems in Java are going to put
serious money behind the effort to make
that faster so I think lambdas in Java
is quite possibly the best thing that
can happen for for scholars own
performance in the long run
obviously we're getting stuff like
method handles we may or may not be
getting fixed noms and and I hope at
some point a lot of Java guys are
certainly aware of the problem with mega
morphic and lining and/or the
impossibility of doing that on the JVM
right now and at some point that's gonna
be addressed
I would hope especially with the
introduction of lambdas to the JVM so
macros also are really really
interesting and that's something that we
can use today is Scala 210 because with
macros you can do basically cogeneration
at compile time and what that allows you
to do is for things that have an
efficient solution they just have lots
of boilerplate and perhaps imperative
design you can factor that out into a
macro which is you know as cleanly
written and as purely functional as you
write as you like and then you can
generate that imperative boilerplate
code that's very very highly optimized
on at compile time which is very very
interesting and we expect we're not on
on 210 yet but we will be in the near
future and we expect to heavily make use
of macros for performance optimization
and another thing I'm keeping an eye on
is an effect system because I don't know
honestly if in the next five years
Scala will be so performant that you can
use arbitrary levels of monad
transformers at the level of your inner
loop I'm more more hopeful that the work
that's being done around a Scala and
effects system would would allow us to
tag methods as having particular effects
and this not incur runtime overhead but
provides some not all but a little bit
of the benefit of using monads and monad
transformers
okay so some code to play around with
copy down that URL if you can yeah
the first part of its easy is just just
github.com slash date he goes slash and
then there's a number at the end
therefore seven three nine five seven
three also check us out on the web at
Precog comm you can learn more about the
Precog platform okay so we are out of
time I want to thank you please do check
out that code in particular pay
attention to that joint signature
because it illustrates how if you think
about a problem differently you can
actually completely change the
performance characteristics of code in
Scala thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
