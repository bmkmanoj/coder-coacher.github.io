out of curiosity how many people have
you know watched talks and angular 2 saw
some stuff last Plus meetup or saw some
of the videos at ng-conf okay cool well
we're gonna do a bit we're gonna dive a
bit deeper into angular 2 tonight so we
know the basics which we're gonna do a
little crash course but we're also gonna
get deeper we're going to see how we can
do complex stuff with forms because
that's a lot of what we're doing is just
grabbing input from the user so my name
is David East I am a developer programs
engineer at Google and I work on
firebase team full time but a part time
project of mine that Google is doing the
developer experience for angular 2 which
is create documentation and trying to
make it like simple for everyone to
understand so if it's not easy
understand just let me know I don't try
to fix that so I give this little
disclaimer before every single talk and
I think it's kind of important angular 2
is an alpha it's changing I've given
about this is my fourth any other to
talk and every single time I'm giving
this talk of a talk I've had to update
my slides because the syntax changes you
know almost weekly so if you build
something in angular 2 from these slides
and then a week later it doesn't work
odds are it's not you it's the framework
has changed and it will continue to
change
so don't develop your angular don't
develop an app in production yet you
won't be very happy so the outline of
this talk is I'm gonna start doing an
angular 2 crash course because it's
pretty dependent on understanding form
so we're gonna just talk about the basic
stuff for angular 2 and then we'll dive
into forms we're gonna we're gonna
explore why forms are actually so hard
to write and that's gonna set the stage
of how angular 2 forms can help and then
at the end I'm gonna do a little bit of
live coding and we're gonna see them
actually in action so this is your
angular 2 crash course so angular 2
itself is written in typescript but that
does not mean that you have to write
your app in typescript I recommend it I
love
typescript but if you're an es5 or es6
kind of person that totally works
because typescript compiles down to both
es 5 in es6 so components is essentially
the mainstay of angular 2 everything
that you'll be building in angular 2 is
going to stem out of a component in this
case components or in all cases really
components allow us to break down our UI
into reusable pieces so we don't have to
code the same thing over and over for an
application and then a component angular
2 is sort of how you would think of a
directive in angular 1 at the end of the
day we're just creating a custom HTML
element and if you can see down here
that's what we have this component is
creating an HTML element called to do -
app and when angular sees that HTML
element it's going to know to fire off
the code above and this is how we define
the logic and the behavior of a
component so there's three main parts to
this component and so the entire code
block above is a component but there's
three parts and we're gonna go over each
one so then one of the parts is actually
one of the two of the parts here is
annotations so we have the component
annotation and the view annotation so
both of these annotations are in
typescript and they essentially describe
things about the component so in this
case we have a component or an
annotation component that says this
class right here it has a selector of to
do up and this is a CSS selector so we
saw on the last slide how we had to do -
app for the element this is how it knows
that that's the selector for it because
we have the component so it describes
information about the to-do app and how
we can locate the view that essentially
the template for the component that's
done with the view annotation and we
know that the URL property points out to
use that HTML so within these two little
annotations we can tell angular Rhian
tell angular what our selector is and
where our view is and we don't have to
do any crazy sub classing or anything
like that it's just really easy to
decorate on top of a class but you don't
have to do this like I said you don't to
do it in typescript you can do this in
es5 and it's still pretty simple in es5
there's no classes in es5 but we do have
constructor functions so that's why I
say function to do app
and then right here I'm going to attach
my annotations why they saying to do app
on the constructor function dot
annotation that equals an array where I
Estancia the new the new annotations
with the same properties I did before so
it's still quite easy to do this in es5
it's it's a little more succinct when
you do it with the annotations syntax
but it just really comes down to your
preference so that's the first two parts
which is the view and the component
annotations then the last part is the
controller and the controller is the
backing of our template essentially when
you write your template and you call the
properties and functions from your
template everything that you can call is
because it's on your component
controller so in this case we have a
component called a controller called to
do app and the first thing is a property
and it's a string array and so this is a
type with typescript it's one of the
cool features of tight script and we
have a constructor where we initialize
this string array and we also provide a
function called add to do we ensure that
the user passes an extreme value and we
push it onto the to do array well it's
pretty simple but like I said you don't
have to do this in typescript and it's
still pretty succinct when you do any is
fine we have a constructor function we
initialize the two dues and then we just
onto the prototype of our constructor
function we create our add two new class
we don't have types but it's still
pretty easy to do so that's how you
write a component but it doesn't really
tell you how to deal with the template
so we have a specific template syntax
for angular 2 and there's three main
features that I'm gonna talk about
there's lots of cool stuff but if you
understand these three things you'll go
pretty far event Euler to so there's
local variables event handlers and
property bindings and it may sound scary
but the code is almost shorter than the
definitions so right here we're creating
a local variable local variable up top
on a text box so we have an input and we
get a hashtag of text box and
essentially what this does is it creates
a local variable of this Dom element
inside the template so it doesn't bleed
out to any other templates or anything
like that it's just local to
template and from I can use that inside
of this button so in this button I'm
registering the event with the
parentheses so I'm saying parentheses
click that's I could do parentheses any
Dom events I need actually any custom
event I registered to its able to
evaluate it to any available event
that's registered to the Dom so when
this button is clicked I'm gonna call
the add to new function which we
specified in our component controller
because our component controller has all
the properties and all of the functions
that we can use in our view and I'm
gonna pass through the ad to do function
the textbox is value because that's just
like saying document dot get element by
ID and getting back the Dom element
because I'm directly talking to a
textbox there and then from here I can
now whenever I click it's going to
update whatever is in the textbox and
just to show you the property binding I
can use this array brackets and I bind
to an actual property of the Dom element
and this is not an attribute so an
angular 1 we bound to attributes but in
angular 2 we bind to the Dom property so
this is just like grabbing the Dom
element and then calling any of the
methods on it and most of those meth or
any of the methods or any of the
properties because most of those
properties are not available from the
attribute so in this case I'm binding to
the inner text and that's whenever the
text box updates
it'll look they be inner text of my div
so just to bring it all back together
and paint the overall picture we have
the component annotation which gives us
the CSS selector we have the view which
tells us where our template lives and we
have our component controller which
gives us the backing of all the stuff in
our view so congratulations you are now
all now experts at angular 2 you know
just as much as me all right so and so
now that we understand how angular 2
works in a nutshell we're gonna talk
about forms so forms are essentially
what are the only outlets we have to the
user as developers we need to get input
from the user and forms is essentially
all we have we have text boxes and
there is and stuff like that and that's
really good that we can get values from
the user but the problem is is that we
can actually never trust the user
because the user even if they're not
being malicious it's likely to fill out
your form wrong so we have to trust that
that we have to trust that the user is
not going to do the right thing and this
is what really makes forms hard when we
can't trust the user we have to code all
this complex logic into our forms and
then that requires a lot of testing
because we have crazy if statements and
all this business logic baked into the
forms so we have to make sure that it
actually works in forms aren't actually
static the user answers them over a
period of time so the form is in
different states as the user updates it
even a specific character can completely
change the entire state of the form so
with complex logic one control can keep
can be dependent of an another control
another controls logic so like a
cascading drop-down list if I select
country that's going to give me all the
states and if I select state that might
give me all the towns and so the town is
dependent all the way back up to the
country and if I reset to another
country it might change everything down
on the cascading list and so that can be
pretty complicated too to keep updated
and then the user can also answer your
form in an ad hoc manner you may have
designed it for them to go one through
four but they may answer 4 to 3 than one
and then when they're answering
something on 4 it's gonna update
something on - that doesn't really
wasn't supposed to be updated then so
it's gonna cause an error and they're
gonna freak out and they're not gonna
know what's going on and you're gonna
tell them well can you please go 1 2 3 4
they won't so the user is constantly
triggering different arrow states that
we have to handle so we write tests but
testing is actually really hard with
forms because our logic is completely
coupled to their to actual our UI so we
have to compile our templates and write
end-to-end tests which aren't really
that fun because they're not isolated
from the Dom so they're so they run slow
and if you're a BDD or
tdd person then that's automatically
violates all the principles of having
isolated and fast tests and also with
forms we deal with changes over time so
we might be checking a response to the
server so we might check to see if the
username exists and we also might be
checking to see if they've gone over on
a max length and we're counting their
characters to see how much they have
left and each one of these things can
trigger another one and mix it hard to
keep track so those are the three things
that make difficult about forms and
angular 2 forms looks to solve three of
these these three problems so nearly two
forms itself is an external module so
it's like the router how you currently
have to import the router as a
dependency in angular 1 and you'll do
that in angular 2 the forms is the same
way you import forms if you want to use
them but if you don't want to use them
you it's not required it's not thrown
upon you but and they're pretty useful
so angular 2 forms tackles the three
problems we have okay we tackle complex
logic and testing and evaluating changes
so we're gonna go over each one of these
pieces so the smallest piece of angular
forms is called a control and this just
represents a single input so something
that gathers a value from the user and
it's pretty easy to create so this is
what the API looks like I'm going to
create a new control by saying bar named
control is a new control and then you
give the initial value the screen David
and then I can grab its value by saying
name control that value and then now
they I can check the state with similar
properties that you're used to with
angular 1 I can see if it's valid by
just calling dot valid I can check to
see if it's been changed by calling
dirty I can see if it's not been changed
with pristine and I can even get the
errors from the errors array and even
count up the numbers so it's easy to
represent a single control but like we
said controls are dependent on each
other so we're never just doing one
control we're doing an entire form and
so this so this is why there is a
control group which is a collection of
forms and it allows us to maintain the
overall state of the form so a control
group is made up of control
we'll create a variable called group and
say new control group and then from
there I have an object literal where the
keys are the names of my controls and
the value are the actual control so the
full name is a new control and I give my
full name right here and then I also can
supply a optional validator and this is
actually what tells the control whether
it's valid so when I say got valid and
it says true or false
it caught stems from this right here and
we're gonna get a bit more into how
those are used but this is how you
supply them in the API for a control
group is actually almost identical to
the API have a single control so if we
want to see if the entire form is valid
I can say group valid and that'll tell
it'll evaluate all of the controls in
the group and I can see it's been
changed with 30 pristine and grabbed the
errors so everything I can do on a
single control I can value eight for the
entire group which makes it easy when
we're dealing with controls that depend
on each other because it's the sum of
all of the value of the state of the
form and if you thought that syntax was
really verbose we heard you and we
created the form builder class which
essentially makes it easier to provide
shorthand API to create a formula so
right here will create a builder and
we'll then call the group function on
the Builder and this takes an object
literal and to the left is the name of
the control the key and the value is an
array and they're already essentially
represents a control so rather than
saying new control like you saw in the
previous slide we can just provide an
array with the initial value and whether
it has a validator so speaking of
validators they're essentially functions
that encapsulate your forms custom logic
so the validator you saw was dot
required
so essentially and make sure that
someone supplied something that's a
pretty simple one and we can do you can
create your own validators by just
creating a function there's a couple of
requirements to do this but there
pretty easy the first requirement is you
have to have it taken a control so this
isn't typescript because I'm expecting a
control but you can just erase the :
control and it works in JavaScript you
just have to expect that the parameter
takes it as control now whenever if we
want to say that the control is valid we
return null but if it's not valid we're
gonna return an object literal and this
object literal is going to have keys
which are the errors so in this case
this is called the not blank validator
now I'm checking to make sure is that
the user is not providing empty string
and so I check it right here if C value
is equal to the empty string let's
return the errors and so I'm returning
the error not blank is true but if it is
something that's just not the empty
string I'll return null and it's valid
now when I want to use the control I
just say if our control is a new control
provide an initial value and then I just
put not blank as the second parameter
and at this point I could call control
valid and it wouldn't it would be about
control because I provided an exam
initial value of Hello but if I set it
back to the empty string it would be
invalid so it's extremely easy to reduce
the complexity of your controls logic by
using validators so this chunk of code
right here is an entire component using
a form a control group that is so we
import all the relevant information so
the first one this is all es6 module
syntax right here
and so we're importing things from Ã¡youÃ¡
to the usual suspects of being able to
boot strap your component your view and
then the second import is from angular 2
forms because forms are required so I
have to import them from an external
module and so these are the things that
you'll usually be using with forms so I
do my component my view and then I
create my controller in my controller
I'm gonna provide a forum which is a
control group and then right here in the
constructor you'll notice a bit of
dependency injection because right here
I'm not
applying a concrete instance of form
builder but angular 2 is going to look
at the type of form builder and know to
instantiate a new one for me it's okay
dependency injection angular 2 is all
done through the constructor so inside
of here I now have a form builder so I'm
going to create my group builder that
group and I have a full name a username
and favorite color and the full name the
user name are acquired whereas the
favorite color is not and they all have
blank initial values so now that I have
a component I can test it and it's not
dependent on any Dom we haven't even
written a single HTML element and we're
gonna write a test for our controls but
the testing is really easy we're writing
four lines of code to do a test so right
here we're going to create a form
builder that we're going to eject into
the or just provide into the app
component is which we created on the
previous line and now in previous slide
and now that I have an app component I
know that the initial state is invalid
because if you look at the component
when we're creating this dot form equal
its builder group we have two required
validators but the initial value is an
empty string so they're not they're
there and they're required so we have an
initial state of an innovative initial
invalid state so we can use console dot
assert which is just provided in every
single browser and so it's nothing
nothing fancy didn't go to and we say
console dot assert we have the app
component which I forgot my CMP but apt
up form dot valid equals false and so
this assertion will pass because my form
isn't an initial valid state so my first
unit test it works now if I wrote it
wrong and I said I'm going to cert that
the initial value is valid which is not
now desertion will fail so in just a
couple of lines of code I'm running my
tests against the control and it's
isolated from the Dom and this will run
fast because I don't have to compile a
template and speaking of templates we'll
go over the template syntax for forms so
we went over property bindings and
property bindings also work for
these of the Dom element but you also
can bind to properties of a component so
how we create our own component and we
have given values or give it give it
properties we can bind to those
properties so in this case we're gonna
bind to a property called control group
which is given to us through angular 2
forms and I'm going to give it the value
of form which is the form property in my
component controller just to make that
clear as you can see right here this is
the property we're binding to and we set
it up right here when we build it so
that's what we're binding to when we say
control that group equals 4 so I'm
setting up I'm setting up the binding
for my view what I want to bind to my
elements as well so I'm gonna create a
textbox and I'm going to bind to the
control property which is also provided
to you by angular 2 forms and I'm going
to say form dot controls dot full name
and at that point I have bound the
updates to this control so whatever this
is updated that will be reflected in the
form if there's any validators on that
control that will be computed every time
they update well that might kind of seem
long having to tap into form dot control
stuff full name so there is a decorator
this isn't an attribute so you don't see
array brackets around it or a property
binding it's what's known as a decorator
we kind of create a custom attribute
that does you know powerful magic and at
this point I can take the control and I
bind it to full name and this decorator
is super smart and the decorator knows
that it's within the form group called
form so it will find my full name
control for me so that's how you do just
a simple control group but control
groups can also contain control groups
so they're nested because a lot of times
we have to separate out the concerns of
our forms a really good example of this
is an address so this is the same form I
had before and now I'm going to create a
nested group called address because I
would like
to know if they address it's valid and
so I provide all the usual suspects the
street street line to city state zip and
then down here at the bottom I can check
to see if the entire address is valid by
saying group that controls that address
not valid so I can evaluate just the
address on the form and I can do some
other things with that I can tell the
user like you have this part of the form
down just right but this part of the
form is invalid and so I can essentially
by using nested groups I can separate
out the concerns in my form and this is
how I would look in a template so we
have the control group of form which we
establish at the top and then we're
doing the single controls full-name
username and now I'm going to nest the
nest I'm going to use a control group
decorator which is similar to the
control group before
the control group decorator know is that
I have a nested group called address so
now I'm inside another control group and
then I can just call all the controls
for the address so just like that
everything is bound it's pretty easy and
for dealing with changes over time we
have something that's called observables
so how many people here are familiar
with observables and I've used the
observables who for so a couple people
so how many people here are familiar
with promises yes we have a whole
roomful of people so when a lot of
people when they came into angular 1
they probably never use promises before
and then they learn promises and saw
that it was a really solid way to
structure asynchronous flow of your
application it's guaranteed that it's
gonna fire off that one time what
there's sometimes you don't want it to
fire off just one time we want the one
time is good for things like I know my
data has loaded from the server or I
know this event is now finished and
that's good for one-time events but
observables deal with asynchronous
events that are in a stream of data so
as you're constantly receiving something
from a server it'll fire off that update
or as I'm updating a text box on a key
value or key up without event I will
keep giving me that value so observables
are first class citizens in angular 2
they come from the rx library which is
if you're familiar with
the whole rx exported across many
different languages and platforms and so
with observables I'm going to create a
just the blink control and I'm going to
create a reference to firebase and for
those of you familiar firebase it's just
it's a little location in cloud land or
I'm gonna be able to save my data and
that's very much under putting it but
for the time being
and so I'm gonna say control dot value
changes dot subscribe and so now what
I'm doing is I'm subscribing to any
changes that happen on the form so
anytime it's value changes from that's
whether I'm typing into a text box or
someone updated that control it's going
to fire off this function every single
time something changes and in this case
I'm taking the firebase reference and
I'm saving the value of to the database
so every time someone does something
it's just going to intercept that change
and it's going to update it for me so
that pretty much is the core of angular
2 forms so I'm going to see you here
that's right I'm going to do a little
bit of live coding and I'm gonna try to
do with one hand so this is gonna be
really interesting so what I'm doing
right here is I'm importing two things
oh wow you cannot read that yeah really
hold that down alright it's that good so
you can't see it just let me know so at
this point I'm importing the usual
suspects from angular angular angular
forms and the first thing you do when
you build an angular app is you create a
component so I'm gonna do another little
snippet that's gonna create me a
component so now I have a component and
I'm gonna give it a selector of app and
then I'm going to name the controller
app and then from here I need to specify
actually need to export it out to the I
need to so
tastehh so this is pretty much the
basics of doing an angular 2 app you
import your needed services from angular
or your modules you use your component
your component annotation your view
annotation and your component controller
and then you export it out so angular
knows to run it and so this is the main
main thing that you do so I'm going to
go up to the template now and I'm going
to say just get a little that's right it
won't do that in here
and give all h1 and say hello all right
so I'm running this inside of angular 2
source so I got out actually buildin
that takes up a hot second so as that's
building I'm actually gonna start making
some changes I'm gonna have to put this
down
and it okay cool so I'm refresh its
loading loading hello
so up to the top right you can see all
of it so we just wrote it into out
that's pretty cool so at this point now
I'm gonna give I'm going to create my
form so I have a form property right
here I'm going to tap to it by saying
this top form
and I created a group and the group
takes in an object literal with all my
forms so I'm just gonna create a simple
one called name and from name I'm gonna
give it the array brackets and I'm going
to say its initial value is the empty
string I'm gonna give it a validator and
I'm gonna make sure it's the required
validator so this one I have one control
within my control group so I want to
specify that and my template and this
template right here is just basically
being able to do an in-line template I'm
using es6 backticks that allow you to do
multi-line strings so at this point I'm
gonna create a div and give it a control
group
so I set up a control group property
binding and then now I want to bind a
text box and give it the control
decorator I'm going to set that to name
and then we can actually bind the
changes so I'll say four dots controls
now thank the Lord for autocompletes
formed up controls
now I'm gonna run the old event again
it's gonna take a hot second so I'm
building directly from angular2 source
here which is essentially doing it get
clone of angular slash angular on github
and then doing an NPM install and then
running a gulp task and Mac essentially
allows me to build inside of there so
now I did say value did I
I did say value and that doesn't that's
just not the same effect so we'll have
to wait another eight ten seconds it's
doing probably like twenty to thirty
different things that I don't actually
need but I don't know what courts to cut
so sounds loading and I'm going to type
in a name and as I type we have the
binding so that that's pretty cool and I
would have bind to different stuff it's
all pretty easy and simple but let's do
some cool stuff with validations so we
have inside of the HTML I'm actually
importing Twitter bootstrap up top and
Twitter bootstrap has cool CSS Styles
allow us to do like cool validation
States so I'm going to bind to those I'm
gonna give it a class first I think it's
called form group
and now I'm gonna do something that's
pretty cool so I'm gonna bind to the
class property of the Dom but I'm gonna
do something kind of cool and I'm going
to bind to an actual single class so I
can say has success which is a Twitter
bootstrap class I said has success and
that is equal to whether the form dot C
form dot valid C yeah I think that's it
formed its form doc controls how I want
to see if the name is balanced re
cheated form doc controls that name I
knew I was doing something wrong
so we'll get a nice little green
highlight if we are valid but if we're
not valid as swear as another class
called has air and we can just negate
that and at this point we have the div
but we need the text box so I expected
you to do this a lot faster
give it a name alright so now we have
bound to the control who's gonna cheat
so we don't build I need to give it this
fancy little class it's not good all
right so it's built so essentially all
we did here is we bound to single
classes we're saying if the control is
valid let's give it a cool little green
thing if it has an error let's give it
red states and we're binding to the name
within the form and we're Bilt's refresh
the page and so it's initially red
because out of the gate is required so
it's not there but okay if I type it
turns green so just like that I can do
other things too I can put in
essentially as you know an NG if
statement to say whether it's valid to
give it an error message and all that
kind of stuff
so what I'm also going to do now is I'm
going to show some stuff with the
observables so at this point I'm going
to just I'm gonna make sure I'm in scope
because of asynchronous module loading
I'm gonna put in a debugger statement
I'm actually gonna put one and we're
going to build so what we're going to do
is we're going to show how this works
actually you can write this in the
browser it's not just this bill process
isn't doing a ton of magic and some
friends it is but not for what we're
doing
so I'm refresh and I'm gonna hit a
debugger so the first tip bugger is
outside of our console so I'm gonna
actually show how you can do the test
so I'm creating our app component which
as we know takes in a form builder so
you app components and I've app and
right off the bat I can call a foreign
property I can see if it's valid it's
not valid so I could do a console dot
search
and that assert fails because it's not
valid and then also let's just run
through skip we're inside of our app
component right now as you can see class
app component so inside of the app
component I'm going to show how
observable observables work so I have
this dot form and I can call the name
are gonna call controls and I could call
the name property and then do the value
changes so I can
now you changes and then I can subscribe
and this will take in a function
so now I've set a subscription so play
it through and then now as I start
typing it all updates in the console I
can listen to changes so you can do so
we can monitor the changes as they
update
so that's angular 2 forms if you have
any questions essentially I should do a
recap angular 2 forms essentially allows
us to abstract away complex logic easy
testing that's independent of the Dom
and we can easily observe changes as
they happen over time with a pretty
simple API so thank you all for coming
out tonight if you have any questions
and you're more than happy to answer
them actually one of the guys who wrote
angular 2 mr. Victor self Candice
sitting back there so everyone awkwardly
all stare at him at once right now all
right glad we got that out of the way so
thank you so much so the question was
he's he has seen template annotation and
human attention he wants to know what's
the difference between the two and when
you use one a month ago you use template
and then now you use view because we
renamed template to view so they're the
same thing the syntax always changes
that's so the example was he's self as
if code and the address and how would
that be valid in that just had a
required validator on it but you could
write a zip code you zip code validator
something like that and you can compose
multiple validators together you don't
know you're not just locked into using
one so the question is about do we use
the constraints of html5 form says in
like saying like how you have email type
is email and stuff like that yeah
everything those are so hTML is
considered like a primitive inside of
angular components so you can build that
up for the inputs I was creating I could
provide a type of email and that would
have worked as well
that's all right well thank you all for
coming out tonight and thanks to
everybody I go to parks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
