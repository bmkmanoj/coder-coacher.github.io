aware of the fact that i am the last
thing standing in between you and beer
so i will try not to i will try and
break the habit of a lifetime and not
hopelessly overrun but if i do which
sadly is almost inevitable please start
throwing things at me and so one quick
thing before i start i am probably more
than usually technically changed today
because as ever i punish myself by using
use insisting on using linux and it
always means that every time i try and
connect my laptop to a projector
something goes horribly wrong so
thankfully i've been able to borrow
another linux laptop from from lars he's
very kindly loaned it to me but it has a
german keyboard plus plus plus plus it's
not it's not my usual set up and i've
just i've just fortunately fortunately
all my presentation was was a github
project so I've just been able to clone
it and recompile it so hopefully
everything will be alright and but yes
please if things are more than usually
bumbly and please bear with me ok so um
my name is mar 7 and as some of you may
know i am yet another Precog person as
of around june this year and i'm gonna
be talking about my my ongoing project
to torture and mutilate the scalar type
checker called shapeless and what i'm
going to show you today is some new
stuff that we can't do just yet it is it
is it is exploiting our the new hammer
which is macros but it's a newer isn't
even you a bit of the new hammer which
is specifically implicit macros and
untied macros which currently only
exists in the macro paradise Fork of
Eugene Bull Marcos Scala Kepler fork
which is basically the testing ground
for new features in Scala macros and
actually fact this one crucial feature
that I relied on that actually didn't
work until Wednesday of this week
because there was a
kind of feature I was trying to use it
looked good to me everything seemed to
be fine except I tried doing something
which triggered the the the the macro
that I the type macro that I defined
sorry the implicit micro that I defined
and was faced with a huge and ugly
looking stack trace on the console
ending in a triple ? not implemented
error actually the bits of the implicit
macro API that I needed to use to get
this stuff to work and Eugene hadn't
quite got around to it so I sent him a
desperate email say hey Eugene any
chance of you any chance of you actually
implementing this I could really I could
really do with this before friday
because i needed for my talk and he was
back within within a couple of hours for
a fix and it was it's kind of a
relatively mind it's sort of just
elaborating stuff but anyway the big
disclaimer is that none of this is
available in a released skylar compiler
whatsoever not even to 10 it's not even
on it's not even on on the 211 snapshots
yet it's macro paradise only there is
absolutely no guarantee that implicit
macros will make their way into into
Scylla ever in fact and III think
possibly one of the things I really want
to try and do is get enough people
interested in implicit macros that that
there will be a riot if they don't get
included in in Scala in scale of proper
okay so this this code is almost
entirely going to be repple sessions and
and and encode I have one slide which is
this one and so if anybody is actually
interested in just just cloning that get
get repository if you want actually have
a look at code on your own machine while
I'm talking then please do otherwise
that's that's that's useful info for
later okay so let's get going
right so um what I'm going to show you
basically is a way of exploiting
implicit type and implicit macros to
make some of the techniques that I've
been exploring in shapers already just
that little bit more useful and
tractable so in a sense nothing i'm
going to show you right now is entirely
new most of the things i'm going to show
you today are things which have been
possible to do in shapeless using using
the kind of tight level programming
stuff that it's known for for for quite
some time now but i'm just going to do a
very very quick demonstration of some of
the some of the infelicities of that
mechanism it's it's very nice in the
sense that that obviously it cuts with
the grain of the type system we have a
nice interesting formal theory of how
how how the various kinds of type level
artifacts i'm i'm working with interact
with each other how they relate to each
other so that's that's great so it's
something that we can reason about very
very straightforwardly on the other hand
macros they're kind of the imperative
version of type level programming in a
sense so in the full of loops and go
tues and sort of mutable state as
opposed to the beautiful sort of
declarative logic programming style of
type level program which is the way it
really should be done but the flip side
is is the same flip slide that in a way
perhaps even more so that we're used to
which is that you know sometimes you pay
an abstraction and performance cost so
there are there are ways that you can
you can you can cut corners using using
macros that that make for dramatic
improvements so what I what have what
I've been trying to do and what I've
been trying to explore in within playing
around with implicit macro see if
there's some way that we get the best of
both worlds if we can get the if we can
get the the the the performance benefits
of using macros combined with the the
the reason the reasoning kind of
benefits that we get from from from
using more more straightforward simpler
tight level programming that that I've
been looking at before so okay I'm going
to very very quickly show you the
problem or at least one of the problems
and I'm going to demonstrate this in the
context of type level type level
arithmetic type level arithmetic kind of
may seem a little bit obscure and
abstruse and perhaps not incredibly
useful but there are things that you can
do with it which I think are quite
useful and in the sense this is one of
the poster children of the dependently
type programming revolution the idea of
having vectors or collection types which
have their size statically encoded in
their type and so this is this is
already present in shapeless this works
on SCADA 292 but it's clunky and we'll
see in a second just how clunky it is
and so let's do a couple of crook inputs
lost underscore again I've got it there
it is well the problem with that is that
then the key doesn't correspond to the
to the I've tried that already it
doesn't help it's worse it's actually
it's actually worth right okay sorry
have I miss something no so and so Scott
so check this has tight level natural
numbers these these are encoded as a
sort of piano numerals so it's it's we
start with zero we have we checked me
out as well as a type level for me we
also have a value level form as well so
this is this is this is the value level
form of of the natural number zero and
you can see it's type is shapeless and
shape your stock nap underscore 0 and
its value is some anonymous value of the
nat type and so we can continue on with
with these underscore prefixed a natural
number values up to I think I go up to
22 for some obscure reason i can't
imagine exactly sorry yes citing the
window up slightly yes what I care what
I what I think i can do is probably this
does that help periodically I will do
that and hopefully yeah every time it
sort of drops below the level the chairs
please somebody shout out now i'll try
and head back to the top okay so and so
we have this slightly clunky including
of clunky encoding of natural numbers
here and they have to be explicitly
defined they're defined in terms of what
0 0 is just our initial value of on that
type but then everything else is encoded
as successor of success of all successor
of so this is nested type constructors
and then a corresponding value level
representatives of those things so if we
actually look at value 1 you can see
that its successor of nat 0 we look at
value to
successor of successor etc etc I think
well its successor of nap one which is
so NAT one is successor of Nazi row so
it's a kind of a recursive piano
arithmetic kind of definition of natural
numbers ok so um and so these these are
just sort of type level and value level
correlates of natural numbers can we
actually do anything useful with him
well the answer that I have already
answered sorry that I've already given
is that yes we can we can use implicit
resolution to effectively do do do
proofs and simple arithmetic sorry
proofs arisen I there's something must
be wrong the compiler is doing math
that's not allowed is it ok so let's
let's see if we can ask the compiler to
do some where's why yes got it oh not
quite almost got it no
sorry ah left yes no this one yes got it
okay cool okay so we can do we can ask
the compiler to prove for us that three
plus five is eight it's an incredibly
complex proof like so so here we are
using comedy as a comma 358 just close
whoops wrong above oh yes d thank you so
nice when people use your code and they
actually know it better than you do
that's great okay so and so what's
happened here is that on the basis of a
whole bunch of implicit definitions
actually recursively defined implicit
definition though there is available a
an implicit witness for the fact that
three and five makes a diff we would try
it with a different value like so that's
not going to work there isn't there is
no corresponding implicit value here now
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not
going to go into too many details as to
exactly what the implementation of this
is but if you anyone who's kind of
familiar with the sort of the recursive
definition of addition in piano
arithmetic will probably get some idea
that what we're doing is we're kind of
like recursing down one value and kind
of like counting up another and and the
first thing that should immediately hit
you in terms of at least compile time an
addition is going to be what o n in the
size right okay now now that the next
thing is of course is once we've got
addition we probably want to have
multiplication as well so let's try
multiply 3 x and that whoops I'm just go
for
full and and that should be under school
12 oops sorry yeah yeah cool okay so
that works as well now the definition of
multiplication in piano arithmetic is
kind of Dudley recursive and so this is
basically Oh N squared in the size of
right so aside from the fact that what's
quite soon we're going to run out of
explicit numerals I mean we could keep
on going by just applying the successor
type constructor as long as we like
until we get bored but is this is very
very very irritating and ideally we
would prefer to have a rather tercer and
more natural form of expression aside
from the fact we're going to run out of
numerals quite soon we also have a
little bit of a problem and if well
let's see what can we do here let's just
actually want okay well in fact if I if
I use that if i use the prod type class
instead and that actually hides away the
result type so let's just check that
this I should have tested this before I
came on yeah that's that's fine okay so
what was that what this is saying is
that it can find it's not actually going
to tell us I don't think in this context
what the product is but it has at least
produced a witness for that so let's
let's just try multiplying well let's
let's just keep doing squares and see
how long we can go before smoke starts
coming out of the back of a laptop so
that's seven by seven I think it's kind
of notice to be getting a little bit
slower with each one yes I think it is
isn't it
definitely Weiss lyst let's get a bit
faster let's try yes okay so a bit
further let's try 20 squared I actually
think this is this is this is this is
quite good i can remember something
someone else was experimenting the type
of encodings of natural numbers and i
thought i think i think their
implementation only got up to you know
eight squared or something like that so
i think the fact that i could actually
do 40 20 squared in this must be a
pretty good laptop okay so this is but
this is I've run out I've now run out of
intellectuals after this one oh that's
as far as it goes but as you can see
basically compile times in this kind of
setting they just blow out horrendously
so it's kind of it's kind of not very
practical and four four four four real
uses okay so we've got two problems that
we've seen and and one of them is clunky
literals the other one is is just
horrible horrible compile times for any
kind of non-trivial type of what
arithmetic and so what I'm going to show
you now is some nifty things I've been
able to do with with a combination of of
tight macros and it listen Mac Rose
which will fix both of these problems so
and the first thing I want to do before
I do that is I just want have very
briefly introduce singleton types sorry
I'm being just adapt that I'm not close
enough to the microphone so singleton
sides kind of a quick show of hands who
here is familiar with singleton type
since carla that's a pretty good
proportion actually that's great and ok
so singleton types are basically types
which have precisely one inhabitant so
rather than being say the type integer
which contains all of the integers you
might have the singleton type of one
which contains precisely and only the
the integer 1 so it will be a type error
for example to ascribe the type the
singleton type of one to the value to
and so Scarlett actually has singleton
types and unfortunately it doesn't have
them well it does have them across the
board it has them with respect to all
types all types have a corresponding
singleton tides unfortunately doesn't
have syntax to express them with respect
to too literal values so there's no way
Scarlett type checker represents
internally singleton types for integers
but you just can't you can't you can't
just express that in scarlet surface
syntax and and but basically that's that
they are going to be very very useful
for us and we're going to use those to
to replace our our piano numerals just
want to do one very very very very quick
illustration of what what a singleton
type will do for you so that's let's do
something like though who is equals yes
let's I'll do it with a string but
further this is I'm kind of cheating a
little bit with this so if I now do Val
bar is of type food type so this is the
singleton type off of value foo
crucially it's not actually the
singleton type of the literal string foo
whoops if I sign something to it that
compiles but if I were to try to assign
some other string like that that doesn't
compile anymore so you can see you can
see the expected type here is is it's
the singleton type of food so food type
and what it's actually found is is is is
a string bar interestingly enough the
compiler is actually mentioning and a
singleton type of strings here so this
this type string and then open brackets
quotes bar close bracket is actually the
type of the compiler really does know
that that string literal does have under
the hood but it won't let you write that
in any way I mean what you would really
like to be able to do is there's
something like food type so this is this
is this is this is not allowed
other than in an experimental branch of
scala see that Paul Phillips put
together inspired by Jeffrey Washburn
which is great stuff I would love to I
would love to see this this in the
Scarlet language proper but again this
is this is something else which isn't
there however however we can use type
macros to rectify this terrible omission
so that's because okay so a tight macro
if you I mean most of the uses that
people talk about for tight macros are
things like type providers so the idea
is basically you've got a type macro is
like a like a like an ordinary def macro
except that it can occur in locations
where you would normally expect a type
to be but type macros can also be
parametrized they can be parameterize
with types but they can also be
parametrized with values and the normal
reason for doing that will be bought at
least perhaps the most common reason I
think most people are thinking of is
that you might parameterize a type
provider wither with a with a with a
file path or a URL or something to or
some sort of connection details for a
database so that the type macro can go
scaring off to the file system or URL or
a database to extract some kind of
schema information to synthesize
synthesizer type on the fly but we're
not restricted to that we can we can
that we can instead and use type makers
to do other things so let's let's just
bring some of the stuff into scope
in what in what follows all of the S
prefixes that you're going to see here
are short for really that's worrying did
I check out the wrong branch crap
hey yeah I could point
can I tab does it why do you think
this is a different machine because I
couldn't get my machine to talk to them
ah right ok cool so I've forgotten
something what if I've got and Oh shape
this examples that's
type completion is not working for me
why is this not working
ok
thank you so much
okay I have got a problem Oh what never
mind ok onward and good point okay right
so I brought into scope so the S
prefixes are and everything you're going
to see here are short for singleton
because I'm playing around with
singleton tight so I we're gonna have a
natural number type which is based on
integer singleton types but before we
get on to that I'm just going to show
you something which is a sort of a
useful piece of the puzzle namely a way
of cheating the Scala compiler into into
allowing us to work directly with
singleton types for integers and also
boolean as well so here we are going to
have a let's call it three and it's
going to be of type s int short for
singleton int of three and this is a
type remember but you know you'll notice
that it's parameterised with a literal
value with an integer value and that is
going to be signed as three if on the
other hand we were just try and do this
oops type error and notice the the
interesting form that the Scala compiler
gives us the the type mismatch back as
the requirement is in 23 and again I
there's no magic here I haven't done
anything to produce that that particular
error message that is the internal Scala
compiler representation of the singleton
type of the integer three I've audit
found instead though it was was was the
singleton it's jeff for ok so what's
going on here how have we managed to do
that well very little magic at all
really there is there is time I'll show
you so I'll show some code a little bit
later on if this time and if not we can
look at it later what we have is a type
macro and the the basically the Scarlet
type checker itself is going to is going
to enable the sorry I beg your pardon
there is there is an implicit conversion
from from vanilla non singleton integers
with the restriction that they are
represented as as integer literals so
this is this is this is this is so the
target is a type macro representing the
the singleton type of the integer 3 the
conversion from the value 32 of which is
of type plain vanilla int to the
singleton type 3 is done via an implicit
conversion which is able to inspect the
tree representing the arguments to the
implicit conversion see that that is of
type literal constant 3 and then turn
that into a into a singleton type which
uses constant 3 as its component and
that that just maps directly into
scholars type system so um we have first
class representation here of of integer
singleton so we can do we can do this
with balls as well which will be useful
a little bit later so bull off true is
oh good good point yes okay so um well
this is that's true rather than 3 and
similarly false again time mismatch and
okay so that's instant balls and we've
got our implicit conversion between
between the the non singleton values and
singleton values and so the next thing
that we want to see is so that initially
when I started great okay so initially
when I started playing around this I was
actually very hopeful that I would
actually be able to just work with
singleton types and there is a problem
with that though and the problem is that
Scarlett compiler is very eager to widen
singleton types to non singleton time so
you can even start off by
by working with out with the city i'll
do a quick demo to show you that suppose
I had def foo off oops unfortunately
quick demos are getting right foo of tea
right so this is this is an identity
function so let's let's apply it to
whoops so foo of three you would hope
would be oops yeah you see what's
happened here is we've lost the
singleton typing and so even even though
that the the explicit type of foot
whoops through your over even though the
explicit type well in fact his loss to
even there so it basically basically
singleton types singleton types
basically evaporate very very quickly
but they exist very very transiently so
we need we need some record mechanism
for for keeping these things hanging
around so singleton types will evaluate
when there that if you like the top
level the outermost type of a value but
if they're actually embedded if they're
wrapped in a type constructor so if
we're kind of doing boxing here at the
lot at the type level if we if we if we
if we wrap our singleton type in another
type constructor we will we will end up
with something which which which hangs
around a little bit longer and when once
we've got something like that which
hangs around a little bit longer we can
do something useful with it so let's so
what we have is a nat type singleton nat
type which is basically the type level
boxing of an integer value so let's
let's see what we can do with that so
let's have about three this time is
going to be of type snapped off so this
is our box at the tide level whoops box
and we'll use the singleton inch types
because we need obviously this is visit
this is that this is a tight level thing
so we can't mention values here unless
unless we use the the the the type macro
that we've we've already prepared
earlier so okay
equals 3 okay right so what's happened
here is that so this time round we have
a different implicit conversion so this
implicit conversion is taking a an
integer lateral three onto a value of
type snap of singleton type of three so
this is this is this is going to hang
around for longer so this this this
value three you can see that we've still
got it we can we could pass it through
that identity function and and we'll get
back out what we put into it so that's
right so we've got something now which
is sticky and so I guess I guess before
I before I before I move on to the next
bit I just want to observe that we've
actually sold part 1 of the problem we
now actually have because we have a way
of lifting integers virtuals to the type
level automatically very implicit
conversions we can now start expressing
api's in terms of in terms of
intellectuals in situations where we
might otherwise encode an index via a
type level literal so there's a whole
bunch of places in shapeless where
that's done so for example in in in H
lists there is a there is an indexing
method to pull out the end the end
element of an H list and this obviously
has to be to keep the typing lined up
this obviously has to be an index which
is which is static you know a
compile-time so consequently the the
shapeless API is is is defined in terms
of tight little type level natural
numbers using this technique will be
able to just replace that and just use
integer literals for indexing so that's
that's kind of nice to start with and so
we kind of stopped a bit of prom the
other bit of problem is we're not
restricted to 22 anymore we can we can
let's do something else let's have 33
why her are so we're no longer limited
to our limited fixed budget of
identifies that that that we had defined
before um okay so as I'm rapidly running
out of time I'm going to get to the
punch line which is i'm going to
multiply some numbers that are bigger
than 22 together so remember how long it
took last time so let's understand
import so we have corresponding to the
to the to the previous some that we had
there is a singleton some so let's just
let's just bring that into scope right
now this is this is set up slightly
differently I'm your g'nite this is this
this is going to look exactly like a
value level thing but in actual fact
what's happening is under the hood is
that we are going to be inferring so
let's I'll just do that the three plus
five thing again and so this looks like
what's oh yes I'll move I'll move it up
again so that people can see ok so this
and so this looks like a value level
operation but what's actually happening
is that those those literal values
arguments are actually being used via
the implicit macro to drive type
inference to infer the type level
natural numbers so that we're inferring
the singleton into type 3 and the
singleton int type 5 from those integer
literals using using the implicit macro
and that is then being fed into the
process of implicitly results so that
the sum method has an implicit argument
of type some ABC so we got we've got the
first two values of those of that type
we saw we've got three and five and then
it's the implicit macro is then
summoning well it's kind of short
circuiting the piano recursive
arithmetic solution
directly extracting three and five doing
some and stuffing in a representative of
the singleton type of int in the process
of implicit resolution so it's kind of
completely short-circuited all of all of
all of the complex infrastructure that's
there's albeit very straight you know
Keanu arithmetic is a wonder to behold
but it's just not terribly efficient
this on the other hand this on the other
hand is ok so that's that's that's
that's addition so I'll just I'll just
I'll just do a big multiplication just
to prove that this is really working so
that's just import s prod ok and so
let's just do product off big number ok
this is this is huge isn't it this is
this who needs big data when you can
multiply 1024 by 184 yes look at that
awesome
I think this is the first time I've ever
been applauded for multiplying to
portage it institute okay right sort of
joking aside so can we actually do some
use I've very very short amount of time
left so I'm very very quickly going to
show you something interesting so let's
have two lists one is going to be of
length 3 so 1 2 3 so again this is this
is stuff which exists in shapeless
already using the the piano arithmetic
encoding so L 2 so these are ordinary
scala lists for far if so what we're now
going to do is we're going to project
this in to interpret so we're going to
basically wrap these values in a tight
which statically encodes their size so
we do have to do a little bit of if you
like runtime jiggery-pokery at least
initially it's just to bootstrap is into
this because the compiler doesn't know
anything about these but just knows that
lists but once we've established that
they are lists of a given size then we
can work with that so let's let's first
have sized list 1 so that is going to be
our one sized and now we have to say
explicitly what size is
edge said said sighs do I may have to
import something else actually I'm just
remember yes import said said come on
right okay okay oh right okay so what we
get back from this is a is a list type
which has been stamped can I just finish
I have to just show this example I'll be
as quick as I possibly can okay so it's
a list which has been stamped with it
static sighs and we get back an option
because obviously it might not actually
be of that size so in this case it is
length three so we get back up we get
back some of that list you'll notice
crucially and this is a difference
between this and and non macro shape
this is we again we can use an integer
literal here let's let's just get that
because we know it's there let's do the
same thing with with the second list so
