next panel I want to start it off in an
interactive way who here has actually
tried virtual reality raise your hands
for me real quick that's when i get a
context set okay nice and who here has
tried web PR all right that's what what
I expected today we're gonna be talking
about the future of what we're kind of
climbing the immersive web for lack of a
better term we've got a really awesome
panel here today I'm really excited to
have a conversation with them and with
you guys just to kind of do a brief
check-in of where we stand today today
if Wi-Fi was working you'd be able to go
and get a web vr enable browser Firefox
or chromium plug in an oculus headset
and using WebGL build a website that is
not a site it's a world that you can
step into I today you can go down the
street walk into a store buy a samsung
phone drop it into a $99 holder from
Samsung and download a br browser a
browser actually built for virtual
reality lets you explore the web in VR
you can go get alt space which is a
social web viewer application create an
avatar and then watch a 90-foot YouTube
chromium instance of a super bowl game
or of a comedy show and if you're so
inclined you can actually build web VR
experiences using markup or JavaScript
using a couple different frameworks so
that's where we stand today what we want
to talk about is where this is all
heading in the next couple years to do
that we're lucky to be joined by a
really awesome panel of some of the
people who are making is possible
starting from our left going to arrive
at Diego Marcos is a software engineer
with Mozilla on the missoula virtual
reality research team Moz vr daigle is
one of the co-creators of a frame a new
framework for creating web VR
experiences that work just with simple
custom elements and next to him is Mike
blix from Samsung software and Jerry
Samsung I met Mike a couple years ago at
an SVR meetup Silicon Valley be our
meetup and Mike showed me a demo of a
bunch of chromium instances in a virtual
reality void I could actually browse in
virtually
one of the first and was like I'd seen
of that in August Mike joined Samsung
and a couple months later samsung
shipped their VR browser Tony Parisi
written lots of books contributor lots
of very important specs Tony's been here
since the beginning of there being a
notion of VR on the web currently VP of
platform products at Weaver who are
doing some really awesome stuff in the
VR space and he'll tell us about that
today Brandon Jones I the reason we can
even have this conversation is because
Brandon Jones and Vlad Vicki java chat
Mozilla got together and thought what
API do we need to plug in a headset and
actually create a virtuality website
Brandon from the chrome team where he
works on WebGL implementation
co-authored respect with lad and in
spring summer of two thousand fourteen
began to ship experimental build of
chromium and Firefox nightly with web be
are enabled he's gonna be able to tell
us little bit today about war web PR the
API is actually going next then Gavin
Gavin real height I hope I got that
right yes all right so Gavin is the
founder of alt space which is a really
really interesting startup that's doing
social VR you can kind of think of them
as like I think the new school they've
taken a very different approach to web
plus BR and we're gonna hear about that
today and then Jason Marsh I Jason
Marshall want to bring up cuz I don't
you saw his panel today but he presented
a heated presentation on an experience
he's created called reflow and Jason's
really good example of a guy who's got
years and years of web development
experience went to a couple meetups saw
web PR and thought I've got to be pond I
got to be part of this I want to
actually help make this a reality she's
gonna tell us a little bit today but
what he's learned and and what he
aspires to do as a developer so let's
get started then first question I think
to Tony everything I've just said if
anyone's nerves the rml we've kind of
heard this before vr has been tried
before I mean it's literally been around
since the 60s as a concept why in god's
name should anyone here take this
seriously that's awesome question to
kick this off so without dating myself
and getting into my own personal
experience and having tried to have you
are from a few different angles earlier
the reason I think we're
good time for this is threefold the
first is electronics have just gotten
really cheap we can actually afford VR
hardware systems as consumers we can
actually buy a headset for a few hundred
dollars right now it's the high-end
machines are connected to very expensive
computers but that's only going to get
cheaper over the next few years and we
can buy mobile headsets the connect two
phones as well all for a reasonable
price then they're only going to get
cheaper so that's that's the number one
thing number two is that as developers
we understand how to build this stuff a
lot better than we did when people were
trying years and years ago there's a ton
of experience in design and development
on vintage you know particularly coming
from video games driven by gaming over
the last several years but coming from
other disciplines as well that make us
all understand better the kind of things
we need to do so there'll be a lot of
experimentation will be rapid but it's
going to converge quickly on useful
applications but finally the third thing
and the most important which none of the
other two would matter without this is
that we now have one maybe arguably two
generations of people who have grown up
with interactive 3d experiences game
consoles and mobile gaming and we did
not have that certainly when the
original VR was being tried in the 60s
certainly not what people are trying
again in the early 90s so I think all
these things come together and we're
going to see some really really broad
adoption of BR over the next couple of
years because of those three factors
nice anyone want to add to that at all
what do you guys see as being the way I
frame this is in a couple years I'm
still going to have a Retina laptop it's
really fast I'm gonna have a really nice
phone that's gonna have a great browser
built into it and meanwhile if I want to
do VR like native VR with unity and
unreal engine is just going to blow your
mind they peerless performance beautiful
experiences in that world when I put on
my headset when i get home at the end of
the day or whatever the circumstances
are like what is going to motivate me to
click on an icon it launches web PR like
what is it that is special about web vr
that needs to exist so if i can approach
this one from the from the viewpoint of
WebGL in addition to working on web PR
on chrome i also work on implementing
web GL api
and when that API first started
everybody looked at it and said this is
going to be great for games on the web
that's what a lot of people talked about
games on the web and then we got it out
there and it took a little bit to get to
the point where it was stable enough not
enough platforms that people could make
use of it but what didn't happen is an
explosion of games on the web we
certainly see that you know people do
build games with WebGL and they're
they're great games but the really
compelling content the stuff that's
really blown us away has mostly been in
the way of data visualization and art
and you know expressing expressing like
Google Maps you know expressing that
information in a way that you could
can't quite do with just a 2d graphics
and almost none of it looks like a game
and in retrospect that makes a lot of
sense because everybody's comfortable
going on steam or origin or whatever
your platform is and downloading a
binary executable to run the latest
Triple A game but if you ask somebody to
do the same thing in order to see one
shader out of like shader toy nobody
would do it nobody's going to bother to
do native xq before that kind of content
but if you say click on this link in
Twitter and now you can see this
incredible GPU optimized shader that
somebody built on shader toy or math
visualization that somebody created to
explain quaternions or you know 3d
version of the globe or you know and any
number of other types of data that come
out of that that's really compelling and
I think that you're going to see the
same thing for via on the web it's
probably not going to drive the triple-a
games you know they have their platform
they know they have their tools they
know how to do what they're going to do
but there's going to be a whole lot of
fringe edge cases where really what
you're looking at is visualizing data or
creating art or just doing something
that can be disseminated really easily
that the web is going to be the right
platform for that bite-sized experiences
right what's bite-sized experiences
small experiences that
you just pop in and out right right I
mean it's the shader point model shader
toy would not exist in a meaningful
fashion if it was a binary executable
right and i think the hope to is that
not only is it lower friction for users
in a lot of ways but it's lower friction
for companies to write who have an
existing website and existing you know
web platform just to add some virtual
reality components to it i think is a
much easier ask then create a whole
application and worry about
compatibility different headsets and all
that kind of stuff from from my interest
is the developer you know end developer
of all the great stuff that these guys
have been building the really compelling
some of the really compelling use cases
are in education but also in
cross-platform so what if you have a web
browser and this is almost one hundred
percent working today what if you have a
web browser and you're looking at some
360 environment some you know 3d world
just scrolling around with your mouse as
you click in the scroll well there's a
button in the corner click it send it to
your phone maybe you're on your phone
now suddenly you move your phone around
and you can see the world click another
button thanks to force must go Google
click another button now you can drop it
in cardboard and you're there you're in
that space or you can take the same set
of code and drop it into a vibe thanks
to brandons chromium beta where you can
do WebGL do web vr in chromium on an HTC
vive which is the top of the line that's
it it's all these different levels of
experience you can get with the web that
you're not going to people are not even
than I think about doing if they're
doing full-blown games and all those
download situations and then little one
use case I'm working on is for
educational VR you've got a classroom
maybe from somewhere between middle
school through college everybody's got a
smart phone in their pocket if you have
a bunch of cardboards google cardboard
sitting around and some of them i call
them plastics because they're plastic
versions of Google cardboard you can
have a couple of dozen of these sitting
in the classroom for almost no cost
can have the whole class go to a website
cvr and do it together and there's no
way you get a whole classroom to
download on app and install it on their
phones yeah to the web where he's going
to build that up to for a school who's
got the budget to build that out for a
school as well as opposed to building a
website right and then the last piece is
if its web content then your professor /
teacher even the students especially
maybe with a frame is going to be able
to build content to show to their fellow
classmates or to their students the the
argument for web PR is incredibly
compelling on that level and are those
big games no they're simple maybe simple
experiences may be there five min
experience maybe there are two minute
experience but I think it's a very
different world in thinking about
publishing a great big game in VR yeah
so the original question is how would I
ass drop a headset everyday and open a
browser to consume BR but the other
angle of it is like hi how would I
develop for the web ER instead of native
right because we want the the web
development workflow that we use some
love today to apply also to the VR
medium right I just wanna open a github
repo put some code together greater
github pages link and send it to my
friend how to use that in native right
we had a lot of people in the audience I
think you've tried virtually already but
are new to web VR in order to kind of
prime the rest of the conversation if
I'm going to try and go home tonight and
do this what do I need to know today to
get started I just the bare bones
information I need may be jeaious don't
throw it to you because speaking hasn't
developer yourself so i started doing vr
less than 18 months ago i'm a startup
guy but I quit my health care gig and
I've been focused on you I experience
for forever too long no but the first
thing I did is I started showing up at
meetups right especially in this city
it's unbelievable there's a meetup
practically every night of the week that
has something to do with WebGL or 3d or
VR or
the cinematic the yard production so
showing up was a great way to get
started but then the typical experiment
Google every problem three Jas has a
huge community and huge set of code bits
you can find online and to just figure
it out and plug and play and put it
together on the browser side like that
that's great resources for development
right now you know none of the stable
browsers have this shipping today and so
if you want to get a browser that allows
it to work with your you know oculus DK
2 or 5 or whatever go to web the r dot
info it's a terrible terrible crappy
little web page but it will link you to
the right points to get the chromium or
Firefox browsers to begin experimenting
it's not it's not crappy it's efficient
he's being self-effacing it I like it's
very simple easy easy your alt remember
as well um I kind of wanted to and
thanks that's think it's a good primer
let's look at the future then I think
everyone would agree anyone who's tried
VR and try to Madden VR experience you
can be nauseous for hours afterwards so
I joked at a presentation at Mozilla
that you know the bug reports in VR are
kind of crazy like I threw up that's an
amazing bug report but those are the
stakes you know and so if there's one
thing the web has struggled with in the
last couple years on mobile in
particular smooth performance like I was
a lead designer in Firefox OS for a
couple years I was trying to get the web
to be 60 FPS rock solid and when I
touched a button he did it to respond
visually within under 120 milliseconds
like that's really hard and now all of a
sudden we aspire to do I don't you
remember the specs for VR but it's like
90 hurts sub 20 milliseconds you turn
your head you see a result on screen and
jank is the worst thing in the world so
the performance bar is insanely insanely
high the question I posed to you guys
and actually maybe Gavin I'd like to
throw to you on this one is um Brendan
Eich recently on Twitter said trying to
do web VR in the browser is pushing too
big a rock up too big a hill you guys
from day one I mean I believe correct me
if I'm wrong you guys started with unity
started with native yeah
then you've been selective in pulling in
the web like pulling in a chromium kind
of wall you know can you speak a little
bit too why you guys made that decision
in kind of your perspective from alt
spaces perspective on the performance
story yeah definitely so so as I said we
use unity as the game engine for a large
part of the experience so the most
important thing for us to begin with was
getting it so people could be in that
space together right you have basic
avatars you can be in this environment
and interact and then the next thing we
needed is is content and things are
people to do so that's when we looked at
the web and so the nice thing about
being in a game engine like unity is
that all of the VR performance stuff is
basically handled for you up until that
point you saw have to you know make sure
that your poly counts and draw calls and
all this stuff for low but you can be
assured that you will get the best
performance that you possibly can and
then when we look at web content we
rather than looking at it as sort of
like a full screen experience so to
speak word so it takes over the entire
room we look at it more as these sort of
holograms that are sort of in front of
you where it's this sort of like it's
like a window like it would be on your
desktop but it's a 3d window in this
case and so we can actually manage
performance inside of that where
sometimes will only update the 3d
objects in that window at like 30 Hertz
but the entire world and the people and
stuff like that are still moving around
at 90 and you can lurk that in your game
engine to where we can actually you know
correct for some of those performance
issues after the fact so we think about
a little bit differently but that's
that's how we've been handling
performance nice nice Brandon minute as
the WebGL implementer would be our
implementer on chromium and we've had
this conversation before but where would
you say web VR in a traditional browser
performance stands today and and can you
give us an idea of what you see as being
the next six to 12 months yeah the where
we stand today is not good enough like
with there there's honestly it's amazing
that it works as well as it does but
it's it's not going to be the type of
thing that is really compelling next to
a native app if we look at it as it is
today we're taking multiple steps to
correct that both
in terms of just you know making sure
the browser has better tools available
to it we're working on WebGL to this
will expose the OpenGL ES three feature
set that gives you a lot of new
capabilities new performance
optimizations that you can apply to your
3d scenes so that gives you one step up
and efficiency we're refactoring the web
PR API so anybody who's been playing
around with it thus far I apologize
profusely but we are going to break your
stuff we there the different
stakeholders and the API I've been
talking about it we're taking the
feedback that we've gotten from the
initial months worth of people playing
around with these AP eyes and looking at
the difference between where the
hardware and the api's were when we
started and where the native hardware is
now and updating the API to take that
into account so that it maps better to
the underlying systems and gives people
more capabilities to work around some of
the performance issues that we have so
being able to more directly push imagery
to the hmd for example and then you know
beyond that there's just going to be a
layer of things happening at the
ecosystem level with you know graphics
drivers and whatnot there's a whole
bunch of stuff that's going into making
sure that the various OS is that this is
this is running on don't get in the way
and that we have more direct access to
the hardware we've got you know Vulcan
DirectX 12 and stuff like that coming
out and even though those aren't going
to be accessible through the browser the
fact that they're available on the OS
will help reduce some of the overhead
there as well so there's a lot of
momentum towards getting us to a better
place performance wise nice so where was
Brendan going with that saying don't do
it at all or was he just saying this is
a really big task he's thinking about
the rock at the top of the hill once
it's up there what is it acquired should
ton of potential energy could do a hell
of a lot of damage when you push it back
down right so yeah I mean these are
really hard problems to solve but
they're getting soft the browser's are
going to work on the bits and pieces
Brandon was just
to talk about if people have figured out
how to be smart enough to render in 16
milliseconds to have 60 FPS they can get
to 11 or five and a half depending on
you slice it one per I I could do really
amazing stuff they do their JavaScript
engineering correctly so I don't view
any of these things as impossible
they're all going to that you know the
performance curves are going to be there
and we're going to catch up with them as
developers over the next little while
right so I don't see the difficulty of
the task as being a reason not to go
after it motivated to try to create web
style experiences again as opposed to
trying to make a buck tomorrow doing
triple-a games right all right Kevin did
you want oh yeah I just real fast i
think the other point too is that from a
content creation side like think like
you're programming for a ps2 right like
you can you can probably go a little bit
further than that but like look at the
tricks they did look at things like
world of warcraft are they making a lot
with low poly counts you can do a lot
with art to make these things look
incredible even if you're not using to
me CPU resources gb resources right to
that point this is something that I've
brought up in the past one of the most
spectacular hits of the last few years
in the gaming world is minecraft like
people don't require high poly counts to
have a good experience like there
there's a lot that can be done with just
the way you present the data Mike did
you want to bet yeah I mean I think it
just comes down to scope I mean
developers aren't going to be targeting
triple-a triple-a games for web PR and I
think when you don't have that graphical
fidelity lovely that you're targeting it
is going to be a reachable target and
these underlying platform issues are
going to be solved by Google and Samsung
and mizzou yeah let's stay with you then
I a lot of us have been tinkering with
what a web VR browser would actually
look like you've actually shipped one
twice technically I I'm like my
background as user experience design he
really can't think of a bigger gap from
a user experience design than between a
keyboard and mouse or a mobile device
thing accelerometer and virtual reality
I mean it's a radically different input
and display paradigm I'm really
interested like just from a design
standpoint and from an engineering
standpoint what did you guys learn in
the development to the gear VR browser
and can you maybe give us some idea of
kind of where you aspire to take things
next yeah absolutely so I think one
starting consideration is that virtually
one hundred percent of content on the
web right now is not VR so we have to
kind of work within that context of you
know having a virtual display where we
display kind of a traditional mobile web
so if you're not familiar the gear VR
has a trek bet on the side where you can
swipe and tap and that's kind of maps
pretty closely to what you can do on
mobile so that's kind of where we
started out we also have a software
keyboard in there that you can bring up
and so that's kind of where we're at
right now we have that virtual screen in
front of you that you can interact with
and from there you can launch into kind
of more be our specific content like 360
video you know using standard html5 or
other video sites so from there where do
you take it that's kind of the next step
a lot of it depends on what happens to
input right inputs kind of hard when you
can't see your hands you can't see a
keyboard with us it's a mobile device so
you don't have those traditionally
accessible that is one of the biggest
things we want to figure out if you know
how do you make that input work really
well right now it's it's actually kind
of more than more than sufficient for
tapping and getting around when you are
focused on getting that VR content so
kind of a lot in the pipeline for how we
make that better that's very enticing
Jago you when you and i were to the guys
who made a frame over the last you know
six months and from it you mentioned
tooling before you kind of talk about
what the rationale behind a frame was
and kind of where you see a frame and
glam which is tonys framework which we
took a lot of ideas from and seen VR
which is also in the same line like we
see a lot of people who are still kind
of chasing the dream of declarative
world building like why do you think
that is and what do you think the appeal
of that is so the Russian is because we
love the rml give so damn the rationale
behind it is like
uh we believe that what PR is going to
be the next big medium and personally
thing like the 2d web is going to be a
subset of this bigger medium and
currently there's like a skill gap right
in the web so the skills that you need
to develop vr are skills that are
related to computer graphics and video
game development and there is some nice
very nice tools out there you have three
days of play cameras you have a
turbulence you have a lot of nice 3d
game engines that are very well designed
but they are appealing for a different
kind of audience is more for game
developers that they want to come to the
web and run elisa market that is not
covered which is all the web developer
has like already a set of skills and how
can we introduce these people into this
new medium in a way that the learning
curve is as smooth as possible and this
is that the reason behind a frame and
glam that is our ideas the new is a
frame is our take on on a declarative
layer to be able to create 3d worlds but
the rationale behind it is like we just
wanna onboard web developers into this
new medium and a frame as its current
form today maybe it's an interim
solution and as people that's what
developers get more familiarize with a
VR medium a frame can develop into
something very different in the future
we will see but the goal is like let
those developers to use the skills they
already have and learn a few new
concepts and then they can do oh yeah we
are experiences in the web does the
Russian I think our metaphor was not to
refer to you guys well maybe that the
web development community were like the
mountainous hill tribes of VR it
compared to like the native developers
kind of Rome it's like there's lots and
lots of us and if we can just kind of
beat the drum in the right way and get
web developers to actually jump into
this it will be very interesting to see
what happens you combine that with low
friction publishing decentralization
lack of gatekeepers like that gets very
intrigued
you know the other metaphor we used was
a frame and web PR in general where our
attempt to kind of throw a match into a
drive field it's not about kind of a
frame is not particularly important in
the long term it's more about getting
the ball rolling and getting people to
start hacking and creating like it
probably won't be any one of us who
invents the blue underlined link of ER
it'll probably be one of you or someone
in the vast community out there so it's
about trying to find ways to build this
collectively and kind of trigger the
emergence that I think is the unique
strengths of a web PR there's another
personal reason for a frame for me I
it's a bit controversial because we're
in a web development kind of conference
so I hit an inflection point right so
I've been doing websites for a long time
I did study websites PHP jungle rails
node backbone angular react you name it
right but at the only days to do what
carousels drop-down menus buttons Jesus
I don't want to be doing that the rest
of my life I just one more right yes
amen brother amen and and I love react
and I'll of angular there's a lot of us
more people but but he's just the
technology new API for the sake of
learning new API says wanna do new
things that were not possible before
right and I frame is it's just it's like
personal interest of mine did you want
to add to that time I mean you've been
at this for longer than any of us um no
I mean you guys some that up pretty well
I kind of stumbled into doing another
markup language for VR you know
originally worked on vrml thanks for the
shout out when I was going to
conferences evangelizing 3gs and WebGL
and I would be doing a talk I tell
people how to use three Jas and it was
just a bunch of you know pages and pages
of JavaScript code on the screen to put
up a camera get you know get a cube
spinning around on the screen right and
then I'd go next door at the html5
conference or whatever and you know like
they would be showing bootstrap
templates and two lines of JavaScript
and I realize it was this giant abyss
and you know skills and orientation most
the designers who are coming to these
conferences and we're probably going to
want to do something in WebGL besides
making a game which you know you need
the hard core engineering skills for and
so that got me excited to take a fresh
look at the idea and see if we could
just you know pair some simple markup as
a designer's expression with a very
simple way of you know driving things
with code as people interacted with the
scene and so I was doing all that
preview are before the oculus hysteria
happened a couple years ago I started
working on the you know heart of glam
same motivations as you though you were
just talking about exactly it's just
like what's a designer to do but I love
what you were talking about I don't
we're jumping the gun on your agenda
Josh I know what you're talking about
about where we're taking this with user
interface yeah no I don't know if you
were claiming not that's actually right
when I wanted to take and I should Geoff
Gavin I want a 30 you because um I
what's so neat I don't find one sort of
janus janus is another attempt to
instead of trying to bring the entire
web forward Janice and I thing called
space or attempts to kind of start with
VR and then the needs of the are and
then work your way to the web and as a
result they've managed to move really
really fast I mean I first visited your
office before you guys are even alt
space and you were showing us stuff that
was amazing at like beautiful
performance using razor hydras I think
too I built i bought the house out of
chromium instances I was pretty cool in
virtual reality so I'd really look at
Janice and I'll space in particular as
being I mean besides just being great
products that seemed have a lot of
momentum they're kind of like
laboratories they I believe are out
there ahead of the traditional browser
vendors and the API authors actually
showing us what people want to do so I'm
curious do you have and like what are
some of the things that have surprised
you the most and what are some of the
places where you've seen the most
momentum for for web VR in alt space
that's a great question and it is it is
a ton of fun because we can just like to
add api's overnight and like they have
no standards to them and we just see
people use them which is awesome and
like I would love to get centered around
the stuff at some point but like one of
the ones that was great to see is we
added in a API for tracking skeleton so
you can get access to all the body
sensors that are
logged in and so to see people do it for
everything from like attaching things as
like a heads-up display off of your
Center I position to doing like little
laser tag stuff and using the leap
motion integration so that's been fun I
think the thing that continuously
surprises me is just I feel like I have
figured out all that we can do with like
one limited subset of something and then
someone will come up with some crazy way
of doing it like we don't have skeletal
animation in there but people will just
spawned a whole bunch of little spheres
and like walk them as if they're like a
person you know yeah i just i think if
we give the sort of as if we give the
right layers of abstraction of people
where they can they can build their own
tools build their own systems build
around frameworks on top of this that's
where we're going to see a ton of
innovation well can you tell us a little
bit where you guys are going I mean I
know you're working on a jsapi the
initial version of alt space was about
letting me create a instance of a
chromium window but you mentioned kind
of the holographic right it gives you a
little bit more about yeah so the way
that we did our implementation is since
we're not actually modifying the browser
internals we have sort of add you can
think of it sort of like a webview
inside of there where we can sort of put
put code injections is we're using three
jas itself and so the nice thing about
that is one of the things that we found
out is that it's really useful to have
like semantic data about these objects
because like we want to be able to like
click on them and like fire Mouse events
and stuff like that which you need to
have a physics representation of this
object in order to do that which
normally is different from the visual
mesh right so you have to be exposing
these sorts of things and the other one
is the synchronization stuff so like
there's been lots of attempts to make
web page is synchronized in the past
where I'm looking at it on my screen
you're looking at on your screen we're
seeing exactly the same thing but in VR
it's actually critical if you're in a
social context because if I'm looking at
this like one of my favorite examples
well so if I'm looking at like a big
chess board on the floor that we're
rendering as a web page and I move a
pita chest piece and you're looking at
it you need to see that chess piece move
right and that skills in complexity to
you know whatever content creation
system art thing that you're doing and
so literally every service has to be
synchronized across all the clients yeah
so it tricky tricky tricky problems
it's okay it's a continuing found the UI
streak so one of the things you can't do
right now the current web PR API that's
about to get fixed is you can't go from
site to site because we're using the
full screen API and the security model
doesn't allow for it so you plug in your
headset you click enter via on a website
and you can put on your headset but if
you click you try to go to another
domain yeah she got you get kicked out
of your arm owed you gotta take a head
set up it's in terrible we don't have
the low friction that you expect from
the web yet but we're about to resolve
that the API the Brandon and folks from
micro actually most people on the stage
are all contributing to this it soon be
circulated for public feedback really
soon one of these this can resolve is
going from site to site to site securely
inverse reality and then all of a sudden
you got a new set of problems you know
how do I know where I'm going it was our
loading indicator how do i tell i enter
in a new URL we basically have to
reinvent the entire browsing user
experience the entire paradigm for
virtual reality this is where science
fiction begins this is like the starting
got on true science fiction let's just
speculate like what does the browser
look like in that world to you guys what
what excites you about that kind of the
world the short answer is not quads in
space eventually as more and more
content and there's lots of 3d content
all are already out there you know
everything that has to do with
geo-located data all the Google Maps
kinds of things is there's you know
sketchfab lots of lots of 3d models out
there but there's lots of ways of
thinking about even something like
Wikipedia in a 3d way where you see the
relationships between the things instead
of just quads in space so that's that's
actually what I want to work on and
working on the quads in space is a great
interim step to get there but more and
more I want to pull that data off and
then see it around me and get start to
use my whole spatial brain to to
interact with that information yeah I'm
get rid of getting rid of browser tabs
right no more tabs well hello there I
actually want to give a counterpoint to
that which is that you know it's going
to start out of squats in space I mean
that's kind of what the Samsung browser
is right now but i don't think the
clubs in space are ever going to go away
and I don't think that they should
because we get an enormous amount of
information from that all of us carry
around in our pocket every day a quad
that exists in space that it gives you
lots and lots of information it's just a
flat little screen but it's it's
incredibly useful and what we need to do
is intelligently say okay well how do we
integrate that kind of information like
more the traditional web content
intelligently into a virtual space that
can be filled with so much other stuff
like you know nobody actually wants like
the Minority Report API or or the UI
where you're swinging it around like
this and nobody like you don't want to
go to Amazon in VR and have like
matrix-style shelves just shooting past
you and it's like all right this is like
every every you know CPU that you can
buy you just going to walk down that
that's terrible you know there's always
going to be a need for you I shorthands
and it's just how can we use VR to
intelligently augment that I think
there's there's there's two interesting
points here one is I think that you can
actually do a lot of interesting things
with quads in space in VR you can like
bend them so that you have the right
sort of curvature from a distance we
actually are like accidentally support
transparency so if your element is
transparent you can get these crazy sort
of things that don't look like Watson
space because the edges are transparent
right and then I think the second point
is that these interfaces are probably
going to look very different on
different VR hardware so like on the
vibe I would kind of hope that it would
be one of these things it's like
attached you know where you can sort of
look down and see it on your hand it's a
very nice sort of like palette based
interface yeah we're in the gear VR
that's not going to make as much sense
and it might need to be a plane in space
so just like how we have to have sort of
responsive designs on platforms today I
think we're gonna have to have
responsive designs to the different VR
input devices and headsets I like that
if you guys haven't tried the vibe like
don't judge VR based on if you try to DK
to or in the gear VR is amazing but
don't judge a base on that you normally
don't judge it on cardboard what
definitely don't judge be are based on
cardboard cardboard is awesome that's
not whether the ER is all about this is
probably a terrible analogy but I love
terrible analogies those are like the
gateway drugs five is like the heroin so
so everyone if you take away one thing
from this talk go try heroin um all
right we've got a couple more minutes I
want to wrap up the three you guys can
again to contribute your thoughts that
kind of previous question what is a
browser look like in a couple years in
this kind of science fiction in this
kind of science fiction future I mean
maybe you want to touch on AR as well
because we talked about VR but immersive
leg extends to a are as well any
thoughts on that I'll just jump in real
quick I think I agree with most of what
I've been hearing so far but I just want
to emphasize one point in this we're
already as bladvic bitches is famously
quipped we're already in metaverse right
just doesn't have the 3d stereoscopic
skin yet right we were so immersed in
our information we're doing this all all
day all day with her phone and have my
phone as a problem eats my bag right now
but you know we tapping out over looking
at the line at Starbucks and we you know
and the caltrain we can't get her face
out of that thing right so it's just
inevitable to me that in a short number
of years all our information is going to
be around us we're going to surround it
by it you know essentially much more
immersed in it using stereoscopic
displays either VRA are I don't know
what those designs are going to look
like but to me that is inevitable and
and coming very quickly okay yeah I mean
for me maybe more of a personal opinion
than Samsung's you can you know as you
see the hardware improving the software
improve you can actually see potentially
the default way of viewing web pages on
a quad actually being on hmd and then of
course you have that that quad but you
also have the environment so you can
take full advantage of that so that's
this seems like an obvious direction to
go and with the quad remaining I mean
that's kind of how our user flows right
now say like the 360 content that you
can launch into then you go to a
different domain you go back to that
quad it's not that bad of a kind of a
user flow at this point it's familiar
and it does work but again obviously a
lot of potential for making it even
better
just quickly for the non graphics folks
in the audience of quad is just a
rectangle in space it just looks like a
square rectangle yeah and part of my
complaint about it right now someday I
think it's going to be much more useful
than it is today because the resolution
of the VR headsets including the vibe is
not as high it's basically about one
tenth of the resolution of your of the
human eye so it's hard to read a lot of
text and so what are other ways that we
can present information that is
appropriate for the resolution and for
the medium eventually than through your
other question is where does it look
like and I think that in some ways vr on
the web is really a pointer to a are
where you've got glasses that keep that
information around you to tonys
beautiful vision that he described right
where instead of looking down scrolling
you can see it around you it's a
heads-up display all the time and in
some ways I think that air is more
appropriate for what I'm thinking about
doing but VR is why you can do it today
an AR is still a ways out and we'll see
what magic leaf has to do because
they're so stealth no one knows but
otherwise I think it's a while still a
ways out there cool well thank you guys
thanks everyone thanks for coming up and
if you want to learn more about web vr I
really quite literally mean this these
are five of the most knowledgeable and
insider people you could possibly talk
to so come hit us up afterwards thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
