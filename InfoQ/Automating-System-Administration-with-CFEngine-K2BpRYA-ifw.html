UNIX and Linux system administrator and
I support postgres databases from that
hat very interested in automating system
administration so instead of making
changes to your servers one by one by
hand you use policy based system
administration where you write a policy
that describes what your system should
look like and then you have some
automated tool that checks the actual
state of the system compared to your
desired state and if necessary
reconciles that state so I do training
on CF engine which is this program that
does that if you have any questions
here's my email address Alexia vertical
sysadmin com have more information on CF
engine at my website triple w vertical
sysadmin com okay so let me show you
what I have
so first I'm going to make sure I have a
clean slate I'm removing postgresql dev
server package shutting down the
database so we have a completely clean
slate to start I'm using centos for my
demonstration since Linux is so popular
today in red hat is a very popular
version of Linux so it seems to have a
very broad coverage can I just see a
show of hand show of hands here how many
of you are running on some kind of red
hat linux system so i have maybe three
fourth of the room thank you so here we
go I'm removing postgresql and
postgresql their server
so nothing up my sleeve postgresql is
not running so what I'm going to do here
is the ACF engine works is the idea is
your item policy that describes the
desired configuration of your system and
then CF engine will take that policy and
we'll look at your system will compare
it to the policy and when it finds
deviations it will attempt to fix them
so the idea is instead of making changes
to each system one by one manually is
you write a policy and then you have an
automated system for monitoring their
policy and enforcing that policy so this
saves tremendous labor when you get into
tens hundreds thousands tens of
thousands of servers increases the ratio
of how many servers you can have per
system administrator and frees up the
system administrator to do more
interesting work than routine work if
you configure a database server then you
have to configure another one and
another one it's pretty cookie cutter
well it's easier to just tell the
computer how to do it and have the
computer do it so this is what we're
going to do here we're going to have the
computer do it if anybody has any
questions please feel free I do take
questions during the presentation so
this is my policy file and if anybody
wants it's available online I'm going to
post it after the presentation triple w
vertical sysadmin com / CF engine / CF
engine underscore examples guitar if you
go to vertical system and calm / the f
engine you'll find a lot of things
including these examples so you have to
make this just a little bit smaller so
it fits fits on the screen can you still
read that okay good okay so this this
first section is the control section so
this controls that running behavior of
CF engine it controls CF engines own
behavior so first we specify a version
of our policy this can be any text
string so i put in a
version identify on a date and then I'm
using some commercial extensions to CF
engine CF engine has been open source
since 1993 so it's still open source but
the last couple of years there's a
company CF engine a s out of Norway with
CF engine incorporated a US subsidiary
that supports the development of CF
engine and provides support commercial
support 24 7 for CF engine and they've
added some functionality and they've
added database functionality which is
what I'm going to be demonstrating today
so this house license is paid ten it
relates to the enterprise a bit of CF
engine so this specifies inputs input
files this is the standard library for
CF engine so finally here is our bundle
sequence so in in CF engine language you
have the way you describe your
configuration your system configuration
you describe it using a declarative
language so you don't say install this
package you say this package is
installed and the reason for that is how
you install a package is different from
system to system from OS 20 s and CF
engines job is to abstract those
differences from you and to take care of
them for you so when you say this
package is installed that's a promise so
the idea is this package promises to be
installed and it doesn't guarantee it
because in the real world you cannot
guarantee something will be the case
because there's some external
dependencies perhaps perhaps that you're
loading the package from an external
database an external repository and that
repository is down today because they're
having some problems so you can't
guarantee that a package will be
installed but you can promise that you
will try to install it so this is the
model that CF engine is based on the
promise model it's a very practical
approach and there is some logic and
math behind it some scientific papers
but for our use it's enough to say that
it's a promise and I'll show you how it
works so promises are grouped into
bundles you have bundles of promises so
a bundle is a collection of one or more
promises that has an
here we specify a sequence of bundles
that's the order in which these bundles
will be examined and action taken to
make the system match the stated
configuration one of the key challenges
to scalability is knowledge management
so we were drowning in the sea of
details CF engine aims to help handle
that sea of details so there's different
capabilities in CF engine to help with
knowledge management so one of the ways
that you can aid knowledge management is
by using descriptive bundle names so in
this example I have a bundle that says
DB cluster is installed now you don't
have to know anything about CF engine to
understand what this bundle is going to
do and then I have a bundle PGH PA conf
trusts local users so that also should
be self-explanatory if it's not please
let me know DB cluster is running so
it's one thing to install a package and
it's another thing to start the process
so our system administrators that the
basic things that we handle our packages
files processes services and CF edge we
can handle all of these things the next
bundle as database exists so you have a
database cluster up and next you create
a database resident in that database
cluster and the final step is schema
exists and is correct so you've put the
database class today you've put a
database inside that cluster and now you
you now you create some tables in that
database and you have schema for those
tables now the way CF engine operates
normally is it runs continuously by
default it runs at five minute intervals
it's very lightweight has a very light
footprint when it runs all the
components the memory footprint is under
10 megabytes
has very few dependencies CF engine is
written in C and it has very few
dependencies three libraries that it
requires so it's very nimble has a very
small footprint and it's very portable
because it's written in C so people are
using it on desktops people are using it
on servers people are using it on super
computer clusters that are tens of
thousands of nodes and people are using
it on smartphones embedded devices it
can go lots of places so the idea is it
can be used to build a server and it can
also be used to maintain a server so if
somebody makes some unauthorized changes
to your server CF engine will fix them
to bring you back to your blueprint how
does that sound do you have any
questions than anything I've said so far
you
good question the names don't affect
what happens the name is just an
identifier that you give it and the main
purpose of the identifier is you have to
be able to identify if you have differed
if you have more than one bundle you
have to be able to differentiate them
but it's also useful to give a
meaningful name so you can see what the
bunt you can get an idea of what the
bundle does without actually looking
inside the bundle so you have this idea
of abstraction as enabling system
administration you don't have to deal
with all these details you just have a
general summary but those details are
available to you if you need to look at
them so you can navigate these different
abstraction levels high-level and
low-level so here's our first bundle
this is a bundle of type agent there's
different components in CF engine that
make up the CF engine system different
like 10 binaries about so the the part
of CF engine that actually makes changes
to your system as the agent and the idea
is each of your systems would have its
own CF engine installed and would run
its own CF engine and would have a local
copy of the policy and you can run them
stand alone like that or you can Network
your CF engine instances and you can
have a source of the policy so you have
a policy definition point someplace
where your issue policy and then these
nodes suck up the policy and check the
car they're their own system state
against the central policy so because
you don't have a central point going
around checking all the servers it's
very scalable each system takes care of
handling its own configuration so here
we have a bundle of type agent and the
name is DB cluster is installed here we
have a promise each promise starts with
a promise type which is followed by a
colon so the promise type is packages so
this identifies what aspect of the
system we're dealing with I'll be
dealing with packages or files or
commands or what is it so this is a
packages type promise and then you have
double quotes you have a system object
this is the promise sir this is the the
object that's affected by the promise so
here we have a package called postgres q
well and then we have some attributes of
that promise and these attributes are
pairs so it's the attribute name and
then the content of ally of that
attribute so the package policy is well
what do we do with this package do we
added we delete it do we verify it that
we update it so in this case we say add
it and the package method tells us what
how are we going to handle this package
what package manager we're going to use
because there's a wide variety of
package managers out there today and you
can have different package managers in
play on a single operating system so in
this case we're saying well this is a
young package and it should be installed
similarly we specify postgresql server
package policy add package method yum
same as before here's something new
classes now classes in CF engine have
nothing to do with object-oriented
programming classes this is the English
word classes as in a set of things or a
group of things that have some
characteristic in common like a class of
cars or a class of sailboats or a class
of database servers so classes are a way
to group servers and the reason it's
convenient to group servers is you might
want to have a policy that's not a
global policy but is specific to a group
of servers so for example you might want
to have the httpd package installed on
your web servers and the postgresql dash
server package installed on your
database servers senior policy you say
it can qualify a promise with a class
and you can say this is the packages
type promise that only applies to web
servers and then you say go ahead and
install this package so here what we're
doing is we're saying if this promise is
repaired then define a class called
start underscored progress now what does
it mean for a promise to be repaired a
promise can be in three states as far as
CF engine is concerned a promise is kept
so for example the policy states that
the postgresql their server package
should be installed
we'll look in our system and we'll find
yes it's installed okay great package
promises kept that's one possible
outcome there's two others let's say the
package is not installed so CF engine
will install it it will run a command to
interface with the package manager to
install the package that package is
successfully installed that is
considered a repaired promise wasn't
kept at the start but was kept at the
end so we call that a repaired promise
the third possible outcome is CF engine
saw that there was no package it ran the
command to install the package and the
command exited with a nonzero status the
command failed maybe the network was
down maybe the remote repository was
done maybe there was some file conflict
in the package couldn't be installed
whatever the case were now in the third
possible outcome which is a promise not
kept not kept means repair was attempted
and it failed so here we're qualifying
our promise to install the package we're
saying if this promise was repaired then
you define this special class called
start underscored progress start on its
core postgres and the way it comes into
play is in the very next promise and by
the way each promise is terminated with
a semicolon in the CF engine syntax a
complete statement is terminated with a
semicolon so what this does is this is a
command type promise it's a promise to
run a command this is the command that
we're going to run just start the
postgresql database but there's a
qualifier here start underscored
progress colon colon so this command
will only be run if that class is set
and that class will only be said if this
promise was repaired so in effect what
this does yes sir
right right it makes sense you see
because the CF engine language is
descriptive and not imperative or
procedural what you're describing as the
final state of the configuration and not
how to get there but in the real life
you have to take account of these
sequential steps so I could have
decoupled these two promises and just
had two promises one is that the package
is installed and the other one is that
this command will be run because this
command can be run over and over again
with the same result when the first pass
will succeed that will start the
database on the second pass the second
time you run it it will fail because the
data which is already running so it will
fail to start the database but the end
result will be the same the database is
running so this class is not necessary
what i'm doing here is a little bit of
trying to impose some kind of sequence
in a declarative language it's not
strictly speaking necessary so in fact i
will simplify this this example well
actually a little bit as it is so what
we're doing here is this couples the two
promises so CF engine when it runs it
actually does three passes over over
these promises and this allows things to
click into place when there are
dependencies so it allows the system to
converge very quickly from whatever its
current status to ideal state so this is
a conditional promise and will only be
wrong if start underscore progress is
set and start on the store postgres will
be said only if this promise is repaired
so what will actually end up happening
is after the package is installed
immediately it will run the command to
start postgres yes sir
yeah yeah good point thank you okay so
let's let's actually see how this works
so stop stop being so theoretical and
actually show you something so that that
that bundle was called DB cluster is
installed so i will run just that bundle
DB cluster is installed and my policy
file is this miss database demo GF dash
i inform us of what's happening inform
us of any changes you make to the system
yep that should do it so normally the
bundle sequence is specified within your
policy but in our case was specified on
the command line so you see this is the
output from yum desh why install so
we're installing the packages and we're
starting the database server good idea
thank you very much max so the question
was how does CF engine know the sequence
in which to to handle these promises in
this case the sequence is imposed
because this promise the commands
promise is qualified you see the start
underscored postgres it's a shorthand
for saying there is a boolean variable
called start underscore postgres check
to see whether it's set if it's set then
proceed and run this command which is
the service postgresql start now this
this variable doesn't exist it's a
custom variable that that I named and
that variable will only be created when
the package is when the package promise
for the database server cluster is
installed so I have a promise that this
package will be installed if that
package is repaired that means CF engine
saw that this package is not installed
and went ahead and installed that's a
repair if that repair happens then that
class will be set and then because CF
engine is cycling over your promises the
next time it hits that command promise
it will take effect because now the
context for it is going to be true so
it's going to run that command so it's
it's efficient because it won't try
running that command before the package
is installed does that answer your
question we don't even need the
postgresql package the only reason I
wanted to install this so I can use the
command line client to access the
database so yeah that order doesn't
matter okay so the question was will the
packages be installed in the order
specified within the packages section I
think so but the limit double check
let's just swap it around and we'll put
the postgresql package second so now
let's remove postgres ql and postgresql
dash server so first of all notice that
the order that in which it was installed
before was first the client and then the
server and that that was that was the
order that we had before so it looks
like it but let's just double-check
so no it's not
right right that's a good point that's
the order from yams perspective exactly
young will handle the dependencies for
you because we're telling it yam dash y
so you're saying yes so that means if it
has dependents it will pull them in not
all package managers do that but the
ones that do it's it's very convenient
on one hand because you don't have to
track the dependencies but on the other
hand you can install with a lot of stuff
on your system that you don't know about
so cuts both ways any other questions
about this this first bundle to install
the database cluster okay we'll continue
next I have a promise about a file and
then file is PG underscore HBA com which
is the access control list for postgres
so I have an attribute of that promise
which is an edit line that means we're
going to make promises about the
contents of that file we're going to go
inside it and and and make some promises
about its contents and those edits are
summarized with the identifier trust
local users so that describes what we're
going to do and I have a comment here
that will is accessible when you run CF
engine and verbose mode or debug mode or
when you get reports from it and the
comment allows me to document the
purpose of this configuration so not
only do you document the configuration
just by writing the policy because when
you configure servers by hand and then
the sysadmin leaves the company the next
assignment who comes in it's going to be
like well why is that server configure
that way there might be documentation it
might be up to date or it might be you
know up to date as of two years ago and
then not updated since then when in
policy based system administration your
policy becomes a living document this is
the current state of the system well CF
engine takes that one step further and
allows you to document the purpose of
that configuration so here I'm setting
up trust local users because I need rude
to be able to access the database
cluster so CF engine which one
Ruth can get into the database to set up
the database and the table schema and
again I have if the problem a trigger
here if this promise is repaired then
this special context variable reload
underscore postgres will be true and
again I have a command that will only
run if reload underscored postgres is
true and it will reload postgres and the
purpose the purpose here is when I had a
comment to document the purpose is load
the new config file
in our I need to show you the details of
this edit line so if you want you can go
under the hood then you can look at the
details of this edit line trust local
users bundle I have two promises here
one is basically delete lines everything
so first it will empty the entire file
and then it will promise that these
lines exists in the file so we'll insert
those lines so first they have a comment
that's a warning that this this file is
under CF engine control don't edit it
directly edited in the policy or else
your changes will get overwritten and
then I set up trusts to all local users
so there's different ways you can edit a
file with CF engine you can edit a
single line in a file or you can edit a
section or you can edit the whole file
or you can use a template it gives you a
lot of power and flexibility and there's
a whole section of the manual on file
editing so here we're just saying
replace the whole file and put this in
next I have a promise that the database
cluster is running a promise bundle so I
have two promises here processes type
promise and a command type promise so
whatta processes type promise does is it
checks the process table for a regular
expression which is here postgres and we
have a special attribute restart class
what restart class is if it's can the
process table and didn't find that
pattern then it will set this class and
the purpose of that is you can then link
that class 2a commenced I promise to
take corrective action so what we're
saying is check the process table if you
don't find the postgres process here's
the command to to start postgres so this
will handle this will repair the case
where postgres isn't running it's
installed it's going to figure but it
isn't running so if somebody
accidentally shuts down postgres this
will start it or if the server rebooted
and the database didn't start because
it's not configured to start on but this
will start it if it's not right if the
database is not running and somebody is
editing the config volume in by hand
okay so the idea is when you move into
policy based system administration all
your changes to the system should be
done through policy now there is a
transition period where people are still
used to editing files by hand but
already they've started to use a
configuration management system and it
can step on your toes pretty hard so the
next bundle is database exists and I
only have one promise here that's a
promise to run a command and the command
does create DB user postgres and the
database name is conference that's just
the name of my demo database and we have
an attribute here to run this command in
the shell in the separate shell which
allows us to do input/output redirection
which allows the command to run quietly
because the idea is CCF engine runs
every five minutes and this command will
be run every five minutes so we'll work
the first time but after that it will
start to fail so
you want to know about it that it's
failing you could make this more
complicated and you could check first as
a database exists and if it doesn't then
create it but either way you're going to
have to run a command to check if it
exists or not so this this might end up
being more efficient if less elegant
okay now we get to that by the way
everything I've shown you so far can be
done using the open source edition of CF
engine this this next part is where you
get actually inside the database and
that's the enterprise extension that's
the commercial one so first I create a
variable here I create a list that
contains two elements create and verify
this is because in my databases type
promises I want to do two operations I'm
going to do a create operation and the
verify operation so when you create a
list in CF engine and then you reference
it as a scalar variable it sets up an
implicit loop over each element of that
list so we'll take this promise and
we'll run it twice once with database
operation create and once with database
separation verify so it's very compact
language very powerful it allows you it
has a great economy of expression so
what are we talking about here we're
talking about the database conference
and the table speakers so it uses this
database name / table name like a file
system here article expression just to
represent the database name and that
table name so this is a promise about
the speaker's table in the database
conference our database separation will
be two operations will be create and
verify so the table doesn't exist double
created and verify will make sure that
the database table exists and matches
the schema database type is SQL is three
database types supported by CF engine
SQL databases which include postgres and
mysql ldap directories and microsoft
registry embedded database
database columns so in this table we
expect to have three columns and I have
the name of the column and the type of
the column and then the database server
well the details about our database
server are abstracted to a configuration
block called demo postgres server so
let's look at our demo postgres server
here are the details of our demo
postgres server we specify the server
owner the server password the server
host the server type and the connection
database that's the database to which we
connect in order to create a database if
it doesn't exist yet so here I have
three tables that I specify speaker's
rooms and talks and I specify a
different schema for for each table and
that's it that covers all the policy so
now I'm just going to run CF agent
oh I want to run the whole policy said
not just the first bundle I was like
that's too quick okay so first thing it
did was it okay I'm gonna have to scroll
back up and and show you this first
thing it did was it edited that PG h be
a calm then we ran the reload command to
read in those changes then because
postgres wasn't running it started it
then it ran the create DB command to
create our demonstration database now it
goes on to check the tables it sees
database doesn't contain the promised
table speakers so it creates the it
creates the table table speakers is as
promised so now it's created the checks
against the policy it finds it matches
okay so let's actually take a look at
what did it do bless you postgres HD
conference so here is my three tables
I've got rooms with two columns speakers
with three columns and talks with three
columns so it automatically created the
three tables and set up the schema as I
told it to now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to mangle one of these tables
and I'm going to drop one of the columns
so I'm going to drop the room underscore
name column from the table rooms so
let's say that's a DBA goof and now CF
engine runs every five minutes
and it corrected the goof see it put the
room name call them back in the table
and you could tie it in so it if it ends
up repairing a table i can log it or i
can run a command to send an alert so it
can be as noisy or silent as you wish
so here I'm shutting shutting down the
database no that's that's under the hood
so you specify the schema if I can
answer that it does alter table add
column that's it's part of what it
showed it in this in this verbose see
this is how it attempts to ya so you see
it started the database backup so it
repaired from a shutdown and I'll
intended shut down and let's let's
mangle our configure in another way I'm
just going to drop one of these tables
there we go three tables
and one more demonstration
I'm going to make a much more
restrictive I'm going to make the ACL
much more restrictive in the PGH be calm
I'm running CF engine to repair it and
the first thing it does is it a ditz PGH
be a calm and then it reloads postgres
so it really reads the new PGH PA and
let's let's take a look there we go we
put it back local all all so your system
when it's under the care of CF engine
can exhibit self-healing characteristics
any questions ok thank you very much for
coming I'd appreciate your time I let
the surveys off to seminar service just
give me a little bit of feedback I'd
appreciate it if you have interest in
learning more please give me some
contact information and if you have any
questions are alexi at vertical sysadmin
