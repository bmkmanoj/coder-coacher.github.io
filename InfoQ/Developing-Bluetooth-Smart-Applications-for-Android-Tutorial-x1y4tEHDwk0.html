developer with
encore an embedded Android enthusiast
and I teach Android classes for new
circle today I'd like to talk about the
Bluetooth Low Energy or le ap is there
now available in the android framework
and show you how easy it is to add some
really interesting capabilities to
mobile applications using this
technology Bluetooth le was introduced
to the core Android framework in 4.3 or
API level 18 and prior to this there
were several OEM specific SDKs that
provided the same behavior but we will
not be going into detail on those here
Bluetooth le or also known as Bluetooth
smart is part of the Bluetooth 4.0
specification aimed at providing fast
and low-power method of communicating
with wireless sensors and peripherals
there are four primary roles that a
device can fulfill in the Bluetooth le
paradigm a broadcaster and observer
central and a peripheral device we are
going to look at two examples today
first with the Android application
acting in the central role to
communicate with a peripheral and second
with the Android device acting as an
observer role monitoring data
advertisements from several broadcaster
devices Bluetooth le is primarily built
around the generic attribute profile or
gap as it is often called this profile
defines a structured approach to how
peripherals expose their data to other
devices peripheral information is
organized as a collection of services
that describe logical functions of the
device a specific sensor or feature such
as a thermometer or heartrate monitor
would have its own service each service
then has a collection of characteristics
to transfer discrete data values between
devices a characteristic can represent
service data such as the heart rate
value or configuration data such as
weather this characteristic supports
notifications when its value changes
characteristics then are minimally made
up of property flags and a value the
flags describe information about a
characteristics such as whether it is
readable writable or supports
notification additionally they may
contain one or more descriptor elements
that allow configuration of specific
values or indication of the
use type that may provide additional
configuration to that is specific to the
given characteristic now if this sounds
like a lot of data and a lot of layers
to follow fear not when you see this in
a real-world example it'll probably
become more clear the Bluetooth special
interest group does define many standard
collections of common services into
profiles that commercial devices can
implement in an effort to foster
interoperability between communicating
devices for bluetooth LE examples of
this would be the heart rate profile
proximity profile or even the time
profile when interacting with a device
that claims to implement a certain
profile developers can expect that a
certain collection of service and
characteristic information exists on
that device however unlike with many
classic Bluetooth profiles the Android
API s4 GATT devices do not currently
provide profile level abstractions in
order to communicate effectively with a
bluetooth LE device from Android you
must determine ahead of time the
services and characteristics that you
expect on the target remote device the
API is will then allow you to scan for
those specific services then directly
read and write those characteristics
that are of interest it is also very
important to note that at this current
stage Android does not support creating
an application that will cause the
device to act in the peripheral or
broadcaster modes it is only able to
scan for and connect to other peripheral
devices in our first demo we have the CC
25:41 sensor tag from Texas Instruments
this is a device that implements a GATT
server in order to provide data from
each of its six sensors temperature
humidity pressure accelerometer
gyroscope and magnetometer each sensor
is defined by its own service and each
service contains a characteristic to
read the given sensor value most of the
sensor services also contain a
characteristic or two for configuring or
enabling the sensor data updates let's
go ahead and take a look at the device
so in this first demonstration we're
going to take a look at the sensor tag
and we're going to create on our Android
device and Android simple weather
station so if we launch the application
will see the basic user interface where
we're going to display values a three
sensor values coming from two of those
different sensors
all right so notice in the action bar we
have a menu option for scanning so if I
hit that button we can detect any of the
sensor tags that may be in the vicinity
and you see that the scan runs
temporarily we haven't found any yet so
we'll try again and now we've noticed
that something is popped up in the
action bar and if we take a look we've
detected one of these sensor tags so we
can select it to make a connection
attempt we can see it connecting
discovering services on that device and
now we've connected to the device so now
at this point we've gone through the
process of enabling the sensors on the
tag reading their values and then asking
for a notification of each of those tags
to be anytime the sensor value changes
to report that back to us so you notice
that as I'm talking here the values of
these sensors are changing periodically
and we're not continuously polling for
that data we've asked the sensor tag to
push that data to us when those changes
occur okay so let's go ahead and have a
look at the code for this example that
we just saw all right so the majority of
the code for this example is going to be
inside of the main activity that we've
implemented here now up at the top here
we've got a handful of constants for
different uu IDs for the services and
characteristics that are available for
each of these sensors so we're going to
be using three of the different sensors
that were on the sensor tag we were
using that humidity sensor and the
barometric barometric pressure sensor
and then we're actually getting that
temperature data from the barometric
pressure sensor as well so we're not
using the temperature sensor directly
that was on the sensor tag okay so when
we go in and look when this activity
gets created
we're going to go ahead and pull up some
of our user interface and remember the
user interface was fairly simple it was
just those three text fields with the
labels on there that we had we were
displaying some of that information
inside of okay and so the first thing
that we do after we get our user
interface is we're going to go ahead and
obtain a reference to the Bluetooth
manager now something to keep in mind if
you use Bluetooth previous to 4.3 is
that the Bluetooth manager is new so if
you are using Bluetooth in any previous
version of Android that manager would or
the Bluetooth adapter rather would have
come from a static method that was just
Bluetooth adapter get instance but now
we have a Bluetooth Manager much like
other system services where we can
obtain that reference from so it's a
little bit of a difference once we start
using newer bluetooth and Bluetooth le
okay and then we've created a collection
here where we're going to store all of
the Bluetooth devices that we found
during the scan and then we've got a
progress dialog here that will show
while the connect connection process is
going on okay then if we scroll down
here to when the application comes into
the foreground we're going to do a
couple of bookkeeping things in here so
the first thing that we're going to do
is we're going to determine whether or
not this device actually supports
Bluetooth okay and there's two things
that will happen if we're on a device
that either doesn't support Bluetooth or
has Bluetooth turned off the first one
is if doesn't support Bluetooth then
that Bluetooth adapter will return and
won't be null okay if we have Bluetooth
but it's disabled then the Bluetooth
adapter is enabled will return false
okay so we have to check both of those
values and in this case if either one of
those is true we're going to construct
this framework intent and start an
activity that will allow the user to
jump into settings and from settings
enable bluetooth for us okay now in this
case if bluetooth is disabled we're just
going to ask them to do that and then
we're going to leave the activity so if
they need to enable bluetooth they'll
have to come back into our application
again to continue
working with it but assuming that this
check is passed
the next thing that we're going to
validate is whether or not the
application has bluetooth LE support
okay so in the in the first section we
were looking at whether or not bluetooth
existed at all now we're looking at
whether or not they support bluetooth LE
this is validated using a system feature
declaration this value can also be
placed in your Android manifest and I
would recommend that you do that so that
applications of inside of Google Play
can be filtered out based on the
features of the device but in our
example we're going to go ahead and do
that dynamically so that for instance
when we're just playing around on a
development device or something where
we're otherwise side loading the
application we can get that same
verification as to whether or not
bluetooth le is there okay so assuming
we've been able to pass all of these
checks and we haven't jumped out of the
application at that point we're going to
go ahead and move on into and display
the user interface of the application
okay then on the back side of these
things we're going to sort of tear down
all the pieces that we had started up so
when if we ever leave the application
we're just going to make sure that
things like our progress dialogue and
any running Bluetooth scans are shut
down in addition if we are connected to
a specific device we're going to go
ahead and disconnect from that device
okay so you noticed in the example that
in order to initiate a scan and then
later to connect to a device that we had
discovered after the scan we did both of
those things using the options menu okay
so the way that we set that up is inside
of a static menu definition we've
provided the single scan option and then
you'll see a little bit later in the
code that as devices are discovered
we're going to add them to that
collection that we had defined of all of
our discovered devices and so when we
build the options menu for our activity
we're going to list out all of those
devices in the overflow menu at
alongside the scan option showing up
there in the action bar okay
additionally when we make a selection on
one of those options items we're going
to do one of two things
so if the user clicks that Scan button
we're going to clear our local
collection of discovered devices and
then we're going to start a new
Bluetooth le scan which we'll see here
in a little while if instead they've
clicked on any other item in the menu
what they've actually selected is one of
those Bluetooth devices so we want to go
ahead and make that connection okay so
here we're going to obtain the reference
to that bluetooth device and then we're
going to use this specific connect gap
method on the Bluetooth device again if
you're familiar with previous iterations
of classic bluetooth and Android this is
a slightly different connect method
that's used specifically for setting up
a gap profile connection to a bluetooth
LE ok so it's a slightly different
method and as part of that we're going
to pass in a reference to a gap callback
where all of the events that go along
with connecting discovering services and
communicating with the characteristics
will be put in all right so if we scroll
down a little bit further the methods
for starting and stopping a scan are
fairly straightforward there is a method
on Bluetooth adapter called start le
scan and another for stop and so these
are what we're going to use to initiate
that discovery process of other
Bluetooth le devices nearby and then as
a result we're going to pass in an
interface that is a bluetooth LE scan
callback which we're implementing in
this case directly on the activity now
the other thing to note is that the way
we've set this up which you saw in the
example was that when a scan is started
we immediately post a message to a
handler that we have on hand to stop
that scan roughly two and a half seconds
later and so this creates just a very
short term scan that automatically
disables itself rather than us having to
do that directly inside of the user
interface anytime that a new device is
discovered as part of that scan the
callback is going to be provided inside
of this on le scan method which is part
of that le scan callback interface that
we've implemented on the activity so
inside of this we'll get a reference to
the Bluetooth device
the received signal strength of that
device and this element called a scan
record that we're going to kind of skip
over for now but we'll see in much more
detail in the next example so inside of
this what we're specifically looking for
our elements of our sensor tag during
the scan so we're going to look for
anything that implement or that matches
the device name that is sensor tag that
we've defined as a constant up above and
if the to match we're going to store
that device away inside of our map and
then we invalidate the options menu so
that the overflow menu can be redrawn
too with the new list of devices okay so
this callback will happen for every
device that we find in the vicinity and
if for instance we had more than one
sensor tag we would have seen more than
one show up in the list okay so then the
next big chunk of what's going on in
here happens inside of this Bluetooth
GATT callback which remember was passed
as a reference into the connect GATT
method when the selection was first made
on the options menu so what we've
created in here is sort of a simple
state machine the methods that actually
get called by the framework are going to
be these methods like on connection
state change on services discovered on
characteristic read/write and changed so
these obviously are going to happen
during certain events of the process
when the connection has succeeded or
failed when after we've attempted to
make its service discovery after those
services were successfully discovered
and then as we walk through this process
of enabling all the sensors on the
device so one of the things to notice
when you're dealing with a bluetooth LE
connection on Android is that they don't
support very well reading or writing
more than one characteristic at a time
so the reason that we sort of have this
state machine is so we can enable one
characteristic and when that's finished
move to the next move to the next and
make sure that we get all of them
because there are basically three
characteristics for every single sensor
that we need to read or write we have to
write the configuration character is
for enabling the sensor we have to read
the value to figure out what the sensor
is currently reading and then we have to
write a descriptor on the configuration
characteristic to enable notifications
and the notifications remember we're how
those values from the sensors
continuously got pushed back to our
Android device so that we could update
our UI so inside of on connection state
change if the connection status was a
successful connection we're going to
start this whole process with service
discovery so the next step after
connecting is finding all of those
services if for whatever reason we
disconnect from the device at that point
we're just going to post via that
handler a message to clear out our user
interface and if anything else goes
wrong
we're just going to immediately
disconnect okay moving along with the
connection process once our services
have been successfully discovered we're
going to start through our state machine
here so we're just calling this little
reset method that we've created that
resets our internal counter and then
we're going to call into this first
implementation here an able next censor
and this will just walk through and
enable each of the sensors in kind as we
advance the value of the state machine
so the first one that we're going to
come into is going to be the calibration
characteristics for the pressure sensor
so the barometric pressure sensor
requires some calibration to happen
ahead of time and there is an additional
characteristic on the device to tell it
to do that calibration and return the
coefficients back for us so that is the
first sensor that we're going to enable
and we're enabling it simply by
obtaining a reference to that
characteristic which is done by getting
the service that the characteristic is
associated with and then the
characteristic itself all using those uu
IDs we described ahead of time once we
have a reference to the characteristic
on the Bluetooth GATT object we simply
call write characteristic after we have
set whatever value we need to do to
enable that sensor now you'll be
noticing as we walk through some of
these examples that the the values that
we use
- right - the sensors or other different
descriptor values those are defined in
the documentation for the sensor tag so
they are specific to this device and
that's where all these discrete values
are coming from in addition when we read
the data out and have to convert it into
a real temperature or a real pressure
those conversion values also are given
to us in the documentation of sensor tag
so when you see those we didn't make
them up ourselves they came out of those
Doc's okay so once we've written that
enable characteristic that will trigger
a non characteristic right once that
process has succeeded so as soon as that
happens we're going to move to the next
step which is to read that sensor value
so if we come up here read next sensor
will again obtain a reference to a
characteristic in this case it will be
you know that data characteristic of
whatever the sensor is we're reading and
then we're going to call the read
characteristic method now again this is
asynchronous so when the process has
gone out to the device read the value
and return it back we will get that
value inside of on characteristic read
now a non characteristic read the first
thing that we're going to do is for
whatever characteristic or whatever
service we got this information from
we're going to punt it up to the UI so
that we can send our first update to the
display of what the sensor data is and
then immediately we're going to continue
on with our next step in the state
machine okay
so the state machines final step is to
set notify so if we go up to that method
here set notify has the job of writing a
value to one of these characteristic
descriptors to tell the remote device
that we want to be notified of any
updates on this sensor so rather than us
continuously pulling the bluetooth LE
device we're just going to tell it that
any time the sensor value changes you
tell me and all update the display
that's what enabling the notification
will do and so once we get a reference
to the right characteristic for the
right sensor we tell it this is actually
a
to step process we have to tell it to
enable the characteristic notification
on our side locally and then we also
have to write that value back to the
descriptor on the device so we're
actually enabling notifications in two
places in order to make this function
work okay but then we'll continue
through this process because once the
descriptor has been written for our
enable we're going to advance our state
machine and then just call a naval
sensor again so we're going to loop
through this same process for each of
the sensors we're working with until
we've written all of those individual
characteristics to get set up at that
point all of the setup is complete and
what we're going to see is regular
callbacks into on characteristic changed
as all of those characteristics that
we've enabled notifications for start
bringing data into us so just like we
saw inside of on characteristic read we
have that same block where we're going
to validate which characteristic this
was and then send a message via our
handler back up to the UI to do this
now you may be asking why I'm using a
handler in this case and it's another
important thing to keep in mind when
you're dealing with Bluetooth le
callbacks all of the callbacks inside of
this GATT callback object are not going
to happen on the main thread they're
going to be called up into your
application on background threads so if
you want to do something like update the
display from this data you have to use a
handler or some other mechanism to
synchronize that information back to the
main thread so that you can do your
updates so we've talked a little bit
about the fact that this handler exists
but let's go ahead and take a look at it
so we scroll down a little bit more and
this is the implementation of that
handler that we've been looking at so
you see that for each individual message
type we've defined we're going to
receive that bluetooth characteristic
for each individual sensor in as an
object as part of the handler message
and then from here we're now running on
the main thread so we can call
individual update methods that will
actually go through and update the
display
in addition because we're doing some
other UI during connection where we
displayed that progress dialog and
modified its message we're also
leveraging this Handler to bring
callbacks from the background thread up
to the main thread for updating that
progress and then finally we have the
values in here that update the display
based on the sensor tag data so you see
that each of these methods simply takes
in the raw characteristic that we passed
in from the background callback but then
we use these static calibration or
calculation methods that allow us to
convert the raw data in the
characteristic back into some real
physical real world data that we can
display on the screen as the temperature
the percentage of humidity and the
pressure now these methods are defined
inside of a additional utility class
that we've put in this example here and
as I mentioned before the mathematics
that are going on inside of here all
come directly out of the documentation
for the sensor tag so all of these
calculations are designed specifically
to take the raw byte data that comes
back for each individual characteristic
and then based on the data sheets for
those individual sensors we can take
that information return it back into a
useful value like in this case the
barometric pressure so that we can
display it on the screen and something
that the users will understand and then
at this point we have a fully
functioning Android weather station
that's reading our data from our weather
sensors one really cool feature of
Bluetooth le is this role of a
broadcaster or a device that doesn't
accept incoming connections but rather
pushes out the data that it has inside
of its device discovery or advertisement
data in the previous example we had to
make a connection to the remote device
once the scan was complete and in order
to read and write characteristic data we
then had to go through the process of
iterating over all the characteristics
we needed just to find the information
that we wanted to read and write this
takes time
and in an application where devices may
be just passing by we want something
simpler so with a broadcaster data is
placed directly into the advertisement
packets as an observer application we
can read everything we need from the
devices during the le scanning process
without ever making a connection each
advertisement contains a collection of
advertisement data structures each
containing a length type and payload the
structure type identifiers are defined
by the Bluetooth special interest group
into the generic access profile and they
include elements like control flags
device name service uu IDs service data
and transmit power level which can be
useful for determining proximity to the
Bluetooth tags there is another
significant benefit of using broadcaster
applications for accessory developers
that is that the Bluetooth stack inside
of those devices is only required to
implement advertisements and not all of
the connection level stack which means
that it is significantly simpler and
generally lowers both development effort
and cost in our next demonstration we
have three connectionless temperature
beacons from KS technologies a company
dedicated to helping developers create
some really amazing bluetooth LE
solutions these beacon tags all contain
a temperature sensor and the value of
the current temperature is broadcast as
service data inside of their
advertisement packet this drastically
reduces the code that we have to write
so for this demo i've purposefully
turned off bluetooth so that we can take
a look and see what happens when we try
to launch the application and that
section checking for bluetooth happens
so we'll go ahead and try and launch the
app and immediately what we'll get is
the system dialog notifying the user
that we want to enable bluetooth and we
can either allow that to happen or not
so we're going to go ahead and able
bluetooth by hitting allow and it'll
take a moment to turn on but now we're
ready to go so at this point if I decide
to launch the application again we
should get into the UI now notice that
immediately this application starts
scanning so that the progress indicator
in the corner will be showing as long as
the Bluetooth scans are in process and
as we're going through you can see that
it very quickly picked up all of the
three beacons that we've placed around
the studio here so in fact if you look
at these you can probably guess which
one of these is in the refrigerator but
notice that we've got the device name
the current temperature value that we're
reading out of this beacons
advertisement and then it's device
address and receive signal strength so
now well we can't necessarily get a
great idea based on the signal strength
of how far away physically these devices
are we can look at them and get sort of
an idea that the more negative the
number the further away so again that
beacon that we've put in the
refrigerator is significantly further
than the other two beacons that we have
much closer here to this device but this
is this application is just continuously
scanning stopping and then scanning
again and as that data comes back for
each scan we're updating the display
here in this list so let's start taking
a look at the code here by looking at
the activity first all right so just
like before we're going to define any of
the uu IDs we need for the service data
but in this case the only information
we're interested in is that single
temperature value so there's quite a few
less things take a look at just as in
the previous example we have that same
access to getting the Bluetooth manager
so there's nothing different there and
as you saw in the example we displayed
all of those values in a list so we have
a ListView here with a custom adapter
for the elements that we'll look at a
little bit shortly and similarly when we
come into the foreground we're going to
be making those same checks for whether
or not we have Bluetooth and whether or
not Bluetooth le support is part of that
so in this example they'll remember that
we weren't manually actually running a
scan we were letting the application
just do regular scans and periodically
all the time while the application was
in the foreground so here we're going to
start a scan as soon as we come up and
then on the converse of that when the
application goes into the background
we're going to cancel any currently
running Bluetooth le scans
okay so notice our start and stop scan
methods look similar but a little bit
different on the stop scan side we're
actually going to be Auto posting yet
another start so we sort of create this
periodic scan where we run the scan for
five minutes
then or five seconds and we're off for
two and a half seconds the other
difference here is that the start le
scan method is actually taking in a
parameter that is a list of uu IDs
whereas before we just called this
directly with the callback element as
the parameter now the cool thing that
this is going to do is it means that in
our on le scan method we're only going
to get back devices that publish one of
more of these services inside of their
advertisements so this is going to
filter out for us any other Bluetooth le
devices that might have come up on
discovery that don't meet this
particular criteria so that we don't
have to do any of that work ourselves
okay so we take a look at the on le scan
method remember that in this example we
don't have to make a connection to any
of these devices we're just going to get
all the information we need out of the
advertisement so all the interesting
stuff actually happens here inside of on
le scan okay so after we've gotten a new
callback for one of these devices the
first thing that we're going to do is
we're going to parse out all of this the
ad records that we're inside of that
scan so remember this parameter scan
record from before this is the actual
raw data of that advertisement payload
and what we've created in this example
here is just a very simple parser that
we can go look at that will take the
data from that scan record and parse it
out into those three element chunks for
the length type identifier and the
payload for each advertisement data
structure so we're going to parse
through that entire record find all the
structures and then return them back in
a list so this is just a very simple
model that allows us to block out those
elements from the
raw data so then once we have that data
back we can determine first of all if
there were any records and if there were
just sort of log some basic information
out about what we found and then we've
created yet another simple little model
to represent one of our temperature
beacons so in here we're going to pass
in to create one of these the list of
all the records that we just parsed out
as well as some basic information such
as the device's address and the received
signal strength and then we're going to
look through to find any of the
advertisement records that are specific
to our temperature beacon and the only
ones that we're interested in are the
advertisement data structure that
advertises the device name and the
structure that advertises service data
now specifically in case there's more
than one we are going to also determine
that for any service data records we
find that the cert the UUID published in
that service data record is the
thermometer service or the temperature
value that we're interested in so it's
whenever we find either one of those
records we're going to use these methods
we've created to parse out that specific
data type into a name and into our
current temperature value okay so then
we're going to get one of these created
for every beacon that we find and as we
just continue to scan over and over
again through the lifetime of the
application these new beacons will pop
in as they get discovered and then we're
we're passing each beacon we find up to
a handler using that same pattern we
used in a previous example so but this
case if we look at the handler it's much
simpler rather than trying to go through
and initiate all of these connections
and stuff like that instead we just want
to take that beacon that we found and we
created add it to a collection again
primarily so that if we find the same
beacon multiple times we won't show it
multiple times in the list so we're
using this collection to uniquely key
each beacon so that if every time we
scan for it we know it's the same one so
we're keying that based off of the
device address and then placing the
beacon in that collection and then at
that point we're updating our list
adapter that we've created and telling
it to update the display so the only
additional piece here is to take a look
at the adapter that we've really created
just to override how these are going to
display so we've created a special
instance called a beacon adapter that
really only has one customization of its
getview method so inside of get view
we're going to take a look at one of the
list elements and pull out the
individual beacon that we're going to
display and simply display sort of in a
column based fashion which you saw in
the example there the name current
temperature device address and receive
signal strength now additionally you may
notice that just so that we could be a
little bit clever we've also decided to
vary the color of the text based on the
temperature so we've got a very simple
set of mathematics here that's just
going to determine based on the current
temperature where the value lives in a
range between zero and forty degrees C
and then set the red-blue blend of the
text color based on that so that if it's
zero degrees or less it will show up as
pure blue forty degrees or more will be
pure red and anything more close to room
temperature will be some blend of the
two so then we're going to take that
text color and we apply it to each of
the text views inside of our list item
so then at this point this application
will just continue to run as it's in the
foreground running through these
periodic scans so for five seconds will
look for new beacons and then for two
and a half seconds will stop and then
pause and come again and as long as
these beacons are continuing to
advertise their temperature will just
update that value in the list over and
over and at that point we've created
this sort of field if you will of
temperature beacons that we can come in
and read the data from without having to
make any connections or do any of that
additional overhead so this is fast and
it's simple and it's very effective so
today we saw two examples of
implementing Bluetooth le api's
within Android applications we looked at
connecting peripherals for reading
sensor data over the long term and
observing broadcast advertisements from
simple sensors providing more limited
data if you'd like to get your hands on
some of these accessory beacons why
