so this presentation is called the new
hotness how we use all these things to
make an accessibility testing API so
first I'm a Viking so I want to hear
everybody do their best Viking yell one
two three all right good
these are my slides can be found at uh
new - hotness Karl groves - sandbox comm
I'm an accessibility consultant for a
company called the posse yellow group
posse yellow group is located in New
Hampshire that's not where I'm located
I'm located here with you guys the I
actually live in Baltimore we have
people who work at the paschal group who
were in France Ireland Scotland the UK
Australia and all over the place anyway
so I'm also the co-founder and managing
member of a company called Tennant I oh
but talk a little bit about that today
you can follow me on Twitter at Karl
groves and you can go to my website and
read all sorts of stuff about
accessibility at Karl groves comm can
someone get the door so we're gonna talk
about like the the modern tool sets the
modern workflows of of developed web
developers these days I started working
on my first web site back in the 90s
actually when mosaic was the was the
dominant browser and and compared to you
know the tools today compared to the
stuff then it's it's absolutely
incredible and we're gonna be talking
about all sorts of things that can can
make our workflows a lot more efficient
and and increase the quality in the
accessibility world talking about tools
is really sort of like bad ok
and it's because a lot of the I don't
know the anti tool atmosphere came from
some stuff I'll talk about and a little
bit later in the presentation but but
for me I like to think of too
things as as being contributors to the
human races a evolution to the dominant
species on the planet okay that's the
creation of tools and the discovery of
fire right with fire we could then
increase our you to take a protein it
made the pro the actual protein easier
to eat when we took it and the tools
that we invented the very first tools
that anthropologists have discovered
were primarily they think used for
scraping the fur off the animals I think
you'll City could could cook it if the
tools are really great right everything
that's around us right now is Korean
boys created by tools I mean I don't see
any trees right it and the the very
thing that we're talking about the web
is created by tools the evolution of
tools is is why the web even exists
tools are everywhere tools are great and
we're gonna use them so at that you know
I'm gonna talk about stuff like project
boiler plates and scaffolding I'll talk
about templating I'll talk about
server-side and client-side frameworks
version control unit testing task
automation and automated building
deploys obviously I'm not going to be
talking about all of these things in the
hour that we have with each other up
there there's not going to be a ton of
detail here but but we are gonna cover
them so so one of the very first and and
most easy to understand tools that we
have available to us now are things like
boiler plates right we saw we saw some
of this stuff really early on with them
with with templates and now you can you
can just go ahead and grab your html5
boilerplate at the web site for for the
html5 boilerplate dot-com and you can go
there you can download it or you can
even create a custom build and if you
create your custom build you'll be able
to include stuff like the latest
versions of jQuery and a standard fav
icon and all sorts of other stuff as a
matter of fact there's also lots of
additional resources that you can get to
when you when you go there and this will
be relevant to the guy I was talking to
in the front here there are some
additional items here you can grab you
can actually grab some
some of the other Jesus anyway these
guys include stuff like Apache config
files that you can download as part of
the their work and nginx config files
and stuff like that and then of course
there's there's an even better you know
project scaffolding tool called yeoman
yeoman is phenomenal I'll talk I'll
touch it a little bit more on yeoman
later in the context of grunt and gulp
and stuff but yeoman you can you can
grab yeoman generators for all sorts of
projects so for instance the guy that
was just speaking in this room was
talking about chromecast you can you can
you can scaffold out and a chrome dev
tool extension using yeoman because
somebody's already done a lot of the
work that to create that the backbone of
the stuff there right we have templating
stuff I mean if you're if you if anybody
here writes PHP you know Smarties been
around for forever
we have handlebars and must mustache
pure templates does anybody used any of
these pure templates are kind of cool
cuz they're like Jason but they don't
have any of the logic built into them
from from stuff like handlebars and then
if there's Ruby folks here there's
Hamill and we have libraries like jQuery
lodash we make a ton of use of lodash at
at tenon lodash is great because it's
got a lot of utility functionality that
you know that that is built before you
uh then we have frameworks like backbone
and knockout
so these give us a great framework for
starting an MVC or mvvm type project
everybody writing writing notes I got
the slides up it's okay
and in version control I didn't link
these two if you've used them you'll
know why
and then there's then of course there's
get and that can help you do version
control and we didn't have this stuff
when I when I started working on web
stuff we had CVS which it's I'm happy to
have survived that era in my life
without jumping out of window another
thing that the web has that we didn't
have when I first started that regular
software devs had was unit testing and
so now we have all sorts of awesome
stuff like queue unit and jasmine and
mocha and chai and PHP unit and J unit
and B hat and and node unit and these
are all really awesome unit testing
frameworks that you're an idiot not to
use I'm gonna demonstrate some of these
later so don't worry about writing
everything down and then there's all
sorts of products out there that can let
us do automated build and deploy of our
project so we can we can run something
like Travis CI bamboo or worker to
automatically build and deploy our stuff
so that you know if you're using FTP for
well anything you really shouldn't be
because these tools exist out here to do
all sorts of great stuff to make sure
that before you launch
you're not launching broken stuff and
then there's task automation like grunt
and gulp and and unfortunately these
things all exist and are great for
front-end developers and and and the
accessibility community is totally and
completely left behind they've left
themselves behind in my opinion because
they don't take advantage of some of
this stuff and I've been talking about
this for a while mainly in terms of the
fact that we aren't taking advantage of
the increased level of efficiency that
we get so for instance with with gulp
and grunt I can do all sorts of great
stuff like automatically minimizing my
JavaScript and my CSS files I can
compile my sass files I can I I can lint
my code I can even do my unit testing
directly from a task and grunt and and
so an accessibility the accessibility
people they just want to come along
behind and sort of
try to make it look like they're doing
something great and efficient when
they're not this is for those who can't
see this is a picture of a cardboard
cutout of a Ferrari Testarossa on
something else so it's separate and
unequal they're the methodologies behind
accessibility testing these days is
really nowhere near on par with the
regular software unit testing and
acceptance testing methodologies I want
to give you some history as to why this
is so when you know when we talk about
accessibility and we talk about some of
the challenges people face the
challenges that people face from an
accessibility standpoint are based upon
the the UI and the objects that are
presented on screen in the UI and the
relationships between those things back
in the day a long time ago when we were
when people were just interacting with
the terminal creating a tool that would
that would read out the content on the
screen is really trivial right you just
take this information that's going to
standard output and you shoot it through
the speakers into instead of the screen
but when Windows came around when
especially with Windows 95 and the real
huge proliferation of computers and
personal computers that was that was
spawned from Windows 95 now we had a GUI
to interact with and now people who
couldn't see it who couldn't see where
the stuff was on the screen had a huge
problem what the hell am I supposed to
click on right what is this thing then
clicking on and how am I supposed to
interact with it it's a completely
different paradigm and so and and and
that was even made worse for users youth
though those users were even left
further behind when we started to see
the web come get really really popular
now everything was on the web and now we
really have to have have a problem and
so accessibility advocates were there
sort of in the early days of the web
people people like my boss Mike Posse
ello were there to sort of try to say
okay wait we got to figure this out we
got to figure out how to make this stuff
accessible and so we did start seeing
automatic
testing tools out there like there's one
called Bobby and then Bobby actually
prevented me from getting hired so I
hate Bobby because because I was a
brilliant I was the genius who decided I
wanted to be a web developer back in the
late 90s in the DC area and and and I
was like I'm just gonna I'm gonna change
from being a recreational web developer
to a professional and I'm gonna apply to
all these jobs and section 5 way came
out went
does anybody know 1998 when was I trying
to get a job in the web 1998 and where
was I was in the DC area so I'm applying
for jobs at government agencies and and
what we call Beltway bandits which are
Raytheon and Lockheed Martin and stuff
and and I'd be like here's the you know
everybody wanted to see a sample of your
work right so I'd send her a sample of
my work and they'd be like sorry this
didn't pass a bobby check I'm like what
the hell is Bobby and I start hearing
this so often I figured out what Bobby
was and it was this freaking tool that
analyzed my code to see whether it was
accessible or not and that's actually
how I got into accessibility because I
got obsessed with this I was pissed
because this stupid tool wasn't helping
me get a job so for those who can't see
the the screen this is a picture I'm
dating myself I'm dating a bunch of you
guys too it's a screen capture from
history of the world part 1 and it's
when it's the cavemen when they're
discovering fire doesn't this guy like
light himself on fire or something yeah
yeah so though and
yeah yeah and so bobby was um bobby was
a bobby was created by I forget who
created it but but they were bought by a
company called watch fire who was then
bought by IBM and so it became part of
an IBM rational tool said and all this
sort of stuff but bobby was automatic
testing tool and accessibility people
like the the real accessibility people
hated Bobby because of a for a couple of
reasons one was that it it sent forth a
lot of these things called false
positives accessibility tool vendors
tend to have this kitchen-sink mentality
where they want to try to find every
freaking thing that they possibly can
even stuff that may not actually be a
problem and so that was that you get a
lot of vitriol on mailing list if you go
back to the early 2000s on the web aim
list you'll see people you mentioned
Bobby like a new person to accessibility
mentions Bobby and then it's like a
freaking rugby team just jumps on top of
them going automated tools are bad and
then the other person runs away after
tools like that we saw a browser plugins
and toolbars like wave or like the
functional accessibility tester or
Firefox accessibility toolbar and then
we saw online checkers like Cynthia says
FA e in wave which were which sort of
also joined the Bobby thing and then we
started seeing what I call the monoliths
so not long after that you know the web
started really taking off did we start
seeing companies that started creating
web based applications right I mean
that's why companies like Oracle even
exist because they were making web based
applications and accessibility tool
vendors are no different some of the
early accessibility tool vendors like DQ
and SSB Bart group created desktop
applications high software did too so
ACC verify was a desktop application a
cc monitor DQ had ramp ascend SSB Bart
group had
in InFocus and then of course the the
sensibility of making a web based
application sort of struck everybody and
said and said now I can just create one
version and and deploy it on the web and
yeah and and and all that sort of stuff
and these things sort of they decided
that they wanted to be the the be-all
and end-all of everything accessibility
so that they would they would feature a
spider that could crawl your site and
they would each page would get tested
along the way and they had their own
issue tracking system and SSB hive
software and the EQ all three of them
tried to create a create features that
would automatically fix your code and
like I said they wanted to be everything
the thing that they ended up doing
though was what was twofold first was
they created this separation between
accessibility and everything else so
accessibility was now done on a
completely different tool set so when we
started seeing mature issue tracking
systems like HP Quality Center and and
and all these other LD Atlassian product
JIRA and all this sort of stuff you'd
have your you'd have your issue tracking
for everything else on QC and JIRA and
then you'd have your extra separate
system oh he out here for accessibility
and I would argue that that made it easy
to marginalize accessibility and and
there's another huge massive problem
that happened with these tools that I
haven't yet discussed and that is the
false positive problem is exacerbated by
the fact that they're they're not
testing for accessibility they're doing
linting all these tools did did a static
analysis on the on the source that you
would see if you viewed source on a page
not the Dom right so section 508
happened to come out in 1998 but section
508 and the work on WIC egg one was
started much earlier in the 90s and
there was an admonition in 508 that
basically says you can't use JavaScript
and that's not really what it says but
that
what it means is because and because
this was before the days of Dom
rendering of assistive technologies and
so they were just like a it don't
use JavaScript and that was the that was
the admonition but when we started
seeing Dom rendering in assistive
technologies that's that there was no
longer a problem really I mean obviously
it's a problem if you write shitty
JavaScript but it's not now you can't
just say don't use JavaScript because of
the fact is everybody uses JavaScript
javascript is awesome and and you should
be allowed to use it but now how do you
test for it so before we could say oh
well you're not supposed to be using
javascript anyway so we'll test you due
to static analysis but what if you're
what if you're trying to now test the
JavaScript to make sure the JavaScript
is accessible or at least the results of
the JavaScript is accessible so this is
why we started to need headless browsers
in their tools and so this is my picture
of the headless horseman and so some of
the earliest headless browsers that
existed were Rhino and and I
experimented a little bit with
accessibility testing with Rhino and and
my brain couldn't understand Zul at the
time but then I came across this project
from MIT called simile and simile was a
basically a headless browser that had
sort of an api to it and and and
similarly was I think it was actually
right now but it was MIT project it's
now abandoned where but that I think
somebody else is using it to create web
scrapers and do data mining and then not
too long after that well probably I
don't know three or four years ago we
saw zombie anybody ever use Dom bjs
zombies really cool and I tried using
zombie and I found it to be really
really really brittle even worse than
Phantom but zombie was really brittle
and it just didn't do what I wanted and
then we saw phantom j/s and so like
phantom Jas and node and grunt are like
the trifecta of Awesome because
everything that runs like unit testing
these days if you use in unit testing or
especially if you're doing
BDD style acceptance testing it's
probably going to use phantom
Samantha was a headless version of
WebKit and as a matter of fact tenon
uses tenon uses phantom J s phantom J s
is a is a really huge pain in the ass
for a couple of reasons though because
it does off for exception handling
and so it's one thing when you're
testing your own code and fan some sort
of craps all over itself no problem but
if you're trying to test you know the
websites of the everybody else then you
have a huge problem but anyway phantom
is really awesome Slimer Jas is it uses
the same exact
API structure as phantom Jas but it runs
a headless version of Firefox but so
ultimately we have these monolithic
tools right these be-all-end-all tools
that are out there that want to be our
issue tracker and our accessibility
testing tool and and all that sort of
stuff and that creates this this as I
was referring through this separation
between accessibility and everything
else so accessibility is a thing that we
do after the fact you know going back to
my going back to my picture of the
cardboard Ferrari Testarossa
that's where accessibility comes in
they're like okay all your development
is done now we're gonna poke it with
worldspace
or amp great you know like what are you
gonna do the Train on that inaccessible
codes already left the station right
you're doing accessibility after the
fact and you're not going to get that
train to turn around the track doesn't
go in in two directions right it's it's
the trains left and you're not pulling
it back so this is why I wanted to talk
about doing integration and not
separation when I talk about integration
what I'm really talking about is I don't
want accessibility or the accessibility
tool to be a completely separate tool
right so if you're doing so if you've
chosen your unit test framework to be
q-- unit then I want you to be able to
use Q unit for all your testing or if
it's mocha or whatever or as a matter of
fact I like to use Karma which lets me
use mocha and chai and all that but I
want it to be whatever you're doing I
want it to be part of that
okay whatever you're using for any of
that stuff I wanted to be part of that I
want to also get into the development
cycle early okay there's a there's if
you read about about accessibility and
project management you'll hear people
talk about well we need accessibility
touch points and we want our touch
points in we want our touch points in
the procurement phase and we want our
touch points in the requirements phase
we want our touch points in the design
phase and all other stuff and that's
that's great right because there's an
effective project management that's what
you want especially if your waterfall
but the problem is that that especially
sort of in that waterfall model you have
this touch point at the end of each
milestone so great so now what so we're
at the end of this milestone we want to
get to our next milestone now what the
hell do we do if we've discovered
everything's inaccessible or even an
even an agile workshop what you're
talking about is you're gonna have the
QA testers do the the accessibility
testing after the codes checked in right
so that's the last part of our of our
sprint is having the QA people poke at
it or something like that no in agile we
want people testing their own work right
so our definition of done is is all
tests passed and I'll go checked in
right so where do we put the
accessibility when the developers doing
the testing so we want to become part of
the existing processes whatever that
looks like and the thing is with an
external accessibility testing tool what
ends up happening is that it's it's oh
 we don't have time for that we're
gonna do that later or something like
that and so it becomes a separate
process or an additional step in the
process and not part of the process and
so we want to work within any existing
automation any existing test
methodologies any unit testing framework
so if we're doing BDD if we're doing
selenium testing on nightly builds
whatever that looks like we want to be
able to do that so that's why I came up
with tenon it's kind of I wanted a
woodworking image but then I saw this
does anybody know what this is
the Wankel rotary engine right so so art
huh
yeah probably before my time cliff sorry
but I chose the Wankel image because of
the fact that uh that it was it does the
exact same thing right we have our four
cycle ignition process only no pistons
we have the we have this big rotor crazy
thing in it and as it turns it
compresses and then the compressed gas
is fired and then it's ejected and I
forgot about the intake cycle but
whatever and so what that's what I like
about the image is it's talking about
doing the exact same thing just in a
different way so here's that here's an
example of what tenon does and as a
matter of fact I'm gonna I'm gonna skip
the slides now and just go into what we
do so tenon is is an API right so so it
and it's root it's actually got a
command-line interface and I can go
tenon bigger font tenon HTTP Amazon
right and the tenant service is grabbed
I passed a bunch of options I inject a
bunch of scripts into the page and I get
a JSON response which is really terribly
useless when you're looking at the
command-line right because that's like
great now what do I do it tells you how
many errors and all that stuff that you
have but but that the possibilities here
are limitless now because I'm all I'm
doing is I'm sending it over a request
of the page I want to test and I get the
response now what can I do with that
well I can make a web application out of
it
so I can do so here's a here's a the
tenon public testing page I can either
enter source or I can enter our website
URL so
by the way this code for this demo is on
bitbucket on an open repository it's
built using react Jas and so you can
download it and play with it so if you
ever wanted to see your reaction that's
it so we now have we've basically taken
that Jason response and piped it into
here and the Jason response tells us all
sorts of interesting things like screen
size and so on and so forth if he has
anyone ever used postman postman is
really cool if you so postman allows you
to test restful stuff or like API stuff
so so here's an example of testing with
postman now what's cool about this
though is I'm going to show you first
off that was really fast I'm gonna show
you some of the other parameters so
let's say you wanted to test the
responsive design anybody have a
responsive website that they want to
share what's that coding house and what
do you read what what do your
breakpoints in it oops so let's do 300
by 600 so we'll send we'll set it over
at 300 by 600
so many problems on the site that we're
just waiting and waiting there we go
nope so so let's see here so here's our
viewport it gets returned to us and we
see how many issues we have so let's see
how many we have at the bottom of the
response is gonna have our issue counts
let's see status density errors so we
have total errors 29 it total issues 47
total warnings 18 so let's go back and
test it at 1024 by 768
oops
so now we have our response and 2947 18
okay let's do so this is one fly SFO
calm so this one has 31 and 38
let me change them to 600 by 3
19 and 18 so something happened in their
responsive design that is they basically
hid stuff that had accessibility
problems on the desktop view so it's
more accessible in mobile right now some
of the other things that we can do is
yes that's true and that's an important
distinction what cliff is referring to
is that just because you have fewer
automatically testable errors does not
always correlate to a more accessible
experience but now there's lots of other
opportunities for for something like
this so Dirk is going to give a
presentation on extending your doing
making stuff in your browser so I'm
going to corner him later and ask him to
work with me on a chrome dev tools
extension but this is a picture of Chris
Patrick's web accessibility toolbar so
you can you can add tenon to that and
then tenon you click on that and it'll
post right over to to the tenon web
service so it's integrated into the web
developer toolbar or you can do so this
is something that I worked on last night
so this is called tenon as you browse
and let's see so what I created I
actually worked on this last night which
is a jQuery plug-in that takes all the
API parameters and and runs it as it as
a jQuery plugin you just put it at the
bottom of your page where your other
JavaScript is and every page that gets
that gets access by users as they browse
they're actually testing your site for
you because it submits that post over to
the tenon API and tests it now what's
really cool is it takes a hash of the of
the page content
it takes the page content it hashes it
and stores that so let's say you had a
really high traffic website then your
home page gets access to you know a
thousand times
you know before lunch it's not gonna
test that page a thousand times because
I don't want that on my server and you
don't want that that traffic lag so it
hashes it so it only tests that once if
your page changes because you fixed it
then it then it retests it so simple as
that a simple jQuery plugin can be used
to post that request sure yeah exactly
but what's cool about that now is that
you can explicitly set the parameter of
say what parts to test right so you can
say okay I don't test the entire page
you can test so one of the things that
you can do like let's say it's a
wordpress site write all the posts in a
wordpress site have a class of post so
you put that in your jquery selector and
that's good that's what content gets
tested so here's another thing we could
do a grunt plug-in so here's a grunt
plug-in that we created so here's the
the task here so the big difference
between grunt and gulp is that in grunt
you basically create this this this
plug-in and you configure the task gulp
is a different story all together
because gulp can work on streams and
it's really freaking awesome and I'll
show you guys that in a bit but so
here's the grunt tenon so in my grunt
file and I apologize because phpstorm
doesn't increase the font size well but
what we have here is in our tenon task
I'm gonna have it test all of the items
in there in the static directory so all
my static pages are in that directory
I'm also gonna have it passed a URL here
I'm gonna test amazon.com and I have a
timeout for I'm certainly long amount of
time but I can so imagine this that that
we're a standard developer workflow
right we have a grunt task set up the
lint to run Janus and jaslyne
J SCS whatever you have you can even set
it up as a watch task and now I can just
run
grunt tenon and it's gonna go to this
it's gonna go against the server what's
that in yeah check you out
where's terminal at good job there so
while we were doing that we found our
issues we found a budget whoo that's
weirdness
thanks for let's do this again so we're
testing amazon.com I like testing Amazon
they probably hate me cuz they get
they're seeing the tenon you ice trick
you a string over and over but anyway so
here's just just like a just like just
like lint just like running j/s lint as
a grunt task you're gonna get your
errors in a nice blurry presentation and
it's gonna tell you whether you've
gotten errors or not now what you can do
is you can can you can configure the
grunt task to give you a pass or fail so
then what you that what you do here so
in this scenario you're a developer
you're working in your IDE or whatever
you're gonna run the task and then
you're gonna get the results but let's
say if you're in a now you're let's say
you're doing an automated build scenario
and so now you have a grunt task running
as part of your bamboo build tasks and
now you want your grunt tenon just pass
a true or false a pass or fail right and
then if it fails because you have
accessibility issues then it turns your
build red so we don't go or you have a
configurable threshold of how many or
whatever the case may be the idea here
is that in the developer workflow
they're just testing your work as you go
you want the errors back you want the
information back in an automated build
scenario you don't want something
getting shipped that has bad
accessibility problems
another thing you could do though is you
can just meet because it's Jason you do
whatever you want with it right so if
it's if you are if you're running stuff
that you that you need to be able to use
a j-unit report format you just stick
the Jason and you pipe it into the
format for the XML for j-unit or
something stupid simple like a CSV file
so now let's talk about some of the
quality stuff because this is what the
topic is about it's how we use all these
tools on tenon itself so this is any PHP
people here so this is code ception this
is a gift that I stole out the code
ception
psych so we use because the UI on tenon
is PHP we use code ception for all of
our tests and the cool thing about code
ception is it allows us to do both TB TB
b and BDD so I can do testing on whether
or not the API is actually returning the
information that I want and I can also
do BDD to make sure that that the actual
workflows work so here's a gift that
shows all those things happening and
then and then we unit tests that the API
itself to make sure that it's running
everything so so a basic example here
we're running node unit we're testing
the the command-line bit here and we're
testing we're actually doing all the
unit tests here and we run 67 tests to
make sure that the API is actually
returning the stuff that we need that it
calculates all those things like the
number of issues and all that sort of
stuff we use a worker for our builds
anybody use anybody seen worker before
anybody use Travis ok bamboo same sort
of principle right it's the same sort of
principle you've set up your tasks and
it goes through it and so each of our
projects has their own worker build
system build script in place and and it
runs all of our unit tests and all that
sort of stuff so whenever we commit to
master it it runs through this these
tasks and pushes it if it's good and it
dumps it if it isn't and then there's
the other here's the
big deal let's see how many slides I got
okay so I'm gonna show you guys two more
things in the UI has anybody ever used
browsersync
who said that of course Derk so we
switched so we switched from all of our
project so we have in a tenon we have
about I don't know seven different repos
for some of the different bits and
pieces and and we switched from grunt to
gulp and we just haven't looked back the
difference that people talk about
between grunt and gulp is that it's
configuration versus actually writing
the functionality basically you can you
can create all your functionality using
using gulp and it's right right there
for you and we we switched right to gulp
and I'm not looking back but one of the
cool things I really like about one of
the things that we built in is browser
sync so I'm gonna go to I'm gonna I'm
gonna type in gulp watch so gulp watch
is a lot like grunt watch in that it
will watch for files that are changed in
and it will spit out a PHP error but
that's actually cuz browser sync is is
lagging somehow so it's running all our
tests it's pushing our stuff to our to
our dist:4 alright so now should be able
to go back to localhost 3000 there we go
so this is the this is the big so this
is a where we saw it goes to localhost
3,000 is where browsersync wants to
launch the site so I'm gonna put this in
Safari I have it in Chrome and I'm gonna
put it in Firefox so what's great about
browser saying cuz you can test all your
work in in different browsers as you're
working so as a watch task it's gonna go
ahead and and do do the watching so I'm
gonna go down here to my sass folder
and let's see I'm gonna go to styles
that CSS and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna put a border around body
so I put a red border around it what oh
yeah so there we saw that it injected
the new the newly compiled CSS file to
Chrome and to Safari and to Firefox
I love browser sync for that you could
they they also offer the ability for you
to not use localhost but use another IP
that you can then test stuff with so
that's really awesome
so then the other part about this that I
wanted to show you guys first off I'm
gonna get rid of that before my partner
goes ones everything Rudd so we so I
mentioned unit testing before and we use
karma because it allows us to use a
couple of different frameworks for our
testing and so we can use we can use
karma for both TDD and BDD one of the
things that we do is before we get a
test before we push a test out live to
be testing against other people's stuff
we want a unit test our test so it's
like Inception right because we're
testing the tests where it's unit
testing the tests that test other
people's stuff and what I love about
this though what's really great about
this this approach is that now it lets
us it lets us do this sort of I guess
live debugging right so unit testing is
one thing unit testing is great for
especially test-driven development where
you want to you're gonna write your test
it's gonna fail automatically and then
you're gonna fix your code so that it
passes that's like this sort of the big
mantra of TVB but what what else is
really cool is now you now you know okay
this is performing at least how I wrote
my test and then if the time comes that
something happens and you're like yeah
that's really not meeting user
expectations well you just you just fix
your code and retest it you know you you
adjust your test you fix the code and so
on and so forth so we had an issue not
too long ago with this one wet which is
what I call tid 73 and 73 is our is our
accessibility test for stupid link text
right and stupid link text is stuff like
click here more read more all that sort
of stuff and so we have let's say click
here read read more learn more continued
go continue reading view view more view
less all that sort of stuff
and and we had a problem where
accessibility people will tell me
that and and something we didn't think
of at the time is that the accessible
name for a link is derived from the text
within the link if the link only
consists of an image if the accessible
name is calculated by the a T as being
the alt attribute so people so we we
came out with our private beta and
immediately had people saying hey wait a
minute
I have an image link that has this
that's not getting caught and so we
created this new it's just a new fixture
the test for the test for the alt
attribute and we had the test our we had
to adjust our test so we have a fixture
here and then we have a so we have a
chai should assertion so it says and
sorry for those you can't see it so
elements dot length should equal 73 and
so we just adjusted the test and now I
can run NPM test and it's gonna it's
gonna test all this stuff what's really
cool to then I like about about using it
this way is I'll let this show you how
it passes so now it says 79 to 79 the
other cool part about this is that it
opens an instance of chrome and if you
click on the debug and then go to then
you go to your console you'll get an
actual test by test feedback on the in
in the console it logs the console each
one of these so tid success 73 unhelpful
link text bound and then we unit test
this thing which we had to create which
we call a 11 why visible because
visibility of content like if it's if
it's display:none versus visibility
hidden versus off screen and all this
sort of stuff we have this utility
function we had to add that and and so
that's that's how we go about making
sure each of the test is good and during
this we have this also this build
process behind the scenes that creates
both the unit test file and the test
file that gets tested and basically if
the unit test does
Pass if this list of fixtures doesn't
pass then then the test file is just
tossed aside and we use the old one
which is like our known good
it's our single source source of truth
so that's it thank you very much I have
tenon stickers up here for you if you're
like the laptop sticker kind of person I
have a bunch of them so come get them
all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
