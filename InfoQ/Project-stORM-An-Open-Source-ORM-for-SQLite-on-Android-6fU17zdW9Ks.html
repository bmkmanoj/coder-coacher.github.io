David Chandler Android developer
advocate with Google and I've been with
Google about two years I'm based in
Atlanta tonight I just wanted to give
you a little preview of a simple
template based object relational mapping
tool to be truthful I came up with the
name storm because I thought it was cool
and then I figured out what s and T
stood for so but but that's what it is
so we try to write a lot of code on the
Android developer relations team and I'm
fairly new to the team I came in January
so one of the first things that I
noticed when I started doing Android
development as I said well I want to
persist off the database on the phone
it's really cool that has sequel light
and I'm like so you know where's my
where's my ORM because I'm used to
having something like hibernate on the
server it makes it real easy to do that
and there were there are a few Oh RMS
out there but I wasn't completely
satisfied with what was there so I
decided to write one besides I needed
something to do for the last month you
know anyway so that's what i'm showing
you tonight this is kind of a i'm
calling it a preview because we're as a
team we're interested in constantly and
improving the state of android tooling
and in making it easier for developers
to write their first android app or any
android app so we are trying to beef up
the adt and the android developer tools
and you've probably seen in last month
or so we've come out with application
templates and we're continuing to add
more of those 44 new types of apps and
we also have a way now for you to create
your own templates we're talking about
adding a hook for annotation processing
which is something that this software
uses so that if you have an Android
library that comes through like the
official download manager then you could
have that run an annotation processor
automatically or configure it in Eclipse
automatically something like that so
that that should hopefully increase the
scope of tooling and
I guess some of the things that are
possible there so I want to spend like
the first part of tonight talking about
storm and then we'll get to this the
second part I have a few minutes left
i'll talk basic HTTP client which is
another open source project I did for
android so how many I assume everybody
here is an Android developer is that
true you like you've written hello world
forever okay so those of you who haven't
I'm not going to try to do any Android
101 stuff tonight we're just going to
jump right into what this thing is but a
high-level sequel aight is a sequel
database that's on the phone and you can
use it in your apps the api's that are
there are pretty low level so when you
want to use a database you have to write
your create table statements you have to
pretty much hand code all your sequel
there's a few convenience methods that
let you use objects like content values
to do an insert but some way or another
you're going to have to take the
contents of any java objects that you
have i'm going to call them pojos
tonight your plain old java object and
call the various buying methods or
convert them to strings and pass them as
arguments or somehow you know get them
to be part of a sequel statement that
doesn't answer to query update whatever
it may be right so what I'm going to
show you tonight is really just a little
bit of tooling that that writes that
code for you and what is really a very
efficient way right so let me jump the
next slide so nobody likes to hand code
sequel well maybe some people do
actually I know some people do I take
that back any deviation the room who
love to hand code sequel sequel light
already has some object like rappers the
content values objects there's in the
database I think its database utils
there's an insert method that takes a
Content values object so it's just
essentially a map of properties and then
on the other side you have your your
cursor object which you can call one row
at a time and call the various get
methods like get short get long get int
for the appropriate field type and then
get a property out of cursor so these
are these are kind of object like but
what I really like to be able to do is
actually you know have a dao class the
data access object may be server-side
terminology and just do a dao insert and
give it my actual Java object and have
it figure out how to get that into the
sequel right so that's what this does so
a lot of apps just require a place to
stuff objects I don't they don't need
the full relational power of the
database you might not need referential
integrity and all that in fact it's not
even enabled by default and you're in
your Android apps and then existing or
m's I mentioned earlier tend to use
reflection which isn't a big deal in
Java nowadays but it does make your code
a little harder to debug if you're
trying to figure out what's going on
deep down in the internals or the
require upfront modeling like green Dao
so I have to ask are the authors of
these projects here because this is San
Francisco where a lot of this stuff
happens you've been using Greendale for
a while okay use what
using a customized version ok cool so
from what I've looked at Greendale I
have looked a lot but you you have to
create your schema first and set up you
know its modeling basically so what I
was looking for was something that was
really easy and embraced all the latest
fads like convention over configuration
was annotation driven will do code
generation so you can debug it easier
and also we'll leave that alone for now
well it's performant as well and then
has minimal performance overhead so the
generated code that you're going to look
at is going to be almost identical to
the code that you would write by hand
the only step that's different is they
convert the different type conversions
there may be a little overhead there
about for the most part it's what you'd
write by hand okay some non goals of the
project it Google all of our projects
have goals and non goals I think it's
kind of cool right that we actually
think about that so it is not intended
to be a kitchen sink or em there are no
relationship modeling capabilities right
now it's really intended to be just a
convenience for stuffing objects in your
app into the database as a persistence
store another non goal is the absolute
maximum performance possible so I'm okay
with a little overhead if it makes a
generated code easier to read and write
you can override any of that stuff but
if you need absolute max performance
you're probably going to hand code your
stuff so setup steps there's two jars
that you need their storm API which
contains the annotations themselves as
well as the runtime for the framework
and then there's storm apt which is your
actual annotation processor so anybody
actually written a Java annotation
processor before yeah it's fun it's
really it really is fun the coolest
thing about it is that you can make red
squigglies appear in eclipse
right so if there's problems that you
detect as you're processing the source
code then you can just log those to the
annotation processor and it puts up a
red squiggly in Eclipse I think it's
really cool to be able to do that it's
actually really useful too as you'll see
here when we get going a little bit so
let me just show you what this looks
like I've got a little sample project
going here storm demo I will just show
you that i have on the build path i
actually have not the jar but the whole
project since it's on my machine here
but you could just add the jar and then
the important thing is you need to go
into this order and export tab and check
to export that api jar as well otherwise
the android won't be able to find it
when you try to run the tests on it so
that's that setup and then the other
thing we have under the java compiler we
have annotation processing enabled
that's just checking this box up here
and then on our factory path we have
storm apt jar so this is a feature of
that's been in Java for a while now that
basically it's it's just going to
inspect our source code any time we save
changes and run our annotation processor
it will look for specific annotations
and then it can generate code in
response to those annotations so that's
my project setup
okay so let's let's actually use this
thing first we have to have a database
so to do that we just extend the
database helper class and let me show
you how this goes we'll create another
database here by just creating a class
will call it demo to database helper and
it has to extend a framework class here
database helper this is basically just a
wrapper for your sequel I'd open helper
that you would do anyway zoom this out
here so it gives you the the required
constructor by default and that's fine
that's all you need and then you need to
choose an upgrade strategy which there
are three of them there's drop create
backup restore and upgrade we'll talk
about those in a minute but for a new
database you probably just do drop
create which is the name implies is just
going to drop the tables and create them
fresh so it's it's decent when you're
developing a brand new app ok so that
was easy enough and then we just
annotate this class with the database
annotation yay for red squigglies oh no
what happens
maybe I've got
okay let me save it for someone see if i
can get control one to work no something
is wrong very annoying all right well
anyway we have two attributes we have to
require or supply oh yeah trying to put
it in the wrong place thank you
interesting all right let's see if we
can find out there we go import it and
then we should add the missing
attributes yes thank you so we give it a
name demo2 DB we give it a version
number and save it okay and you've seen
the error log which is a useful view to
keep up when you're working with an
annotation processor you can see we had
a template error I think that was before
and then now we're generating comrade
turbo managed demo TV demo to DB factory
and we'll talk about those classes in
just a second so now we have a database
but actually I don't want this database
I want the other one that I have as part
of this project already so i'm going to
delete that but i just wanted to show
you how to do it one thing when you're
using an annotation processor and you
delete something that has generated code
is that you're going to frequently have
to go clean the project to get rid of
the artifacts right so now we're back to
where we were I'll show you my other
database helper class okay so now we
need an entity so let me create a new
entity
let's call it user group and we'll just
go with that for now so this is my plain
old java object will give it some fields
it needs an ID and by convention here so
far this is what it is it's every object
just needs a long ID and then it also
probably needs a name so we'll do a
private string group name and let's just
do a private date meeting time or
something like this and we want
java.util.date
okay let's generate our require getters
and setters
and that's our class
now to generate the digit the magic for
this I just need to annotate it with at
entity and here the red squigglies come
into play because it turns out i also
need to implement an interface called
persist able and this is up for debate
right now we're on the team there's some
people who don't want that we'd like it
so you don't have to implement or extend
anything persist abul just has a couple
of methods get ID and set ID so those
are used by the current framework but
that's all there is to it so basic class
we got a few fields we're done with that
part okay so this has generated some
code for us we're going to take a look
at that now under the apt generated
folder which you may have to unfiltered
to see this in eclipse if you're using
that we have the database factory class
which tells you it's generated code
right and it just has the static DB name
and DB version coded in there that we
supplied in the annotation it's got a
list of table helper classes which are
the ones that are going to hold all the
sequel for each table and it's got user
group table in here twice probably
because there's a bug so I can clean my
project and get rid of that let me just
do that
let's have a look at that again here
okay now there's only two tables in
there so this just implements a
singleton pattern for getting the
database helper which is your actual
sequel I'd open helper that's part of
Android so if it doesn't exist then it
just creates a new instance and of
course you have to pass it a valid
context because that's required by this
sequel light open helper so that's that
there's really not much to this class
it's just a factory class that needs to
be there because you need something hard
coded that it can pull from when you do
it the sequel light open help recall to
supply the name and version etc okay so
we also have now for our each object
person and user group are the two that
we've modeled we have a dao and a table
class so let's look at the let's look at
user group Dao since that was our one we
did on screen here so this is just a
thin little wrapper class it extends
sequel aight dao which is a generic I'd
base Dao and this is where all the good
stuff lives if we take a look at that
guy you'll see that's where all the fun
methods are delete get list and sir debt
cetera but here basically we have to do
is provide a reference to the
appropriate factory so an entity is
associated with a database and we need
to know which one the idea of multiple
databases is in here although it's not
fully supported yet and then we need the
table helper class where we can get all
of our sequel statements so that's
really all this guy does ok and then we
have a table class and this is where all
the heavy-lifting happens right here so
at the top we have an enum representing
the columns and the convention right now
is just that the column name is all caps
the field name except for ID it has an
underscore because that's the android
sequel light convention we get the table
name we have our create sequel statement
or
Rob's equal upgrade is currently no but
if you want to put in a custom upgrade
statement you could do that by extending
this class then we have several methods
that allow us to convert to and from
objects and this is the kind of code
that you have to write by hand otherwise
so let's take a look at new instance for
example this given a cursor we're just
going to pull one row off the cursor and
create an instance of our user group
object by calling it setters and so we
get we get the string from the cursor we
run it through a converter the string
converter which just returns the string
and then we call the setter and we do
that for each field and going the other
direction we can take our user group
object we can call the various getters
run them through a converter and then
use those values to populate a content
values object and so this is pretty
lightweight there's not a lot of stuff
going on here it's all stuff you're
going to have to write by hand anyway
and there's a bunch of other methods
related to different types of
conversions like you can get an array of
strings that represent the column values
which is useful for other things talk
about that in a second so that's
basically you get those generated
classes and then to use it you just
create a new instance of the entity Dao
past your context and then you can call
the methods on it so let's take a look
at a test case which does a little bit
of this okay so we create a new person
do pass it our context this would be
your application context if you were in
an activity here it's just the the test
instrumentation context we call Dao
insert we give it our object we get back
the ID of the newly inserted object then
we can call Dao get give it the ID we
should get the person back ID should be
the same this is just a little demo
liner
needed there's lots of methods available
on our Dao now we can do like lists all
and get all the objects that are in the
table we can do delete delete all update
we can do insert mini and give it a
whole collection of our objects and it
will do an efficient insert there so
there's a lot lots of stuff that's
available let me point out a few of
those things on this this other slider
oops everyone my power shouldn't need it
for a while so you can see some of the
most useful API methods the insert
insert mini get will just return a
single object update delete list all
will convert it all to a list and then
there's several example methods like
list by example get by example where you
can pass it a pup an example object
where you pop you populate only the
fields that you're interested in and it
will include them then as part of the
query to query for that object and the
way this works is it actually creates a
new instance of the object and then
compares your example object with the
new instance and anything that's
different than the default values it
uses in the query and then there's also
a little convenient filter method which
lets you right now just do add
conditions that are equality conditions
so you can say do dot filter equals give
it the column name the value etc and
then exact the filter so by convention
again the the call name is just the
field name and uppercase and ID is
required it's a long and the column name
is underscore ID and there's currently
no way no way to change that so the
types that are currently supported you
can have any primitive and rapper type
the little be boolean bite cetera as
well as the Big B and string and then
byte arrays are treated as blobs boolean
bite and char all have any
affinity and sequel light so that they
can you can use them different ways seem
like the best way to do it but you could
write your own converter and change that
if you wanted to there's also a type
converter interface with a Java type and
a sequel type and if you want to write
your own converter for your own data
type you can do that you just have to
extend type converter and then annotate
it with ad converter and do a project
clean because I don't yet have the ink
support for at converter in incremental
compilation so some little niceties here
there are a couple of public methods as
lists you pass it a cursor it gets you
back the list of the objects there's
also an as object that will expect to
find one row in one row in the cursor
only this is used like by the get method
and if there's more than one in the
cursor it'll throw it too many results
exceptions so you'll be notified that a
the cursor returned more than you were
expecting the insert mini method uses
the database utils insert helper class
to prepare the statement only once and
then run all the inserts inside a single
transaction which is much better
performance than doing each one
individually the column name eman enum
can be useful like the filter method
gives you some type safety around your
columns as opposed to just putting
string field names in there and of
course read squigglies are kind of cool
so one of the challenges is for
upgrading your database versions and
there's currently three strategies
supported for that the drop create is
the easiest but of course you lose your
data so that's not ideal if you've got a
production app so the other one that's
kind of automatic is the backup restore
strategy which uses CSV files so it will
actually dumped the contents
the current database to a CSV file and
then it will read that CSV file into
your new schema and any columns that
have been I think I have a slide on this
actually so let me just say a couple
more words about the CSV methods here
you can call these methods directly from
the database helper which you can get
from the DAO or the database factory the
database helper has the methods back up
all tables and restore from csv one
thing that it does is it tries to
preserve your data exactly which is a
little bit tricky with things like
doubles so it actually calls the double
to raw long bits method to get the raw
value and then saves it as a hex encoded
value in your CSV file so you wouldn't
be able to read the CSV file with just
any CSV reader and get a meaningful
value out of that double but it does
preserve the exact values so that you'll
reload your database correctly and then
also blobs are base64 encoded so that
they can be safely stored in a CSV so
there's a file named DB name dot V
whatever your version number is that
table name you'll see a bunch of those
files and your if you look in your apps
files when you use this mat them so to
do this automatically all you have to do
is set your upgrade strategy to backup
restore and then any columns that you've
dropped between versions will disappear
any ones that you've added will get the
default values from the object and if
you've renamed any sorry about that it's
not supported yet but we'll be adding
probably a column named annotation or
something like that so that you can add
that at the time you rename a field and
then pull that out of the database and
you could also do it by instead of using
the backup restore strategy you could
use a custom upgrade strategy and you
could manually edit the CSV file and
change the column names if you wanted to
I guess so that they'd be read back into
the
fields but we'll have support for
renaming eventually soon probably so the
last strategy is just upgrade and to do
this you can override the database
helper dot upgrade method in your
database helper class and do whatever
you want in there in terms of migrating
the sequel or you can just override the
on upgrade method for each table
individually if you want to in the table
helpers and that will let you you know
do any rebuilding indexes at alter table
statements or however you want to do
your upgrade
okay so a couple limits no relational
modeling yet also you can't currently
compare doubles or blobs if you're using
a filter builder API because it's hard
to compare exact values of doubles it's
generally a way to get into trouble so
we'll probably be adding like a delta
method that lets you supply a range of
how close it has to be to be an exact
match and blobs I don't think we'll ever
allow I mean somebody wants to add it
that's fine compare blobs but you have
to base64 encode them and it gets kind
of messy that would be inefficient you
can always write your own custom queries
if you want to do these things by using
the DAO query so I already talked about
what these different classes were the
database factory the DAO and the table
helper this one maybe shows graphically
how the main function of the table
helper that it contains all the sequel
all your cursor get and your sorry your
cursor yeah cursor get and your helper
bind methods converts from a cursor to
an object to content values as needed
that's what that's for so the idea was
to construct this so that the the actual
sequel light interactions happens in
that base dao class that's available for
everybody for all your tables and any
the only stuff that's in the generated
code is the actual how do i get an
object from a cursor etc so the base
sequel light class is not generated and
that allows us to do better testing and
debugging of that class so just a few
notes on the implementation here one of
the challenges was supporting
incremental compilation because it turns
out that annotation processing happens
in rounds and when you write an
annotation processor you actually get
passed to you what's called a round
environment which is only the code that
it's looking at during that round and
the idea here
that if you generate code it that
generated code might have annotations
which generate other code so the first
round generates some code and then the
second round looks at that additional
code etc now storm isn't that
complicated it just essentially we need
it just needs one round but
unfortunately because of this
architecture of apt you can only see the
code that was changed during a given
during given save so if you go in and
add an entity annotation the only thing
that your annotation processor is going
to see is that entity and the source
code thats related to that entity it
does not see the entire source tree
right so since we're generating a
database helper or a database factory
class which has to know about all the
available entities and since each entity
has to know about any available
databases then we had I needed some way
to keep track of what had already been
processed in previous rounds right so I
used a file which is about the only way
to do it so you'll actually see in your
eclipse if you look at it under the apt
generated with all your generated code
there's also this file called stormy and
B and it's just a simple little text
file with the information about the
database and each entity in there
actually just the names of the table
helper classes which is really all
that's needed for that stage so if
you're having problems with this in this
preview phase you know project clean
will rebuild this file because when you
do a project clean then all the source
code is available and all the
annotations are available in the project
so that's really how your your processor
is going to work the best ordinarily
okay but by reading in this file before
each round of annotation processing it
does support incremental compilation so
you can go in and just add one new
identity and it works the only thing
that doesn't work yet is the ad
converter this uses free Mercker to do
the code generation so let me show you a
little bit of those templates here's a
database factory FTL it's really pretty
straightforward it's just you can see
though you know it's a lot less fun to
work with Java code in a free market
template than it is in the Java editors
because you don't get all the completion
and syntax highlighting and stuff like
that so that's another reason why I
tried to minimize the amount of Java
code in the that's actually generated
from the templates and these you will
find in the empo project if you check
out the source under the source res
directory just three templates in adi
deo table helper template is probably
the most interesting is pretty big but
that actually doesn't take a whole lot
of code to generate these various
classes
and then the error log view just a
reminder that that that has a few
debugging notes that go in there as the
annotation processor runs so you can
confirm that files are going to the
right place things like that okay so
what does the future hold for this thing
limited limited support for relations we
at least want to be able to do a primary
foreign key relationship so that when
you do a get you could maybe pass a flag
that would say you know also populate
relations and it would then do a second
query or a join to go grab the related
object and pull that in as well i'm not
i'm not inclined to go with lazy loading
or proxy loading or anything like that
like hibernate does because that gets to
be really messy I've been trying to keep
it light weight more filter methods we
need greater than less than you know all
the standard sequel comparisons between
etc the filter builder API currently in
order to properly throw an exception if
you try to do an EQ on a double or a
blob I had to create an overloaded
method for each equals method so you
have an equals it takes a double float
long short etc it's kind of a pain to
have to do that for all of them but
actually there is a little bit of value
in that in terms of getting it exactly
right right so probably there will be an
a tidy annotation at some point where
you can change your ID column it doesn't
have to be the ID field and a column
name annotation of some kind and then
there's a lot of interest in this right
now within the Android tooling guys
xabier and tour so we're looking at
putting in hooks so that this could be a
standard library as part of the ADT
you can find the source here at dr.
Fibonacci googlecode com I put in I
actually already published the slides
there's a link right at the top of the
page here and there's the simple little
basic usage thing but really there's
more info on the slides at this point
you can get to all the source let's in
get use the issue tracker if you want
it's probably going to get moved at some
point pretty soon because in order to
support making it part of the ATT okay
so last year we did blog posts on the
official Android blog about making HTTP
calls from native apps and used to be
apache HTTP client was the
recommendation because it's part of the
OS and it's very full-featured well
tested over a long period of time huge
huge surface area for for features in
that client so unfortunately that huge
feature set means there's a huge support
surface for it as well and I think the
desire of the Android team was to scale
back the minimally supported
capabilities so they started
recommending httpurlconnection instead
but that as you know is a much lower
level API so with HTTP client you're
just saying you know new get method and
and then executing it with a HTTP URL
connection your reading and writing
streams right so it's a lot lower level
so I felt there was a need for a project
too juiced have again a simple HTTP
interface that would have that would be
more similar HTTP client as far as its
overall approach but would correctly
handle all the i/o streams and reading
their stream and the try close finally
try clothes in the finally all that kind
of stuff so there's a couple clients
that are available beside
I that you might want to look at there's
the Google HTTP Java client which is an
open source project on google code
that's actually used by the Google API
Java client which is a project that you
can use to have wrappers for any rest
api that's part of our standard apiary
infrastructure then then I also wrote
basic HTTP client which is a really thin
one it's just a simple very simple
client that's don't try to support the
huge feature set of Apache but the kind
of the target space is well I just need
a little stuff from the web we wanted to
make that that easier so that's what it
is so there's a synchronous and an async
API and the thing this kind of novel
about basic HTTP client is that it
provides an async callback method so the
that will automatically wrap your
request in an async task because you
don't want to execute network requests
on the UI thread right that's a big
no-no so ordinarily you want to either
do it in an async task or best is
actually in a service and I don't have
support for that yet but it's open to
patches somebody wants to write that it
actually won't be very difficult so
there's an async API which is really
easy to use and then it's extensible as
well you can supply your own request
lager and request handler if you need to
change how you open a connection for
example supply custom SSL properties or
something like that then you can really
easily supply your own sauce for that so
the source is here and how to page is
actually here as well so let me pop that
up here you can see the API hopefully
that's readable
basically I can show you in a simpler
example actually in the bigger print let
me just close all these guys and pull up
the basic HTTP client tests okay so very
simplest case now this actually is not
Android specific it's intended to be for
any java app so the basic HTTP client is
the non Android aware version and you
just initiated give it a site and then
call your client get client post client
head client dot whatever the HTTP
methods are right and it just does those
things and you get back a response
object and then you can check the status
code you can call get body to get the
body of the response so it's very
straightforward right these two
parameters out here that are no no this
is the path that will be appended to the
base path that you set up with part of
your client so a common thing is to
initiate a client to a site but then you
have different requests to different
paths on the site and then null the
second mole is a parameters object that
you can pass with all your request
parameters and it'll do the right thing
you pass it a map and if it's a get
request that URL encodes them and puts
them on a query string and if it's a
post request it makes them the mime type
form data encoding and all that and then
this is an example of the async API here
here we're using Android HTTP client
which extends the async class and it
also has a couple Android aware little
workarounds from prior bugs on prior
operating system versions so we do it
gets but the third argument is an
asynccallback object and then this code
will actually complete whenever the
request comes back so what that does is
actually creates an async task wrapper
executor
your request there and then calls you
back when it's done now this test won't
actually test anything because I was
just illustrating they called the API
but it J unit I'd have to wait and wait
for flag and all that kind of stuff but
that's that's what the async API looks
like if you want to get a little fancier
and pass a custom handler you can do
that so in the example here we just want
to override our error handler so when we
create the client we can pass the
additional argument which is a request
handler type and the easiest thing to do
is just extend your basic request
handler that's part of the framework
already and then override the one method
that you want to you know change their
handler so it's very easy to change also
if you do a sink I think I was going to
mention that when you use the async
mechanism then it automatically will do
retry and back off exponential back-off
as well and the retries you can set max
retries and that sort of thing it tries
to be intelligent about whether it's a
fatal exception or whether it's a
recoverable exception and there's
actually a method that you can override
and the request handler to determine
that logic for yourself as well what do
you want to recover from any given
exception
so the source is at basic HTTP client
googlecode com and some final resources
that you might want to look at of course
you've all seen developer android com
there's a little page not many people
know about that the Android some of the
guys on my team don't like be sharing
this page because it's a little bit out
of date however it's fantastic if you've
never seen this page you should go there
common tasks is an Android you can
search for it and on the developer site
and it's just like if you're just
starting Android development this page
will save your life it's it's a sorry
take that back legal doesn't like it
when I say things like that all right
but no it's a great resource because
it's just how to do all the common
things how do I put up a menu how do I
you know do a contacts menu whatever i
wish i'd have this page when i started
it would have saved a lot of time on
other sites learning some of this stuff
actually as far as just a one-stop you
know for for beginning tasks i think it
is better than Stack Overflow yes but
thank you for mentioning Stack Overflow
because we do officially support that we
have a lot of a lot of our team will
answer questions on stack overflow and
it is a great resource for forgetting
you know how does any particular X thing
work an Android
there's my blog I do a few things be
sure to connect with Android developers
on google+ we do weekly several weekly
hangouts around the world on Android
development topics there's a Dory that
you can submit questions in advance will
research them and then answer live on
the Hangout there's a app reviews that
we do every week saying these are what
we like in apps this is good UI design
this is ways to improve so there's word
there's a lot of stuff that we're doing
right now we want to encourage people to
connect with us and then I do a nandroid
blog post every couple weeks or so now
when I work on these frameworks and I'm
sure you'll see more as I add features
to to the ones that I talked about very
welcome thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
