I've been at PBS for the past five years
or so I work primarily in the group that
works on things that can build revenue
for PBS's initiatives so most of the
things I work on are either
subscription-based or for sale which is
a little bit unusual for PBS a lot of
our offerings are free but you know
everybody needs to keep the lights on
and so that's why we're developing apps
for the paid market so if you're
familiar with the PBS system you'll know
that we've been around for about 40
years and one of the reasons that PBS
was founded was because it was really
clear that television was becoming a
vast wasteland of programming and it was
really apparent to a lot of folks out
there including Fred Rogers that there
were real needs for kids to have content
that really was appropriate to both
their developmental stage and their age
and the kinds of things that kids needed
to be learning so PBS as an entity is
always looking looking for ways to reach
kids wherever they are and now that we
have these mobile platforms we are
really seriously looking at mobile as a
very important way to reach kids
wherever they are so of course PBS is
first and foremost a broadcast
organization and so we have been
developing award-winning television
shows for kids for those 40 years in
August as you see here PBS had seven of
the top 10 programs among mothers of
young children including Super Why
Sesame Street Curious George Dinosaur
Train and the cat and hat knows a lot
about that now obviously some of these
brands are new like super why some are
old like Sesame Street and curious
george but they all have a place on the
mole
platform so as part of our mission we
always develop each show around a
particular curriculum focus in the case
of curious george that's science and
exploration in the case of super why
it's literacy and when we are developing
the show we're always thinking about
these other platforms that we can reach
out to so interactive online games white
board games mobile and we've really been
successful in drawing kids to these
platforms so pbskids.org had 10 million
unique visitors last year and we get a
lot of repeat visitors they come back
and they play the games again and again
so we were hoping to replicate that on
mobile so we started doing mobile apps
in 2009 with a couple of experimental
apps which I'll talk about in a little
while and now we have 13 PBS kids apps
live in the iTunes App Store we have had
more than 1.2 million downloads this
includes one of our apps that actually
plays video clips from the PBS shows
that was launched just this summer and
is doing some amazing things with video
streaming and I'll talk about that so
just like with our shows we use our
successful characters to build
successful apps and we work with each
character's specific curriculum that is
based around their character traits so
Sid the Science Kid he is I think he's
four or five years old so that limits a
little bit what he's able to do in the
world so he is very inquisitive and he's
always asking why and so that is
something that the whole show is based
around and so when we decided to do an
app for sit for said we also wanted to
ask why and have a very exploratory app
that was built around that concept
Curious George doesn't speak so that
means that it's a little challenging
sometimes to develop games with the
character that can't tell you what to do
so it's something that
we explore very carefully so our first
appt was called my journal and it was
for mr. Rogers neighborhood it was a
little bit of an experiment it was a
game that we had developed for another
platform it was initially on the web and
it was a flash based game and we really
wanted to explore okay how how is this
going to work can we do something social
emotional at the time there really
wasn't anything social social emotional
in the App Store and I should I should
qualify right now we're just talking
about iOS apps we do have one android
app and I can answer questions about
that but i'm not going to present on it
specifically so this helps kids talk
about their feelings around these five
topics so it walks them through a store
basically making a story book and I've
done one quickly hear it sometimes I
pretend to be a superhero and when kids
tap on each of the different icons there
they get the voice-over of what it is so
sometimes I pretend to be a superhero a
policeman a baby and animal or I think a
mom has the last one and then it helps
kids structure much like Fred Rogers did
in the show kind of structure their
feelings around what they do when
they're doing these things so when I
pretend I sing or dance or cry or stomp
my foot and then that makes me feel
silly or brave or strong and then at the
end of the app you get the opportunity
to actually draw and express their
feelings themselves the rest of the
stage is you know we kind of have
predetermined things to help kids walk
through their feelings a little bit so
that was our first step it was done with
a very very small budget and it did
pretty well but you know again it was
mr. Rogers unfortunately his no longer
with us we don't have him on air in most
markets anymore and so it didn't get a
lot of hits in the App Store although we
were pretty pleased with how well it did
now Martha speaks
is a brand that started as a book and
Martha if you're not familiar with the
books Martha is a talking dog who gets
into lots of trouble because she can
talk and so we did it for them basically
looking into exploring vocabulary and
building vocabulary and this was a
really fantastic app because we were
able to actually do some testing with it
and see if kids were actually able to
improve their vocabulary and in fact
their vocabulary improved by thirty one
percent after playing with the app over
a period of time about two weeks there's
a couple of different games here Chow
time is very popular because once you
have actually correctly identified the
plate that goes with the word that's at
the bottom then you get to lick the
plate clean using the dog's tongue and
it makes lovely slurping noises which is
very very popular if you're five and
then you have a dar you dress up
activity where you can see that on the
left and what Martha does is she'll
speak a word than in context so she'll
say that is very fashionable or
something like that once you have taken
a picture of your dog and then finally
it's kind of a Martha speaks mark sorry
Martha says like Simon Says where you
have to actually use these different
words in context so amble you have to
press each dog until they're walking
slowly and there's all these different
synonyms for stop go run fast in there
and it's really funny because we've had
some anecdotal reports from parents who
are like oh this is so great because now
my kid comes up and says halt so and
then at the very end of the app you can
go in and you can kind of test the words
that you've learned and kids love to do
this and see how many how many they can
get right in a row now super why if
you're at all familiar with the kids
category in the iTunes App Store you'll
be familiar with this app it's been in
the top five
Oh for a number of months in a row I
can't even remember how many and it's
really i mean i think that this is the
perfect storm of an app that has some
good redeeming educational value as well
as a really really popular brand Super
Why is huge with kids they love the
empowerment that they get from the app
and being able to go in and actually
write the letters here with princess
presto and this is an interesting game
one of the rules that we have often used
in the past in developing games for kids
is don't make the wrong answer funnier
than the right answer because you don't
want to encourage the wrong answer
necessarily so what the developer did
with this game what's really interesting
was they actually just said okay well we
don't necessarily want to make this
funny but we'll just show so if you
actually click on plane it will show
that Goldilocks slept in little bears
plane it'll actually change the art and
so it will be really clear to the kid
right away that actually they've gotten
it wrong and they won't get the sticker
that comes with getting the right answer
until they do it correct but they can
see the context and that really helps
with learning wonder red specialty is
rhyming and so we go through the rhyming
families and then at the most basic
level you can spell words with alpha pig
and every time you finish a word
correctly or use the word correctly in
the game you get a sticker for it and
then you can play with that sticker in
your sticker book but that was all
informed by super wise super wives was
developed by out of the blue enterprises
which was founded by Angela santomero
who did Blue's Clues and they have done
years worth of research into literacy
approach and so there they have a very
structured approach for each character
each character has specific skills that
they can help work with a child so the
characters were really driving that game
now here's dinosaur express this is for
the Henson Company Dinosaur Train is
obviously another interesting perfect
storm
dinosaurs and trains who would have
thought that that would be successful
it's really a funny show and it explores
a lot of really great dinosaur knowledge
as well as the idea of maybe not fitting
in because buddy is a t-rex and he's
been adopted by a teradyne family so
this app we took a slightly lighter
approach and we did it simple seek and
find followed by a matching game
followed by some dinosaur facts and what
we did with this app was a little bit
different than anything that we tried
before we actually did an update
strategy with this where we release new
content every month or so for three
months to see if people would have an
uptake and it was really interesting to
see that people did come back and
download the updates so that was an
experiment for us again another
experiment for a slightly older audience
is an app that went with a web-only
property we've been experimenting with
this at PBS KIDS GO in particular doing
properties that maybe aren't quite
suited for television but we want to
explore the content area and this is a
corporal cups food camp is with fizzies
lunch lab which is a web-only property
that explores healthy eating and healthy
food habits unfortunately we did learn a
lesson with fizzies lunch lab corporal
cups food camp which is a really long
name and that is if it's not a
recognizable brand we're going to have a
hard time getting it to download we have
not been super pleased with the number
of downloads and it's a really fun app
so we're still hopeful that we might be
able to do something with it but it
really drove home to us the power of the
brand in this three to six six to eight
kind of age range now here we have a
couple of a couple more apps these are a
little bit lighter weight a photo
factory just allows you to take a
picture of your kid and then they can
explore putting themselves in the
picture with PBS kids characters
including the PBS KIDS branded
characters as well as curious Joe
margin Super Why and you can decorate it
and it's a lot of fun kids love that up
and then also just as straight painting
app with Super Why word ball was an
interesting experiment this is a this
was our very first kind of arcade style
game and it combines the use of video
with educational content so you're
seeing a music video from the show
collecting word balls and then you're
using those word balls that you've
collected in the video in an arcade
style game this is our most recent while
not our most recent i should say over
the summer we released the PBS KIDS
video for iPad player and this has been
just an unbelievable success in August i
first talked about this at the Duster
magic app camp this spring and it had
just come out and we'd had 10 million
streams and we were so excited and I had
been out for like two weeks 10 days
something like that in August there were
61 million streams of video from this
app which is almost half of all the PBS
KIDS video player online offline we this
is using the same back end as the video
player that we use on our website and we
have been blown away with how successful
it is and basically as you can see
there's a list of characters down the
side it's extremely kid-friendly kids
can navigate through delegate through
this app without any difficulty there's
parent information at the bottom that
they can slide out here it's shown slid
out but normally the eye is just all the
way off to the left there and they can
go in and they can pick their favorite
clips or they can just watch the
playlist as it goes through said science
fair just came out in September and this
I alluded to before it's a very simple
exploratory app where you can use a
magnifying glass to find targets as
can see with the alphabet blocks up in
the top you explore some simple charts
and each of these is driven by one of
the characters from the show which has
you know a specialty you know may does
charting and she loves math and so she
talks you through kind of why a chart is
important and what it can be used for
Gabriela loves to collect things and so
she's showing you through her different
collections and challenging the user to
find different details in her
collections and then Gerald is helping
you explore the concept of time and
change over time so his his game is
called time machine and you can see once
you've put the flower pieces of the
flower stages in order then you can
actually scroll back and forth kind of
in a quick time lapse little pim gee
that's really small I'm sorry this is
actually an iPad app and we're coming
out with a series of these in
association with the little pim company
which does educational dvds for
different language learning for kids 326
it's a series of games that we had done
for another one of our initiatives PBS
kids play and we ported it over to the
iPad because we really felt that the
experience would work well and so we've
come out with Spanish French is coming
out next week or the end of this week I
guess and then we also have Mandarin
Chinese which will be coming out with
shortly again this is a little bit of an
experiment because it's not a broadcast
property that we work with but we think
it's important to have the curriculum
area of languages represented in what
we're providing and another big one that
we have coming out pretty soon is
supervised alpha boost this is a new
exploration of Super Why in a little bit
more of a twitch arcade style game and
we're hoping that kids will really love
the facts that it's based around parties
you have also all sorts of parties
birthday parties Halloween parties that
you can explore
and you can collect different things and
at the goal of the game is to spell a
party related word so in this case it's
pumpkins so what's next we're doing a
lot obviously and we have lots more in
store we have a number of apps in the
planning stages at this point and both
for Super Why as well as for dinosaur
trains and Sid the Science Kid and as
well as for some of the other great
properties that will have coming out
soon we have some great news shows that
are coming next year and we're working
on a plans for those we are also talking
about Android now we do have one android
app right now it's the same thing as the
Super Why app we ported it over to
Android it was a little bit of a
challenging experience to be perfectly
honest it took us a while almost 10
months to get it to port and it hasn't
been as successful as we've wanted it to
be but there's a lot of reasons that
that's probably the case and so we are
still really looking into that as a
platform we're just taking it slow
because obviously like everyone we have
constraints as far as funding but we are
definitely looking into doing series of
apps to explore different elements of
the curriculum for each series and
tablets of course is something we're
keeping an eye on as well so that's
pretty much my overview of PBS kids and
I'm happy to take any questions well
there's a couple there's a couple of
different ways that we gauge success it
isn't all about the money i mean i am in
a revenue generating department but one
of PBS's big missions is innovation and
so we are exploring audience you know
how to reach new audiences or different
audiences or audiences in different
places one of the metrics I use is time
of play so how long a child is engaged
with a nap we do build analytics into
all of our apps so we have a pretty
decent sense of what the mini what many
games they're playing how long they're
playing them for you know if they
actually complete all of the goals that
are set out within the game obviously we
try and target downloads just like
anyone else um you know and we have
metrics internally for what we feel is a
successful app you know generally
success starts at around thirty thousand
downloads for us and then goes up from
there yes these are all paid apps and we
pretty much we research based on the
brand and based on the content that
we've developed we decide on a price
point for each separately so we don't
have like a will only do apps that are a
particular price point we actually take
a pretty close look at that for each app
separately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
