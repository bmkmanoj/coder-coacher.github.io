guys got involved with kind of your
journey to here yeah so you and Rick and
I met as we're actually Udacity students
so we were both students of the Udacity
self-driving car course and one of the
options they gave students last year is
to compete for a chance to participate
in a self-driving car race and a bunch
of people applied about 20 were selected
overall and we were thrown into a slack
chat room to kind of get started on
building some traffic our board we had
six weeks and we didn't have to build a
car itself we were given a card from
Poli sink but the goal was to make it
around a fully autonomous lap and time
that and be the fastest person to a
fully autonomous lap on this race course
and so we were you know 20 ish students
from nine different country or from five
different countries across like nine
different time zones trying to organize
you know this race a lot of challenges
there just in the organizational part
and getting everybody working together
and just you know where do we start and
we were all pretty like new some of us I
was working at Lockheed Martin at the
time in autonomous vehicle research and
other people were doing different things
but none of us are really full-on doing
self-driving cars and we were taking the
course to kind of learn more about the
field more about our area and kind of
you know have goals of you know
transitioning in the career to do
something with self-driving cars so fast
forward six weeks we've spent a lot of
time doing a lot of remote work and then
we had two days really on the track so
we've had about four or five days total
being down in California together as a
group where everybody came in but then
we only had really two days of actual
testing so we had a lot of you know
great we're here we got the code let's
try it this fails okay let's try this
this let's try that that fails now we're
having vehicle issues now we're having
this issue and so a lot of iteration
going really really fast
a whole lotta we like to say it was like
adrenaline fueled development because it
was extremely fast development and very
exciting and we got to the point where
we were able to get a deep learning
model we
only using a single camera augmented
with GPS data but everybody else there
that had been able to complete a single
app was using GPS Waypoint following
which is not that exciting of a
technique basically you drop breadcrumbs
around it and then you follow those
breadcrumbs yep second exactly whereas
we were actually using a single camera
and using convolutional neural networks
to do this we're getting both camera
though that's wild yep a single camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
