what I like to hear thank you so real
quick I have a few questions for you
before we get started first off how many
people in this room are recording me
don't lie it's okay i just want to know
all right good so I look good in this
angle only a bit feel free to didn't we
say that the pictures are okay in this
room so go ahead and G+ your hearts out
just keep it on silent so I'm going to
be talking about Google+ and the +1
button I'm Timothy I'm a developer
advocate here at Google and you can find
me online and I encourage you to do so
let's chat Timothy Jordan calm / + will
redirect to my Google+ profile you can
follow me a nap mention me and we'll
talk about all sorts of stuff so today
we're going to talk about the Google+
project and I mean we're really going to
talk about people right we're going to
talk about people through the google
plus project we're going to talk about
people through the +1 button we're going
to talk about people who happen to be
authors and then hopefully we'll also
talk a lot about you this is going to be
an interactive session you expected that
right who said yes yes
I've brought bait stickers and +1
buttons and you get them if for some
arbitrary reason I think you're off
alright so let's jump in the Google+
project who here in the room has has a
google+ account oh this is going to be
easy so you already know but let me do
sort of reiterate some of the core
principles here because I think they're
interesting and and I'd like to talk to
you about them so since everybody here
is an expert maybe you can tell me some
things first off the Google+ project is
really based in our core philosophy we
focus on the user and the user has
changed right so we figured we ought to
as well and we introduced the Google+
project and we're just getting started
there's a number of things about the
Google+ project that make it unique and
beautiful and are one of the many
reasons I love working on it the first
of is circles you know a lot of people
but you don't treat them all the same
right you have your friends you have
your colleagues you have your classmates
you have the people that you met here
that aren't really friends or aren't
really acquaintances yet but you want
them to think that you think they're
important so you can have that circle
it's a long name but it's possible right
and you can share with them specifically
and you know what you're going to want
to share something with them that you
might not want to share with your family
directly or you might want to share
something publicly that you don't want
to share individually one-on-one or you
might want to share something with your
family that you don't with the public I
mean there's so many options and circle
versatile and easy and I think they're
really great who here shares frequently
two circles and not publicly all right
and who here only shares publicly all
right so the people that didn't raise
their hand I'm confused about you
but we'll build up our logic mechanism
over the talk so I
I know she said something but I couldn't
quite hear her yeah you better strap in
it's gonna be a long talk all right so I
I used circles a lot and and I think one
of my go-to examples is that I actually
use circles to share directly with my
friends and family on a daily basis i
post a daily photo which I used to do to
the world which was you know kind of fun
but the world doesn't really want to see
a daily photo about me but when I talked
to my uncle he loves seeing the
different places that I'm at and I'm
talking and the different things that
I'm doing and it's cool to share that
with him but not everybody else was a
shared to see a daily photo and it
restricted me I wasn't sharing every day
because I didn't want to take that
picture and share with the world but
when I take that picture and I just
share with my friends my good friends my
actual friends and my family then that
made it okay and I was doing it a lot
more and I think that's really cool
sparks good discussions are sparked by a
good content that just makes sense so we
made a mechanism here that allows you to
surface content to yourself and share it
with your circles conveniently and this
was actually really great for me
recently I have a friend who has an
illness and there was a new treatment
that came out about it and I was able to
share that right away and have a
conversation with them I mean it's just
putting in that interest that I wouldn't
necessarily search for every day but
that I would like to know updates about
and have conversations about is really
cool who here uses sparks somewhat and
what a few people use barks all right
hangouts hangouts are really cool right
when we interact face-to-face that's
important that's why you're here right
you could probably could have seen me
post some stuff online or watch this
video later but you wanted to be here so
that we could talk face-to-face so that
we could have a question answer period
after time or so that i could give you
cool schwag right there's so much to be
said for this interaction which is
really neat and we wanted to enable that
online but the way video conferencing
works is that it's either difficult to
set up and confusing and complicated or
or it's one
one or it's by some sort of schedule but
if you just want to hang out with
somebody you don't want to do all that
work right I grew up in a small town and
one of my favorite hobbies and you might
think i'm born because of this is I like
to sit on a porch it's just really fun
to like hang out on a porch in my
hometown it was small enough that people
would walk by my friends and my family
and we could have conversations and you
know what that's what a hangout is for
me is that ability to be like hey I'm
out on my porch why don't you come say
hi and people actually do but we can do
it at a global scale that's a big porch
that's really cool and the almost last
thing I want to talk about is mobile is
that life doesn't happen here in front
of my laptop and it doesn't happen to my
desktop at home and in fact I like to
leave those things at home and go out
and experience life but while i'm there
there might be something I want to share
or I want to connect with somebody who
lives in Florida and I never get to see
but this reminded me of them and so we
made a really great mobile experience
that allows you to share so easily right
with things like notifications an
instant upload it just makes it such a
wonderful experience nope there's lots
to work on the last thing and this is a
feature this is you right the Google+
project is about you and it's about
hearing what you have to say we're in
field trial after all you know and it's
it's about you getting started and you
giving us your feedback and it's also
about the bigger picture right
connecting humanity to share in a way
that we haven't been able to do before
in a way that we naturally already do in
real life and taking that paradigm
putting it online so it's not the
strange artifice that gets in the way
it's just a conduit to connecting to the
people who we love and care about real
quick who here grew up in South Silicon
Valley who grew up in California who
grew up in the United States
who grew up outside this country who
here was in a different country three
days ago go around the room right this
is a global community when we restrict
it to this space doesn't work anymore
but when we restricted to online as long
as you schedule it or everybody's a
friend or you can follow but maybe I'll
never talk to you what's that this is
about taking this experience and putting
it online I think that's pretty neat
there's some amazing uses of Google+
that we've seen already to that I'd like
to mention and I'd like to hear some
from you some of my my top picks is I
went to a Google+ concert with Daria
musk right and i was i was at my house
in bonny doon in the middle of the
redwoods and we logged online and we
were able to hang out with her and she
sang a few songs and then over the
course of like six hours she held a
concert for the world there's a google+
cooking school did you know this right I
think there's actually a few of them and
there's these amazing photo communities
that that are popping up I mean you get
Chrissy bow and like Trey Radcliffe
doing photo rocks walks here and then
people are doing photo walks elsewhere
but they're having the same experience
and that's really neat and I'd like to
take a loan before I move on because
we're going to get into programming
really quick and I don't know that we've
had our dose of humanity just yet do you
have like a really cool experience that
you've had in Google+ that you'd like to
share just a few of them right here and
it has to be five sentences or less I've
been to one of these before come on up I
walked into my living room and my
houseguest was in the middle of a
hangout and I got to meet a lot of his
friends who like it turned out I already
knew because I was hanging out in the
background of the Hangout and it was you
know why i opened up my computer when he
had his awesome
andia that's the thing is that it spans
from like charity stuff to you know
meeting old friends or new people to you
know just the casual walking into a
living room like this tool is so
versatile and so special and I encourage
you to think about that you know think
about like you know how have you been
able to interact online that you
couldn't do before and do more of that
that's cool all right so there are a lot
of things we can do on google+ and first
and foremost be a user you've all got
that covered right the next step is to
add this to your website and spread this
across the internet and plug into the
Google+ project and plug in to how
Google is adding people and that's the
+1 button so we're going to spend a
bunch of time on this too I this is the
Silicon Valley Google technology user
group so I've been told there's a fair
amount of developers here you don't have
to raise your hand if it gets weird but
I I know my people you're out there so
I'm going to talk about the +1 button
and what it does right now and we're
going to go into some basic
implementation we're going to look at
some code and we're going to do some
best practices as well as look at some
really cool stuff that I think you can
do with the button that people are just
starting to figure out so first off the
button is available on search and it's
been available there for a long time
right and this is sort of one of the
core values of the button is being able
to see recommendations from your friends
when it matters most when you're
searching for something when you're
looking for something right it doesn't
always matter what your friends say in
the stream not always you know it can be
really cool when you're spending time in
the stream but when you're looking for a
bed frame right you need to know what
your friends have recommended and it's
really helpful that when you search for
it their recommendations are there right
in front of you and +1 button all you
have to do is click on it and that
recommendation at the bottom goes from
including just a couple people you know
to you as well and everybody you know
has the opportunity to see that public
action that you've made it's also
available on ads and of course we wanted
to make this available outside of search
it's neat to be able to +1 say a
restaurant you
already know you love and search what if
you don't know if you liked the article
you're about to read just yet you might
want to go to that page first yeah in
this case I'm landing on a movie website
this is Harry Potter who's seen it yeah
nice there's only a handful of us but
what we have ones so when you click on
the bar when you hover over this button
on the page you'll see those annotations
in that hover bubble as well and we just
released a way for you to show this in
annotation in line on the page so that
when you're about to start to read an
article or review you already know if
your boss has read that article and you
better bone up before your next meeting
I once you decide to click on it and
it'll give you an option to share on
google+ and i think this is really cool
once you click inside there it will
bring up a field much like the share box
that you see on google+ in the stream it
has a opportunity for you to type some
stuff in it has a snippet that's defined
by the publisher we're going to talk
about that it's really cool and it has
your circles you can define the circles
you want to share this with so I you can
go ahead and type that in and you can go
ahead and share with your circles of
course I would share with the witches
and wizards of which there are four in
this room
and the really cool thing about this is
that we've got a button in three places
now right and I can maybe click it in an
organic result and then somebody might
click it in a search ad a paid listing
and somebody might click it on your site
but they all go to the same annotation
the same bucket of Plus Ones the same
recommendations in search so you spread
these +1 buttons out you get your users
to click them and then it matters to the
to their friends and family when they
see it in search and this is true right
nine out of ten people trust
recommendations from people they know
which is sort of an obvious statistic
but it looks better when it's blue and
with the % I'm seven out of ten people
trust recommendations from family
members or friends they say those in
fluent in fluence their purchase
decisions right and two out of three
people share content are more likely to
share content within one of their
circles than to make a general or public
post and we actually almost got to that
in this room which is surprising because
i would i would venture a guess that
most of the people in this room are very
post and public information happy you're
posting to your networks a lot updating
them on different things that's that's
why you come to these meetings and get
updated on on the latest information but
even in here there was maybe a quarter
of you that said you shared
significantly two circles rather than
public that's really interesting all
right so being able to share from any
website directly to your circles is
really interesting all right and so
that's pretty much at the +1 button it
can help you with CTR on search I the
search traffic is pre-qualified and it
comes with a recommendation and you can
share directly to the Google+ project
for sure circles so let's take a look at
how you actually implement it we have
this really fancy configuration tool
it's a form but you can copy the code
from there and paste it into your page
and you have a button right away so I
recommend you take a look at this page
if you're starting out or if at any
point you want to learn a little bit
more about the mark-up as you change the
form the code updates for you so it's a
really good educational tools
well you could kind of see how things
change is you change the language
grammar or whatever the code itself is
very simple we have just a script tag
it's right up there at the top including
the JavaScript for the +1 button and the
+1 tag which is actually where the
button is going to be rendered here is
an example page which is super basic it
would work it would be kind of silly but
it would totally work but it helps me
illustrate this point right up here
which is the rel canonical and this is
important right who knows about
canonicalization for their pages and for
google search is good I tell you
something new canonicalization is really
important let's say you've got three
different pages or three different URLs
that post it to the same or I'm sorry
point to the same content and this is
something that really could happen right
I'm going to go over the screen so I'm
going to shout while I do that if you
look at this URL up here you see the ?
order x equals price this is a variable
on the URL that could happen when a user
is modifying the page and say your CMS
requires this to know how to render the
products on the page but that's in the
document dot location of the href that
is the URL of the page even though that
has nothing to do with the content what
canonicalization allows you to do is say
okay maybe I have a user ID parameter on
the URL maybe I have a sort by but none
of that actually means the content the
true URL is this right that's great for
Google search because then we know what
to point the search tail as we crawl
crawl your pages it's also good for the
+1 button because if the +1 button sees
these as three different URLs you're
going to get one click on each one of
those URLs if say a user clicks on each
one of them right but what you actually
want is each one of those three users to
click and have a go to the same plus one
bucket right the same series of
annotations and hopefully that's also
the URL that google search seizes the
canonicalization and you can control
this you can
have effect on this by setting the rel
equals canonical and I'll talk a little
bit more about that later of course
we've got the +1 button code in there as
well the other thing I wanted to mention
about markup on your page is what drives
this plus snippet this is really cool
because if you share something into your
stream that's rich that has it's full of
information it's more likely to start
conversations it's more likely to be
interesting to your friends and family
it's more likely to make it easier for
you to engage with these people so we
want publishers and that maybe you to
mark up their pages you don't have to
add content you just have to identify
the content that's already there and
there's four ways that you can do that
well three ways and then one feeling
lucky that the ways are schema.org
markup which you may know and i'll talk
more about open graph using meta tags
and then of course the last way we may
look at this is kind of our best guess
and it'll happen in that order right if
we see schema.org we'll use that and if
we don't see schema but we see open
graph will use that we don't see open
graph and we see meta will use that and
if not the google will do its best to
determine what the best description and
title and image on your page it going to
be but my guess is you'd rather have
control over that right so schema.org is
what I'm going to talk about and there's
a few reasons one its supported by all
the major search engines right so you've
got Google Bing and Yahoo who are all
supporting schema.org are the other
things that you might already be using
it there's these things called Rich
Snippets that are really kind of cool
mmm I like stuffing so when you search
for stuffing you might get a whole bunch
of recipes on the page and this recipe
has a review and it has a description
and that is set by a rich snippet markup
on the page and you can do this with
schema.org the base type of schema is
thing which already requires to have a
name description and image and so you're
already set for the + snippet because
what it requires are a name a
description and an image
and they set these items on the page and
then we we throw in a fav icon just for
fun all right so i just want to show you
another basic page because i like that
breast exam Palance one I what I've done
is I've just highlighted the schema.org
markup and you'll see this is just a
regular page I haven't altered the
content at all I just added an item
scope for one and item type and then I
have some item props this is what
they're the items scope gets placed at
your parents tag all right all the item
props have to be children of that tag so
that could be HTML if you really want to
play it easy or could be body also
really easy or it could be a div tag
maybe and then under that div tag
enclosing that div tag you keep all your
item props that's okay too the item type
designates what type this is now I've
thrown up a pretty generic type and this
is going to be common on a lot of news
sites article but it might not be
comment on your site and you go to
schema.org and you can see all the
different types of available the
taxonomy between them and you can choose
what's right for your page maybe you
have a business right or a local
business or an organization or video
something like that and you can set the
right type so the google knows what the
type of the page is and then we have the
three item types there's name
description and image and you can see
those tags are just parents of the
actual content so in the title we've
added the item prop name and in a span
we've added Ida prop description and in
that span is what we use is the
description that makes sense I've
learned to take silences and
overwhelming yes so I'll move on so best
practices all right now we you know
we're going to start and get into some
interesting stuff here and some really
cool stuff first off pretty basic plus
ones are for URLs and has to be a public
crawlable URL so for those of you that
have staging servers what you would want
to do is set your rel canonical to the
public equivalent of the page and then
the button would actually work if you
set it to your staging server which
can't be reached by Google when they
click that button you'll probably get a
red button with a white !
it's not going to work and remember to
set the URL of the button there's a
there's an edge case here or if you have
a blog homepage say and you have links
to different articles on that homepage
it would be common for you to maybe put
a +1 button by each one but you want
that button to link to the article not
the page that on with all the buttons
right to do that you set an attribute on
the button tag hrf pretty
straightforward and then of course if
you don't have the href if you just the
page that you're on we really recommend
you use the rel canonical link in your
head and this is how we look at it first
we look for the href and if we don't
find that we go to the rel canonical and
if we don't find that we go to the URL
of the page document location.href more
best practices speed this is one we gave
you for free speed is really important
to us and we know from feedback over
many years this B is really important to
you as well so we made the button faster
there's nothing you need to do it's up
to three times faster since we launched
and we just did that because we want
that button to render really fast if you
wanted to rent even faster and maybe you
want it to render outside the rendering
of your page you can use the async
snippet and what that'll do is your page
will start loading and the button will
load in parallel but it won't block any
other assets all right here's an
interesting one we're getting to the
stuff that's sort of new and people are
starting to starting to do on their
pages the easy example here is retail
retail would put a +1 button on a
product page that's really common and
that makes sense is that users are
searching for products i like this
microwave i'm going to +1 that but what
if you like all the microwave selection
at best buy it makes sense to put a +1
button at the category level as well
yeah and people might search for that
what if you like all the electronics at
best buy it makes sense to put a +1
button at the brand level as well people
might also search for that any page that
you might search for it makes sense
to put a +1 button and this is how we
see some people using it and they'll put
that brand level near a logo or on their
homepage and sometimes they'll even add
promo like Nashville did here and this
is great because when I searched for
technology news and Mashable comes up
there I see all the recommendations from
my friends who read Mashable regularly
all right this is fun and I actually
have a demo in here this is call back
the button actually has a call back so
when a user clicks it we can run a
JavaScript function on your page and
we'll tell it a few things one will tell
it the URL that was +1 and whether it
was +1 or unplumbed right so if you have
multiple buttons you'll know which one
it was hit and you'll know whether the
user clicked it or whether the user
unclipped it yeah like they undid there
plus one action and this is really great
because you can use it to increase the
value of the +1 button to your users on
the page and this is how you might want
to do it let's say I'm on a page and i'm
looking at a really cool hat something
like this and i plus 1 bet it would be
really great experience for me if I saw
similar hats on the same set on the same
site come up yeah maybe I have an
uncluttered experience but as soon as I
plus 1 that I see all these related hats
or even over time let's say I'm always
reading technology articles on a new
site and I'm always plus wanting those
would it be cool if I landed on that
news home page and I saw the latest
technology articles it's quicker and
easier for me to get to the content that
I want and it increases value on that
page so this is the example it's a frog
because I think frogs are cute the way
this works is I just coded this up and
we're going to look at the code so you
know the callback works and how you
might be able to use it what i'm doing
here is i'm just throwing a keyword at
the flickr api I thought it might be
neat to see how this works across
different services and the flickr api
i'm searching here for happy i think and
it's given me this happy green frog when
I plus 1 what the code is doing is it's
taking the title of this particular
image not my original keyword throwing
it back of the flickr api and get
those images from that that title as
keywords so it's pretty basic I just
threw it together today to demonstrate
this functionality so let me go to the
demo so when I put in happy the first
thing comes up as a happy buddha i think
is a really cool photo and I click +1 on
this and you'll see it takes the title
from that image and then just loads up a
whole bunch of images this is really
basic obviously this is not sexy Hugh I
but what this does demonstrate is from
user action you can modify in page
behavior and you can store that over
time let's look a little bit of the code
all right so that's a lot of code but
I'll make it simple so up at the top I'm
just doing a JSON call i'm using jquery
here to grab some data from flickr and
you'll see there by text is of our
variable for search and it just has the
keyword happy in it and then down here
is the callback function so once i get
all those photos i go ahead and load
them all up and that includes rendering
a +1 button that actually has the URL of
that image page all right so when we
plus 1 this we're actually plus wanting
the page for that image on flickr which
is pretty neat and then this is the
callback you'll notice in here i've
actually set the callback to be +1 call
back and I've set this using the
JavaScript API but I could also add a
call back if I use the tag in HTML and
so this callback does something really
similar it gets the event and it grabs
the current title you'll notice up there
at the text it's setting the title of
the current photo to be the keyword to
search for and it's grabbing all those
images and adding them as thumbnails so
I'll post this code soon alright so
moving past and like i said i'll post
that coat on my stream sometime in the
next few days a week alright so let's
talk about analytics alright you're
going to maybe change the button on your
page where you place it or you're going
to add some callback functionality to
increase value
the user you're going to want to track
that over time so there's a couple
different ways you can do that with
analytics one of them is through
webmaster tools and what this is going
to tell you is about the +1 CTR on
search it's going to tell you about
who's plus one in your content this is
aggregate data right so where the bulk
of users are from in the world that kind
of thing and it'll start to show up over
time and I'll take a look at some
screenshots in a moment and also on
google analytics that'll tell you about
how users interact with plugins not just
the +1 button on your site so this is
the webmaster tools and I this is this
is a mock of showing a +1 button
activity also got a mock of showing the
change in CTR right so it's plus twelve
percent which is pretty cool it's an
example so don't get your hopes up but
um you know it'll tell you right there
when users see the annotation on search
how does it affect their decision to
click if you're getting a lift in CTR
that's positive and that's important and
then of course we have some demographic
data we're going to tell you a little
bit about the types of users you have
and where they're from and again this
data shows up after we have enough data
that it's anonymous and we also have
google analytics which is great for
telling how users engage with the social
plugins on your site and interact with
the rest of your content like how much
time do they spend how many pages do
they view and you can report on this in
the way that you do with Google
Analytics it's very cool there's a
couple other screenshots and I recommend
you take a look at this right you and
you get this for free you know when you
install the button after about an hour
you're going to be able to c plus 1 data
in both of these tools and then if you
want to add in data for other social
plugins you just need to add some really
simple code to your page that's
analytics all right
we've gone through google plus and the
+1 button and now we're going to take a
look at a little something extra for
authors because authors are people too
so authorship is really interesting
right because when you write an article
you have a byline and you want people to
know that you wrote that and then you
might also share that on Google+ and it
would be also very great if when you're
on google search and you search for an
article and an author you know has
written it you could see their face you
can see their profile photo right there
on search and that's what we started
doing really simple feature but you can
see how it's really powerful in search
when you see that photo of any one of
these people like I want to read an
article by them and how you do it is
really simple so the implementation is
very straightforward first if you've got
a site with authors and you've got a new
site or you work on one you just need to
ask the authors to create a Google
profile make sure the +1 tab is visible
on their profile and the links section
of the profile should list your site and
the other site that the author
contributes to more on that in a second
also on your site you want to associate
the content they've written with their
profile a straightforward way to do this
you use use rel equals author now for
those of you who've done this before
it's really easy it's just an attribute
that you add the link tag that goes to
the profile if for some reason your CMS
makes that difficult or if it's just
difficult for some other reason you can
add a question mark rel equals the
author at the end of the URL this way
you can just add a regular link without
having to add extra attributes either
one of those things will provide a link
from that content to their profile and
their profile already links to your site
so we have a bi-directional verification
that they own that content pretty cool
huh and then we can surface that and
search alright so we've looked at google
plus plus one button and best practices
and we've looked at authors and that's
kind of a lot so at this point i'd like
to go to the question and answer and
let's have some questions and answers in
one second
and then once we're done with that let's
just hang out for a little while yeah
I'll be around if you want to ask
questions one-on-one or if you want a
high five because this world is just so
cool we can do that too before you
actually ask your questions I do want to
emphasize that today we're talking about
what we have now right and I'm really
interested in hearing all about the ways
that we think you know Google+ can
improve you know we want that feedback
and you can tell me today and I'll
listen it will record on the stream and
and we'll we'll talk about it internally
another wait way to do that it just
talked about on the stream and plus
mentioned me or your community manager
Natalie or or or Chris your bow or
anyone on our team another way is to hit
that feedback tool we read those those
are really important to us so give us
feedback in all these different ways
this is just one forum to do so but
again I'm not going to talk about
anything that we haven't yet released
but I'd love to hear your thoughts about
it if you want to tell them to me all
right and for every question and as long
as these stickers and buttons last
you'll get one a little more about
huddled yeah sure I think cuddles
awesome you know huddle is that way to
communicate on the phone and it's kind
of like text messaging but way cooler
right you can have group text messaging
with your friends and i'm actually using
this is actually really neat as I can't
get my father to do text messaging but I
send a message to him via huddle the
other day and it showed up in as
notifications and responded it was
ridiculous I don't know how that works
but now I can you know use that form of
communication with him I think another
way that it works really cool that I've
noticed and users have told us is like
let's say you're going to an event like
a music festival and then you start a
huddle at the beginning of the day and
then when you inevitably all get lost
you can all stay in touch right and
that's really neat too that's
interesting to know ok so the portion of
the question that I'll repeat is that
this gentleman has a number of users
that he's friends with your friends that
you brought into Google+ and they don't
seem to be pretty
seemed content right you're not seeing
things coming from their streams and you
want to get them more involved and
obviously you do because google plus
it's so cool and if everybody could
start trying to use it and that'll be
great well i think that there's sort of
a couple steps to like really getting
your friends and family on the stream
and anybody else who wants to share tips
for this i please and please i encourage
you to do so but the first step you've
already done you've gotten them on which
is great so they're on there and they
can read your content and that's step
one I have a friend who his his secret
weapon is hangouts like in his family's
like no I don't know that Google+ things
like I'll tell you what go online around
seven o'clock tonight and and and look
for my post and then they join a hangout
and that's just it right hangouts are so
magical especially the first time that
you see them as a phone ring so I think
that's another step is exposed your
friends two parts of Google+ that you
feel passionately about and I the third
step this really worked for me is that
when I rate right cool content directed
at them they respond bad comments and
after they do that for a while and they
see the value they're also writing their
own posts so engage with them right
bring them into you know the product and
and and start talking with them all
right I think we have somebody on our
hangout let me see if I can make it
louder and through the microphone hello
well there's a whole bunch of you I just
got to know what what part of the
country are you in okay is it really
warm there
you're hold on let me point you at the
world just so you know everybody's
watching you okay awesome thank you so
much so do you have a question yes do we
get stickers so I'll talk to van about
that we'll see if we can send you some
okay my question is is this app to
improve and quite possibly to replace
Facebook and all other social networking
systems she was is this happened I
believe he means Google+ his Google+
intended to replace all other social
networks out there and and i responded
as as i started is that i actually
addressed this at beginning of the slide
show and what's important to us is
focusing on the user right i know that
there's lots of similar ways to do
similar things online and offline but
what's important to us is just doing the
right way for the user yeah and so
that's why we implemented circles in
particular and that's why we built you
know this product and that's why we've
we've been extending that across Google
and that's why we're focusing on the
users in such a way hello yes okay
there's all these things happening and I
and I think that's important and that's
that's what's interesting is that is not
so much you know what else is out there
but is this working and is there
something that we could do to improve it
you could give us feedback on I mean
we're in field trial and this is just
the beginning right now we're just
making a great experience for our users
okay so let me just leave you on
something is that I you know one thing
that it is really clear by the question
and answer period is this and you
it's it's it's a bit more of a serious
note than our last question but I think
this is important is that every one of
these questions or pieces of feedback
you've talked about your experience and
what you're doing and then we've even
had some responses like look that that's
not available to feature but you can do
this other thing and I think that's
really interesting and you as part of
this technology user group you're at the
forefront of playing with this new
technology and and and playing around
with google plus and while we're in our
field trial and I really encourage you
to continue to do so and keep giving us
your feedback as you can see we've taken
feedback and made project product
changes directly from that and we're
going to continue to do that so please
keep letting us know everything that
works well for you and everything that
you'd like to see improve and don't
forget to log on and hang out thank you
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
