I'm working for graphics tree and I'm
gonna talk about I grafts we're doing
visualization for very big data sets and
we and we use GPU actually to to be able
to process more data so I'm going to
talk about how we use and leverage the
power of GPUs to make our code run
faster so let me start by motivating
cool things that you can do with GPU so
this is a system from otay that will
actually record a hockey game right and
then lets you let you live it right if
you want in VR where you can just see
the game from any angle be in the field
literally and this is this is all
powered by by by GPUs another example
actually is doing machine learning on
GPU so this is this comes from analytics
which has a whole platform for doing
medical diagnosis right and they're
actually for instance on on radio on
x-rays they're better than dr. selected
to detect hairline fractures right to
get to that point they had to learn
right on a huge amount of data and for
that GPUs are great
and the last thing I want to show you is
actually what we do a graph III which is
building a data x4 for very large data
sets so let me show you a demo of that
alright so i quickly packed it up in
Python so you may not be yeah maybe it's
more readable now the code doesn't
matter what i did i tried to call the
speaker at this conference and i look at
who was following her on twitter and i
made a graph out of it and this is this
is what I got
let me reload
so this is our community of speaker so
we can see that I have two main clusters
actually you know where most of the
speaker are here and for instance over
here we have the data visualization crew
for instance and actually images just
give a great talk about designing the
data visualization with interaction in
mind so it looks like the community is
actually kind of split in two but but
that's not really the case when I added
to the graph to know Nick diagrams also
all a link between speakers whenever
they had a common follower and this is
the picture we get
hmm
okay it looks like it looks like the
network is failing me so I disconnected
be
yeah so so this is so this is the graph
I get and this is the raw data so what
I'm going to do actually I'm going to
run a clustering algorithm on the server
that's going to be on GPU on your GPU
and now actually
oh okay Mike my computer died no
let's try one more time
alright
ok I think my laptop died
uh
okay well
so I can't quite for you to graph
in the past recording the screen and
running the visualization at the same
time has proven to be a problem so this
is what you would see actually in fact
so you see connected communities of all
the speakers the point here is that we
run all the expensive analytics on the
server on GPUs and then we swim the data
to the client so that we can explore it
so this is what I'm going to talk about
I'm going to quickly give a high level
difference of GPUs and CPUs explain what
they're good at I'm also going to argue
about why you should care about GPU now
even though they have existed for like
20 years and then we're gonna since this
is forward yes we're going to go I'm
going to explain how you can take
advantage of GPUs from JavaScript
directly all right so
this is a cpu watch what you have in
your laptop and phone and this is a GPU
so already at a very high level we can
notice a big difference right the CPU
has a few processing unit but they are
very flexible and I'm going to explain
what that means the review the GPU has a
lot of them but they are very rigid
right again I'm going to elaborate on
that but you might you might wonder
right why can I get why can't I get a
lot of flexible execution unit right
that would be the ideal hardware to
program well if you were to do that your
computer would burn down all right so
the key the key reason that drove the
difference in designs between CPU and
GPU is simply power constraints we can
put a lot of transistor on a chip the
today but we can only light up so many
before we just mail down the whole ship
so if you go back to the future in 1995
this is this is the way your CPU worked
right so here we have a program that's
going to add a bunch of number four of
them and the CPU is simply going to go
through the program operation by
operation one by one so we're going to
execute you the first edition then the
second one and so on so this dislike
architecture is called single
instruction single data right because I
apply one instruction on one piece of
data one by one and you can see actually
doing the operation right actually
computing things is not what is
consuming a lot of energy right decoding
the instruction and moving data around
within the CPU is where we actually burn
a lot of power
so fast forward in times today in your
laptop in your phone your CPU is looking
like that so if you run the same program
you would just take the foreign foreign
operation we had and just run them out
all at the same time so that's great
right we go for time faster but in terms
of power we're just consuming just as
much as we did before right so this is
called Mindy we run multiple instruction
and each struction operates on data
independently so there is actually
another way in architecture and cheap
design that that you can go to to get
better performance and that's what GPU
do so instead of instead of running one
instruction on one set of data they're
going to run the same instruction on
multiple pieces of data right and now
that that's actually that makes our life
as programmer much more difficult
because to program such chips I have to
arrange my code to do due to group
operation together so I do you know for
addition and then I might do for
multiplication and so on in terms of
power that's that's a big gain right
because now i only pay the cost to
decode instruction and to execute it
once so that means i get i get to
amortize all that all that cost that I
had to to move there around
so so you know this is how this is why
GPUs can have a lot more process a lot
more execution unit is because they are
more rigid in the sense that they need
to do all the same then they need to do
the same operation over and over again
so I said GPU have existed for 20 years
and that's true there on your phone
there in your laptop so what has changed
in the last few years that you might
want to take advantage of them well so
Jim WebGL mm not quite so what has
changes you can now have GPUs on the
server right in fact you can rent one on
amazon for 65 cents an hour and so
that's a that's a lot of computing power
that you can use for your back in
application that in the past was only
available for gaming basically so
for instance this is how we take
advantage of GPUs in architecture to to
do a big data analytics so we have GPUs
on the server and there we run
everything that's computed
computationally expensive so for us it's
all the analytics right and then we
stream the result to the client that's
simply over the internet and here on the
client we use the GPU too but this time
it's only for rendering right and then
we get to display the results all right
so you may wonder right why why do I
care that that to get the results so
quickly right so let me hear quote
Marissa Mayer so so she said famously
that for every half a second of delay in
your web app you lose twenty percent
refusers so I graph III we builded a
visualization for security here using a
data centers so for us the time to graph
is critical that means we need to be
able to grab the data process it into a
visualization in a few seconds and GPU
enable us to do that
so if I were to run to a visualization
on cpu this is where I we get after two
seconds so this is my data center and
it's a mess right there is 0 everything
is together does this graph is just not
legible it's a hairball like we say if I
run it for the same amount of time on a
GPU this is the visualization i obtained
right so all the different clusters
nicely separated suddenly I have a graph
that's the tuple and I can I can just go
about maybe drilling you know one of the
one of my service see what happens she
ready outages
alright so hopefully at this point I've
convinced you that the GPU are awesome
so the next part of the talk is just how
do we use them and how to use them with
JavaScript so if you want to do graphics
or if you care about rendering we had
we've had a lot of WebGL talks and I
would I would point you to them as a
reference for everything else act and I
want to mention that there's some great
library for JavaScript like three
Dodgers if you want to do anything else
with GPU anything that's not graphics
and fortunately we are the situation
here is not so great so there is no nice
high level API that you can use to to
program a GPU what you have to do
actually is use low level c like api and
those so that would be open CL sort of
an open standard and then if you use and
video hardware that would be cuda so i
graph III we use OpenGL so let me let me
tell you a little bit about open seal so
open CL is kind of like C so that means
that in your program you have variables
that are tight and then all your memory
is just one big array so in JavaScript
you were used to have objects right that
you can pass around in function in
OpenGL and in see everything is just an
index into the one big array that is
your memory right so that's interesting
because opencl lets you structure your
memory into here i use it i I've
structured it into a 2d array and then I
get the key point is that I get to run
the same operation on on all of my
altima all of the cells of my array at
the same time
so that gives me huge file ISM right
that that's where that's where i'll gain
performance so if you want each if each
of the little legs cells of my array is
like one c function or one javascript
function that i'm going to call
so let me show you one one real CL
program actually so to make things
concrete so this is what the program
should do and I've written here at sea
this is the CL program the opencl
program that is going to move node on
the screen so it takes a 2d arrays input
and then for every element of that array
I'm gonna add 2 2 i'm going to add two
to every element so i'm going to
displace if you want the note bye-bye to
in opencl i'll write it like that so I i
would simply specify that it's a colonel
it's sort of a joke on to say 11 program
and i have to make sure that my input
and outputs are passed as argument
because function in opencl cannot cannot
return value and then the strange part
is that my my loops actually disappear
they become implicit because the code
the code that actually changes the
position is going to be is going to be
run in parallel on all of the cells of
my array so that means all I have to do
is figure out you know which cell I need
to operate on and this is done with
those those like opencl primitive
function here I here get my ID
so you know if opencl is great and give
us a lot of performance why why don't we
use it everywhere right is there a
reason to use anything else the answer
is that you know opencl code is is
actually quite ugly and complicated in
practice so this is a screenshot of our
own code and you can see it's quite
complex and it's it's not easy to
understand what it does or why it's
correct right there is like you know
complex loop condition strange commanded
lines of code so so I mean the truth is
that it's tough to write opencl but it's
worth it because of the performance game
thankfully actually the denote community
made it very easy to interact with
OpenGL and GPUs right with with all the
nice feature that building for a
synchrony I'm going to I'm going to
detail that so AMD actually rode
bindings called node opencl that that
map all those low level c function on to
javascript function that now we can use
and what's great about it is that I get
to write my my you know server
application mostly in JavaScript so I
can be productive and for the tiny bits
that are performance critical I can go
down to open CL and and make make you
know those important code paths really
really fast so you know for us we notice
that in our code base you know the book
you know everyone except the open seal
hackers are completely insulated from
from our use of DP you you know we're
it's mostly JavaScript
so there is one big don't downside with
no to open CL is that to use to use one
opencl program it's a lot it has a lot
of bureaucratic code and I need to go
through so this is how this is how I
would call the function in JavaScript
this is how you call the same function
in opencl alright so that's not fun so
thankfully we're actually building a
wrapper around opens around node opencl
that we call CL DJ s and the goal is to
wrap all that bureaucracy and hide it so
that we can call an open-cell program
just like you would call a javascript
function for instance this is how you
create your opencl programs i declare it
and then you can simply call it to cycle
normal function the only key difference
perhaps is that the input and output
needs needs to be either typed array or
buffer right because those are going to
be passed down to the GPU
one thing that I didn't mention is that
when you run an open CL program right
since it runs on a GPU your CPU can do
all the other things right at the same
time so that that function that wraps
your opengl program has to be an a
synchronous function so you get notified
when the result already and that's where
node is often or the java javascript in
general because it has all those great
promise library to to deal with the
synchrony so for instance this is how I
would you know run compose opencl
program together where I would you know
call our move node function to move the
points and then I might use the result
and feed that into several other open
cell programs
alright one cool feature of theology
that that we implemented is God's
visualization so let me let me explain
you what I mean by that in opencl you
often end up using macro because you you
really care about performance and macro
lets you target special device you know
optimized for a special hardware and it
also lets you enable and disable code
paths as needed so that way the compiler
only really sees the code that you need
and can do a better job at optimizing it
so as a result instead of passing a
functional a parameter as a function
argument we often just pass it as a
macro so what it means is that when you
want to change one of those argument you
would have to recompile that that open
cell program every time and we actually
handle that completely transparency so
you can simply you know if I if I
actually if i disable the strong gravity
featured and I would run that piece of
line that piece of code and when i
change that parameter to true then i
would simply recompile my program this
time with this piece of code and that
all happened in the background without
me the JavaScript programmer having to
to care about it
alright
one thing that will be great that that
we haven't implemented is simply take
any JavaScript function maybe a type one
in Adams andrea's for instance and
translate it to GPU code right so that
it can be run efficiently on the GPU so
one cool stuff would be imagined
Feinstein's taking a query from the user
/ you know your data sets a sequel query
and instead of running it on the cpu
translated down to GPU code and rhonda
GPU so there is like no no like big
technical hurdle that prevents us to do
that you just haven't implemented it so
what we're really doing is really
building the equivalent of jquery but
for opencl inside archaeologists library
and we are actually right now we are
actually busy porting it to the latest
version of node opencl and we are hoping
to release the library this summer so if
you want a lotta version of it you can
email me
alright
so the question that you may wonder so
you know we've done all that work to
take advantage of GPU in game
performance you know was it was it
really worth it well yes there is here
is the difference between a
state-of-the-art you know graphics for
GFE running on multi-core cpu and an
hour GPU implementation so we we get to
be about 60 times faster by taking
advantage of GPUs and that lets us
process about 15 times more data while
remaining interactive right that's very
important for us because again by by
being interactive by giving the answer
the user and so quickly we follow a
Marissa Mayer principal and you know
fight delay again you know every house a
second of delay cost you 20 be 20
percent of users
alright so
a couple of takeaways is that GPUs
actually work very well is known so you
know take advantage of them the
advantage of the fact that you can now
rent one for 65 cents and we get we in
our in our experience we get great
performance with it and that doesn't
affect our productivity much because we
still do most of our work in JavaScript
all right
so that's it for a talk we actively
recruiting you xui expert or infovis
designer so if you if you're interested
