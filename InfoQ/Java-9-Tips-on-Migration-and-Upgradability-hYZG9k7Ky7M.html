work at Oracle I manage the the Java SE
engineering team which is basically you
know what you are getting out of the JDK
I've been working on Java for for a
number of years so it's still something
that is more than a job is something
that we feel it it's important first
safe harbor which means that you know
please don't make any purchase decisions
on how I'm gonna say so what I'm gonna
give you today is a couple of things so
the first one it is it's going to spend
a little bit of time on upgradability I
know it's not very sexy but that's
something that I believe is going to
become more and more important you know
the cloud micro services continuous
development continuous delivery
continuous deployment continuous
development phase delivery so the speed
of accelerations of writing services
decaying services of grading services is
something that you guys need to take and
be aware of we're going to nine try to
remove the fear around nine about you
know I know there's been some some
concern but hopefully I can give you a
good sense around you know where we are
so for the the uptake of nine has been
very very good I know we if you look at
the data from eight to nine you know
nine is in fact you know ahead in terms
of you know adoptions you know people
are starting to already you know tech 9
so it's it's it's very good good sign
for us then and I want to talk a bit
about modules you know one one of the
key feature that we have we have
introduced in nine because there is a
direct in a relationship between module
and of credibility and so that's
something or you can cover and you know
of course you know all this stuff you
know at the end you know ready measure
up to the cloud and of course to micro
services so I use the one micro services
one so now you know I can move ed in and
talk about I've great ability so
it's odd you know and in some way in our
language is to sing about you know could
I find you know the right image or
pictures to kind of characterize or
credibility and so the the best one that
I found was the three monkey which is
nobody wants to talk about it nobody
wants to wear your body and then buddy
wants to do anything about it but at the
end you know all of us know that it's
it's a very hot problem you know
something that oh there is annuities of
java or gosh you know they're gonna you
know those guys have brightly reason
oh no that's mean it's gonna be some
work for me I don't trust you know the
fact that you know if I uptake in a new
version of Java something is gonna bring
it so you know in one way that's true
but you know also we need to acknowledge
that the world is changing
you know today and in fact in over the
past in a few years there's been this
massive consolidations and compounding
we know of services into cloud
environment and we have seen you know
over the past few months and you're
gonna see more and more in a big crisis
you know I know that there was a touch I
should have upgraded my service and I
figure out well you know it's gonna be
too much work or you know I don't I
don't wanna do it that's okay and then
of course you know you have the big you
know splash where you know you want air
services get attacked a couple of
statistic here that should give you you
know a fair amount of insight of the
problem through 2020 99% of
vulnerability exploited will continue to
be the one that online which means that
people have not touched a system
in 2016 there was first report from
Microsoft that showed that you know over
the years over the upcoming years we're
going to see an increased number of
inner abilities you know from 5,000
whatever number it is up to the point
that you know you can reach and you do
the number
it's basically an average of 15 a days
so what does it mean that you know at
some point in the near future
we may have to upgrade 15 times a day
and that's a major problem for our
industry at the same time you know if
you're creating a large cloud
environments you know being able to
support you know end versions of the
same software you know and if you have
multiple layer of software it's going to
be a tremendous you know cost and as we
know cloud computing at the end is going
to be around utility computing which
means that you know can can i deploy in
an environment where the cost of
operating you know is reduced
what can provide you you know the best
price performance price pair you know
megabytes of Merit price pair CPUs and
so that's why cloud operators are going
to want to have uniformity to reduce
their cost so why why do we need to
upgrade well security fixes that's one
certainly reason why we need to upgrade
regressions well you know there is a
major bugs we have introduced a bugs in
the nuts pot so of course you know you
know you need to get it upgrade to be
able to fix this bug there's a new
release
hey you features cool features I want to
be able to use them more performance yes
you know from everybody's of the VM you
know you can see significant amount of
performance and you will get you know
improved performance more robustness yes
you know if I get two throws one there
fix you know the you know the VM the
libraries or more more stable
well some time because Leon do I know
you another the new version of the u.s.
new version of the soft
taking a new version so you need to
basically go in a bit and of course you
know if you have multiple instance you
don't want to get multiple version of
the same release so you want to go in at
uniformity now why not upgrading well
the first one something is gonna go
wrong I don't want to touch it right
next one
ah is gonna cost me money because I'm
gonna upgrade something's gonna go wrong
my service is gonna be down my bus is
gonna call me and then somebody's gonna
call us and say hey you guys in a scrub
you know you messed up you messed up our
services right
and finally for you guys I know I know
it's work I have to go and basically you
know you took some api's you change some
BPI senior two years I have to make a
change and of course you know that's
something that may may go okay now you
know one thing that I wanted to do also
it is to kind of look at the in a
different technology in our industry and
start to look to look in a bit more
detail you know how those platform
houses runtime are dealing with you know
compatibilities and abilities to do an
upgrade services so the first one
JavaScript yeah we love it
right love lot of JavaScript cards so
you know I find this very interesting
statistic that basically is looking at
you know the 10 you know most in a
relevant site on the Internet and kind
of looking at the compatibilities inside
the card you know on the sides and the
interesting statistic it showed that 30%
of the card right now
on the sides have a bunch of
if-then-else which means that you know
clearly you know when people have gotten
you a new version of the browser new
version of JavaScript engine there to
basically do if then else which means
that you know there is not that much
compatibilities this most scary part it
is if you go now to the top you know
what's the number
in there heard the entire internet
basically this number go up to 64 + 64
percent of the JavaScript card is not
compatible so hmm interesting
now let's go and go well okay you know
you're kidding the block
okay it's doing you know what a TV well
but of course you know it's just
starting and the interesting part it is
you guys some of you guys may know we
are in go we are someone go lame
question to is Greco and now oh sure
decision that I made on go on
I need to go and basically go in change
which mean that they're gonna run into
significant you know compatibilities and
of course our credibility issues now all
their environment so the runtime like
Python you know they were you know you
guys know the transition between Python
2 and Python 3 it was you know people
say well solder is good you know of
course it'll be painful but at least I
can start fresh in some but of course
you know they're either cast you know
I'm doing that in those sto you know a
bunch of people that are still stuck on
Python 2 because a lot of libraries you
know why not see not working CNC shop we
are you know that kind of surrenders
which some way you know it's okay fine
we understand you know as we are moving
we've all been to a bunch of api's we're
not pretending to trying to be
compatible here we just say hey that's
it so let's look at on on the Java side
so Java from the beginning you know
we've been very concerned around
compatibilities and up credibility's
you know in terms of compatibilities you
know the Java platform is really
providing you know three main contract
the first one is run binary which means
that you know if you have an existing
library should after compiled we can
bring this class file and go
run it in the end - one version of the
JVM we have source meaning that in every
source is there you should be able you
know to go and recompile this source to
be able to get you know the same level
of capabilities and behaviors and
finally there is a behavior which is
something that is sitting between you
know the API that you are using and how
the runtime of hotspot is executing in
of these behaviors and certainly know
the antenna it is for us it is to be
able to maintain in at the same
behaviors from one radius of the
platform to the next widdy's you know of
the platform on the API side something
that Java did in a very early on was to
try to clearly separate what we call the
public API which are basically the API
that any Java developer should be using
okay verse you said an API that are just
you know internal API but of course you
know developers and you guys are very
small and you say oh man you know what
is on the other would I have this very
interesting API will not use it because
I can get what I really want maybe in
some case you may be able to get better
performance but you know this API is not
part of the specification set of public
API which mean that from one way is to
the next one
if we decide to kind of change the
implementation guess what then you get
stagnant because you are kind of
depending on something and we move the
ground
you know the knee underneath you the
evolution of API is something that is
that go you know through a very rigorous
process you know which is part of the
you know Java community process by in
Java specifications where there is bunch
of expert that's it and basically
discussed you know the pros and cons of
how to implement you know these
capabilities of these behaviors on the
Java platform or you know how deciding
you know how in fact you know the CPI's
which is a current API
I need triple but there is in a very
strict you know process that involved
the community and that's something that
has been very useful you know something
that is very important and has been you
know from night and you know something
that was you know very successful in
term of has a community driving
specifications of the sapiens now the
the process that that we go through you
know we call this compatibility review
process which is in fact something now
you know that he is public and available
on the con GDK whatever can start to the
cat into the reasoning on why an API is
being evolved is you know is something
that you know involve understanding the
legacy meaning that how existing api's
have been there for many years because
we don't want when we introduce a new
revisions of the API we want to ensure
that existing developers existing you
know applications have a path towards
upgrading we also need to understand how
does API is going to be used today
within the environment and the
capability of the VM but also we need to
understand how in the futures those API
is maybe may evolve and in fact you know
if you look at the amount of time that
we are spending into designing a new API
it's roughly sorry sorry sorry which
means we're spending thirty percent of
the time not on designing the new API
but kind of understanding how people are
using the D key is then understanding
you know how we can provide these
capabilities today as well as
understanding how in the futures we may
decide or we may need to avoid those
APRs
there is also you know a fair amount of
work that need to be done around fixing
security fixes which in some case may
lead us to understand that we may need
to change an API because the API that
was industry design it is not secure or
because the implementations you know
this because this API has some
significant vulnerabilities issues and
the significant trade-off between
ensuring security and vulnerabilities
which is something always has to go
first because we can deliver us an
environmental runtime that is not secure
versus you know ensuring that there is
an upgrade ability pass and we do spend
you know a significant amount of time
you know managing this trade-off around
fixing the right way without completely
breaking in a racing and and part of
this process
you know I truly believe is one of the
reason that over the past you know 20
years Java has remained to be you know
one of the number one development in
environment because you know you guys
are counting on us around insuring
compatibilities and ease of
upgradability now moving to nine okay so
how many of you up try nine yet raise
your hand okay okay and of course you
know maybe the reason the guys haven't
tried it is because oh sure you know
ever a lot of things about 9 you know we
brought you know a lot of things and
that's kind of the first impressions
okay and then you know of course you
know the the second part was kind of
what I will call the acknowledgement
that well no I don't want to talk about
it you know everything is running fine
on seven one eight I'm gonna touch nine
you know well you know Java 8 is
fantastic you know it's great but you
know for the people you know that went
and start to basically take the existing
you know seven eight
in a work load and move them to nine
then I know and I've had a chance you
know over the past in your four months
talk to a number of customers numbers of
developers knows your sense is that it's
not too bad okay yes you know there is
you know some amount of world and I need
to do but at the end you know it's it's
some saying that yeah you know it's it's
okay
so kind of looking into you know down so
so the good news about nine is app the
class pass didn't change in there you
can go and kind of you know take your
you draw or whatever put it on the class
pass and everything should you know most
likely Ryan class wedding has not change
we didn't force you what we introduced
in nine module system we are not forcing
you to convert your new existing
applications into a module yes we
understand that they are in a bunch of
capabilities around that are kind of in
a private API stuff that you should
really use but we understand that for
performance reason and there is not
today you know alternative to those API
lines so you know we found that you know
it was the right decisions to kind of
you know let get you access 2010 or EPS
to get the ultimate performance because
at the end you know we understand with
how Java is way is widely deployed you
know own you know within the industry
that performance is something that you
guys matter so at the end you know most
of the existing cut you know is there
you know we are spend you know a
significant amount of time doing
outreach to you know the main tool the
in libraries that you guys are depending
on and making sure that you know by the
time we witness now I know by the time
now that nine is out that you know
significant you know number of you know
generally used libraries have a version
of nine you know available the
not-so-good news of course is that well
may be the case that you know you are
using this obscure libraries you know
nobody has been maintaining and maybe
these libraries is using some internal
API that maybe there is some work that
need to be done here
you may end up into into a case where
you know some work some more working it
need to be done for you to be able to
attack nine until these libraries has
been converted if you use some component
that are shared between Java C and Java
EE you may need to adjust you know a
bunch of argument on the VM to enable
some option or you know a module that
are not part of the default you know in
your new class pass a few number of
api's have been removed and I will go in
the following slide into you know some
of the DP is a number of you know API is
a tool that we're in the GDK that we
felt you know or not widely used have
been removed part of our intent is to
reduce our work you know maintenance
cost and then you know one thing that
you will see more is warning and and
part of the intending and you're going
to see us doing that you know over the
upcoming release is it is to kind of you
know kind of start to give you the
warning that hey okay using this stuff
you should not really using it but we
give you a warning so you have the time
to slowly you know migrate your your
applications
it was so by the time we are kind of
enforcing you know access to those API
so free you know you could we have
without migrate so at the high level if
we are looking at kind of the many
compatibilities that you're gonna write
- you know we you know up taking nine
yes there is a bunch of bug fixes that
may introduce some regressions bunch of
security requirements you know come in
meaning that a you need to to ensure
that you know your you know in our hand
we need to ensure that the platform is
secure on you end or so you guys need to
uptake new modern and safe you know
protocol if you're using some native
card you know should be okay there's
been too much change in this area in a
couple of you know changing properties
and of course deployments in in the
browser had some impact change of course
on the garbage collection you know now
g1 is becoming the default but of course
we can go back to the CEO the main area
is encapsulations of some internal API
and we do provide you of like for most
of those api's you know at least in nine
but we can give you the warning that hey
you know you need to go in and figure
out you know how to migrate from those
internal appears in most case we are
providing you know we have we know we
are providing a fair amount of
documentations to help you guys move to
invent a native API but you know there
are certainly you know some some amount
of work they need to be done here
significant change in the overall
packaging something I will touch and
then you know a few as I say you know
deprecated method and functionality that
we have the perky DD 8 that now you know
we are moving in now so as I mentioned
the number one incompatibility is most
likely if your application is using a
soft poly libraries that there's not be
for it yet online understood so you need
to let us know you know as as I mention
it you know we have you know silicon at
which for words we want to know you know
all the API that people are are using
also you know something that we have now
and that kind of you know the advantage
that we have it is there is such in a
large number of open source project that
are using
typically what we do is we are trying to
run new versions on all those
open-source project to be able to find
in the potential regressions our
compiler or in some case in our run time
but you know it's important for us you
know that you let us know you know which
libraries you know have not been party
so we made you know influences some
level and have helped some of those
library maintain yours I know to speed
up the uptake of nine encapsulation of
most internal IP is so you know the vast
majority of internal IP is will become
accessible by default but we do provide
you you know an option on the BM on the
VM to kind of unlock you know everything
under and full of you know internal
api's now are very good at tentative
public api so yes that's you know so no
matter work with that kind of in a world
that you guys and the echo system should
have done over the years we've been
telling people for a number of years
that don't use those internal api's we
have provided a tool in aid as well as
your 9g DEP it's it's a very useful tool
for you to basically take your existing
class file or run for this tool and this
tool basically go and try to sort out
and figure out which potential
incompatibilities in your applications
may have so it's going to give you a
nice initial warning as well as give you
some amount of understanding of how much
work you know maybe you require for you
to port your your applications we
introducing nine new capabilities that
we call the Milky release jar so we
understand that you know if you want to
deliver you know one jar file if you
want to be able to support both eight
and nine instead of having you to
provide to your customer two separate
jar file now we will let you basically
combine in a single jar multiple class
representations for different release of
the platform and then at runtime the VM
will figure out and understand that if
you're running on an ATM
you're gonna go grab the eight is shown
nine you can run
online or if you're online but select
hate you can go and grab it and then
that's that I say there is like you know
a number of comment option when you are
launching the the VM that will basically
let you in the unlock you know a number
of those internal impedance another
significant change that may impact you
it is yes we change versioning string
you know going from you know 1.9 to nine
that 1.3 it's a bit painful for some of
you but you know fully you know the
semantics of the new versioning streams
your providers you know better abilities
to express you know what are you getting
is that securely see so that's an update
really so that is that a majority sees
okay the modular runtime images so of
course if you look at you know a new
disk what you're getting in terms of how
the GDK is being installed you have a
complete different structure in fact you
know there is no more our teacher so if
you are going in fishing classes inside
Artie drawers and gonna work very well
online but that's something you know in
the first place you know we should done
you know we understand some case you
know you went and go ahead and did it we
did remove you know a bunch of the
SanDisk but you know what we did and
that's who can of this you know early
access you know one thing that I would
want to stress here it is that you know
we are putting early access even today
of ten you know it's very important for
you guys to go and try those early
access because you can give us
significant amount of feedback in term
of you know if we are deprecating
something and if you think that you know
this is capabilities all this API is
very important we may not know when we
were on that this your face of the Java
platform in the GDK is a lot of API you
know our our science looking at active
project is that you know some of those
API that we have are just like a sepia
but maybe not it's only when you know
you uptake and re-access weenies and
have the ability to provide us feedback
that we can you know understand oh shoot
maybe we should get this appeal there
was a bunch of you know different
combinations you know front on the GC
around the different collectors that you
know we're kind of trying to simplify
you know a lot of our maintenance moving
forward you know we announced the
duplication of CMS with g1 and over the
past few years you know we have made
significant new investment and see if we
can progress on g1 well now we feel back
you know g1 is really the collectors for
the vast majority of users and something
I will encourage you to go if you're not
yet on g1 to go in a Patek g1 there is
more work coming on and on 10 in your 11
moving forward in terms of continuing to
improve you know g1 and really go after
the corner cases where CMS may still be
better than g11 things to look at it is
that you know we are putting you know
more control around you know VM options
that are no more supported so it's more
visible to you that if you are using a
VM option that is not well supporting
now ease up the the VM will exceed or
user you're gonna get a warning saying
that hey you know this stuff is not no
more support so it's more ya gonna make
something that should be easier for you
to to get data of course there was you
know couple of api's on the add property
change listener predictions listener
that we're basically fairly you know
we're not expecting a significant
significant use but you know there may
be some application that are using those
those AP is bunch of you know as part of
the module modernization of the runtime
we have to kind of you know dismount on
the platform infinite places where there
was like you know absurd you know
dependency on you know aid ability with
was your component so we removed in a
bunch of those we believe you know non
used you know API of you know fairly
friend out ramen api's once nificant
change around the thread stop you know
something that you know for a number of
years
you know it's an insect operations be
great for us to be able to fix the VM so
stretch stop should work but that's you
know massive amount of work and we
engineering but at this point I think
it's better for us to be clear that we
know we deprecated and now these things
you know and exceptions if it's try to
using it we change the GGC logging that
may impact you because there is a new
format but you know the new you know we
had like you know different flavor of
logging you know within the VM and I
think what we try to do in nine it is to
combine everything into one single in a
framework that over time would make it
much easier for all of you to maintain
and get you know the right set of
informations from from logging
I did mention Jim one you know became
kind of the default collectors you know
something you can go back and and use a
pallet GC if you need to it's not like
we have removed it okay the next big
change is the six months for these
cations and you know part of the reason
it is that you know we have to kind of
acknowledge where we are in where the
industry is in term of in a spinning of
development you know delivering
innovations you know as as quickly as we
can you know if we were if we had stayed
with the current model just roughly
three years two years and a half
you know GDK named Ziggy ten would have
been released in 2020 in the edge of the
class that's mean that's too long right
and so we decided you know to basically
move our word development you know
engineering team from you know you know
feature driven where this where you know
typically the way we are managing where
this is was we were kind of identifying
kind of you know a few main features and
then basically you know there is mother
was that until does what is all until
those features are done we're not going
to really is it and of course you know
you see what happens when we try to plan
as best as we can but
you know as we go and and implement some
of those very complex features we start
to realize that okay well maybe we need
in those three moments maybe we need six
moments maybe we need one more month
because you know we try to do and we
feel like it is our responsibilities to
ensure that you know when we worry the
features the features to be solid and so
we decided to move into us a time
time-based
you know Maria which is now every six
months and you know we're implementing
internally in the dis Winnie's model and
the ensuring team and the open JDK
community is is fully onboard is around
the time we're going to fork and right
now we are looking to fork ten which is
basically when we start to do the
stabilizations of dedicate 10 on
December 15 it was a feature is in if
not then basically it's going to be
under the keel it from a management
standpoint is much simpler because it's
clear messaging to the engineering team
and also for the engineers because
that's kind of telling them either the
feature is ready and that can work on
the final stabilization so and if not
then they can delay and if you know now
that you don't have to wait three years
for this for these features to be
delivered then you know that's something
that is you know much more much more
compelling and for you guys then that
will enable us to deliver you
innovations at a much rapid paced also
you know what we announced was you know
that we're going to deliver a pure GPL
open GD cavities and also you know we
have announced at JavaOne this year that
all the commercial features that we had
in our core GDK we can open for them and
so as we are progressing then there will
be no difference between the rocker GDK
and you open GD k you know something
that you know will enable us to address
kind of the chunky market if you're in
the legacy it may be great for you then
you can stay on our core GDK okay if you
want innovations and come with us on the
pan GDK we're going to crank this stuff
every six months in a bunch of new
innovations a bunch of new excitement
and you know we are certainly know very
excited
and you're looking at the roadmap that
we have in a bus in terms of you know
significant project like project
Valhalla project Panama
you know revamping the entire Jane
ai-jen a system we just announced you
know the GGC low-latency
in your for once so we can get rid about
you know first time for you know Java
and for JVM based in to applications and
then project loop which is implementing
lightweight thread you know into into
the JVM so roughly you know from a high
level features that's mean that you know
every six months you will get an open
JDK release and then roughly every three
years you will get the long term
releases which is you know a modem that
is you know people that you know are
using Linux you know very well familiar
with and something is that's an industry
model that you know a lot of platform
are moving into into this model so it's
it's simpler to explain simpler for
customers you know to make the choice
whether you want stability legacy you
stay on the LTS if you want innovations
you move on the six months in a release
cadence so you know if we look at in and
basically you know that's that's data
that we have kind of you know nine you
know over the past I would say five
major releases so if you look at in
clear detail you know why it is ought to
uptake a new version of Java and so what
we have found that basically 20% is
because yes you know we have removed the
pre Kadir API but typically what we try
to do it is to ensure that we give you
enough notifications before we are
removing those API is sorry persons or
the complex cases which is the case is
where either you know the implementation
of the spec was wrong meaning that you
know we have to adhere to the spec the
spec is right but the implementation is
wrong and we do try to implement the
best compatibility test suite but some
guys you know we're gonna miss something
or somebody will come that is doing an
alternative implementation of the VM or
the Java language and say that hey you
guys
the implementation is not matching the
specifications and so here of course we
may have to change the implementations
or can be the case that the
specification is wrong and in that case
you know who need to go and potentially
also change the implementations then
also there is a case that I was
mentioning earlier where should you know
there is a vulnerability here and we
need to go and make a change you know
the 30 persons of the heart case for us
because you know we can compromise the
specifications we can compromise
security and we can compromise
correctness so there is a fair amount of
expectation that we may run and is not
always the case from one way these to
the next release that we can run into
some of those issues but you know there
is a case here
and finally what we found out you know
from talking to a large number of
customers that in 50 percent of the
cases the issue was all around used of
internal api's okay and that's where I
think that you know we need to kind of
go back and figure out you know how do
we assemble you know those applications
you know how can we better around
providing kind of the right level of
abstractions where the set of public
KPIs are clearly exposed to developers
there is a clear contract around hey as
a developers or as a library developers
those are the only public API that you
should be using if you go and start to
dig inside and using it an internal and
private API guess what you know this
contract this correctness you know is
not going to work so you know the best
energy that I could find it is you know
can we go back and look at what the
other guys have done so you should go
back into the data center ten or fifteen
years ago the highs look like and I'm
sure most of you have been in these
things why are you aware now if you go
now to one of the new data centers you
know from all the major cloud providers
they
you see the difference here right and
here there is no real magic that's mean
there's been just you know very few
golden world first one is you need for
uniformity this mean every servers look
the same the cabling behind is the same
so there it is completely in deformity
and why because it's easy to manage easy
to maintain easy to understand and then
the next one is modularity which mean
that I can take a piece it's a module I
can replace it by module I have clean
API clean and their faces and that's
something that if you take this energy
and look at what's happening within our
software industry then you can start to
see this trend where there is this
tremendous demand and in fact you know I
will hope that the macro service
revolutions is all around providing a
better way to provide modularity is
between how you build services and
applications cally Dockers you know
significant innovations around providing
a uniform containers you put your apps
that's the containers any cloud will be
able to operate on this container in the
uniform uniform it miners community the
foundations of how all those the
containers get manage provisions
instrumented but the key part missing it
is what about the app that is sitting
inside this container okay and that's
where Java 9 and the module system is
becoming so important it's so important
because module really exposed from an
object oriented in a priming in a module
you know what is the class that need to
be reused remember that in order for you
to build a motorized environment you
need to get these clear separations
around what are the PISA can reuse and I
can reuse them with trust trusting that
those api's these behaviors this
contract that I have is there if I can
inter Majella KDK as close to 217
packages but hadiri is add your using
others
every package that I have here can
depend on another packages creating
these dependencies is flow of
informations and contract is so
important and in nine form once you know
we on we know we have introduced in the
Java language deep in the Java language
deep in the libraries and the VM because
this contract around API encapsulations
is being enforced at the vm level for
once now we know through the module info
you will work to clearly exposed you
know one of the set of packages an API
is about public this is what set of API
is our primary and intern api's that
basically saying that nobody should be
using unless I give you the right to
using it so in nine we kind of
introducing in a way before nine yes we
had public public package because what
public package is like opening to
everybody and so the key you know
innovations and capability that we are
introducing in nine in modules is now
the abilities to say that yes those
packages are public but by the way there
is a public to everybody which means
that at that point any developers you
know can use the pr i--'s or
those public api's can only use by my
friend modules or those predicates pis
can only be used within the module
itself and thus abstractions run module
is not just for us you know which i'm
commenting the platform is something
that we are providing to any libraries
developers so when you write now your
libraries using the 9-mil modules you
will have the same abilities to be able
to protect your user from accessing
internal api's it's it's important
because now you can express you know
this clear dependency you know and why
this dependency expressing these
dependency is important because now you
have a contract a contract that can be
enforced by the VM itself if you go back
and look at at the GDK seven the
internal of gk7
we reach to the point
you know this this stuff was completely
unmanageable in term of dependency left
and right and guess what
you know upgrading internally for us a
grating any packages any any api's was
very complicated so over the past three
years that we spent working on jigsaw
and the Moodle system we end up in to an
environment that is much cleaner and we
believe by having these motorized ations
use of module system we can provide an
environment that we need you to make
sure services your libraries the
platform much easier to upgrade so you
know summary you know the cloud clock is
ticking no more don't sing in terms of
grading services in term of months years
is going to be second minutes to manage
at scale uniformly cloud operators you
know how they require uniformity that's
why it's so important you can upgrade
upgrade upgrade in nine we introduced a
module which I believe it's a strong
foundations to make the Java platform an
environment that will make it easier for
you to write services that can be
upgraded up take off nine is not that
scary okay and ready might call for
action it is please uptake nine because
as we can move you know the entire
ecosystem online for strong module
encapsulations
you know environment then every
applications every libraries will be
much easier to upgrade thank you for
your time and I think we have we know
few minute for questions thank you
hey questions will I ever be able to use
the modules of one GDK into another one
for example if I have use the Oracle LCS
version but I want one feature which is
already an open JDK KDK can I use that
module that's that's a beautiful
question it is well and that's a
question I'm getting almost you know
every day from a customer oh I love
stability but I see you guys are working
on these features but I want this
picture so basically I want feature and
I want stability right so that's you
know that's a nice things to ask you
know and and in some case you know
OpenJDK you can contribute here and in
some case you know you know the ability
is to bring a new module a new module
into a legacy way this will be you know
possible because thus your face off of
dependency and again I'm gonna be too
too wide or maybe there is no
implementation that are required so in
some cases gonna be possible
most likely you know libraries I owe you
go up you know easier is gonna be but if
you go into a new feature that is doing
massive surgery inside the VM then at
that point we have and when I use the
word we is not so much Oracle that's
been one big statement that we made a
job one it is we want Java to be an open
judicata MIMO transparent in terms of
bringing more people to help us advance
and contribute but we have to make
decisions as an ecosystem do we invest
in the past because we can do that
that's mean I can go and put engineers
to go work and back call a bunch of
features or do I move engineers into
building new feature that we are working
on and that's kind of the balance here
hi we currently use OSGi as the Java
platform audio system no no no no so is
there a clear path to go to Java modules
yes so so basically you know OSGi was
the module system
what was the module system was built you
know a few years ago you know when there
was no module system and so basically
what we did with the jijiksa module was
to kind of understand the capabilities
of AG eyes but also understanding that
there was one big requirements we wanted
to get as a module which is certainly
expose the module system to developers
which is what what was kind of you know
the main goal of AGI but also we wanted
to use this module system to modernize
the platform itself and in some way we
are selfish here but at the end we
realize that you know the cut base had
so much dependency you saw the graph
that I showed you on the dk7
it was completely crazy well we had
dependency left and right and and
building a module system to modernize
the platform this is what your eyes you
know a Services has a different set of
requirements that's where kind of ended
things
no didn't fit you know very well but
certainly in the design of the jigsaw
system the module system now that we
have in nine we work very closely with
authorized people to make sure that
there is a pass for be able to bring
OSGi on top objects of working you know
side way with jigsaw so we always by
like Jerry Bell or other tools too hard
for metal level changes so we'll Java
provide built-in hardware like we always
struggle to deploy new metal level
changes to web containers when we
recompile right so yes so we are working
you know on classify definitions or the
abilities to go well you can quickly you
know redeployed with having to recompile
andrey or we you know we're doing in
fact you know in nine we introduced a
shell it's kind of give you now the
interactivity is what you can go in and
so we can look up more classful
definitions and be able
to do all three deployments as well as
hot patching that's kind of we know now
the kernel you know some of the kind of
like Linux can do hot patching and so
when we do it is to bring kind of the
same concept into the VM itself well you
don't have to shut down your service you
can go in we do you know really find
some classy and just some some
constraint of course is there any change
in the native API with Jane I yeah so
project Panama we go to Carol eight or
the team is working very hard with with
your entity community and clarity you
know that's an area that we need to
completely revamp and of course that
dirty secret of j9 was with the g9 and
Bureau's API in such a way twenty years
ago was to say we want to make it so
hard
so people should figure out that he'll
let you use Java but of course of course
twenty years later when I that you know
we have to accept that there is none of
capabilities that David or should use
from from the native so please look at a
project Panama it's on OpenJDK so
Bernard there's still more questions
there's an open space next by chance are
you gonna be able to make it okay so if
you have more questions there will be
open space in the next room in 25
minutes
