basically the tools that allow us to get
our HTML out of our code I have a
favorite I like handlebars Express
doesn't naturally come with handlebars
but the best part about that is is it
lets us see how we could configure
Express to use another template engine
so let's do that first we are going to
NPM install another package called
Express three handlebars and we also get
to see one of the nice features of NPM
and then we'll take a look at what the
package.json file actually is so I have
installed they expressed three
handlebars package and what I've done in
the background is update the package
that Jason or what is packaged Jason
it's essentially a manifest that nodejs
uses for managing various projects and
what we have here online whatever line
that is line eight is the beginning of
the best part about package Jason which
is the dependencies we need to run our
application and we haven't actually
created any of this by hand so we don't
have to touch the Jason ourselves it
gets created for us using NPM the reason
I'm using this package is because it is
as they say a handlebars view engine for
express that doesn't suck now we need to
actually set up Express to use this
particular package and the first thing
we are going to do is we're going to get
rid of all of our old views what our
views there are things that Express uses
to build our web pages so first of all
let's go RM views get rid of everything
inside of there then we are going to
copy from the package we downloaded some
basic framework of views to work with
ourselves just like it says there are
basic views into the views folder now
the apt j s is the generic file that is
usually used to start up it's like the
main file for your express application
let's open that up and you can watch my
not so great VI skills here we're going
to include another our package that we
just downloaded so we can link
handlebars into our code using the
require statement and then we have a lot
of settings here express has a lot of
settings that in 10 minutes we won't
cover but here's what we're going to do
we are going to get rid of the previous
view engine that we're using called Jade
and we're going to plug in our own the
app is our application
we are declaring that it is handlebars
we are hooking up the interpreter
and then we're making it work
we're going to get rid of the previous
views that were used and we are going to
send everybody to our new code let's
make sure everything works and we do we
see that it works we have a new home
page that has nothing on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
