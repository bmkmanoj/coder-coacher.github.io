programming android and I'm going to be
teaching Android classes for Marikana
and today I'd like to tell you why I
love android first of all it's the Java
that I always wanted I worked in Java
for for a long long time I've built lots
of stuff that works on giant servers
that runs on big iron somewhere um but I
always wanted to do desktop stuff and I
pretty much never got to and Android
makes it really easy to do that one of
the things that's that's really
important in a 44 developers is that you
want a linear curve you want stuff
that's easy to be easy and stuff that's
hard to be incrementally harder you
don't want to ever find yourself having
to back up a whole month to do the next
month's worth of work and you almost
never have to do that with Android with
Android the next little bit that you
want to do is probably just some little
addition that you make to your current
application I have a nephew who's I
think he's 14 years old and he's already
building Android apps they're simple
android apps and if i want to make them
more complicated I just you know get the
source code and add tweaks to it it's in
it's a perfect perfectly nice linear
curve getting more and more difficult
the second thing is that that swing
which is the the Java graphics library
was always kind of an uncomfortable fit
on top of Java so for better or worse
java always chose simplicity overpower
so it's not a very powerful language but
it's easy to understand it's clean and
straight forward and I don't think you
can say any of those things about swing
so it's always kind of a weird fit well
android graphics are not
way at all android graphics are
perfectly are pretty straightforward
pretty easy to understand um if you
decide to go with 3d acceleration or
something like that the tools are there
you don't have to use them if you don't
want to but they're there if you do want
them and the last thing is that it's not
j2me and those of you who are j2me
warriors i'm really sorry about that and
come on over to android the water's fine
the second thing i like about android is
that it fails better and this comes from
a an essay that was done by cory
doctorow he said it much better than I
did but but your mobile phone is
something that that it's a fairly
intimate attachment and it's getting
more so as time goes on you use it to
like probably if you're like me use it
to you know figure out where you're
going to do eat lunch today on all your
SMS messages from all your best friends
are still probably sitting on it um it's
more and more a part of our fairly
tightly integrated part of your life and
there are all sorts of people who want
to own it okay so we've got players like
Apple and Google and Samsung and AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon that all think they own a
little bit bit of that phone and their
goals are not necessarily the same as
yours those people to all of those
organizations some of them are good some
of them are not but they all want a
piece of your phone and they're not you
and the thing I like about Android is
that you know open source is not the
point open source isn't what this is
what I'm describing here Android is
really not totally open of course on the
other hand it's pretty good self defense
there are for instance random outlaw
versions like cyanogen which is just
some group of guys that put together
something that runs on my phone I love
it the other day my phone died and my
entire call log was lost and with a
little bit of knowledge of sequel light
and a little bit of googling I was able
to figure out where the call log is
recover the whole thing and put it on my
new phone I think that's a that's a big
win people need to think more about not
what happens when everything goes right
but when something goes wrong how how
easy it is to get at all of the
important stuff that's now on your phone
and the last reason is that tiny robots
are just cooler than fruit I'm Blake
Mike and I'm going to be teaching
classes for Americana and I hope to see
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
