this slide it is not the rest of the
slides get better I promise I'm the
director of apps research for strategy
analytics and we are primarily not
developer focused in our research we
cover a lot of developer information but
we really work with a lot of the
platforms telcos handset manufacturers
to help them understand their strategies
around the application space in my area
in particular but also with no hardware
and sort of across the entire spectrum
of research areas so I wanted to sort of
start today by a pretty simple statement
that apps are pretty important right
they're important to to you folks who
are building businesses they're
important to us because they give us
jobs because we cover them but I think
primarily fundamentally one of the
things that we don't talk about as a
driver for app growth is that people
just like using applications I mean how
many people here have used an app today
thank God if everyone didn't raise their
hand I would look really silly and we
use these applications throughout the
entire day as yiannis was saying during
his presentation there's no sort of date
parts right we use them when we wake up
we use them when we were in the car
hopefully not too much but in
Massachusetts where I'm from they do it
all the time and we use them in various
places that I will not site here but
it's something that's with us all the
time something that we use all the time
and that's what's driving this explosive
growth so we're going to share some data
here throughout this presentation that
hopefully be helpful if you have any
questions at the end feel free to you'll
come up and ask us anything when we're
done I'll try to be quick so we can do
some Q&amp;amp;A at the end basically what we've
done here is look at sort of app
downloads to date and I really want the
important thing to come across this is
non feature phone related application
download so you're looking at things
like iPhone iPad Android Market
blackberry etc and really what you see
is that until the end of 2011 actually
this is year to date so growth will be
even higher you're getting very close to
reaching 30 billion downloads across the
spectrum of applications that's a huge
number I wrote a report once comparing
it to how long it took McDonald's to
reach the first billion hamburgers
downloaded and the number was like one
percent as long it was pretty pretty
impressive and you know if we extend
this graph beyond 2011 you'll see the
number grows exponentially and the
benefit of that of course is that lots
of people are down
the applications some of those people
are paying for those applications some
people are paying through money some
people paying through advertising some
were paying through virtual goods as was
discussed before I'm sure we'll discuss
during this panel but ultimately the
point is you have a route to getting to
a consumer in a way that nobody else had
the opportunity to before and very few
will have the future have the
opportunity to do so in the future so
look at this as an unbridled opportunity
to drive revenue now with that there are
obviously challenges as well but let's
delve a little bit deeper into what's
driving these importance of these
applications I wanted to highlight how
important applications are to the
consumer we do a lot of consumer surveys
at strategy analytics and what we saw
was we ran the survey in January in
February and I'd argue if we do it again
next year numbers will be even greater
so you can see across the spectrum of
all different countries throughout the
world that we did this survey so was US
Europe including the big five as you
would expect and China China obviously
being the most important applications
played a critical role in the decision
to buy a handset so not only does that
mean that applications are valuable to
consumers but you have a position with
handset manufacturers and carriers in
influencing consumers decisions so if
you help support a platform and that
platform becomes successful a lot of
people make money on the backs of your
applications and that puts you in a
position of strength when trying to
distribute these applications and become
relevant in this industry in an industry
where 500 thousand applications are
becoming the norm in an app store having
that leverage is incredibly important
now you may be wondering the next
question would be so what happens on the
next phone so next phone availability of
apps on the next ponent you choose to
purchase and you can see now I didn't do
a comparison on this chart but across
the board the relevance of application
has become more important for every
single country for next apps next phones
that consumers are purchasing so again
it's not just a handset a handset could
lead to a tablet tablet could lead to a
smart TV or connected device eventually
moving into the car I think it's just a
very important point to get across that
it's bigger than just selling an
application for 99 cents or a dollar or
two dollars I wanted to delve a little
bit into some of the top categories for
iphone we have this data across all the
different platforms but the chart gets
very ugly for lack of a better term and
unreadable if you put more platforms in
there so
what you can see is that games are
really dominating all of the platforms
that we see today especially on iphone
and across all the lists now a little
bit less pervasive in the free side
grossing it's very important and paid
applications games are very important to
when you combine games and entertainment
you're talking about more than fifty
percent of applications falling into two
categories now the interesting thing of
course is if you compare the pricing of
those applications there's a lot of
downward price pressure because a games
generally cost less than other
applications and there's a lot more
competition so while games are an
attractive area something like medical
applications have the highest ASP on
iphone from what we've seen in our data
yet it's a very you know it's a less
competitive environment but obviously
you need a lot higher expertise to get
into that and actually make an
application that's valuable so there's
this trade-off between sort of the sexy
applications that you want to sell and
the applications that could potentially
be less competitive and drive more
revenue per US business games of course
are a dominant globally as well so the
first slide just showed you everything
in general this is a breakout of the
different regions now we pull this data
directly from the apple store we've been
doing it for the entire year so behind
this data is you know several hundred
thousand data points throughout the year
and you can see that across the lists
everywhere note except for maybe you
know the Middle East and Africa were
actually social networking and I am
applications are much more pervasive
than in mature markets games play a very
dominant role in the North America which
tends to be a forebear of other markets
on occasion these games representing
northwards of sixty percent of downloads
throughout the year that's a huge number
and it's hard to not want to get into a
market where sixty percent of
applications are coming from we touched
on this you plops on this before I think
it's a really important trend to discuss
is the movement towards free
applications now there are good things
and bad things about this right the good
thing is if you have an app that's
really great at monetizing a user if you
sell if you give it away for free and
then charge users for use or virtual
currency or whatever you're going to
charge them for you a possibility of
driving a lot more revenue you know the
downside is of users don't like it they
delete it and you may not get any
revenue from that at all plus there's
going to be more competition so you can
see over the course of this year the
trend towards top grossing apps that are
free has been steadily upward you can
see the
tannaz a little bit more lumpy depending
on sort of what applications are popular
in a given week but the trend on the top
100 is pretty unmistakable you're
talking about going from thirty percent
to nearly fifty percent of applications
are free now in the top grossing if you
look at games the percentages are much
higher it's in the sixteen seventy
percent of games are free so the
positive part is ways new ways to
monetize consumers are recognizing that
you don't just have to buy an
application to use it the downside is
you really have to make a killer app the
consumers want to use and use over the
long term to succeed developers most
excellent opportunity it's sort of a
basic concept right you know to take
advantage of what's out there but
ultimately these are some things you
have to think about because despite this
unbridled opportunity that the app
market is presenting there are
challenges right do you do which
platform do you choose to develop fourth
you go with Windows Phone because it's
newer and because it's not as
competitive or do you go with iPhone
because you're able to monetize better
or do you choose Android or do you
choose something else altogether do you
go with feature phones universal apps
versus device specific apps so is it
better to sell an app for 99 cents that
works on an iPad an iPhone or is it
better to sell an app for 99 cents that
works on an iPhone or an iPad and then
you're selling the application twice
there are always trade-offs that you
have to make is doesn't make sense to be
more useful or less expensive or more
attractive or potentially less
attractive to an audience that doesn't
have multiple devices native versus
html5 this is something that I'm sure
will be discussed throughout this
conference I know there's a panel on
later which I'm going to go listen to
because I'm interested to see what they
say but is html5 really the future what
are the challenges and opportunities I
just wrote an article about that that
will be published as a little soft
promotion that we're doing in fierce
developer that will go out next week and
you know the bottom line findings are
that html5 is an interesting technology
but it's always going to be behind
native applications free or paid again
we discussed that pretty pretty much ad
nauseam virtual goods or advertising or
paid downloads which is the paradigm
that works best for your company these
are things you have to think about and
figure out because even slight shifts in
price can really move an application up
and down in the top 100 and ultimately
do you distribute through the primary
mechanisms like the apple ice the iphone
store or do you go through a third party
like a getjar or carrier where a carrier
may be interested in saying well we
don't really have an app store that's
particularly useful
right now or hasn't have a lot of
applications it's not unique we're
really interested in getting you on
these platforms and maybe you can get
some money from the developer or from
the carrier rather to move on to their
platform because they're desperate to be
avoid disintermediation which is sort of
already happened but no tell them that
because they might pay you to develop an
application for their platform without
knowing it so those are some of the
important points I think and then
there's one last point we just finish
this report about competitiveness of app
stores so you we can argue about the
discovery mechanism in the mobile space
and I think we'd all agree that
discovery is challenged in the mobile
space is it is it you know often times
on the web because there's just so much
out there but with five hundred thousand
applications it's really difficult to
break through the noise so what we did
was look at the top 100 applications for
each of the app stores on a weekly basis
and compare how many apps turned over
regularly so in theory you could have as
few as 100 applications over the course
of an entire year right if none of the
applications moved out of the top 100
and as few as one developer if a
developer dominated at the top 100 what
we saw was no while something like ipad
1 you know quote unquote won by being
the most competitive of all of them you
can see that pretty clearly all of these
guys are falling into the lower left
quadrant so making it into the top 100
which is critical to being successful in
a long term getting recognition getting
marketing getting free marketing and
getting you know driving additional
revenue from these platforms is really
hard none of these guys have figured it
out yet so I think that's also a
critical component to understand is how
do you break through the noise how do
you get above the angry birds of the
world and the cut the ropes and the
other companies that have embedded
themselves in the top 100 and no good
for them that they refuse to leave and
there's no mechanism for improving
discovery so that your applications that
are new are being discovered so I think
this is something worth noting something
worth thinking about and something we're
considering when you decide which
application stores you want to build for
so on that note I am going to let the
rest of the group present and hopefully
we'll have some Q&amp;amp;A at the end thank you
I forgot there's a conclusion slide and
and those are them but we'll just do
that at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
