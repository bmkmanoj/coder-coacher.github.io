here i mean the turnout is really great
so welcome everyone my name is christian
court sky I work in the Google developer
relations team and specifically i work
on google TV and android development so
i'm going to give you quick overview
today of where we are with google TV and
more importantly how you can develop
applications and get your applications
published for Google TV if you want to
get a hold of me the best ways is either
on google+ so you can find me christian
courts k or i also still use twitter so
CN kurtz k or we have google TV
developer tweets so it goes out like I
don't know we try like once every other
day so you can follow us there we
announce news and things relevant to TV
developers we also have a weekly hang
out so if you follow me on the Google+
page we use Google+ to broadcast to hang
out actually every Wednesday one o'clock
pacific so it's usually we bring in one
or two of our developers from the actual
product team and if you have any
questions or if you have any any ideas
or anything you want to talk with the
team you're always welcome to stop by
the Hangout its life so feel free to ask
whatever you want it's probably the
fastest and most direct way to get
answers so what are we going to talk
about first we're going to talk more in
general why developing for television
and I realize a lot of you are familiar
with developing for mobile phones or
Android developers so just curious how
many of you actually are Android
developers or have written android apps
okay so about half of you that's that's
pretty good so then I'm going to show
specifically how you can develop for
Google TV
II how you get started and then once you
have a nap how you get it distributed so
without further ado one of the questions
I want to answer for some of you here is
what actually is a TV and you have to
keep in mind there is a world out there
while we actually go home and we sit in
front of our pcs and we may be hack some
code or something there's actually
people out there who watch television
and sometimes it's really amazing
outside Silicon Valley so some of the
statistics is that in the u.s. an
average home has two and a half people
and it has 2.86 televisions so there's
more TVs than people out there and also
in the u.s. people watch an average of
five hours of television per day
somebody's watching my four and a half
hours or five so what this says is there
is actually more televisions out there
then there is mobile phones and not
every television is a google TV as Eric
Schmidt said we're working hard on
changing that but smart televisions are
more and more common so in for example
in 2010 over twenty percent of all TV's
sold have some form of internet
functionality and actually I was just at
CES over in Vegas and walking the show
floor last year 3d was the big thing
every TV vendor had to have something 3d
this year is was actually smart
television so if you walk across the
show floor every major vendor had
something to say about how they have
smart TVs and so we expect that by 2014
there is about over 120 million smart
TVs sold so there's a lot of opportunity
for developers so to sum it up there's a
lot of people out there who actually
watch television and people watch a lot
of TV and it's mostly a passive medium
it's not so much people we've done a lot
of field trials and we talk with people
and we usually watch them how they
approach television a lot of i want to
say quote unquote us we know what we
want to
action we want to get to the content
quickly regular people when they come
home from work all they want to do is
kick back relax they just want to be
entertained and that's sometimes a
mindset you have to keep in mind when
you develop applications so there is a
very different engagement with the
television then people have with a
personal computer with a tablet or their
cell phone and also TVs are getting
smarter every day so if you look at
quote-unquote smart TVs today of course
there's Google TV but there is other
televisions out there that use things
like HTML widgets or use some basic
integrated applications so we we
actually for see that as as usual
Moore's Law is going to run its course
and the CPUs and RAM and everything is
going to get more powerful so very soon
every TV will basically be an
application platform and so for
developers I think now is a really good
time to sort of get their feet wet and
get in the market and it's going to I
think it's going to go about the same
way the mobile application development
when and where somewhere past the middle
it's right now if you remember the first
smartphones with j2me it was kind of hit
and miss but I think as time goes by
Smart TVs will be a really interesting
platform for developers and so anyway so
people watch spend a lot of time with
their television and I think we should
help make better use of this time so in
general if you look at what you want to
develop for television the one thing
that I can say for sure is anything
entertainment-related is a really big
for TVs so go where the money is and I
actually use this slide here from vegas
and there is big business in in
entertainment so what can you do as
developer so smart TVs give you the
opportunity actually to be the center of
the living room if you look at the
typical household you usually have a
television set somewhere in the center
of the house the family spends a lot of
time when they come home they turn on
the TV and then they sit down they watch
TV so you can as developer you can
enhance the TV watching time you can add
value to it without being too intrusive
so one of the challenges is really
striking a balance between overloading
the user with too much information that
they may be not want but I think there
is a lot of value that can be added and
the other opportunity is yes people
watch 5 hours of TV a day but that means
that there is a 40 inch or 60 inch
screen idol in the house for 19 hours so
if you can come up with a killer app for
the other 19 hours that is actually
really cool so maybe you don't want to
have the TV running at midnight but if
my TV you know maybe talks is my alarm
clock comes on in the morning when I get
up and it already has the weather report
on the TV that used to be the future but
that's actually possible today so I
think there's a lot of opportunity for
apps that we haven't really thought
about I mean a couple years ago when
people what I mean some people still use
like non-smart phones but when people
first started using smartphones Tetris
and whatever tic-tac-toe were sort of
the killer apps nowadays people want to
have like really immersive engaging
applications they want to slingshot
birds across so I think we'll see the
same progression for TV applications so
we got to start somewhere we gotta sort
of figure out what people want to do in
the living room but then I think
entertainment in general is going to be
a good opportunity for developers the
other thing is as we say at Google is no
your users or follow your users so as
developers I really encourage you to to
sort of figure out who are your users
and what do they really want and you can
develop for like people like yourself
but you're probably a lot more
successful if you develop for the other
ninety-nine percent of people so I've
SAT through a lot of user studies and
it's really amazing to look at
v watching behavior that people have and
my best test is usually when my in-laws
come over if they see a google TV and i
have to explain to them what it does
first couple rounds it was little
painful nowadays I'm haces now that we
launched the next version version 2 we
made it a lot simpler to use for normal
users and the real idea of Google TV is
it wants to get out of the way when you
just want to watch TV but with a single
button press you'll actually get to
Google TV so with that actually let me
show you quickly how Google TV looks
like I've seen earlier couple hands up
so some people have a google TV at home
I actually brought one with me I can't
show you the TV functionality but I'm
just going to give you a quick demo how
Google TV looks like to the user let's
see if there we go okay so this is what
you would normally see except it would
be a movie playing so we actually passed
through the hdmi input so a typical
Google TV setup you have some cable
set-top box or whatever AT&amp;amp;T comcast
pick your favorite carrier and you loop
it through the google TV unlike some of
the other things you don't need to
switch inputs or anything but you can
just press the home button and it brings
up the google TV menu at the bottom if
you have used any of the tablets it
looks very much like a honeycomb tablet
it also has a little bit of ice cream
sandwich II feel to it with the launcher
bar in the bottom and you can pick some
of your favorite applications and for
users who are I want to say for advanced
users you can configure all of the home
screen here so you could of course
customize which apps are there you could
customize the home screen but your
average user they will probably just
launched some of the apps that are
pre-installed or you can launch Google
Chrome it has a full Chrome browser you
can surf the web so that's sort of the
default that we expect I mean that's
sort of the minimum from
Shin allottee you can't really sell a
smart TV without it the challenge is as
you see here already using it with one
hand maybe having your soda in the other
or microphone it's pretty hard to
navigate a website that's sort of just
regular website so for web developers
what we actually recommend this you can
also take advantage of smart TV you can
optimize your websites and we have a
couple we have a couple optimized
websites here and I'll talk about that
in my talk later who have just used
regular HTML HTML 5 and they have
created TV specific experiences for
their website so let's let's see
actually crackle is a nice one so
crackle is a video site and they have
created more of a living room look and
feel of their website that you can
actually use with just your remote
control you don't actually need a mouse
cursor for that so this is this is one
opportunity for people who are HTML
developers you can get you can just
optimize your website and give it a TV
look and feel sorry whoops oh crap see
I'm not looking what I pick here ok will
back out of that good thing is it takes
forever to load so anyways I don't
really want to waste too much time on
the on the websites that's something for
web developers so I'm an Android kinda
guy so the good news is we also have the
android market and you can install all
kinds of apps from the android market
and so for the rest of the talk i'll
show you a couple considerations what
you should have when you develop an
android app one other thing if i had a
set-top box right now here one thing
that google TV does is it integrates
with your set-top box and it actually
allows you to browse for content this
one here since it was paired with my
set-top box at home it knows what movies
i have it knows what's currently on TV
so i could very easily change programs
or i could find things that are
interesting to me so this is one of the
advantages people always sometimes they
ask questions like what is really google
TV versus just running android on a
large screen and so this would be the
equivalent of like a Google specific
application that we wrote that is
available on Google TV so also one thing
that we can do is if you search for
content let me just search for say
office that should be safe so so here I
find for example that for the office
there is a couple of seasons available I
can look at say season one and I can for
example by season one either on Amazon
or Netflix and so as we go along there
is of course an opportunity for VOD
providers to add to this here so as an
Android developer basically this is an
Android application so this is sort of
the what I consider the gold standard
for usability and for a user interface
what your app should look like notice i
don't need the mouse cursor or anything
it's all dapat navigable so that's
basically what Google TV looks like so
now let's see how you can actually
create applications for this all right
so how do we develop for this so from a
developer's point of view google TV it's
it's basically a Chrome browser and it's
an Android runtime and I've already
shown you some examples for Chrome web
optimized applications it's a full
chrome dress a desktop browser so yes it
does have flash it's chrome 11 so for
web developers you'll you'll know it
does some of the html5 you may have to
basically you can just develop against
the chrome 11 desktop version and it
allows you to create TV optimized web
experiences as I always say just showing
a web page on a TV does not make it to
the optimized trying to hit the links
with your mouse cursor from your couch
is pretty annoying so this is not TV
optimized and here I have some cute
little kittens so this is TV optimized
so this is just an example of the
YouTube web page and what we did is
basically when we detect the connection
comes in from a google TV browser we
just give the user choice and say hey do
you want the TV optimized or do you want
to standard desktop version you can
actually try this out if you just at
home go to your google chrome browser
and you just go to youtube
calm / lean back you actually get the
same experience so as that we have what
we call the web app spotlight it's a
gallery of websites that we want to
highlight from developers who have
created some really cool web or TV
experiences on their website and you can
just go to GTV gallery appspot com to
find them but for the rest of the talk
really Google TV is all about Android
and the reason is when you develop for
Google TV and you're an Android
developer you're pretty familiar with
the existing system it there's really
not much secret sauce to it so Android
gives you the deep integration with the
system it's a familiar programming
language and it has familiar ap is so
Google TV supports basically standard
honeycomb 3.1 or API level 12 Android
API s and there is a few more things
that I'll talk about at the end which
are Google TV specific I don't really
want to call them AP is but it's just
using Android API is suitable for the
television the one thing I want to
highlight is again developing for Google
TV it's it's not just a big screen
android device so I've seen a lot of
developers who take a tablet application
and run it on a TV and most of the time
it's sort of kind of works but it's
never a really perfect optimized
experience what we really think what
makes a great Android application for
Google TV is optimized UI for sort of a
ten-foot viewing distance lean back with
a remote control and yeah the input
device like you don't want any touch
inputs and also the other thing that you
can take advantage of is google TV has a
lot of optimized media codecs so we
actually have hardware accelerated
impact playback for mp4 file
we have sound support for anything up to
i think it's 5.1 Dolby Surround so we do
HTTP Live Streaming for adaptive bitrate
screen streaming so there is a lot of
codecs that if you develop for a tablet
you don't necessarily have but you also
don't need because the tablet it's a
much smaller screen real estate and
nobody really expects blu-ray blu-ray
quality video playback from a tablet so
with that said I personally think the UI
design is probably one of the biggest
differentiators for for developers and
as a user one thing that you have to
keep in mind is TV viewers have what I
call an unreasonable expectation on
screen polish if you just watch your
favorite game show in the afternoon
every time there is like our name badges
coming in or somebody has like text on
the screen it's not just a 12-point
Helvetica it has drop shadows it has
reflection it has CGI rendering the
stuff is like flying in from the side
exploding in the middle of the screen
just watching your favorite sports or
whether or any of the other news
channels you'll see a lot of high polish
video and high polish you I if people
then switch to your app and you have a
listview with like droid sans' 10 point
it looks pretty pretty sad so again UI
design is one of my pet peeves here so
when you design your UI you really focus
on what's vital for your application in
the living room people don't want to
spend a lot of time trying to learn your
application people have a very short
short attention span they have very very
little patience when it comes to their
television usually they want to get
something done quickly one of my
examples is if you write a music player
or media player or anything don't make
people press seven or eight clicks to
get to the first piece of content if you
have something like say
music on demand just start playing
something either save a playlist from
where they last left off and just keep
playing from last time or just play
whatever favorite hits of the day or
something just make sure the user feels
they started your app something is
happening even if they have to whatever
click through and maybe choose a new
piece of music you can maybe entertain
them in the background with something
then group together controls
interactions and do progressive
disclosure we have a tendency especially
on tablets to show a lot of stuff on the
screen in android gives you a lot of
really cool layout mechanisms with
fragments you can show a lot of UI
elements on the screen again watch watch
some of the professional TV shows and
newscasts and you'll see that people
really focus on a few key words you
don't want to read paragraphs of text on
a screen so focus on the essential throw
out the non-essential multiple screens
basically instead of putting everything
on the same screen just progressively
disclose more and more information as
users drill down deeper and from a
technical point of view look into nine
patch images TVs are really big screens
and if your assets are non scalable and
you have fixed size rendered buttons and
you bring a lot of them your app gets
very large very quickly and it actually
doesn't look very good and lastly as it
TV's really high you I expectation you
may be an excellent coder chances are
you're not a very excellent UI designer
so maybe you know get somebody who
freelances or find some somebody who can
do part time and some UI design for you
actually one of the poor examples one of
the bad examples is if your app looks
like that it's probably not a good idea
so I think this is bad you I design so
here's what you should do you should
have a dark background so you may have
noticed earlier and the lights in here
actually pretty bright but imagine you
sit in your living room the chrome
browser comes
up there is a white background there's
dark font on it it's very disruptive for
a living room also the background having
just a single color people are used to
things like blends or some sort of
rendering stuff so having a background
image makes your app look already twice
as expensive and sophisticated and it's
some simple really simple tricks
sometimes so have some dark backgrounds
use bold fonts people don't want to pull
out their reading glasses is like think
about the demographics of viewers that
you have most of them cannot read a 5
point font or a 10 point font when
they're sitting 10 feet away and keep
the lines short and increase the line
spacing so this would be about as much
information as people can process on
their TV screen when they're sitting
there at ten o'clock at night and maybe
had a pizza and a beer if you want more
information you can actually go to
developers at google com / TV so this is
a URL that's just in general good to
write to write down or you can find us
on Google is we have a UI design guide
and we have some of our UI designers
they wrote up some of the lessons
learned that we had from user trial and
use the feedback developing android apps
okay so now that I've convinced you you
want to actually spend some time to
create a polished app let's see what you
can do so one of the one of the things
that I keep telling talking about is
comparing an android app between phone
tablet and TV yes technically you can
write an app that runs on all platforms
and sometimes that really make sense but
keep in mind the UI is are slightly
different your phone is a very different
UI mode you're very close you have a
touchscreen it's more personal also your
tablet has actually a lot of real estate
and even though your TV screen is much
larger don't put just don't kind of keep
drawing the curve don't put as much
information on your TV as you would put
on your
on your tablet when I work with
developers what I actually recommend is
if you already have a TV later or sorry
if you already have a phone layout and
you have a tablet layout your TV layout
chances are is closer to your phone
layout than your tablet layout if you
just put a tablet app on TV it actually
doesn't work as well especially the
other reason is people on tablets
frequently use gestures swipe rotate
pinch zoom whatever all that doesn't
work on TV you'll be in for a world of
hurt if you try to convert all those
gestures on TV people will not like the
user interface so if you look at
basically information per square inch I
would say the TV is somewhere between
tablets and mobile phones so the other
thing to keep in mind as a developer as
I said earlier we want high polish we
want your apps to look really good but
keep in mind the memory consumption so
as developers if you for example just
want to have a background image and say
your graphics designers they whipped out
Photoshop and they made this really
fancy brilliant looking great background
chances are if you tell them it's for TV
they will give you something with about
1,900 pixels by 1080 pixels and what
this means is if you look at the kerf
you're a full screen background for
something like an hvga device which is
sort of the low end android phone it's
half megabyte not a big deal for
something like the high resolution wvga
it's one and a half megabyte still not a
big deal tablet okay we're talking four
megabytes it's starting to hurt on a TV
a full screen background takes up eight
megabytes at that point you really
should think about how many background
images you need and do you really need
one full screen or can you maybe
composite something at runtime one of
the things to also keep in mind is and
this is a topic I'll talk a little bit
more about later if you stretch an image
or if you just barely stretch an image
to fit the
background keep in mind Android actually
keeps the unmodified and the stretched
image in memory so if you have say a six
megabyte picture and you stretch it to a
full screen background now using six
megabyte plus the stretched version
eight megabytes we're talking 14
megabytes so you're starting to run out
of heap space so let's look at some of
and this is actually just simple UI so
this is a this an image viewer that we
wrote and it's just a simple example of
a grid layout and it has some options on
the side and you'll notice it's square
and we've sort of gotten used to that
screens are square on our desktop and
our phone on our tablet one of the
topics I want to talk about is that when
you look at an old-fashioned TV TV
screens were not always square and
believe it or not this is still haunting
us today so I'll explain the second why
so the problem is basically square
images and round screens and if you're
on a really bad TV something like this
could happen this is a little bit
exaggerated but not much so keep in mind
televisions are not computer monitors if
you sit on your monitor and you read on
your box what resolution your monitor
has you can you can pretty much count on
that every single pixel is there and if
it's not there you can return it if you
buy a HD television even if you pay a
couple thousand dollars I can almost
guarantee you that not every single
pixel on the screen is really visible
there is things like the aluminum bezel
is overlapping something there's
manufacturing tolerances and then
somebody might just have gotten a good
deal on a tab on a LCD panel that's like
five percent smaller so what we find is
most televisions don't display the exact
number of pixels on the screen that HD
TV or basically the 1080p standard it's
technically it's 1920 pixels by 1080
pixels
not all TV's will display that about
twenty percent will but the other eighty
percent won't so when you actually set
up a Google TV device we calibrate the
screen size to what's visible if you
watch say your local news channel or
watch any sports channel you'll notice
that they never put something all the
way on the border they always leave a
couple pixels and there is if you look
up on Wikipedia for overscan there is
usually a five percent margin that
people don't use and if you watch an
action movie and they cut off like a
couple outer edges nobody cares if it's
your UI and you're cutting off one of
the navigation buttons people will
really miss it so technically speaking
TVs don't display border anywhere
between five to ten percent what we do
is as I said we compensate for it but
what that means for you as a developer
you have to scale to the to basically
the output so if you write an Android
app you can't rely on your background
canvas always to be exactly 1080p
resolution and that goes back to the
background image now if you have a full
screen background image you actually
have to scale it slightly by five
percent and now your memory footprint
basically doubles the other problem is
this is actually not even what happens
so the problem what happens is on Google
TV after we calibrate and you have
basically the upper left corner will be
visible but we will cut everything on
the right and everything on the bottom
to make sure it fits on the screen so
for an Android developer if you really
basically if you create fixed size
layouts you may actually end up clipping
to the right and to the bottom and it's
not it's ugly so what you should do is
and we keep telling about this all the
time when you develop an Android app
don't have any fixed assumptions on
screen size if you develop for mobile
phones you've probably by now realized
there is more than one screen size you
have a development phone
most everybody else will have a
different phone and it will be slightly
different it started back in the days
when we had the droid in the Nexus S or
sorry the nexus one and I think one was
800 x 480 the other one was 851 x 480
those 51 pixels were well sometimes
people noticed but so the reason is for
Android just create dynamic layouts use
things like grid layouts use things with
basically relative layouts if you use
gravity you use all of the mechanisms
that we have in the XML layouts you can
easily create layouts that float
automatically and that adapt to the
different screen sizes but if you hard
code and you use absolute layout which
is deprecated anyways then you may run
into problems so this is just one more
reason to really learn about the layout
management and actually use it okay so
this was the screen now let's took take
a look at the remote control so this
thing is also different from your
regular from your from your touchscreen
and if you look at an application and
people who create android apps today
they'll know that most of the time
people will use it with just a touch
screen and no matter what you do you
implicitly rely on a touchscreen so this
is this is a grid layout here and if you
for example use this on a tablet you
would just touch whichever grid or
whichever cell you want to interact with
and as a developer you don't need to
worry about things like focus states is
it highlighted is it active is it
navigable and so on if you navigate this
with a remote control you actually have
to do left left down down over and so on
to navigate on this grid so a couple
things for developers to keep in mind
first of all laying things out in the
grid is usually a good idea I've tried
to use things like map views where there
is map pins that are seemingly random
over the map it's always difficult to
navigate map pins with the
hat because it's never quite clear if
you go left or right do you want to go
to the nearest one left or do you really
want to go to the closest left how much
should the focus jump around it it gets
really tricky with grids much easier so
if you can stick with a grid the other
thing you notice here is there is
actually a grid in the middle and then
there is the menu bar on the side so in
this case here say if a user has focused
highlight on this cell here and then
presses the down key so the question is
what should happen and there's actually
not a simple answer to this so the most
likely scenario that you would have
guessed is you're here you go down you
probably want to end up down there and
make sense to us as humans to computers
maybe not so another choice would have
been you go down well the next cell down
from here is actually all the way over
to the side so the focus would jump from
here over to the navigation bar for a
user this is confusing they look at the
screen and they're like what just
happened where did my focus go the other
thing that could have happened by the
way depending on how you designed the
layout is the computer could have also
said okay I'm basically in this block
here I'm going down okay there's another
list I'm just going to go to the first
element in this list and you could have
also ended up there so where you end up
and there's a few more possibilities
that could have happened by the way but
where you end up ultimately there is an
Android default focus handling and
depending on how your layouts are
cascaded and how they're boxed in each
other you may end up with desirable or
entirely stupid ways so the good news is
you can actually has developer override
this and I think for normal applications
focus handling the default focus
handling makes sense most of the time
for TV applications where the d-pad
navigation is your really your primer
input mechanism defining your own focus
order and making sure you tested this
and actually maybe try out a couple
different layouts makes really sense the
the other thing is make sure you
understand what is the most likely
operation that a user wants to do next
and maybe move your focus your default
focus highlight there so that users
don't always have to navigate through
the entire screen if all they want is
most likely they just press next or okay
so okay so now we have the screen we
have the remote control let's look at
sound sure okay so the question was if
you have horizontal lists you could use
a gallery widget for that which yeah I
know so for some of those we actually
wrote our own layout management we've so
what the one thing that I find is if you
have horizontal scrolling yeah i think
the gallery once they work for basic
look and feel if you want something
better you have to write your own so
okay so now let's talk about sound so
one of the other things that's important
in the living room is is actually sound
output and one of the things is if you
look at mobile applications people
frequently use things like the haptic
feedback the vibrate mechanism on a
television sound is a lot more useful
and vibrate doesn't work anyways so we
have a lot of apps that use sound output
you also have a lot of multimedia apps
things like Pandora Napster playing
music in the background one of the
things that you should do if you have a
google TV app is make sure you read up
on the sound focus or or betcha
basically the the audio manager so when
your app wants to play back sound make
sure you request audio focus and that's
a signal to the play
form that everybody else should mute
their sound there is nothing more
confusing on a TV than having multiple
apps outputting sound at the same time
and we've had cases where apps that were
not so well behaved and they would just
keep playing music in the background
people would then switch to live
television and they are confused because
there is different out of the audio
sound track over the live TV and yeah so
that sometimes actually even leads to
customer service calls as our OEMs keep
telling us so as a developer request
sound focus and there's a little code
snippet here basically all you need to
do is use the audio manager and check if
you have sound focus and then you can
also conversely of course you should
respect audio focus so if you are an app
that plays in the background in the
plays audio make sure that you actually
implement the focus change listener so
that if another app requests audio focus
you actually give it up and you give
somebody else a chance to play back
audio so couple more random goodies and
so those are not google TV specific API
is per se but it's just using Android ap
is specifically for Google TV so one of
the frequently used things is location a
lot of apps use location especially
mobile apps what we do is we don't have
a GPS or we don't really know exactly
where we are but when you set up a
Google TV device you typically enter a
zip code and what we do is we convert we
convert the zip code to a coarse
location and you can get a location
provider and you can actually use the
provider name static so if you request
the known location from a static
provider you will get the zip code where
your TV was set up this should be good
enough to for example give you things
like weather forecast or
go news or anything okay so the question
is is there a way to get more fine-grain
location information basically a street
address or something no you cannot
override the system location provider
but in your app if you want to you could
ask the user for their exact address and
you can do something with that we've
we've heard people ask for other stuff
like using basically the Wi-Fi
triangulation or anything we're not
doing any of that right now and I say
yeah it's a nice feature we should add
that somewhere to our to do list but
hasn't made it from our engineering team
yet so the next feature is list channel
listings and channel changing so this is
another frequent requests from
developers and before I explain what it
does I explained what it does not do so
it does not tell you what the user is
watching it does also not tell you what
show is currently on on which channel so
what it does is we have a content
provider the content provider gives you
a list of channels that are currently
available on this set top box and if
you're familiar with the way channel
lineups work here it's very regional
some places have whatever CNN East Coast
CNN West Coast sports channels and so on
depending on what your package is so
it's it's useful information in that
when we set up a set-top box we figure
out what channels you have as an app
developer you can basically get the
available channel so you could switch to
a channel what does it mean to switch to
a channel okay so in those channel
listings we have a channel URI as one of
the fields so this TV URI you can take
the URI and you can send just a regular
Android intent with that URI and then
this will as Android intends to
we'll go to the TV viewing application
or TV viewing activity and it will
switch channel and then the TV viewer
will take over the application so the
useful or the use case for that would be
if you have an app and you have a button
to tune to whatever weather channel you
could iterate through you could first of
all find out if the user has subscribed
to the weather channel and if they do
then you can send out an intent and then
your app goes in the background and the
weather channel comes up one of the
other things Google TV does not have
right now and I again I know the
question is going to come in QA later so
I just answer it you can't overlay from
your Android app on top of the running
video output so that's another API that
we don't have yet so let's look at a
couple real world examples there is no
api for that so the question is is it
possible to take the video signal and
embedded into your Android application
effectively so that would be basically
like you have a video view today where
you can just stream video to it there is
no official API for that some of the
apps have figured out how to do that but
so it has to do with the video view and
the special URL so the reason we don't
make it official is it's not something
that we feel confident gives all the
functionality so for example you can't
change channels that way very easily and
it's not something that we want to
guarantee for backward compatibility so
if somebody wants to experiment I'm sure
you can find some references to it but I
would really not recommend use at an
application because we are not
guaranteeing that that will work in the
future for me for the next upgrades so
so this is this an example here of
basically a mobile app and just again
from a you
my point of view this is the Pandora
mobile app and this is the Pandora
google TV app all I wanted to highlight
is it looks very similar it was pretty
easy port actually one of the bigger
problems was making sure all the UI
elements are useful with the d-pad and
think it also uses the fast-forward
rewind buttons on the d-pad so another
app we work done was CNBC they have a
website they have a mobile app and what
they did is they created an app with
actually an embedded video view so what
they this is not the broadcast view here
so they actually I pee stream the
basically the highlights and segments of
the program today and it allows you to
personalise which stocks you're
interested in and if for the stocks that
you are interested in there is a video
then you will you will be able to
actually view the video over IP and it
shows the video view in the app so this
also this app has a tune to CNBC TV and
if you happen to have CNBC TV you can
just go tuned to the live channel there
so how do you get started with your own
app so what you actually really need is
the Android SDK and you can use the 3.1
or the 3.2 they're pretty equivalent for
this purpose SDK just use one of the
honeycomb SDKs there is some
misconception out there that people say
you need a Linux machine that's really
not the case you can use any development
machine you can use max you can use
Windows the only thing that you need a
Linux machine for is to run the emulator
and that's because we use kvm and it's a
long drawn-out technical discussion but
just believe me it really doesn't work
well on Windows or Mac it's pretty
snappy actually on Linux but so that's
why we didn't make it available for
Windows or for max yet but for
developers I mean if you're really
serious about developing a Google
TV app you can get pretty far with just
the emulator but in the end you need a
real google TV box just for things like
overscan just to do your user testing
and so on so my recommendation is using
an emulator is useful for some things
it's it's good on a desktop it's nice
when you can just prototype something
quickly but for actual development I
always have a google TV box with me the
Logitech reviews are well they are still
available for or buy a brand new TV yeah
so yeah so how do we connect the
computer to the Google TV so for phones
you use the USB cable and for Google TV
we don't use usb we actually go over IP
so if you are familiar with the Android
tools there is a DB it's a simple adb
command it's a DB connect and then the
IP address and then you can connect to
it the TV IP address you just get from
the TV so there is in the settings you
can just figure out what IP address it's
connected to there is one other little
caveat if you do that then you will
actually not it will not work what you
need to also do is you need to go to
Google TV enable debugging and you need
to set the IP address of your host
machine and that's basically they have
to know each other so it's sort of a
security feature we don't want your
neighbors to debug your TV just because
they're on the same network so you have
to enter your host machine in the Google
TV so it's trusted as development
machine so the question is if you have
multiple computers you use to develop
can you configure all of them right now
it's one at a time it's actually an
interesting requirement
I'll bring that back to our engineers so
the other thing is of course if you're
an Android developer you're familiar
with there is all the Eclipse tools
basically you just set up for regular
Android development so if you develop
for Google TV some of the trip some of
the tricks that that i have used over
time is you can actually use a honeycomb
tablet so if you don't have a Google TV
but you happen to have a Google like a
zoom or any of the honeycomb tablets
laying around you can actually pair a
bluetooth keyboard with your tablet and
you can test things like the focus
navigation and you can also test what
your UI looks like on a large screen
device the emulator of course for Linux
workstations you can use that for screen
sizes and you can also configure it with
odd screen sizes so you can see what
does it look like five percent smaller
ten percent smaller or ultimately get a
real device the sony blu-ray player the
logitech revue yeah i've actually been
told we are looking into like sending
out an email later what we do is we have
what we call our fish tank program where
we basically have people sign up and you
give us an app idea you say what you're
working on and we give it to our
business development folks if you have a
track record as like a real Android
developer you have maybe an app in the
market you're seriously working on a
Google TV app we don't want to have the
lack of physical hardware stop you so
we've we've been known to give out
google TV boxes for that will send out
an email to the list of people here so
ok so the documentation it's all for
Android it's the usual spot that's
developer.android.com for Google TV it's
developers notice the ass google com /
TV you can also get there if you just go
to google.com / TV and then follow the
links for developers so okay so now
you've created your app you have made
sure it's well polished the next
question is how do you get it there so
this is market running on Google TV and
what I want to highlight is so this is
not like a super special super-secret
new market this is the regular Android
Market it's it's one market you don't
need to upload it in multiple places the
people when they go to the android
market on Google TV they will notice
that maybe their favorite application is
not quite there yet so then tell your
developers of your favorite application
to come and work with us how do we
decide what shows up here is based on
device features so as Android developers
you're probably familiar with device
features so in your application manifest
you can specify which features are
required by your application to run and
that's stuff like if your application
say requires a camera it doesn't make
sense to run on a device that does not
have a camera if it requires a GPS again
it doesn't make sense to run on a device
that does not have GPS the one key
feature is really touch screen I'll talk
about that in a little while but
basically this is a list of features
that are supported by google TV if your
application does not require any other
features than those it will show up in
the market and it will it will run on
Google TV one of the features that is
not on the list is the Android that
hardware a touch screen so since most
devices or basically all devices before
Google TV
he had a touchscreen the assumption is
that every Android application out there
requires a touchscreen unless you
declare otherwise so if you have in your
application manifest if you have no
mention of a touchscreen market assumes
you need a touch screen because
otherwise you would have said otherwise
and it will actually filter you out when
when you browse the market on Google TV
so what you want to do is if you want to
show up on market for Google TV then you
add the Android hardware touchscreen
required equals false statement in your
manifest so this is quote unquote the
opt-in for for market on Google TV what
you can do is if you actually set the
the touch screen flag for false that
means your app will show up on Google TV
it will also show up on all the other
devices since we assume that even if you
have a touch screen you can run apps
that don't require touch screen so
technically now you have an app that
runs on all Android devices again- all
the other constraints screen size and
other features that you may have so what
you can do now is at runtime you can
actually use the package manager and you
can use a runtime query to check for the
com google android TV feature and so as
you the use case you had earlier you
could at runtime make a distinction and
figure out ok i'm running on a TV maybe
I'm doing something slightly different
than if I'm running on a tablet the
other thing you could do is if you only
want to create an app that is only
available on Google TV maybe because you
have very specialized user interface
then you can require the com the Google
and Android TV feature and with this
feature required your app will only show
up on Google TV devices so these are
basically the two main flag so it's the
android TV flag and it's the hardware
that touch screen flash
so yeah so this is basically if you only
show up on Google TV then you set the
Google TV feature to true I get frequent
emails from people who upload an apk and
then send us the business team or
somebody a panic email saying oh my god
my app doesn't show up what did I do
wrong just do yourself a favor before
you upload your app to the market use a
apt it's a tool that comes with the
android sdk and it will actually dumped
out the list of features and will dump
out basically all the things that
android market sees actually android
market uses apt to ingest an application
so when you when you use a apt the
parameters are dumped batching and then
your application name it will actually
print out a list of features that are
required print out a list of features
that are not required some of the things
that you should watch out for is as I
said earlier Google TV for example it
does not have a camera but that doesn't
mean you couldn't write an app that uses
a camera on say a tablet but does not
use a camera on Google TV you probably
all familiar Android has a concept of
permissions so if you want to use a
camera you declare the camera permission
as required and the system will
automatically assume that you need a
camera but you can also declare the
camera feature is not required and then
you say okay I need the permission but I
don't need the feature this makes the
camera quote-unquote optional and so a
apt will go through all of the
permissions and it will do all the
implicit features and we'll do all the
inference so I've had some apps that for
example ended up using GPS or using some
of the features that were not available
so apt is really useful for that also
before you upload your app to the market
go test it on a bunch of different TV
is tested also on small screen TVs as I
said earlier the overscan settings when
you when you have a google TV box you go
to the menu and there is screen size and
you can actually manually set the screen
size for minimum maximum over skin and
you can actually try some of the
settings out and see how your
application would look on TVs that have
large overscan margins where's the small
overscan margins lastly if you do upload
to market include a 16 by 9 screenshot
it looks really good if your app
actually runs on Google TV to show it in
your screenshots include a feature
graphic a lot of people leave that out
and let us know come to our hangout
tweet about it send me something on
Google+ where we're seriously always
looking for the next great application
on Google TV yeah yeah so the question
is is there like anything that's against
terms of service for developers so I
think in order to distribute in the
android market there is basically
there's the Android Market terms of
service in terms of content
appropriateness and so on so how do we
distribute an html5 app for Google TV so
the primary discovery and distribution
is through the android market so some of
the people they have been successful
using html5 packaged in an Android app
and you can then kick off a web view and
you can render it in a webview okay let
me just explain a little bit more so I
think the question goes along chrome
versus webview versus things like
PhoneGap so the google TV stack it has a
full chrome browser if you run an
android app you can open up the chrome
browser and you can send it to a URL
open up a URL and you basically can then
browse any web app or any html5 site the
problem is it's not as integrated as an
experience as an Android app so at that
point for example the user when they
press the back key of the Menu key they
get to the chrome browser menu or
they get to the regular back stack of
the chrome pages I think it's possible
we have a bunch of apps that actually do
that my preference would be to stick
within a web view in android because you
have a lot tighter control of what for
example happens when the user presses
the search key what happens when the
user presses the Menu key and so on okay
so just a couple more words about
monetization I know everybody needs to
make money so how can you make money
very easy it's the same as regular
Android you can have in the end roid
market you can have paid apps you can
have in-app billing or what we call
freemium so for for those two models
what we find increasingly when we look
at the statistics and we talked with
developers it's a lot easier to make
money when you when users are already
familiar with your app the in-app
payment usually works very well and
especially for content things like
renting movies upgrading content works
really well or you can have
subscription-based or you can have
advertisement based but i think it's
basically the same as an android if you
have an app you have a monetization
strategy for android you can use the
same ways we have of course full support
for Google Checkout so you can use the
regular mechanisms that are also
available in android yes it's amazing
i'm still getting a paycheck so
I think Google TV is I mean it's one of
those things where people had very high
expectations based on Android it's I
think people are more reluctant buying
new televisions and they are buying
handsets of buying phones so i think
it's not realistic to measure the
success compared to how many android
handsets for a selling I think when I
look honestly when I was walking through
CES this year I was very pleasantly
surprised at last year I had to
constantly explain what is google TV
this year everybody knew about google TV
and people were excited about it people
wanted to get on to it so yes of course
i would love to have google TV running
on every single device today but i think
we're doing pretty well there is
definitely a commitment behind it I mean
we we know that this is a long process
we can't change the way that people
watch TV or we can't like update every
TV immediately so I think for developers
the opportunity is even if it's a
smaller market right now having an app
that really stands out gives you an
opportunity to actually really build a
brand early I've heard a lot of
developers and you read about developers
who were early in the mobile market and
who maybe had a one guy I think he was
blogging recently he had something like
a su doku game or something he made
close to 100 k the first year he
published it yeah he does not make 100k
anymore because if he publishes the next
whatever su doku version there is now
five dozens out there so if you go into
the Google TV market even if there is a
smaller total install base compared to
mobile it gives you a smaller market and
a better discoverability so
yeah I I put stickers on it so yeah I
must agree that this is not the most
pleasant thing to have on your couch at
home it's really nice for nerds but for
normal people they look at this and they
don't know what to do with it we know
this is one of the sticky points and we
as Google I mean we're not in the
hardware business we trust on our OMS to
know what people want to do in the
living room logitech let's just say the
track record for the living room up I
don't know it so I trust I mean if you
look at the sony remote it looks a lot
more like something you want to have in
the living room so we actually have a
google TV remote control app so for both
iphone and android and you can just use
your android phone or your your iphone
and you can control your google TV with
this funny you should say that one of
our guys is actually working on that so
so the question was multi-screen apps
and I think that's definitely a really
hot topic is how can you because
everybody has a smartphone nowadays so
how can you tie together a smartphone
and a smart TV and just for reference
there is a company out there that's
really very active on it it's the
company's called mobile mov IL ya so
they're actually using flash for it and
they connect over the cloud and
basically it's a poker game where you
have your poker cards on your handset
and when you deal out so it's an
interesting use case yes it's not an
Android we're actually one of one of our
guys is working on a nap right now that
we hopefully open source sometime soon
