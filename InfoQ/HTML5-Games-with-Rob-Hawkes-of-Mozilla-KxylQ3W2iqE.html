today a little bit about sort of html5
gaming so give us an overview about what
it's all about what's going on what kind
of technologies you should be looking at
and just sort of a general sort of feel
for the sort of gaming on the web so for
those of you who don't know me I work
for Mozilla my technical evangelist
there so it's my job to sort of engage
with developers and still talk about
cool new technologies Oh sort of on the
web and so we have a few sort of
problems just now probably my fault and
I've also been up since 4am except found
out my university results this morning
and I couldn't go back to sleep
afterwards and to find out I've got a
first class in my degree which is quite
interesting thank you um obviously not a
first class in keynote but hey I'm so
but I digress all of this is cool am but
I'm really really interested in html5
and in my job in my hobby at University
whatever and I have a slight addiction
to it I like experimenting with code and
particularly if it involves or visual
stuff and if you doubt my addiction to
html5 is supply my girlfriend made for
me with the html5 logo on it and I call
it HTML pipe and it was really nice it
was chicken and leek it was very tasty
and I'm glad she made that for me but
anyway stay worm gaming is something
I've been into sort of most of my life I
Cartman they're not being involved in
games so the first sort of games was
like ZX Spectrum games and stars playing
things like paper boy and it took the
ages to load on like the cassette and
made that funny noise and then moving on
to things snares with like Bomberman I
was really interesting and mega drive
with an Sonic and and I sort of moved on
to the PC throughout that time and sort
of doubled with things like SimCity
which I was addicted to and other things
like mega race and done anyone remember
mega roasts it was great fun m and then
I'll still have moved on to multiplayer
games so doom wasn't necessarily
multiplayer but there was a version of
it that I was playing
and dad's internet cafe which was
multiplayer and that was great it was
like 30 people in the same room just
playing doing and I was like a kid at
the time it was awesome and but what I'm
getting hit at here is gaming is sort of
part of my life as I grew up and it's
part of everyone else's life I think as
well most other people at least and it's
fun to play these kind of games and
they're also really fun to make and I
have to apologize for the font that's
screwed up as well so the time is now
ready to sort of start making games on
the web ins we're still about fresh hold
and where we can create some really cool
and interesting games that the
technologies that were used to use to
make websites and but before I sort of
carried on with that I just wanted like
there's some notable events that sort of
justified and I've been quite
interesting related html5 gaming and so
one of these was there recently there's
been some quite a lot of funding for
html5 games and which I'm really seen
before and it's sort something that's
been needed because there hasn't been
the kind of games being created a sort
of indie games one developer just
screwing around to experimenting with
stuff and the funding is sort of needed
I think to justify the the time and if
it's going to take to make some really
really cool games that are going to
really make this technology worthwhile
I'm sort of related to that is like
acquisitions of html5 gaming engines so
zingo bought the aged engine and disney
bought the rocket pack engine and so
these are two really sort of interesting
engines that cropped up and before
leaping got released to the public they
got snapped up and used for farmville so
there's other things like there's the
first large-scale html5 gaming
conference which is in September in
potent it's called on game start and
it's kind of interesting to see that you
can get enough people together to talk
about and to learn about these
technologies and there's obviously
something some interest there so I think
that's a really good thing and that has
actually found out the other day another
one in San Francisco in november and
called new I've got it written down here
you gain so that's the first and second
of November I think something like that
so that'd be really interesting and and
a random thing Facebook is getting
involved in game performance html5 game
performance they're not making games
they're just really interested in
finding out how to soar better the
performance of this technology and I
think that's a fantastic thing to sort
of for someone to be doing especially a
company like that so why is HTML 5
claiming so cool well it's because it's
using the technologies that we normally
use in everyday sort of creating web web
sites and behavioral scripts on web
sites and we can use those now to create
browser games we're not using really
anything new here and it's just looking
at the technologies in a different way
and just to clarify by html5 I mean HTML
and JavaScript it's just it'll take too
long to say that every single time but
it's cool because you can you can write
it once and use it anywhere so and if
you're developing on an iOS device and
you currently going just for that device
you're going to either have to so write
your code very carefully you're going to
have to rewrite it again for another
platform with paypal 5 you can just
JavaScript and HTML you can write it
once how true is that whether you can
write it once use it anyway it's as long
as there's a browser on that device that
will work fine I mean it's in an ideal
world pull the browser support the same
technologies it would you like one to
use anywhere but what I mean by this is
just using the same cut your little st.
languages and across the platform so
have ya it's on the iOS so yeah okay and
so yeah I mean like Christine was saying
and there is there's going to be sort of
variances in like the the way they
display them different devices and stop
at that but it can you see it says
different types of JavaScript for like
that you are the controls for you could
touch down events rather than mousedown
events but the majority of your code
will probably be be fine to use a
cross-platform and I'm not saying it's
perfect just thing is easier to you have
a question no no okay so another thing
sort of kind of related is there's no
compilation as well so it's kind of like
a hacky language you can sort of just
put something together really quickly
you can look at the source code you can
learn things from what other people
and it's little quick to sort of test up
and just use it and just get up the
speed of it and I like the rapid nature
of this kind of technology in its and
why I started creating games in it and
it's like white small text files you're
just using images and stuff like that
it's not taking too much room em but
it's open and I think that's one of the
most important things it gives you a
warm fuzzy feeling about using it it's
just anyone can look at your code and
and this is also negative and i'll get
i'll get into this in a second and but
that's one of the reasons why I'd like
using it and so it's not all rosy and
like I said the Sun reasons why you
might not want you to html5 for gaming
I'm not advocating that you should
replace absolutely everything with this
technology and so I just wanna cover
like two of this of main issues I think
and one of these is you can see how the
fonts cruder that should say full
support so not every browser supports
every single aspects of html5 and
particularly of course mobile platforms
and desktop platforms this is quite
prominent so for example canvas isn't
supported a little books by i9 let sorry
anything below I night and you can sort
of install something called explore a
canvas or of a sort of add-ons that
replicate campus functionality but it's
not going to be quite the same and so
you need to be aware of things like that
and web sockets which we'll talk about
in seconds well sort of multiplayer
communication it's not supported on IE
yet at all and or on android which is
interesting because it's supported on
iOS so there's no WebSocket support on
one of the mobile devices and again you
can fake this using flash sockets and
stuff like that but it's just being
aware that some of these technologies
and fully supported yet an auto WebGL
which is like free d graphics and is
also not supported in IE and safari or
opera and they are looking into it our
development versions of it but this
isn't publicly available fully yet so
just need to be aware of these kinds of
things another thing is there's related
to what i was talking about with the
open stuff is there's no drm and but
these technologies weren't built for
that they look to be open they're built
not to be
I'll do you meant to look at the source
code you meant to play around with it
whatever Stoke there's nowhere really
for the drm to going in my opinion and I
kind of like this because i like reading
the code i like looking at how up
someone else's made html5 multiplayer
game and seeing how that differs from
what I've done where I can improve
whatever and you can still like an
obstacle your code or minify it and kind
of works but it's not a solution and you
can still sort of under minify or
whatever so you can still you need to be
aware that if you use these kind of
technologies people are going to look at
your code and this can be an issue when
using multiplex people can cheat we'll
talk about that later on so some of the
technologies involved the sort of
mentioned a few there's a variety of
them really I'm going to cover the main
ones so this canvas in WebGL so these
are the two tour big graphics one so
canvas is 2d and what GL uses canvas but
it's pretty and these are really
interesting canvas is fairly mature and
WebGL I think I believe just hit one
point 0 in the specification and but
like I said it's not fully supported
everywhere but it's really quite
interesting so fast as well cuz its
hardware accelerated and spouts the kind
of graphics register the audio excite
you got html5 audio and which is great
apart from looping is really crap lay
across browsers and I don't know any two
browsers that support it the same way
and it's not such a big deal if you're
just like playing music in the browser
but if you're doing like a looping style
effect like a rocket thruster so you've
got like a half second noise and you one
that's a loop and loop and loop you're
always not always in some browsers
you'll get like a very small gap and
it's so noticeable and and at the moment
that has stopped me from using html5
audio in my game but this kind of stuff
it's already being looked into I think
opera has the most perfect and
implementation of that so far which
doesn't have the gap in so I'm hoping
that that will improve in the future
says WebSockets as well as the
WebSockets is like the multiplayer
communication stuff so this dislike a
bi-directional sort of pipe I suppose we
can sort of send data down and up at
real time
you don't have to request the data every
time it just sort it's there when you
need it and this is so good for most
play games so whip you using stuff like
websites you're going to need a server
to sort of a pipe it down into and one
of the technologies I really like to use
on the server is no Jas and particularly
because it's JavaScript on the server
and I just kind of like that because i'm
using like i said with the sort of right
once use anywhere you you're using the
same language again on the server so if
you're clever you can write your client
side code on your server side code sort
of using the same stuff effectively to
see you you don't have to rewrite stuff
that often and it's just really really
cool I mean this is a synchronized it's
event-based it's kind of interesting and
it's got like great third-party modules
so if you want to install WebSocket
support you just like you socket i/o or
something else there's loads of options
available and is such so easy to install
and just get you start using and you're
using a language you already know the
storing data and stuff that's quite kind
of important stuff in game so on the
client side on the players computer
you've got a local storage so and you
can store a certain amount of data that
you can easily sort of add persistence
to the aims of people consume plays make
a building I don't know lay some farm
stuff and then leave the game and come
back and it's all there you don't have
to save all of that all the time on the
server and but if you do want to use a
server again the font and screwed up
there you've got MongoDB or Redis or
stuff like that so these are MongoDB
it's like a document or its oriented and
database system and like no xq hours
they call it whatever radius is like a
key value store thing which is stored in
memory it's sort of a little bit faster
but whatever you use whichever one is
and suits your purpose whether any of
these if any of these do that's up to
you but these things are there they're
supported by now so whatever it is just
an easy way of storing bait on the
server so
enough about the technology and stuff I
just wanted to show you some of the
existing getting some of my favorite
ones that are out there and some of
these are I think most of these have
been developed of his demos I don't
think any of these are making huge
amounts of money yet but whoever look
into them so one really interesting one
was some Google guys ported quake 2 and
using WebGL websockets a WebGL for the
3d html5 audio for the sound web sockets
for multiplayer so this was a
multiplayer version of quake and quake
to even am an auto local storage for the
persistence and etc so and it looks
really cool I mean it looks like quake 2
it is playing in your browser and it's
using javascript is pretty amazing and
it's open source and there's a sort of a
website for it I'm up quickly slides up
later just if anyone's asking later on
and with all the links in and stuff like
that so it's just quite to Google if you
type into Google you find it anyway but
whatever so another one I don't know if
there's anyone played minecraft ok I've
not played a person myself I know a few
people who are addicted to it and you
basically run around in this block e
world sort of mining stuff and building
stuff and avoiding zombies and stuff at
night as far as I know so it's kind of
cool but anyway so that minecraft isn't
isn't JavaScript it isn't on the web
it's I don't know what language it
actually uses anyone know or see ya so
at me as desktop stuff today this is
actually a map viewer created in
JavaScript using WebGL and for Minecraft
it's only a small step to turn this into
the actual version of Minecraft like a
client to display and minecraft because
you run toes and the client sort of
connect bit so you can already see that
it this is how my graph looks on the
desktop anyways private fairly basic
it's blocky it's kind of a perfect game
to sort of port into this WebGL at the
moment and so I'm really interested to
see if that goes any further I'm sort of
a bit different non-free d and not even
that complicate
it's quite fun this is word squared is
anyone heard of that it's a cool game
and it's massively multiplayer scrabble
so effectively it's an unlimited
Scrabble game and there is no end to the
game you just continue putting words
wherever you want and it uses web
sockets for the real-time communication
stuff and and this is a into a map of a
very very small part of the word squared
universe and each pixel there and
probably even less than each pixel is a
title that someone's laid for a word and
and that is a very small part I mean
this goes on forever and and it's never
ending so it's pretty cool interesting
game it's quite cool you to the
technologies and something I'm sure
quite a few people have played
civilization so this is a game called
freeciv which is an open-source version
of that and it is canvas and web sockets
they're actually sort of looking into
developing a 3d version of it using
WebGL so this is I think this is a
really promising one particularly
because it's actually out there now
working it's fully working they're not
making money books it's it's free and
open source but fine it's a great
implementation of it and this is the
kind of stuff not necessarily copies of
games I want to see games as fully
featured as this created in HTML 5 not
just little demos and I kind of stuff
I'm making at the moment but proper
fully featured games that really fun and
interesting to play and can be extended
and what happy and so this is my game
I've been actually plugged sounded can
you see that so the video is a bit crap
because I'm actually chose one little
bit like but anyway so this is a
multiplayer massively multiplayer
perhaps just multiplayer game that I've
made I'm using web sockets for the sort
of communications volume and campus for
the graphics you basically just shoot
your friends in the face with a pocket
and you have like the health bar grounds
which you probably saw the little ring
so if you shoot your loser that will
ring and if you get shot you lose your
ring as well
need to be careful because if you do too
much you're getting get picked up really
easy this is my excuse really just to
muck around if the html5 canvas and web
sockets and stuff and I advise anyone to
just do that just make a little game fun
it didn't take too long the complicated
stuff or the little details and you
don't have to get that far just play
around a bit get used to like things
like node on the server web sockets if
you want to do multiplayer and you just
want to do single player just my kind of
canvas and what have you and it's just a
really good way of getting to grips of
it rather than jumping and trying to
create something properly crazy straight
away but anyway so there's more games
loads more games and there's loads of
directories like game directories and
specifically focused on html5 which are
out there and there's one called html5
games com it's got most of the
interesting games that are out there at
the moment um anyone heard of congregate
the game's repository yeah so that is
actually now supporting html5 games so
long as they're submitted through the
iframe submission thing I haven't looked
into it too much but it's kind of cool
that that's one it probably one of the
most popular game directories and like
flash games and stuff and it's
interesting to see that they're opening
their arms up to sort of html5 and and
there's a really fundamental thing to
get games popular is because just
showing them out to developers and stuff
is not going to get you very far if you
want to get it out to the general public
you know going to need to go to the
places where they're already playing the
games right now whether that's Facebook
or congregate or wherever and so just a
few fundamental it's really about game
development I'm going to get into the
codon stuff it's not that complicated
you can look into that afterwards if you
want it's mainly just showing you the
specific parts of the game development
stuff that you're going to need to look
into and so obviously you've got your
main thing but gamely so you got your
main thing most games will have one of
these and it sort of manage till the
logic in the animation and physics and
all that kind of stuff and those sort of
the heart of the game and sort of where
everything happens and so maybe like
something like word squared might not
have the game loop because it's it's not
using the canvas for the graphics you
don't need to refresh something
every frame but if you're using canvas
of graphics what you're doing physics
updates you might want to use a game
update at gamely people so it sort of
related to that like I said you've got
physics updates so that's part of the
game leap if you want and so if you're
all like and using something like box2d
or and I sort of touching that in a
minute but any sort of physics updates
in game when you're just doing that
simple movement collision detection
whatever you'll have sort of physics
updating your game graphics updates as
well it's fairly simple stuff I mean I'm
not saying this is complicated it's just
being aware of the components of a game
and so this is just if using canvas this
is where you sort of a redraw every
element that you've got in your game and
back onto the screen and the networking
is so if you're doing multiple you're
going to have sort of networking side of
things so you're going to rather you
using web sockets and if you're going
for the sort of web-based stuff your
puppy puppy and so it's just being aware
of like these aspects of the game and
how they're going to sort of integrate
and I think one of the most important
things I found at least with raucous is
the controls in the UI and is
particularly because it sort of
cross-platform so you can play on the
meadow bar you can play on the pc the
same controls that work on a pc are not
going to work on the mobile and and i've
still not I know what to do with it but
I've still not solved it and rockets yet
but it's not going to be too complicated
because these technologies you can be
CSS or just JavaScript touchdown events
and it's kind of cool so we've Rockets
died I had a UI designer to do this for
me so it was a lot better than I could
do and but I think it adds a little bit
more to a game and I hate CML five-game
at the moment is still going to look
fairly simple it's not quite there yet
for the high performance graphics and
really sort of nicely rendered 3d stuff
it's going to hold my hands up it's not
ready for that yet but if you're careful
with your graphics and stuff at that
and--but really nicely and optimize it
you're going to get a really nice
looking game that is using the
technologies that are available right
now so something interesting and with
the control side of things you probably
seen on iOS games if you played them we
sort of put your thumbs on either side
and you've got like joysticks and but
they're on the screen
that's kind of cool and a guy and I
could stably de lisle and to implemented
this in JavaScript just as he was
mucking around and he just wanted to see
if it was possible it was it's really
cool way of adding a is interfaced view
html5 games so for example in rockets
with the Rockets flank around my left
fun could be moving the rocket around
and my right fun could be shooting in
certain directions and on the pc instead
you will be using the keyboard or mouse
or whatever and you're only having to
change a very small amount of code which
is just your event listeners and a
little bit of you I'd stuff but the
logic for shooting and moving is all the
same you're just changing the way that
you interface with that is really easy
with these technologies and it's a
performance I mean this isn't like a
fundamental feature of game-like
development is just something you need
to be aware of along the whole process
and I sort of stumbled across this quite
a lot like you did too many loops or you
just do stupid little things and you
slide your game done so much so you just
need to be very careful I mean I'll run
for if a couple of tips to a performance
at the end so yes I mean you might be
thinking it's pretty crazy I want to go
through all this effort just to make a
little game you don't have to there are
game engines around so they sort of done
all the hard works for you so you just
concentrate on making the cool game says
like Jake working for game development
and it's best way to the cadet space so
in this one could impact as anyone heard
of impact yes it impact is really
interesting one it's ninety nine dollars
and which I used to think was expensive
for game development but I actually
think is quite cheap now for what it
does it's one of the better ones and the
documentation is great for it the
developers a really nice guy is active
and it's really helpful you can jump on
IRC and start talking to him he's a
really nice guy and we'll just sort of
support you of anything you want it
doesn't support web sockets and
multiplayer stuff out of the box but
people a community of sort of trying to
build multiplayer sort of add-ons for it
and stuff like that so it's not got
everything but it's one of the better
ones I definitely would sort of suggest
looking into that one an open source
free one
and is crafty it's not my favorite
there's a few things that don't like
about it and but it's written it's doing
better than some of the upper free ones
out there and it's fairly fully featured
you can you can make a nice game of it
there's no problem with that you just
pick the one that you sort of prefer to
use of space and it's also isogenic
engine and this is one of the most
promising ones out there that hadn't
been to of enveloped by a larger company
yet and so I'm hoping this stays public
I would it would be a shame if this one
got taken up as well this one has
multiplayer built-in and for massively
multiplayer as well users node on the
server and mongodb and can be stored on
beta graphics it's icy graphic sort of
2.5 d staff or 2d scroller stuff
whatever it does pretty much everything
and it's powerful but it comes at a
price and so it's a I don't know the
exact prices a few hundred pounds so few
hundred dollars as well i mean it's it's
still in beta at the moment and but if
you get what you pay for and it's a sort
of it's not for a per-game license i
think it's a one developer license kind
of thing so I don't know I think I think
paying for engines I think people are
gonna have to get used to and if you get
the better quality stuff and if it's
going to push that forward I mean it's
the same in like and so stuff like unity
you have to pay for that and you get a
really nice and tool to create game to
see isogenic stuff and this isn't a demo
of something he's been doing with it
this is rob eben the crater he's
spraying a thing called an iso city it's
like a Sim City kind of thing and it's
just a little demo eating and it's not
using I mean even though it's really if
not using webview it's it's just 2d
graphics using canvas and it's just
showing off the engine it's just
something quite interesting I mean he's
got that working like Philly HD
resolution like massively thousands of
your players walking around lasers to
buy it's all over the place to a
multiplayer city editor kind of thing
and it's running really really really
smoothly and this is the one of the most
promising things about this engine is is
one of the fastest and
you don't have to use sort of foot
engines there's like libraries and stuff
so you can sort of get components so you
might want to rewrite your whole game
bleep yourself and doing and multiplayer
networking stuff but you might want not
want to do the graphic side of things
well there's there's sort of light
breeze and stuff out there to sort of
help you with that so you talk to pull
in bits from other people so one of
these is the physics stuff I was talking
about this one called box2d which is
what Angry Birds uses on iOS I believe
there is a port for JavaScript or box2d
web and there it's one actually cook box
to DJ s or something like that but that
one's fairly old this one's a newest one
is updated more often so I think this is
the most promising one to look at it's
just gives you a physics engine to just
plug into your game and just do whatever
you want it was pretty cool for
multiplayer stuff there's a figure
motion jas now this is trying to solve
it like within multiplayer there's you
get issues of lag you get have to use
things like client-side prediction I'm
not going to go into that but what it
basically means is you try and predict
you do stuff on the client side to to
mitigate the lag that's happening
between the client and server and it's a
fairly complex side of sort of game
development and most people probably
don't even think about it so for example
isogenic he's doing this for you you
don't have to worry about it but if you
just want to have the multiplayer stuff
there you've already created your own
engine you can use things I'm motion j/s
now it's not been fully developed yet
but it's there a great idea and I think
it's something to keep an eye on maybe
they'll be something else sort of
replacing it through providing the same
functionality but I just think the
concept of being able to plug and play
these these parts of game development is
going to be a really interesting part of
the html5 gaming and so like hosting all
this stuff when you're in server you can
do that if you want or you could go sort
of like cloud Beijing go and join and
node service the thing is noge the
actual URL and just provides a sort of
remote node server for you to use you
can use web sockets with it you can do
it v1 it's really quick sort of get
something up and running and there's a
competition called node knockout
which gets loads of developers together
to sort of screw around with nodejs and
as web word square came from I believe
and I think anyway there's developers
bed together they make games they make
applications whatever and they used no
joint node servers last time just
because it in 48 hours they just had
something together to set the server
without having to set it up really they
just signed in and there it was you just
pushed your code up and get whatever
you've got your game working multiplayer
already and scaling all that kind of
stuff if you don't want full serving you
just want to communication stuff so this
thing's like pusher which is like
WebSocket sort of communication service
so you can sort of sign up to that you
don't have to worry about your web
socket stuff you just say i want to send
the message to the server server wants
to send a message back to the client
don't have to worry about that pusher
does it for you and this thing's like
cutting as well and so sort of self
posted sort of web sockets communication
platform so it's not remotely hosted you
have it on your own server but I'm still
pretty cool so it does it all for you
and there's a lecturer server which is
and another cell posted platform it does
communication stuff but it's not web
sockets and it's more for like game
object sort of running it's like a game
server I suppose and the interesting
thing about a lecture is it doesn't just
do javascript it does a whole or variety
of them of supports a whole variety of
platforms and so it's definitely
something to look into and flash
developers use is quite a lot so
throughout like the development like
when I was doing orchids and just
mucking around at University and stuff
there's a few key lessons that I've
learned I've sort of couple a couple and
so the most important ones are the sort
of ones i'm going to get free now so
with like about some of the game loops
and the physics updates and graphics
update you need to cut down on your lips
because they will just grew up with your
own processor and too many loops you
just going to notice straightaway when
you've done too many loops so you just
need to be frugal with with what you're
trying to do with your game you need to
be careful with how many objects you're
looping through all the time so if you
don't need to loop through an object
don't loop through
like saved small amounts of small sort
of performance increases but it it all
adds up it's one of the main things I
learned my first developed I was doing
loops all over the place and it didn't
work very well I had like 30 circles
drawn on the screen and it was already
slow so you can actually get thousands
and if you do it properly install of
related to that is don't use JavaScript
timers and I still do in my game don't
look at my code and use what I've done
the way to do it is to do
requestanimationframe and it's something
kind of I want to implement I haven't
had time to implement it and it
basically puts the browsing control of
sort of the the animation so instead of
staying every 30 seconds I want you
right now to push this animation frame
just push it push it push it push it
request animation frame sort of said to
the browser I'm ready for any frame now
and the browser when is ready will say
ok you go take it and so it saves them
it's joining up saved it's good on
performance and people talk about how it
saves back to your mobile phones I my
dear if that's true but I'm just going
to get onto that how if you're using a
JavaScript time when you took over to
another tab it could still keep running
and I think they're trying to look into
sort of capping that but before I mean
you'd be running something 50 frames a
second in the background and it would
just be screwing up with your processing
processing usage and stuff like that and
it is just not very good so with
requestanimationframe it sort of gets
made inactive when it its losses focused
and you can sort of pick up again
afterwards when you come back into that
tab so it's just like I said these
little things and this is probably one
of the biggest ones at the moment is
going to save so much effort on your
behalf and it's really easy to use and I
mean it's not supported in in every
version of every browser but guy called
Paul Irish from google has made a shim
that allows you to sort of use the
request animation API and just in your
game anyway and it will just sort of
fall back into the tech timeout
JavaScript time and stuff so you don't
have to worry about keeping two versions
of your timing since
going sup network tricks I think this is
probably the most interesting thing i've
learned recently this is a rocket search
of the island this and i know very
quickly and had to learn how to solve it
very quickly and because if you want to
make a multiplayer game you probably
want more than two people playing it
before it so it gets really annoying I
mean the concept is basically need to be
aware of how much data you're sending
and I wasn't and so the way i do raucous
is I send an update from the client from
the player to the server the server go
to ok and you want to move this way okay
fine this is your new position so with
one player is one update going up to
this day over one update going back down
fairly simple to pledge to updates going
up one from each player and two updates
going back to each player and so that's
for updates in total going back because
it's obviously for each player is their
update on the upper person's update fine
two messages in all messages done so for
players you've now got four messages
coming in 16 messages going out so so if
you give me notice the messages are
getting messages out I sort of the
square of the messages in and so you can
see 30 players 30 messages in nine
hundred messages out so it's getting
pretty mental already I mean think about
this this isn't just like one time data
being sent this is every frame it's for
every update on the server at least it's
sending 900 up days I mean this is
ridiculous but go curva still so you
want to make a massively multiplayer
game you've got 100 players and there's
10,000 messages out in one frame it's
ridiculous so I got tripped up very
quickly with this kind of stuff and the
way to get around it is to you can even
make your game intelligent so the good
thing about using sort of well you know
the size of the browser and on the
client side so you can if your server
knows like what the player can see you
know what they can't see so you know not
to send them updates for the players
that aren't affecting them in the game
that saves you so much so many resources
don't I use that in Rockets now because
originally it was a fairly big world and
you have players
flying around the outside of the screen
that you couldn't see and that wasn't so
much of a problem it was a problem when
each of those players fight at about 20
bullets you then had 10 players and 20
bullets you've got 200 villas so I think
and if you've got two hundred bullets
flying around except 20,000 updates are
happening 40,000 yeah cool this is why I
don't have a degree in mass and anyway
so you're fourteen thousand updates what
I mean is a big big number so you need
to be careful and I mean that crash my
game it was ridiculous so by the way I
did it was any bullet or player that was
not in your visible barrier you didn't
display it until he popped enjoy aerial
just a little bit outside and the game
was not playable and it's simple little
things and it don't have to do too much
to sort of get these performance gains
of game I'm going to get onto the
cheating yeah yeah yeah so next slide
heaters and stir when i first started
rocket the codes obviously available to
anyone to see and i was probably being a
little bit too trustworthy with my code
and it was multiplayer i was the cut the
player was sending updates to decline
sorry to the server and instead of like
saying i want to move and the server
going ok I'm going to put you here so
that's the operative server
authoritative server and I had a dative
client which means that the client sort
of says I'm here and the server go ok
and so I didn't think anyone was going
to screw up with that and turns out they
did straight away probably about five
minutes after I released the game and
people were flying around that like warp
speed they would had rapid fire bullets
they were they even made their own
weapons and which I found fascinating so
some guy works out how to the only
weapons that were in the game at the
time were you just have done the space
button it shot out of times limit so it
was like
everybody 300 milliseconds it would fire
me Billa and but that 300 millisecond
limit was on the claim so you changed
that to 30 you've got a machine gun you
change that 20 you're going to crash the
game which happened quite a lot and but
people worked out that instead of
waiting for the spacebar to fire about
it they would just code their own sort
of event handler which would sort of do
20 bullet presses in one press and it
would make a cluster button so they was
press the spacebar or see whatever
button they have linked it to it would
put 20 bullets in it would change the
velocities to come out of random angles
and it would just destroy everyone in
the game I found it hilarious and it was
great and I'm going to put that into the
game later and it but it was I don't
know it wasn't such a bad thing it was
just an interesting thing that I noticed
because it was easy to fix you make you
met your game sort of dumb and on the
client side so it can update its own
stuff but the server basically is the
full control and authority of what's
going on instead of the client going the
player going hey this is why I am right
now make sure I'm there on everyone
else's computer the client just goes I
want to move and you know where I am can
you tell me where I need to be now and
that's kind of what you need to do this
is where like I was saying before you
get client-side prediction this stops
are getting or laggy and stuff like that
I'm going to get too much into the
details is it can get pretty complicated
just be aware that if your code is going
to be open so if you aren't looking into
these kinds of things might regret it so
yeah the good thing about this though is
that people were making they were
finding the errors in my game which I
fam amazing and I didn't have to pay
them to do that they were going in they
felt motivated enough to go in and try
and break my game yeah okay they did it
and but I appreciated that and it showed
me all the holes I needed to plug in the
next version of the game i plug them and
then they tried to do it again and if
they did it again I fixed that
it's free testing you can't get better
than that and the fact because this
isn't all compiled and stuff I was like
sort of making changes like as soon as I
saw someone hacking and I saw what they
did I could make the change in a couple
of seconds upload it to the server and
it would be fixed I didn't have to do
any compilation or anything like that it
was just done restart the server working
and it's really quite interesting you're
quite cool and so although I hate
cheaters I will to love them a little
bit so something I'm sort of looking
into at the moment and slightly had a
few conversations people about this is
dom or campus so I'm sort of sitting on
the canvas side of things and I know if
you guys who is sitting on the Dom side
of things I get both sides and what I
mean by this is so on canvas you are
using the html5 canvas element to draw
your graphics and stuff like that see
using this sort of pixel sort of
blitzing I think they call it and just a
grid of pixels and you're just pushing
pixels on to it you know there's now
each element you draw or doesn't have
its own bomb element there's no sort of
sense of objects and in canvas it's just
a block of pixels it doesn't know that
that's a circle it just knows that it
it's a bunch of pixels in that area and
with the downside of things you're using
normal content elements and stuff like
that putting image backgrounds in
whatever and it's I don't know it's in
my opinion Dom has more performance
benefits i suppose and the canvas i
think is the right tool the future I
don't think it's particularly ready to
replace the way that what the Dom works
at the moment because there's still some
issues of canvas performance it's going
to get better and if either acceleration
and better updates I mean people are
doing stuff with cameras that it wasn't
built to do let's put it that way so
we're trying to sort catch up with it I
think and what I mean sorry if you have
a question
yeah I mean there's those different ways
to sort of get around it it's quite
interesting to see the ways people are
trying to squeeze the performance out of
stuff like that so I mean I did use
multiple canvases for the original world
bits and probably over the new one so
the background I used a separate canvas
and the guide the Rockets role on
another canvas so I wasn't constantly
having to redraw the entire background
every time save so much like so many
resources so much resource is but I mean
the whole dumb versus a missing kind of
reminds me of like the wait tables we
use to do Lau back in the day and serve
before CSS came along until saved
everyone yeah I mean I completely agree
that there isn't an either/or situation
at the moment it's there is sort of
context to what one you're going to
choose and I just I think the kind of
argument I'm getting out here is is more
that I think we should be concentrating
on fixing canvas the issues that we have
with canvas so whether that's the
accessibility so the canvas doesn't know
what's being drawn in it and so the
interaction layers and stuff like that
as there's no you have to code your own
you can't just click on a camera to know
where you've clicked and what you
clicked on you have to make that with
yourself and this is the kind of stuff
that dom's really good now I don't know
I mean whether I want to replace the
done with cameras I haven't quite
decided yet I haven't my thoughts on
this haven't really matured yet and I
just think it's something we need to be
thinking about because I think you've
got a really good reason for why you're
using that kind of technology I think a
lot of people are just using them
because they're there so the reason why
I say that is a lot of game engines are
giving Eva just dumb support or da man
kind of support but the develops who are
using those engines don't know the
difference they don't they're just using
the Dom because it was the default
version and I think it's more of an
education thing that I'm getting out
here it's it's not necessarily replacing
them yeah at least until canvas is not
ready to replace the dome as we as we've
agreed under but I mean yeah he's a
performance thing so if you want to be
sort of supporting the older browsers
you're not going to
obviously you stuff like the cameras
because it's just not going to be faster
and but we need to be making sure that
we're going in the right direction for
the future now my concern is if we keep
sort of holding onto the Dalton we're
going to be hopping back on what we
could be doing with the canvas kind of
stuff this is why I haven't quite
decided for a fun just canvas from just
Dom Mia I I just need to be careful and
really think about what we're trying to
do and so anyway the sort of besides the
point I just thought it was quite
interesting to get out so the future of
sort of html5 gaming i think is quite
interesting and I think like we've
already agreed with that discussion as
well is we're kind of at an early stage
with stuff like canvas with WebSockets
and particular because WebSockets sort
of has had a bit of a rocky sort of
journey recently and there's some quite
interesting things that need to be done
and if they are done I think it's going
to be really interesting to see the
improvements are going to be made with
html5 gaming so one of the most
important is better documentation to
more tutorials about this kind of stuff
and especially the complex areas like I
would say like client-side prediction
the multiplayer stuff that people might
want to add to their game but they might
not want any of them have the research
and understand the ferry or themselves
so there's a really good gaming resort
called gaffer on games then if there's
anyone heard of that guy called Glen
again fiedler I don't know how to
pronounce his name the part is probably
fairly simple but it's a really good
sort of resource for desktop gaming and
languages and it's where I learned how
to do client-side prediction all that
kind of stuff but you have to port from
the language of T's using over to Java
scripts and that kind of doesn't work
sometimes and it's a bit annoying and if
you're just a developer this one's to
make your game quickly and understand
the technologies it's not ideal so we
need stuff a resource a repository or
something just bad at documentation for
making particular aspects of gaming in
JavaScript there's kind of bits and bobs
all over the places bits that questions
on stack overflow and the game dev stack
overflow and stuff but I don't know it's
not quite there yet and I think that's
really going to help people and push
things forward if we can get
kind of thing and something I want to
kind of work on as well myself yumping
is WebGL support sorry bad in the moment
and sickly with the IETF and whatever
and the WebGL is interesting because
it's massively hardware accelerated so
there's like WebGL there's a 2d version
of WebGL which is what the web version
of angry birds uses so it's like sort of
hardware accelerated to lead stuff it's
quite interesting and if WebGL gets
better I think we're going to see some
much more much cruder games coming out
and I think when the cooler games come
out I think that's when more people are
going to get involved it's sort of like
a a role of an all running down a hill
effect and yes so yeah I mean aside from
web GL I think we need more engines as
well more gaming engines more robust
engines more mature engines and solve
the issues the complicated issues for us
a bit like isogenic if that comes up and
comes off very well that'd be great and
the price might be a concern but we that
can be worked out in the future and I
worry that a lot of these engines are
just being snapped up by the big
companies I think that's a really bad
thing and I just want a really nice one
that is ready for the public and that
can be used if we can have that I think
we're going to see some really cool
games and a much brighter future and for
html5 gaming and improved audio like I
was staying in the loop stuff is crap at
the moment so nodding her I think if we
can improve take some of live audio
support and more consistent at least
html5 audio support with proper looping
that'll be amazing we can just I could
drop flash completely then from my game
and more powerful mobile devices i mean
we're getting that now like every time
sort of whatever its upgrading the power
and you're getting more out of it I
don't know how much exactly but I think
with more hardware accelerated stuff
like canvas and WebGL and mobile devices
and stuff is going to be a lot easier to
make for quite interesting games and
perhaps if we used on for the moment or
whatever but being or pushing the power
of the mobile stuff
I think that's what a lot of games are
getting em being played right now he's
on mobile devices and we're ready to be
going there yeah so yet multi-touch
support javascript or iOS at least M has
full multi-touch support in JavaScript
so I'm double too much in android yet
and I were looking into it for five
bucks and we're going to start with just
single touch support and then we'll move
into multi-touch but it's there and it's
in JavaScript so it's it's usable I mean
he really wanted to you could support
and fingers I think it's actually 11
fingers I don't know why it's 11 thing
is I don't know we'd try this out and I
was at another event and seb Lidl i was
showing his sort of controller thing and
and he put ten fingers on and i was like
just put another finger and it just
worked see but we can put anymore on so
I've been a widely to limit of 1120 the
two people I'll be interesting on one
device Vista is that any single that's
interesting say androids so single touch
support and majority of them all right
first one in the other this one yeah yes
I mean that would be interesting to stop
getting more consistent I think there's
a mass spec coming out for touch-based
event right yeah even though it's just
touching a screen
I just want to make games so enough of
being kind of related to those again
crappy font is not better is better
controls and so more sort of like
console-like control systems and so like
what Seb Lee Delilah's done with the iOS
stuff the joysticks and sort of what
what's going on here and the brass
monkey stuff which used to be so with
the emoji stuff was the kind of stuff
I'm interesting in here and turning
smartphones particularly is it just iOS
at the moment okay so smart phones
turning them into controllers but not
just controllers you can change the
interface of the controller is it just
using HTML and stuff isn't it yes I mean
one example is yet a super mario game
and yet the controller looking like an
old was it my own yeah no system
controller on your phone and you just it
just look cool but if you use a
different game the control system would
completely change so you might have the
two joysticks on it but you're not
having to do anything that much more
complicated assist in the API that
exists right so I mean this kind of
stuff is calling it's interesting and it
put breaks away from the keyboard on the
mouse even though you're playing on
browser on your tally or wherever and I
think the way people win 25 interacts
with these games is going to be quite
interesting to see how that developed
them in the future one answers ization
said that completely on monetization
whatever is a massive itchy right now if
there's no money involved in this
industry there's people i'm just going
to make the games do it is it's just
going to be the developers making demos
in the cool stuff and so right now there
aren't many games making profit I don't
know if there's probably why I mean the
zinc stuff i don't know watching you
getting support html5 yet and i'm sure
they'll make a crapload of money when
they do and release that but there's no
system for normal developers out there
to make money from these games of these
open technologies and i think this is a
massive stumbling block for the future
like if there's no money they just not
gonna make the game
on this platform they're going to go to
where the money is which is iOS whatever
so the kind of questions when you t
answer and I don't have the answer yet
but how do you monetize a game when the
code is all open to you so do you do
sort of in-app purchases and how do you
do that without sort of people coding
their own purchases and stealing them or
rewriting their own feet to the game or
whatever you need to needs to be thought
about and I think there's something that
needs to be looked into some can make a
lot of money other so unreal hooks
that's my twitter at rob hawks and rob
comments my blog if you want to find out
more about this kind of stuff and some
interesting project that worked on
recently was Twitter sentiment analysis
was my dissertation Eenie that was
really kind of cool and do a podcast
with explicit web or web development
staff talk about this kind of crazy
stuff and got a book we're going to give
a couple of way today and on sort of
html5 canvas a little bit about gaming
at the end as well we make two games at
the end it's all about sort of getting
to grips of cameras from scratch so I
mean if you know a little bit about
characters probably isn't your book but
if you don't know too much you know of
it you don't know how to you haven't
really used it yet you want to find it
about all the features and Stefan kind
of book for you and it sort of gives you
a look at your JavaScript as well so if
you need to JavaScript absolutely fine
and so yeah that's out on missin amazon
can go on my website volcom / foundation
canvas so you can get it there if you
want another thing is coffee forward
which is Mozilla events happening this
friday and at the Red Rock Cafe in
Mountain View so this is new mozilla
project called Webfoot it's like they
call it a an innovation accelerator this
is all about of grabbing these open
source projects at these open projects
and pushing pushing the web port
together so getting Mozilla involved and
you might know more about this than I do
they go so y combinator for open web
technology stuff so
on Friday I don't know the actual times
in a time okay so yeah so this on Friday
we'll find out at the time in a second
and so it's just an excuse like on the
Friday just to meet a few great people
it's in Mountain Dew so it's it's fairly
local local for you guys not for me i
live in the UK 952 1130 on friday and am
yes yeah good clarification point and so
you cannot be interesting so I
definitely go to that and is also
Mozilla dev Derby which is something
we've been running and did one last
month and it's running every month now
so this month feeds html5 video so it's
a competition where you can upload of
demonstrations or experiments or
whatever that you've made with these
technologies so like to know you could
pick a HTML 5 video element you can
manipulate it with the canvas do
something really cool with that and
upload that demo if you win and you can
get prizes like android phones bags and
t-shirts and that kind of stuff so next
month is all about touch events and
which is going to be interesting and
then the month after that is the history
API I think ok it on the website but
either way it's good thing to keep an
eye on and it's cool competition I'm
thinking she'd definitely submit
something if you're interested in these
technologies the link is down there also
screwed up a little bit and put I mean
if you said Derby Mozilla on Google
you'll you'll find it and so yeah so
thanks for listening and hope you enjoy
the rest of the day I believe we have
some time to decide for questions I
don't know if we overlapped a bit or
questions cool stay but yeah so the
question was who's going to be making
the big impact of the monetization side
of html5 gaming say whether that's the
Chrome Web Store or iOS App Store
I don't really know I mean my gut would
say the web store stuff is quite
interesting and but I mean it's not
there's nothing stopping you from using
that game for free the way I can see it
is the monitors they late inside it's
going to be stuff that you can put on
the server that you sort of push back
down to the client so whether that's in
app purchases with someone regardless of
the this system where the money comes
from whether that's the App Store and
web stores or whatever your own paypal
anything as long as you can keep control
of what's going on on the server they
can't see that code unless if they can
see that code then you've got a bigger
problem and then push the stuff back
down how you stop that regarding sharing
of that content I don't know yet and
it's going to be interesting and I don't
have an answer to it yet so so that's
the valid point it's using things like
PhoneGap you can package up the html5
games and whatever into an app on iOS
put it on the App Store as an iOS app
and sell it that way and so you won't
necessarily be accessing it through the
browser but you'll be accessing it for
the WebKit stuff on iOS 3d app yeah so
if there's ways of getting around this
kind of stuff it's just there's no way
to do it cross platform on the web
particularly and so yeah I suppose
you're going to where you start this is
why I like the isogenic engine because I
think it's one of I don't believe it's
the only but it's one of the most
promising ones that's really sort of
pushing for the ISO isometric gameplay
kind of stuff the whole farmville look
and whatever and the engine that I would
recommend is isogenic engine the fact
that it's not out in the public properly
I mean you can buy it and use it but
it's still being developed and there's
kind of the best answer I can give in
that regard I've not tried any of the
other engines so I don't know whether
you create an engine yourself I'd
done it isn't depend if that's something
you want to do but isogenic is probably
the one to keep an eye on in regard for
ice advice' graphic gaming and the web
the getting closure I've not actually
looked into that yet so be interesting
to look into right yeah so the question
is with rockets and any other
multiplayer game if you get on at say
four in the morning and there's no one
there it's going to be pretty boring
game so I have run into that problem and
particularly because there's a small but
sort of sort of addicted group of people
that play the game but they're not on
then they there's no one to play so the
way I was looking at it is i'm going to
introduce things and pots like so you
can just sort of you AI running around
at the game it's going to be multiplayer
but you could play single player except
you still get the multiplayer aspects of
the game and the digital human and yeah
so you get hire people to come in and
play by not if you've got money to burn
go for it but yes I mean it is a problem
and everything but that's not a gaming
html5 game before a mr. gaming problem
in general and that is building up
communities and then that so building up
a community of players for your game and
then that boils back to the whole where
do you advertise these games you go on
congregate do you go on put it on
Facebook do you put in the app store
whatever if you're not going where the
players are you're not going to get many
players and it's not going to be a fun
game so you gotta balance it all out and
I've got an ideal solution but the bots
the AI is is my way of fixing it
temporarily at least any more questions
