to attend the talk this is obviously a
great turnout the last event I spoke at
usually after the talk people would come
and then they were them ask questions or
comments or whatever it is and I found
myself again discussing what's going to
happen to Java for like the 1000 times
with this person and the conversation
went for a long time and it made me
really frustrated so i went home and sat
down and I wrote an article I like a 12
page article they ended up sending it to
to jax magazine that amazing to my
amusement they decided to true to
publish it because they thought it was
actually okay so i turned it into a
presentation and they contacted I think
Rob and then they told me that I can
actually come to this event and then
talk to you guys about it I am not
pretending to know all the answers I am
that this is not a talk that is going to
be you know I mean that has a lot of
numbers or like has a lot of you know
predictive models wherever it is for
like and drags in for like an hour to
tell you that Java is going to die one
day wherever it is I tried its the
slider working on my dish as well let's
go through them skip think we can just
skip this one as well so anyways again
this talk is based on that article
actually comes out on Thursday and if
you're interested in reading it you can
just go to jackson 2.com / Jack's
magazine or you can get it through the
iphone app Jack's magazine oh the
android app java java tech so this talk
again is structured in such a way that
will simply walk you guys through the my
thought process as i try to achieve some
clarity and find some answers and we
flee not bore you again no numbers no
predictive models as I said before
because I don't think they matter much
because they assume that things are
going to stay the way they are and not
going to change it's really good to look
back and try to gain some insight but
predicting what's going to happen in the
future I don't think it has that much of
a value I will attempt to keep you
entertained throughout so a lot i'm
going to get in and you include some fun
fun facts and a lot of cheesy humor this
is a WYSIWYG what you see is what you
get I put everything on the slides some
people really hate then they send me
email at the end why you're just reading
off the slides now I am I I really think
I think that it's a good thing so could
so people can go back to the
presentation and be able to go through
it without actually having to find the
recording of the presentation or any of
have to play it back so they can just go
through the slides pinky promises I'm
not promising you again any definitive
answers and I'm not gonna give you guys
any hard empirical data to back my back
my claims you are I am expecting you
guys expecting you guys to disagree with
me and some of my other things on these
presentations are quite opinionated on a
promising you again is my biased opinion
and more importantly the answer to the
question why do java programmers wear
glasses um this is my first time giving
this talk I just semi finished the
slides about like five minutes ago I
thought it was going to be the easiest
thing because I've already wrote the
article so just like take those and put
him in slides but it wasn't it wasn't
the case I found that after writing that
article interestingly maybe like just a
month later I evolved some idea quite a
bit so there are certain things that are
including this presentations that are
not a part of the article that I wrote
before I would very much appreciate your
help and your feedback in order to
improve this talk if you go to speakers
score calm / SF jug dash future of java
you'll be able to
give me that feedback I appreciate
negative feedback as much as I
appreciate positive one so please help
me out so um anyways the eschatology of
Java um I again they went home about
this article and I had a very boring
title it was like straight talk on Java
some something crappy like that and they
send it to a couple of people one of
them is my brother to that screen is
flickering a little bit I don't know if
that's a good thing yeah anyways and
then he read the article and proof read
it and he said you know what would be a
good title said like what you said this
cat ology of Java like what the hell is
eschatology so I had to look it up how
many people looked it up for you go the
rest of you probably didn't bother I
looked it up for you so what is khattala
G is this is straight out of Wikipedia
is the part of theology philosophy and
futurology concerned with what is
believed to be the final events of
history the ultimate destiny of humanity
commonly referred to as the end of the
world or end of time so this is so cool
it's going to make me look so smart so I
so we're with it all right this
presentation could have simply be titled
what is the future Java right anyways um
every time something significant
happened on every time a new version of
Java comes out there is like some
security issues issues with the latest
java plugin or even some competing
technology you know how dare that's
picking up picking up some steam you
have this phenomenon of the Java late
night talk show where all of these
people trying to figure out what would
be what what's going to happen to Java
what's the mean is it going to die or is
it gonna you know or does it does that
you know that event matter or not and
like they'll actually I try to answer is
actually
oh who decides the fate of Java you know
whether these events are should we just
ignore em or should you actually take
him into consideration and it's a really
important question because it doesn't
really matter without whether you
actually invested an entire career in
this technology and a lot of us on one
of those those people um or you've just
you're like a new guy you're trying to
figure out whether it's worth your while
to actually go and spend time on it you
really want to you know literally figure
out when you jump ship you know you
don't wanna be mean up you want to be
employable we put it this way sorry ways
in this blogosphere these pundits of
these bloggers are usually end up in two
different camps the first camp is the
camp of the eggheads and the second camp
is the camp of their own romantics the
next section is going to discuss both
camps usually and I'm going to try to
kind of hate on them a little bit and
highlight the problems that I have with
these people so let's start with the
eggheads the eggheads are obsessed with
features they think that the future of
Java the future of any programming
language for instance depends on the
supported features you have to support
certain features or not support them to
actually remain or stay valva stay
viable and these people I'm not like
this group that agrees on anything in on
the y on the other hand they are very
heterogeneous in the sense that they
argue over everything they argue whether
the most recent feature is good or bad
something think it's good solvent think
it's bad well what should be added what
should be what should the next feature
beard then be you know and they have
very different opinions and it was
really hard for me to wrap my head
around why are these people I mean what
are the reasons behind singling out
those those like particular features or
thinking this is going to be saying that
this is going to be good Nova door like
this is going to be bad what makes it
really worse it's like the next version
update of of the
after world or the platform does not
introduce only one feature it introduces
10 of them or 20 of them whatever it is
so you have the eggheads like going
crazy all over the stuff ready so and
they figured out that since these people
never agree on anything and since their
opinion seems to be very individual then
these people must be acting out of out
of a bias and must be influenced by some
kind of by some kind of hype and when I
was thinking what would help she'll
devised turn the device it turned out
that maybe it's the background or maybe
it's the programming language that
they're most influenced by our most like
familiar windows platform that the most
familiar with and I got really curious
how many programming languages out there
are out there how many so I can have an
idea of how many types of eggheads are
there or like how many types of egghead
opinions are there and then come out
right but so I actually went and looked
up try to find like some kind of
resource online where I can actually go
and look up the number of programming
languages out there ever created how
many people are familiar with 99 bottles
of beer very few people nine hours of
beer is one of its a drinking song it's
an American folk song that goes like
this
alright so 99 bottles of beer on the
wall 99 bottles a very take one down you
pass it around 98 bottles of beer and
they goes on and on and on until there
are no bottles of beer at all and
depending on how drunk you are you could
start you know for like 3,000 bottles of
beer on the wall and go yeah well
usually people start from like 99 so um
this so if you go to 99 dash bottles
dash of dash beard net you'll find
programs written in every possible
programming language ever created to
print out the lyrics of this song some
of them are for loops some of them are
you know recursive were algorithms long
I kind of stuff and some of our quite
interesting in fact in 1977 there was
this a journal paper called the
complexity of songs written by Donald
Knuth that says that the complexity of
this algorithm Zizzo vlogging very
interesting paper to read then I put the
PDF there for you if you wrap if you're
a that geeky one of the most interesting
programming languages i came across was
a language called their pit it's an
esoteric programming language whose
source code is a bitmap you take this
big image right here you compile it and
any prints out 99 bottles of beer all
right so few more interested in learning
about it you know the URL is there for
you as well so what what made that
interesting is that I figured the guy
who wrote this programming language has
gotta be pushing for including the
feature of giving the Java C compiler
the Java compiler a bitmap and compiling
it into Java in the intro bytecode so so
so their argument kind of stopped making
sense to me and they stopped caring
about people like suggestion features of
even like a arguing in that argument
because it could be pointless now one
thing is these people always assume that
adding more feature all like is how
people should evolve a language
and that we always we need to keep up we
need to add features and go the language
and such but the problem with that is
that some feature is just impossible to
implement or sometimes those features of
just not consistent with the philosophy
that drove the initial design of the
programming language itself right um and
is this change you know needed to begin
with do we actually need this feature to
begin with or is it in the right
direction otherwise you end up with some
bloated ugly programming languages in
the liking of C++ that has every feature
in the world and you make it make it
make your your life and everybody's life
really hard she Duke right there chasing
that carrot that carrot is the feature
where it is so anyways um the next thing
that influences these people other than
a personal bias and the personal
preference is um they sell hype around
competing technologies every time the
new kid in the block which is considered
to be the hottest programming language
meaning the one that has the latest and
greatest features it's always there and
there is this old hot enough programming
language that has the set of the
features that fulfills the need of the
specific use case at some point on time
and it's all relative to some to some
point in time right so right there one
should really sit there and in kind of
make a judgment call they say that fed
is this new kid in the block is
something just gonna you know go away
and not really get a matter is you're
going to make an impact and if it makes
if it's there to make an impact maybe
you should consider you know borrowing
or adopting some of those features and
proposing it to the next version of Java
whatsoever if that's even possible right
so and then um I figured that the way to
actually realize that is actually to
watch how people behave when a new
technology is out there and I can't any
called they came up with the concept of
a programming language inertia actually
didn't come up with anything it's after
referring to social inertia when people
actually resist resist change people
just
all set there oh there is this new
programming language let's rewrite our
oakham our own you know right this part
of the of our software and deploy to
prod you know because it's cool people
just don't do that because it's always
associated with some kind of learning
learning curve and the second thing that
determines it is how much value of these
people getting out of this new
technology of this new programming
languages all the values of the feature
that it brings in you know so um is it
worth their while is it worth the
investment and it very much has to do
with how hard it is and the only the
only the only way that it would make a
difference is if it's so hot that it
would actually render the status quo of
the status quo on hot because people
have satisfied with hot enough I mean as
long as it fulfills you need you're fine
anyways this whole thing this being said
what is up with Java so Java is a
language it has been there for many
years it's a well mature and it's
certainly not the hottest out there that
many platforms and many really nice new
different languages out there I'm much
much harder than Java but I also do not
see anything out there approaching the
tipping point of hotness in a serious
way so next time you come across these
tabloid blogs that are they have titles
like the Java post-mortem or like the
death of Java wherever it is you might
want to actually think twice because it
could only mean without just
discrediting anyone just like that it
could only mean that there's this new
technology out there that picked up a
lot of steam and gained itself a bunch
of a bunch of fanboys because it's not
that simple the next camp is that of the
romantics and these are diehard
community people you know they think
that it is the community that decides
the fate of a technology the community
that decides the future of the java
programming language so as long as
people believe in it
and support it it's going to survive and
thrive and if they just one day wake up
in the morning they say hate you Duke I
hate you java your stupid mascot I'm not
we're not gonna do it anymore Java is
gonna die right I don't like these guys
although they put up a pretty elaborate
argument based on on on a lot of numbers
and they say a look at Google Trends to
cut the what people are searching for
look at the job postings Java is
everywhere they got Stack Overflow look
at the number of open source projects
and github and more importantly look at
em the index which for many many years
continues to indicate that Java is the
dominant number one programming language
month after month if you're interested
the link also is on is on the slide that
I try to share with you later but the
problem with this is that this is kind
of a chicken-or-egg situation alright so
the relationship between the viability
of the programming language and and and
and and the health of its community is
kind of a correlation it's not a
causation you don't have a healthy
community than a viable programming
language the one does not cause the
other or like a viable programming
language that would cause its
communities just happens it's just a
correlation so one does not cause the
other one and more importantly if you
have a healthy community it can only
indicate current success you look at
java community and it's amazing it's
like no other community and me no
judging by their users this is one of
their user groups they're the people or
you guys are not only people that are
passive you know like most other views
of groups I just sit there and then wait
for the next version to come out but
your people that contribute and give
back and actually help define the future
of this language by participating in
things like the OpenJDK or the dr j sr
project and such so not to paint a black
and white picture the silent majority
actually have
to be on the fence and it was one of
these people and these people you know
have adopt this great what I call the
gray area argument well it's some kind
of reconciliation of both the egghead
argument and the Romantics argument and
kind of acknowledges the minutes of both
sides and they do have both of them have
merits and they say all right you know
it's both the features in the community
the features and community will decide
the future the future of Java so the
problem for a long time I was one of
these guys but I mean is no such thing
as the gray area argument mean you're
just like a moderate egghead you know or
like you'd be like a more moderate
romantic I'm independent of where you
were you lean and they had fundamental
issue with the arguments that these
people like put up so I it wasn't it was
never I wasn't satisfied and then I
spent a lot of time you know saying that
maybe I'm neither of them decide not the
features and maybe something else and
then in trying to kind of come up with
an answer I was trying to argue by an
analogy and explore in especially
Natural Sciences and Social Sciences
look up for some kind of theory out
there that study some kind of an
evolution and evolution of a population
or evolution of a community wherever it
is and draw some kind of analogies and
try to kind of infer what it's going to
happen to Java what happens usually to
programming languages didn't take long
and gel I thought of programming
language Darwinism that sounds so cool
but my problem was maybe if I was
successful on John but I didn't know
where to where I was going with this and
they the challenge was actually drawing
those analogies so before on before I
actually go further um how many p
for our familiar with Darwinism of how
many people are really familiar with
Darwinism all right you get a few over
there so um in this case are spending it
just like give like a small primer and
go over it in the next few slides and
reason why I asked people ask for people
who are like really familiar with
Darwinism I was open not to have any in
the room so I can you all I
want but unfortunately you know right
there is keeping an eye on me already
but Charles Darwin was a scientist this
smart man and he went on this voyage on
this voyage you know conducting
scientific experiments and recording
resolved observations on his notebook
and he went traveled to a bunch of
places and probably one of the most
significant you know places that
actually that his studies is these
islands right here of the coast of the
western coast of South America called
the Galapagos Islands and after that I
mean he after that he went back to to
England and he wrote this book the
famous book of on the ariane the origin
named on the origin of the species this
is the short the short title the long
title is on the Origin of Species by
means of natural selections or the
preservations of favorite races in the
struggle for life Charles Darwin 1859
notice that favorite is spelled with a
you yeah those brits can't spell yeah
sorry so I i decided i was going to
correct it by the na i didn't think it
was right but anyways when he went to
these islands he actually you know ended
up with a bunch of finches recall like
Darwin's finches he took him home with
him and all these birds they have like
difference and we thought it was they
were completely different species which
turned out to be not the case it turned
out to be there do the exact
species but they have different beaks
and these beaks are different in such a
way that they are you're like that like
this guy right here is a food eater like
a seed eater so he has like a bigger be
a bigger big true to eat seeds with and
this guy who's who's a fruit eater he's
like this type of the shape of beak or
this form of big so it could be fruit
super fruits with while the cactus eater
has like a different beacon stuff so you
didn't know that we need to get you in
jingling actually realizes that they are
the same bird but why do they have
different beaks right so it turns out
that actually the one that each said
then the that these birds the shape of
their birds like matches the the type of
food that is more available on that
particular Island you go to the island
where the vegetation has a lot of fruits
then you have more fruit eat a lot more
food and fruit fruit fruit eating
finches more than you know city to city
a new finches and that's how he came up
with this theory of evolution by natural
selection which states that species are
not immutable species evolved and what
and how did he say these species evolved
they evolves because their environment
establishes a bias toward certain traits
and against other ones so you put all
these like finches and all you have is
fruits available every other finches all
the other finches they can't eat food
they simply die off because there is no
food for them and the ones that thrive
and gets to get you past their their
their gene and multiply are the ones
that actually can eat that type of food
so the fortunate organisms possess that
possess the favor traits or thrive as I
send for your ones like would die off if
you're interested in reading more on
Charles Darwin on the theory of
evolution I highly recommend the david
quammen book The Reluctant mr. Darwin
and if you're just interested about you
know more about finches you can read
this book I haven't read it but I heard
a lot of good things about it ah back to
what actually matters you know any
enough inches so it was great it was
this was really fascinating so the next
step
me was actually to go and take I was
just told that I should go back inside
the blue box sorry if I'm gonna have
been there most of the time I'm not
allowed to go outside of the blue box so
all right so um so I thought it would be
like really good to actually if I could
actually take all the concepts that are
highlighted by the by Darwinism by the
by the theory of evolution and in mad
pain to actually programming languages
so I go if programming languages were to
be Finch species what would the big
forms be the different big forms
different big forms um guessing they
would be like the feature set supported
by the individual individual programming
language and the population of the
individual Finch species would be the
community around it you know how many
people are programming Java would be the
bird the feature sets of Java you know
would be its beak and how many java
programmers would be actually like the
commute how many finches would be with
much actually the community around the
java programming language but what would
the environment be of the individual
Finch species be analogous to that's
actually the question that I was trying
to get you because Darwin says that it's
the environment that actually drives
that evolution so it's got to be
something that looks exactly like the
environment on within the context of
programming languages that would
actually decide the fate of these
programming languages environment was
like it is weird like words so I said
maybe I should like to find it further
the environment for the individual Finch
species would be the specific Island you
know that the species lives on and the
kind of available food if in its
specific islands so it was we got a
little clearer and age or the following
analogy that the specific island would
be analogous to the specific hardware
architecture on top of which the
binaries of compiled individual
programming languages
artifacts are executed I had to read it
because it took me like a little bit to
come up with that senses but and then
the kind of food available for like the
Finch species on the island and would be
analogous to the problem space within
which we use this programming language
right or just the type of the kind of
software to be written using that
particular programming language a lot of
the programming languages that we use
i'll actually generic but one way or an
hour or another wind up solving specific
problems using those languages just to
recap i have biological evolution one
side a programming language evolution on
another the french species would be
analogous to the programming language
the finch population of that species
would be analogous to the community and
the big form would be analogous to the
supported feature sets and the kind of
available food would be analogous to the
probably up for a problem space of the
programming language and the island on
which the finches live would be
analogous to enter line in the
underlying hardware so this sense the
environment decides the fate decides the
faith of programming programming
languages let's talk knitting first
certain things this could only mean that
Java is a language which has been very
successful that's a fact has is well
fitted to write currently needed
software on currently available hardware
that is why Java is successful right and
it's only reasonable to assume that it
will continue to be as successful at
least as long as the environment states
and changed so if the environment stays
and change Java will stay successful
right now before we move on and kind of
drill down into the environment part the
theory also of evolution highlights this
concept of the comment and sister common
ancestor question and it is a known fact
that all programming languages have
you know they all they all have like a
common ancestor which is the very first
programming language ever created if
you're interested in a very nice post or
like a very nice map there's a link here
to the PDF so you can see from O'Reilly
it's called the history of programming
languages so I just thought that it
would be fun to put it up there so to
answer the question right now again of
what is the future of Java we should
simply answer provide answers to the
following questions are there any
significant environmental changes right
and if there are any how do these
changes affect Java do they make Java
more fitted to its current environment
or do they make it less fit it if it's
less fitted that means it's just going
to go away and if it's more fitted that
means just going to become even more
successful if it's unchanged in the word
good um since we talked about Java
finches this is the real Java Finch
record so this was the mascot of the
Java users group queen duke was actually
owned by sun microsystems so this guy
right here Bruno from from the Java user
society of Brazil still walks around
with this guy with a pop in his hand in
Java one and then creates videos know
where it is ya think so but um he's a
nice guy it's a yeah so anyways the next
one's environmental changes let's talk
about the hard way how do we depend on I
mean did it did it change not so uh
Moore's law I don't need to remind
anybody in this room of Moore's law but
it simply states that the number of
transistors on integrated circuits would
double approximately every two years and
it's been remarkably accurate this
concept was first introduced in this
paper cramming more components onto
integrated circuits 1965 and what this
means for software is that the
performance gain is automatically
realized you write a piece of code you
wait for two years you buy a new server
you put that piece of code on that
server and it's twice as fast just like
that all right been working out really
well for us we did the hardware people
like do the thing the legendary mr.
Moore is this guy right here in his
grill is the co-founder of Intel so um I
was looking for a younger version of him
or like something but this is what
actually he made all the money and stuff
and he stopped caring about his like
outside appearance started wearing a hat
to the office me on some glasses to make
him like look serious and stuff what I
look for more this is the first picture
that came out I was like gonna put that
on the slice oh yeah and then you
started wearing them like a jacket to
kind of make him a fascist business
casual I guess now I'm anyways I told
you about the cheesy humor so but
anyways more so it's great um mean we're
maybe around here so it means that if
things go the way um you know that's
predicted that we will be able to
produce one chip that actually has
enough processing power or can do as
many mixes of many million instructions
per second as the human brain around I
don't know something in 22 around right
after like 20 20 and if we continue by
2060 will be able to have one chip that
is equivalent to the processing power to
all human beings you know on earth which
is pretty awesome and fortunately in the
words of George lindell reality hits you
hard bro Google em all right so the as
predicted by physicists the laws of
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics
limit the computing power that we can
limit or we can put or we can cram on
the one silicon chip because of heat and
leakage and what that means is that you
put them so close to each other and you
start generating so much heat that the
chip will just simply melt right no
matter you know no matter what you do
and the leakage meaning that those
electrons you know in solve the
electricity
men inside the chip it's just we won't
be able to know where where it is won't
be able to know where we won't be able
to locate like the electron because
would be operating by completely
different laws at the quantum quantum
level what this means is that the era of
the single chip is gone so now we buy
computers that are multi-core means like
what cpu is right next to each other on
one chip we could make one chip one
silicon chip anymore because we couldn't
fit that many that many transistors in
it what the hell does it mean for us on
the software silence programmer you
couldn't talk about this without
actually discussing the imperative
programming paradigm which has been the
most dominant has been the most
intuitive so far Java is indeed is an
imperative programming language in
itself and what this mean is we have all
these computational instructions that
are expressed as the sequence of
statements that have a side effect of
mutating emulating mutating states of
these variables and whatnot so this
imperative paradigm burdens the
programmer with actually state
management with the responsibility of
managing that state so you gotta
synchronize make sure that if you have
multiple fits going on at the same time
we're going to synchronize access to
that state and you gotta actually
synchronize you know mutating it making
sure that you're not reading you know
corrupt bad data you know dirty you know
variables make sure that only one thread
can modify at the same time and you know
all that all that jazz so parallel ism
and before I go into this small section
let me know that parallel ISM and
concurrency of different concepts if
there are any like really crazy
concurrent or geeky people in that in
that space they will call me out on Troy
but I'm just using them interchangeably
and loosely their liquid me
in different things but paradise was not
was not was not easy you know on the
single courtship because we need to
agree Megan do that across the different
thread within within two one chip on a
multi-core chip the problem just became
a lot worse because now we need to
synchronize access across can currently
executing threads across different
different course so we're try a key to
do a lot of things around to try to
incorporate immutability and our designs
we try to actually upload that into on
these all these all these frameworks
that you know much smarter people like
wrote and spend time doing but it's has
been proven to be really hard and what
we end up doing especially if you are on
a multi-core chip one up just like
giving up and we end up actually writing
software that can own that only takes
advantage of the of one core we have six
cores 2430 course but we don't we can't
we write only software that is limited
by the computational power of the clock
rate of the one chip so um ada is the
word words first computer programmer she
is known by how many people know ADA the
language at least it's named after this
amazing woman and she's known to for her
work on the analytical engine and which
is the first programmable
general-purpose computer invented by
Charles Babbage who was considered to be
the first of the father of the computer
and the shoes sending him all these
notes and all of these letters and this
is straight out of no d i'm going to
bore you and review these few of your
lines but they're they're really they're
really amazing and remember that this
was in eighteen something so on maybe i
shouldn't read the whole thing what do
you think whole thing no okay alright it
must be evident how multi furious and
how mutually complicated are the
considerations which the working of such
an engine involved there are frequently
several distinct sets or sets of effects
going on Simon Tate simultaneously all
in a manner independent of it
each other and yet to a greater or less
degree exercise in a mutual influence to
a judge adjust each to every other and
indeed even to perceive and trace them
out with the perfect correctness and
success entails difficulties whose
nature partakes to a certain extent of
those involved in every question where
conditions are very numerous and inter
complicated no D so um this is exactly
what we're we're dealing with the how
state or mutable state is extremely hard
to manage there was no computer when she
wrote those things in fact I don't
believe they ever built Babbage ever
built a final version of that engine if
you're interested in reading and you've
got time about this woman this book is a
good book if you're into novels you know
this one is probably like a better a
better one this is more like a story and
this one's more about the women ada The
Enchantress of numbers political numbers
of our political science anyways what
this means is that the paradigm is
shifting it means that every imperative
programming language every language
within the imperative model is doomed to
extension it won't all going to go away
there are not going to stay because of
that constraints and it's virtually
humanly partly impossible to actually
you know right I write code in that
manner and take advantage of the full
computation power of machines Java is no
exception so Java will die you know one
day or another so the new sheriff in
town right the solution is actually
something that nobody cared about you
know that was there forever in academia
now we actually had to redirect from the
Hades and you know dust off these
functional programming languages like
Lisp and Haskell that you did some kind
of programming assignment in college and
you really hated it so much and you said
I will never
deal with this again all right they're
back big time all right so um the
difference here is that the relevant
functions don't have any side effects
and there is no snow state there to
manage there are no variables it's a
completely different paradigms probably
out of the scope of this discussion but
then what happened to its Java overs ja
vol you know me I just said the Java is
dead but um what's interesting is that
it's really important to make the
distinction between Java the language
and Java the platform right it's all
these movement that talks about all
these people talk about making
functional job on all these libraries
like lambda J and you know adding all
these things all these features like you
know closures to Java which by the way I
think it's the greatest thing I've been
waiting for that thing for years finally
coming up and in a month or so ah but
that's like putting lipstick on a pig
this is Java the language right there so
it's only a matter of time that it's
just going to go away and I personally
believe that actually doing functional
Java is you're working against the
paradigm and you just can make your life
extremely difficult and as you are
trying to use a language you know in a
way that it wasn't intended to be used
as but Java the platform the JVM is
completely different these two has been
evolving towards separate faith
independently from each other away from
each other in the past maybe may at
least more than six or seven years and
with the goal that they want to provide
first class support for all these
functional programming languages or
dynamic programming languages that have
dynamic typing like Ruby and such and it
really a good job in this project called
The Da Vinci projects jets our 2 2009 it
it really a really good job in it to the
point that a lot of these languages
perform better on the Java Virtual
Machine on the JVM then actually on
there
native runtimes taking advantage of the
many many years and the many under and
all that great work that was done you
know to improve the jet and to work on
and to improve the JVM as a whole martin
fowler who needs no introduction says
the legacy of java would be the platform
that the language i'm not sure about the
context of this quote maybe he means
that something that would look like the
JVM or like there would be that would
replace said i'm not sure if you
actually meant that the JVM is going to
true to survive the language but when it
is very much very much right i recommend
reading it for java that next series on
developerworks and there is the link to
it is right there it's it's it's a great
and I think he's got maybe four or five
articles already there highly recommend
meeting those so in a nutshell we're
going to end up with the JVM without
Java the language right so that's so bad
at least the JVM is going to make it and
stay there so I turned out to be a lot
more useful than just you know write
once run anywhere now um this is G sorry
just got out of the blue box again some
so now the next section after we
discussed what the impact of the
hardware would be on there on Java want
to talk about the software we're right
are we writing software differently has
it changed in a way that is significant
that would make you know Java more
fitted or less fitted you put things
back in context don't um Java is a
generic programming language and quite
honestly has proven itself to be fitted
and well suited for every every you know
business case so if you use case like
out there for many years desktop Java
you know mobile java or whatever or like
enterprise Java it's been doing it's
been doing really well all right so
especially the success that actually had
initially on the desktop was what was
actually replicated if that's the right
word on the enterprise side where je
became the de facto standard for
enterprise applications you don't
mention the enterprise without actually
without mentioning Java because he
addressed all these need of the most
complex use cases out there because
immature managed to mature a impressive
technology stack and a number of
well-defined defined a pap is through
things like the JCP projects p process
and and such but then um social happened
and when social happened the line
between the enterprise applications
consumer applications is kind of blurred
before consumer applications what's
selling t-shirts online that's it now
you've got people looking for you know
Yelp is 1bobby of those companies they
want the highest rated Moroccan
restaurant within 20 miles of this
building that band they want to know
whether their friends has checked in in
the last 30 days to that particular
restaurant or not to make that decision
so they actually became a lot more
demanding and in certain cases then on
enterprise applications so Java was
ready I mean all that work it just was
made available for for these people but
he had a problem mean java j2ee sucked
it was really me or brittle i mean if
you're one of if you did ETA gb in your
life that's I mean you I'm just going to
look around and look at your face and
then kind of figure out whether you did
it or not because you're supposed to
just do this you know by then what
happened is um while other platforms
continue to actually struggle Java you
know how they continue to thrive and
then um you know be changed
in a way and then you know that the true
that actually allowed it to make to make
it a lot more accessible make it more
appealing with the release of Java EE
that is a lot more lightweight and that
is has a more of a focus on developer
productivity a lot of frameworks and
interfaces actually helped shape this
change one of them in such like the
spring framework and such that actually
all the rest of actually in fact all of
these frameworks that are and you know
kind of a POJO based more towards like a
more simplistic more more accessible
sets of api's in ways of doing things
leveraging things like meta programming
and such and then Bob went a lot of
things from different frameworks out
there you know convention over
configuration and all of these things I
mean that's a different topic but again
and then cloud computing and the
emergence of paths happened I mean is to
be really hard because these if you want
to buy a weblogic server or we want to
you know but you need to deploy this job
application you need to pay for the
license you need something that has an
8gb container and you need to set it up
and it was a mess with a lot of work
quite frankly and right now we have you
know elastic Beanstalk you will have
jelastic when you actually go and
compile your war file and you're just go
and you know drop it you know just like
upload it to a particular website you're
up and running so I made it a lot more
accessible to all of these people if you
wondering about this thing it just means
the study of clouds sorry I had to put
it for anyways it's good news for java
on the server side java is actually more
fitted to solve problems on the server
science right um the mobile space how
many android developers developers are
here i'll piss you off all right
we're there the mobile space was very
fragmented I was terrible constrained by
you know hardware scarce data
connectivity and the only thing the only
technology the technology that was doing
anything about it was j2me you had all
these would define profiles knew
everything was quite successful um if
you've ever played snake in your life
that's probably written in Java but what
happened is and he did it was doing
really well who's doing really well for
itself and unified all what happened is
there was this explosion of smarter
innovative devices and it was never like
a Java phone I've been out there and
what happened he's cut j2me got spread
so thin and really failed miserably to
kind of you know amount to anything it's
just like too hard you have people doing
different things bringing in new
hardware components and Java was like
lagging behind trying to do something
that works for everybody but it's just
not the case it also was impossible then
sun microsystems decided to do something
about in the 2007 they actually released
the early java for FX version to solve
the wrong problem to do the exact same
thing j2me did they're trying to support
everybody and support that unify new
unified program in a programming model
and it just failed just as much current
javafx is a little different but i'm
still not a big fan i think this is like
one of the earliest javafx levels i
could find online android android came
in a very critical time it came in as
any filled this void left by this j2me
this faith j2me and failed early javafx
and gave java and much much much needed
needed jolt introduced it to a wider
audience right in mobile applications or
like games for mobile mobile phone
phones was a good thing java's all the
sudden cool again it's not only for
people that work for like Oracle and IBM
anymore but how many people think that
android is the best thing that happened
to Java is one a brave one hey y'all
that's very how many people think that
Android is a good thing quite a lot of
you right all right this look at Android
um so annoyed is actually these java
classes as a lot of you guys are
familiar with judging by the hands that
were raised our java class is compiled
into a binary that is nothing like the
bytecode all right it's executed in this
vm dalvik that is nothing like the
scanned of JVM in fact it's actually
architectural architectural II I'm
different and a lot of the Java standard
class libraries I'm not fully supported
or they're implemented in such a way
that that is counterintuitive to the
java SE developer so back in the days
you should just do this out nothing
happens or then i think they fixed it
and it started login stuff now they tell
you you look at and whatever it is i
might be by the way feel free to call me
because I'm not a I am NOT a an Android
developer so I could be very much very
much wrong in this last statement is it
still the case oh my god come on eh be
escorted out oh never speak at this
group I pissed off the organizers right
okay oh my god all right I take that
last piece back or you know I'd piss and
even even more in fact i think android
is the wolf in sheep clothing I think
android is not good for java in a long
term I think android got it out the soul
of Java judging but you would just talk
that Java is the language is just going
to go away and what we're going to be
left with is the actual JVM is the
platform davek actually not that Vicki
mean Android chooses belviq over that
and all it uses so users from Java is
the syntax right so Google made a very
smart decision which is to actually free
load in on the most programming language
out there something that is mature
there's a lot of tools
and I was a big community and has a lot
of good well told people hey guys here
is Java and on mobile phones but it's
not the case right um I think they only
did it because nobody gave you know you
know nobody gave a rat about their goal
or like what were these languages they
try to like come up where they couldn't
get any traction so they made the smart
decision of saying a you can write Java
Java instead so I think it's really
hurts Java a lot on the mobile space in
the sense that on that it actually you
know diminishes the role of the platform
so but just to be fair to these people
how much choice did they actually have
it's not like Java was like doing great
on the mobile space then it's not like
javafx was doing really well so blame it
on sun mean of just doing doing doing
doing what works ok I'm ok iOS oh how
many people love objective c you like
subjective see back there all right how
many people would write a line a single
line of objective-c if we had no iphones
oh my god
oh you're one of those old-timers I'm
gonna piss off another person I think
it's the worst ugliest possible
programming language in existence I
spent this weekend and they regret
spending it you know right in this
little small you know whoever it is yeah
yeah I totally prefer see yes but oh man
all you gotta do is just pick up any
book any event the book and open it and
try to read a method name hi it starts
it starts from page 7 and continues to
page eight and that's just like that's
the constructor call for your repair
anyways again I told you I'm biased and
opinionated so please don't get offended
so anyways but Apple can't do no wrong
quite honestly the platform is so we're
done the hardware is so beautiful that
people are like actually willing to sit
down and then take there and then use
that programming language to write these
amazing application and there is no
debate right here that they are the most
successful mobile platform that we have
right now fabia is no jotnar there is no
JVM on iOS they won't do it and they
won't let third-party it's like porting
you know flat out and they have really
good reasons they keep a tight lid on
their platform and they really want to
actually use and support languages that
they actually have control over and it
worked out really well for them from
their policies on the apple store to
control quality for the you know visit
me and taking into considerations all
these problems these like patent wars
and lawsuits in wherever it is so they
just say alright we've got objective-c
we just got to do with it alright we're
not going to take any risks out there
but it's actually a workaround which is
to ship actual the JVM with the app now
so James Gosselin suggested that the new
who that this new chip which is a jdk
178 JD Kane enhancement azmuth proposal
would actually allow us to actually ship
the runtime the native app code and the
Java code in a single binary without the
need of shared libraries you can
actually go and ship the JVM you know
with yet and that there's a link I think
to that article and it's it's it's quite
rich the recent this may be a few months
and months ago that interview in
computer in computer word but not so
fast I mean I got really excited and
they started looking into this but there
are a lot of concerns the first of them
is the size of the finest ship a ball
shape AG lab who would be very big on
and but I said all right mean maybe this
is a problem that's not gonna you know
be like that forever we have been
looking we have been waiting for many
many years right now for project jigsaw
which is jsr 337 but still dragon which
would allow us to actually go and
without the modules of the JVM that we
don't actually need and then trim it
down to the very minimal run time that
we actually depend on all right um but
um this thing is still dragging what we
said all right I meaning it will
eventually get fixed for you know some
some time and the other concern is
Apple's App Store's terms and conditions
that clearly state that they are subject
to change at any time all right I'll be
surprised if they even allow these type
of applications in the store to begin
with but I won't be shot if one day wake
up in the morning they tell you all
right you know you can't with a boot all
every single java application out of out
of this store and if I were them and we
do just just that uh but the real
challenge was not that the real
challenge actually is to write apps of
comparable quality to native iOS apps
right so javafx the new javafx is the
flagship mobile technology that Oracle
has these days we need actually to
provide support for controls and look
and feel that is consistent with their
apples guidelines that they're very
strict about that and they need actually
to support or provide API you
support apple hardware right nobody
knows what the new hardware of the
iphone looks like until the day they
launch so you know eventually it's going
to take some times for new API is to
come about know whatever it is to take
advantage of the new hardware but if
you're a lazy java developer like me you
willing to wait you mean it's not like
can it be the end of the world but the
value that javafx actually brings in
these days is there are like one of
those technologies that have outstanding
performance in handling video and
graphics and animation and all of these
things arguably something that is even
superior to what the iOS the iOS SDK
provides but according to Gosselin the
jet code generator would have to be
turned off right so this means is you're
better off using phonegap like
technologies you know right in
JavaScript and html5 and that stuff
would eventually get confined into
native code you get much much better
compared much better performance because
this piece is pretty important so Duke
is thinking that the state of mobile
java is very concerning all right and
the biggest fear is that we'll find
ourselves one day where Java is just not
a player in the in the mobile in the
mobile space like at all one day that
you know and that Google will just drop
it altogether or drop it gradually and
say a you guys maybe should start using
dart instead and maintain dart or like
make make features in dark you know
make it just like graduate like a richer
richer platform makes little small
changes or small api's available on dark
and then having black for java and then
is out the DD transition anyways the
elephants in the room right so we looked
at the hardware change and its impact of
Java we looked at looked at the software
change and its impact of Java we're
obviously writing how is it software
differently in some in the mobile space
it's not so good but in the enterprise
during the price page space it's them
it's even better the hardware you know
literally is an indication that what
we're going to be left with is a JVM but
there are other factors that are a part
of the environment which is like
security concerns and I mean maybe like
around March or April or whatever it is
you just going about all these blocks
disable Java you know Java is dead
there's a lot of security problems
whoever it is but we knew ye ality is
that you know every single technology
has security problems and then we end up
releasing patches Nui fix those to
create a security problems and exploits
right one of these exploits if you are
curious was simply that most of them by
the way only affected the Java browser
plugin most of them so people who are
using server side java are not you know
that affected but it was things like you
know with that the new newest version
was allowing the allowing and allowing
malicious code to disable the security
manager reflectively which you know
gives that code you know freedom to do
whatever the hell they want and but the
problem right there is that people just
don't update by March 25th 2013 only 5.5
percent of browsers were running
actually the patch version of Java the
rest you know run in this version that
still have these these exploits and it
was really a concern but it's really
important not to simply just say it's
Oracle's fall so it's Javas fault knees
p
will suck all right is to actually draw
the line of responsibility when these
problems happened Oracle just to be fair
to them did a really good job of
actually releasing patches like shortly
after and making making these updates
available but people were just not
updating I mean you get these pop-up do
you want to keep the JVM updated and you
just like this a minute you know like
every other user this is on one end
right it clears out kind of like takes a
little bit of the responsibility of
Oracle's schroeder but most of it is
like on the developer all right um I
really believe that if you are depending
on our run time it is the real
responsibility to ensure that your
application is executing within the
correct version of that runtime or like
a required version that it is the
responsibility of a developer to
actually make that chick you know at the
before you know you start off your
application and say a are you you need
to update your Java and whatever it
isn't kind of reminding one way or like
one way one way one way or another that
on one end on I bought most of peoples
of us actually don't and unfortunately
and that has to be built or like done
early on but quite honestly if you are
still writing Java applets in 2013's the
chicken have come home to roost hi truce
thank you all right truth hi so uh yeah
so on maybe you should consider
delivering um software otherwise a lot
of us don't have this luxury of this
choice but it's just the better way of
doing it that way you ensure that people
have the versions that you need them to
have all right ah not a one of those
cute words had to look up just sound
smart it's just tightens war so the
Titans war Oracle America versus Google
um nobody was surprised in fact when the
acquisition of Sun Microsystems happens
everybody freaked out because son was
this company that was really known for
supporting open source projects and
supporting the community and wore
clothes really known as this money
grabbing company that would charge you
for like the smallest thing a lot of
money all right so we were very
concerned but um you know it's
throughout the years they have been
supporting the community but doing
actually a tremendous job supporting the
Java users group you know keeping the
communication open with with the
community and involve in the community
and so there's there's there is nothing
to say on that so I'm like one can only
like comment that and and appreciate it
but then you wake up one morning and
they're suing google / / / Oracle Java
is an open-source programming language
thanks to Sun because I believe like a
lot of other people that have funded an
open source that I highly doubt that
actually Oracle would actually do that
actually open source it but what happens
is that these api is right there that
actually looked at the android platform
that there when they said oh you guys
are using the Java API so we're going to
sue you over it because we own that and
that wasn't a part of the Java language
we're going to sue you
over it because we owned this stuff
right so um they lost and there was a
big relief and the argument of the judge
was that the Java API is of non
copyrightable because they are
functional in nature and they are
required by others to use the Java
language all you're going to be left
with is four loops and if statements
that's what Oracle things and if you
were to call you know the swing API if
you're still writing swings wherever it
is they want to charge you for that so
thankfully they lost that case all right
so shameless plug I'm just gonna write
your review in the article to end this
sir to end that you end this talk all
right first one was kind of a pest
because I had to disclose why where the
presentation was based on but this is
how I ended that article that truly that
this is one of those questions that is
better ask to a palm reader in the old
suks of Marrakech or a gypsy fortune
teller in the streets of Seoul EP I
can't say so leaping over Stolypin over
right and now you can spend your time
reading into the visible acceleration of
vapor rising from that steamy cup of
java asking yourself is it really as
hard as it seems to be or is the
temperature of the wrong room just too
low I say take a sip before it gets too
cold to drink when all the vapor there
is to be is diffused through the air we
all know it's been there long enough not
to burn your tongue in a couple of days
I think and they'll be available on
thursday you could read the whole thing
but actually this presentation has like
maybe a few small sections that are not
in them that are not in the article
lastly any comments are any questions or
any yet yeah certainly certainly I mean
we don't the comment was that you don't
really want to know what the hardware
looks like and the gentleman mentions
mentioned a lot of them a lot of
technologies right there the
and you know being a research right now
that would replace the silicon chip
right but my comment to that one is like
Donald DS is commercially available yet
and you can only a kind of predict you
know so much that's why I don't like all
these predictive models all of these
things because they base it on
historical data and they assume that
nothing is going to change that is just
going to change things are going to stay
the way it is but I mean you could only
mean me again palm readers what I mean
them my understanding of samsung all
samsung phones are run android i am not
aware do they have like any other
operating system then they do their have
an operating system okay okay well I'm
no mobile expert I'm just pretending
those slides and just decided it let me
hate on the Android for like a little
bit because I'm I actually a back-end
developer I don't have a question for an
answer for that quite honestly I'm going
to be honest with you I'm not familiar
with the operating system that Samsung
has I mean that's actually needs to me
so um thank you so anyways I know all of
you guys I tricked you into actually
waiting for the end the only question I
said that it was going to answer which
is why do java programmers wear glasses
because they all see sure don't hate me
I warned you about the cheesy humor at
the beginning of the talk all right
I wish so again thank you very much for
sitting through this talk those of you
who drag their girlfriend tonight you
know I made her sit through all this a
yo lot you know and I really appreciate
it and it would very much appreciate
your comments on speakers speakers score
calm / hfsf jug dash future of java
positive or negative please because i
would only help me improve this talk and
if you saw anything that I said that
it's not accurate please help me out you
already pointed out the roost and
finches they will like fix them there
