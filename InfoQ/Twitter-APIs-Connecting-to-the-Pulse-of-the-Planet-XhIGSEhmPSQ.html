raise of hands how many people here
might actually use Twitter a couple cool
awesome we have work to do to get all of
you but before that happens before we
get started if you could tweet your
favorite song to add our Choi our Choi
that's me and it's part of the demo as
I'm talking rambling feel free to just
think I don't want to listen this guy
I'll just tweet a song title to add our
Choi and please keep it clean please
keep it classy so what I'm here to talk
about is connecting to the pulse of the
planet from the Twitter perspective or
before i get started actually a little
bit about myself this is me my sister
and my two kids i graduated from UC
Berkeley computer science and 2000 great
computer science program I was an early
engineer at salesforce.com had built the
API is that was a phenomenal experience
was therefore a great eight years really
got a chance to learn how to build
scalable software systems at some point
or another I decided that it was time to
go back to school that was 12 years
later or 10 years later so I went back
to business school it was an interesting
compliment i'm happy to talk to anyone
who is considering business school or
seeing how business and technology kind
of work together i met my co-founder for
a startup called style up and we got
into y combinator that was a great
experience to be in your Paul Graham
Gary tan and all these luminaries that
you hear about and they really are as
smart as you here so that was an amazing
experience and lastly I'm now a
developer advocate at Twitter of many
things that I've done that I've enjoyed
this is one of my favorite jobs never
had a ton of fun I get to speak I get to
show what people are doing with cool
cool things on Twitter hopefully I'll
share some things with you and just as a
plug we are hiring so if you're
interested want to work in the city feel
free to meet me afterwards so when I
when I go out on the occasions that I'm
actually fortunate to go out and talk to
people I normally hear three questions
number one is why should I build into
Twitter you know I love talking to
engineers and and i think that there's
so many things that you can do on social
media people want to know why twitter
and you know how can it help the next
thing is
how do I build into Twitter well great
now that maybe I've given a couple of
examples how would I do that and i want
to show some examples of that so that's
the third point of just showing other
great examples that we've built as well
as that have been out in the wild and
hopefully those will inspire you to pick
up some of our tools some of our open
source libraries on github and start
poking around so the first question of
why build into Twitter and if you are
having a conversation hashtag you know
open web camp 6 Twitter first off
enables global distribution and that can
mean one of two things if you are an app
developer or if you're a web developer
and you've built this awesome thing you
can use twitter to get distribution to
get people to see it and if you're a
publisher you can use twitter to to get
your content distributed it you know
viral content great content gets shared
widely and that's what people love and
that's what they retweet and that's what
they they they want to talk about so you
know different people have different
examples of what great content is just
three examples right here a lot of
people love Twitter for sports and so
the NFL shares live video clips as they
happen or right after they happen and
they get a ton of distribution people
love watching the video clip and then
having the conversation about it on
Twitter people love selfies selfies are
thing now and here's a selfie with the
Pope and so it's not just these brands
that are going out there and sending
their message it's individuals having
their experiences their voice
distributed on our platform and news
distribution this was a photo from the
the unfortunate crash at SFO it was
actually taken by a man who was on the
flight got out took a picture and then
soon after this is not just the
conversation this is actually all the
places where that image and that tweet
were syndicated so you'll see that you
know some of the major news sources
actually had this as the key piece the
the keynote of the story add to that
that that image that story got then
distributed on television got
distributed on lots of different
channels and so this event was breaking
on Twitter
spread throughout the world one
interesting note that i like to use for
this particular example is havin reviews
the social media application path a few
of you so twitter facebook larger groups
path their premises that it's a smaller
social network but you can share to the
larger social networks this guy this man
david was actually using path at that
time and he clicked on the photo wrote a
little message sent it out to his social
network and shared it on twitter and so
through this integration this
application was able to get a ton of
distribution and kind of downloads
because it got visibility because it was
a great story being told so from where
we stand on the developer advocacy you
know promoting the api is we want people
to bring great content into twitter and
to do what we can to help it get great
distribution to lots of people because
they're amazing stories amazing
applications that people want to see and
want to hear about other reasons that
that people like integrating into
twitter we're growing in terms of our
user base at this point this might be a
little outdated but 230 million active
users 500 I think 550 tweets on a daily
basis and seventy-seven percent of the
users are actually outside of the United
States and so we get a ton of
distribution globally and we're super
excited about being able to have the
conversation not just be local not just
be where you are but just around the
world the things that you interest or
you're interested in the things that you
follow can be anywhere and we're pretty
happy about that that leads into how we
see as developers but just as people who
are people who love and work at Twitter
its Twitter is the shortest distance
between your users and their interests
so if you're building an app if you're
building a product if you're building
anything that requires greater
distribution there's a built-in nature
of Twitter where there's all these
conversations happening and you're
plugging into that so if you like movies
and you like television right there's a
conversation happening around the Oscars
and the selfie that took down Twitter
but just had a tremendous amount of
popularity and tremendous amount of
distribution
if you like science NASA has an amazing
twitter handle where they shave photos
that are literally breaking to the world
or to human eyes and are breaking on
Twitter that just get a ton of
distribution because it's great content
again and a great distribution great
channel for spreading your word out
LeBron James a little time Leigh but he
had this tweet which was I'm not MJ I'm
LJ and now he used clear on 37,000
favorites you know a hundred thousand
basically engagements and Counting but
this is his own voice and him
interacting with the stands and if
you're a fan or if you're even a hater
you'll follow the Brawn James to see
what he's saying to see what that
conversation is about and if you are
into finance and you like you want the
best new hottest tips on on how to trade
how to invest this is Drake saying hey
the first million is the hardest you
know kind of being great and then t
boone Pickens who's actually a
billionaire replying to him you know
saying actually the first billion is a
hell of a lot harder and so this is a
conversation this is what actually
happens on Twitter and we're just we're
amazed to see how these conversations go
where people step up where people step
down and Drake said you know t boone
Pickens you just dump it on me heavy so
these things are happening these are the
conversations that are happening on
Twitter and you know by building apps by
building publications by reaching out to
these people you're plugging into these
conversations in these groups these
interests that already exist lastly here
Twitter one of the things that we pride
ourselves on is being open in real time
you know we feel that it's essential
that everyone's voice get heard everyone
gets distribution and the greatest the
best content is the one that you know
people share and that it is absolutely
real time right it is the platform of
now the platform what's happening both
developers and both from users you get
to see how news are unfolding as they
unfold and as they get distributed one
of the visualizations that we have
around our office if you're around the
office feel free to do
give me a message and happy to have you
over we we visualized using vine least
in this case we have these large screens
where we actually show tweets happening
in real time around the world so there's
Asia there's America and it's just it's
it's humbling to be there and just to
see these conversations happening and
thinking we know what can we do to help
get people's voices distributed and
spread in line with that we've had other
companies do visualizations or analysis
of conversations that are happening on
Twitter because they're open because you
can see who's following who because you
can see the interconnectedness of people
they did a this company election nista
did a map of the various countries in
the Middle East and how they were
connected both in terms of conversations
as well as followers and so here in the
top left you'll see Lebanon Jordan Qatar
Kuwait the circles are actually the
influencers the key people who speak and
the lines are actually how they're
having conversations or how they're
being followed and so there's this whole
conversation that's happening with
anything that's happening whether it's
start up to politics or so forth and
Twitter Twitter's mapping those things
maybe we're not ourselves mapping them
but there's certainly other companies
who are looking at that information and
seeing how these conversations are
unfolding and how these influencers are
happening to shape events so people ask
why building Twitter we feel that the
the key things are just distribution at
real time global scale connecting users
to their interest regardless of whether
or not you're promoting your local shop
or your ESPN trying to get content
distributed and the fact that it's open
in real time we feel as an advantage for
for both transparency but for for making
sure that your voice is heard and you're
getting the latest information at any
given point so hopefully those are some
interesting reasons that you might want
to twit up to build into Twitter and
then the question is well how do I build
into Twitter and so we'll share some
examples but for that we have some cards
out in the back that we're willing to
share we have streaming api's which you
can basically if your developer latch
onto and yet tons and tons and tons of
tweets streamed at you and do whatever
you want with them
we have the rest api so you can do more
transactional things like we had that
path example click a button post a post
a photo post a comment to twitter we
have twitter cards so at the very
beginning of the presentation we showed
the videos of the NFL showing video
clips on Twitter and Twitter cards
enable that distribution for Twitter's
platform we do a bunch of stuff in open
source which some people familiar with
has anybody here used Twitter bootstrap
show of hands do you guys like it it's
okay it's cool yeah cool I'm a hack so I
you know when someone can make something
that's visually beautiful or good enough
that I can run with I love it but we
have a bunch of other open source
libraries you guys should also check out
we have made those things to help scale
that we have open sourced and other
fortune 500 companies are actually using
and you can just go to Tico / app store
apps twitter com to get started to
create your first app you'll get auth
tokens and so forth and you'll be able
to plug right into Twitter to give a
little background of what you'll expect
when you plug into Twitter this is one
of the first tweets Jack Dorsey are our
founder send out the simple message just
setting up my Twitter 140 characters
people look at this and they say hmm
that's interesting kinda sorta what can
I do with that we think any individual
tweet certainly has a lot of reach if
it's an amazing Twitter if it's amazing
content or if it's someone's voice but
it actually is 140 characters with four
kilobytes of information and so when
you're looking at this tweet you may
just see text what you actually have is
location associations for your tweeting
to who've applied responses popularity
tweets retweets and so there's a whole
set of information four kilobytes at
scale at 550 million a day certainly a
ton of data to work with it may not be
the most it may not be the precise
information that a lot of people use but
when you start adding language
processing analytics on those kinds of
things you can start getting sentiment
you can start seeing how people are
feeling about things what they're
watching what they're not watching you
know you can get a pretty good sense of
what's going
on actually in the world the first time
i heard that working at twitter i was
like come on really but we actually have
one of the largest corpuses of human
thought with 550 million tweets I
believe they say it'll take like 13
years to read just you know if it were a
book so there's a ton of information
it's a ton of people expressing amazing
things on Twitter you can get that
individually through our REST API is
transactional or you can get the stream
and so if you were to take those tweets
and just put them back to back to back
to back to back that's what you get and
that's just a little piece of it so
building into twitter is actually as
simple as doing a post to this is our
filter api you might specify on the URL
parameters who I follow what you're
tracking open web camp and you can even
specify locations and you can get a
stream that's specific to that area or
to that filter you can get a stream that
is the sample stream which is one
percent of the fire hose a lot of people
come and they say hey I want all the
tweets I want everything just give me at
all at 550 million in a day I promise
you you do not want all of them I've
tried even with the one percent and it's
a lot to take in and there's a lot of
data start using that start playing run
with that start collecting that data and
doing analysis on that as your need
grows feel free to reach out to us we're
happy to like work with you but trust me
one percent of 550 is plenty and it is
statistically relevant again there's
like a good enough sample set where
you're looking at a good chunk of data
with what people are saying and then we
also have the all the fire hose which we
mentioned and so just as an example
again there was some amazing talks
already that that i'm not going to
one-up by any means but just to get an
idea of how easy it is to build into
twitter we have to get started
we have github account at Twitter dev so
you just go to github com Twitter dev we
have a number of we have a number of
code bases but the one that is pretty
popular or that we we kind of like is
the Ruby example that we have uses the
fire hose or the sample stream so you
just go here you click on here you know
you guys just do a git clone you can get
everything you need yep get everything
you need as we mentioned before you
create an application so you go to apps
twitter com you create application
details description in doing so you'll
get your auth tokens so get your
whatever you need to connect the Twitter
and with just a little bit of code in
this particular example right here you
would put your tokens which is just a
simple yamo file there's actually two
examples so I have a bit of a messy
playbook here we've done the pretty
simple example a guy named Andrew who
just hooked us up with Wegg sockets you
can take a look at the code that we have
here listens to web stock to listen to
just all these tweets coming through it
handles them we've integrated with
Google Maps it's almost like the first
thing that people do and we're just
trying to make it super simple to be the
first help you do the first thing that
people do and you get a fairly simple
streaming example right and this one
shows the tweets happening on the left
hand side it shows them being located
all over and then as you change the
location it will actually change the
filter and you know just show the tweets
in that area so you're getting that
stream based on just a certain area it's
pretty amazing when you start looking at
it you start diving and you're like
these are actual people in these actual
places actually talking about things
right now sounds a little sounds a
little weird but as you zoom out again
you just start seeing the scale at which
you're operating and this is actually
throttled a bit as well because it's a
pretty simple example you can actually
go to Twitter dev demo calm / maps inst
where it's hosted we just have some
these examples out there but
you get a scale of like yes this could
actually be the body of thought of
people in an area or potentially in the
world if you were to be so so bold we're
happy that Monica and Sophia and Rachel
and Penny and everyone is talking about
and using Twitter so that's one example
and then not to jump around too much but
just to show a couple of other examples
that we particularly love with brands
and with you know our own code here's an
example of a company called bluefin that
was actually acquired by Twitter because
the amazing things they were doing with
Twitter data at scale there is a talk
track you probably can hear it's might
have to just mute it great so we all
know that you know Twitter and sports
they they go pretty well together here
is the Super Bowl and this is a
visualization of all the tweets
happening during the Super Bowl time
indexed and so this is the conversation
13.4 million people talking about the
Super Bowl on Twitter and bluefin we're
actually and time sequence important
events in the superbowl including the
halftime and you can see that little
piece about commercials and saw who was
talking about which commercials what
were the most popular plays and what was
going on right so they've overlaid all
this information but the key thing being
that if you have the conversation that's
happening real-time about a TV event and
more specifically about commercials you
can imagine that broadcasters who you
know who's watching not too sure well
again a statistically relevant sample of
the population is on Twitter and so when
that conversation is happening we can
reliably say this percentage of the US
or even the world is watching this show
at this time as is happening so those
are the kinds of things that blue film
has been doing and you can imagine there
are other companies that are taking this
to different verticals or different use
cases so we're super excited about you
know the possibilities that you can do
with the data and the creativity that
could be you know unleashed if you will
there's also this thing that starbucks
does called tweet of coffees anybody
heard of this at all one person so thank
you it's actually pretty straightforward
you can go onto Twitter and this is me
doing it you just say acts tweet of
coffee to Brian bloom this person I did
it back then but this was my willing
participant thanks for having me at info
Berkeley with the event and then down
below who replies starbucks does
consider blog says hey Brian Ryan just
tweeted you a coffee click on this link
and literally when you click on the link
and you do a quick Oh auth you have five
dollars in your account did it work I
hope it would go for the Starbucks app
okay I'll talk to them about that fair
enough fair enough if anybody else wants
a coffee I'm happy to meet you out back
and give you a coffee if you want to
give all your information starbucks
they're buying the information they
actually don't do a ton with that
information they actually just see this
is just a very natural marketing use
case and and to to effectively have the
conversation have starbucks through the
conversation in a very natural way one
of the things that we do in developer
advocacy is we try to show or we try to
help develop we try to help developers
and brands bring their voice to twitter
in a way that makes real sense on
twitter and so certainly you could take
content and you could broadcast it you
can have the ads which do work and do
have click through but this was
something that was very natural on
twitter and just kept the conversation
going in an evergreen conversation it
launched more than a year ago when
people are still doing it and you know
yes starbucks has this continual
conversation about their brand out there
great marketing but it actually you know
drives revenue so feel free to use it
sometime with maybe a friend who who
loves starbucks nardi has the the app
installed and give a shot so i asked you
guys to also to tweet at me a song we'll
figure out what songs you tweeted it me
right now i'm crossing my fingers
let's see here and so let's see here the
next episode by dr.dre done by maybe not
that one will do this one block with the
jungle de la soul I know so effectively
what this is doing is this is so
effectively what this is doing is this
is this is this is just a quick
integration that we did because we got
invited to the the the Spotify hackathon
and so we put this together really
quickly it was actually a music
hackathon in San Francisco wasn't just
the Spotify hackathon and we were able
to work with a lot of the the music
companies there beats was one of them
they wanted to launch this new web-based
audio player and so and so we did really
quick integration where you login via
Twitter you log in via beats and you let
people just tweet you and it creates a
playlist so the thinking was that this
actually was playing in the background
to be launched before the before the
hackathon itself to let people have
music going on in the backgrounds I've
also used this for a couple of bbqs and
whatnot with friends and and we're just
trying to show that like there are a lot
of interesting things that you can do on
Twitter and give people both ideas as
well as sample code I'm happy to show
you where this is it's under my own
personal github account but super simple
to do took a couple days to put it
together an interesting use case of
Twitter is a communication channel
other crazy things that our team kind of
goes out there and does and and we think
are cool with devices so this is one bar
developer out with my peers remain you
it in the UK he is fascinated with
drones and so i wish i could give this
talk this would be amazing but he takes
a drone he sets it on a table he tweets
at it and it flies he's taken Raspberry
Pi kind of connected that together and
I've seen it once and I was just like
whoa bow down just amazing and then he
runs into the crowd and he takes a
picture of himself by tweeting you know
take a picture takes a snap and then
post it to Twitter so of a romance you
can show you but these are all things
that you can do with the API they're
actually on our github account he's got
the it's called node copter he's got the
libraries for flying the node with the
api's for the Twitter and I think even
the raspberry pi stuff so if anyone is
interested I'm happy to show you or
learn sit down and learn with you and
figure out how we could go build this
together so hopefully I've given
examples of of you know kind of what the
Twitter API is able to do maybe even
inspired you a little bit of you know
why you use the API for distribution for
bringing great content or for tapping
into the conversations that are having
on Twitter and there's a bunch of code
out there to just get started I'm here
to help Twitter dev our entire developer
advocacy team is here to help you can
google twitter api libraries and learn a
lot a lot of things again we have cards
out there in the back and just feel free
to tweet me at our toy i'm happy to chat
with anybody and get you started and you
know see how i can help and that's the
talk questions yes Oh
no charge for the one percent correct so
the question is is there a charge for
the one percent fee there is no charge
you can just get started as it scales up
because it is something of a cost
getting the full feed does have its not
a charge at least some kind of
restrictions but there's some terms
around it but again that one percent you
can get started you can download that
Ruby example and you know get going
immediately other questions how do we oh
great great question so we have a bunch
a number of ways that we make revenue
there's a brands brands use Twitter as a
distribution channel so when they have a
tweet out there when they have content
and they want to broadcast that more
widely you can actually promote a tweet
you can even target tweets to your
target audience so say that just as an
example of NFL wanted to make sure that
that video reach more people they can
proponent it they could targeted age
demographics location and you know get
in front of the right audience we also
have the ability to to to get a lead
generation if you will and so you can
actually take you can actually have a
card that can gauge interest for maybe a
flyer or for news or for information and
then share your email address all in the
open where it says you know you are
doing this and then the brand you know
collects the email address for
distribution list and so forth and then
there's just there's a number of
products like that
yes and and and we encourage people to
start using it kind of the organic sense
and kind of understand what message
resonates with your your audience where
you want to be and to just get started
doesn't cost anything at all you know
create a twitter account go on follow
brands and accounts that you like and
people build relationships I've melt a
ton of people on Twitter before meeting
them in real life and and it's not a
substitute for anything you you go out
there and you're on this platform and
you make connections with people and
that you know that leads into things
with Drake and t boone Pickens going
back and forth on Twitter very
organically other questions yes that's a
good question so the question is what
initiatives do we have to get more
distribution or get more awareness to
the broader population have you seen
some of the stuff that we might have
been doing in the world cup at all
recently cool so we for the World Cup
specifically we had a new user flow
whereby if you are interested in the
world cup it will number one get you to
sign up and then immediately ask you
okay you in the world cup yes what is
your team and by knowing your team we
then suggest players and teams that are
relevant to that area and so you can see
our I wouldn't say focus but one of the
things we're doing is saying around
events around around events or around
things that are more topical bringing
people into a new user experience where
you have the context and you're brought
in immediately following people to
understand what the conversations look
like so the conversation is what is
relationship between Twitter and TV and
how is that how is that is that
initiative the twitter is doing or that
we're bringing with TV we work with a
lot of publishers a lot of broadcasters
and I think part of serendipity and part
is you know how can we partner together
to if you're a broadcaster they want to
make sure that the conversation is
continuing they want to make sure that
are getting distribution so they come to
us and they say hey what things can we
do and we'd love to be a part of the
conversation for many different
verticals and so TV with just being one
of them so I'd say it's more of a you
know coming to the table and saying hey
what awesome things can we do together
more than us pushing under them
pushing it it really comes down to if
people are tweeting about it if people
are talking about television shows Game
of Thrones the Super Bowl World Cup you
know we want we want to be that that
channel for that real-time conversation
and whoever it makes sense to partner
with or whoever comes to us we're happy
to work with them another question back
there what happens to them so we have we
have algorithms in the back so the
question is if you have shady accounts
following you or spamming you or sending
you messages what happens to them so we
actually have a pretty aggressive
algorithms that look at look at those
accounts figure out which ones are
getting a high level of what we call
abuse and they actually get banned or
they get disabled it's it is a matter I
can't talk about the details because I
don't really know the details of how
those algorithms work but I have seen
them the spam team work pretty fast in
some occasions even be a little too
