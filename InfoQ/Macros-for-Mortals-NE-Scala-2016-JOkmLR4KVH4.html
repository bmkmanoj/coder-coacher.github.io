don't know me I don't have spoken at a
lot of conferences and meetup groups and
all these other things over the years
I'm Brenda McAdams these days I am a
consultant at bold radius I do
consulting and training mostly focused
on Scala play acha and all the things
especially from the Scala side whatever
on sky live been learning a little Scala
GS but I'm still very confused I want to
talk about Scala macros for mortals so
this is something where I've been
learning them I'm trying to specifically
do this is he not quite a beginner's
talk and I expect that you guys are
probably going to have to have some
level of skull and how much to know what
I'm doing this talk is entirely Dustin
Whitney's fault I was in I was in New
York in October for you know and he
asked me to speak at a meetup he's like
you should talk on macros like I guess I
have to learn macros but I've improved
this a lot so the original version of
the talk was sort of let's walk through
the documentation and understand for
this version I've written my own macro
and we'll talk about what that macro is
it'll get two different ways to write
that macro there's really two styles you
can use to write macros right now and
we'll see if we understand what's going
on when I'm done if not I apologize but
hopefully we'll get there this is also
how I learned to stop worrying and
mumbling curse words when I go through
this because it can be confusing but we
see them all over the place so the
question first is what are macros and
the reality is the documentation is
pretty good these days I got a lot out
of documentation of just lots and lots
of detail of how they work corner cases
understanding what's going on someone
has been giving a lot of love to the
documentation who deserves you know a
lot of praise because good documentation
is always missing from projects in many
cases and so of course summarize it in
one word because I don't want to read
all that documentation and there's an
awful lot of it and really what it comes
down to is meta programming which is the
Latin for
actually what metaprogramming is is code
that writes code and that's really what
we're doing with macros we are using
code to write other code we can write
new methods that actually expand out to
something that appears as if it's built
into Scala we can write annotation sort
of like we can in Java except they
happen at compile time and not at
runtime which means you get the
performance of as if you've written some
complex thing and can put at compile
time and that part to me is one of the
most compelling because it's something
I've always wanted to sometimes be able
to do is have codegen really good code
Jenner and Scala for things that I've
seen in the past so we write extensions
the skull and it's important to remember
these macros are expanding or evaluating
a compile-time that's what we want from
them the whole point is that we get this
at compile time so we don't have this
huge runtime reflection penalty if we
can avoid it and they may generate new
code so maybe you will have an
annotation or a method that spits out a
whole new tree of code a new class maybe
or evaluate existing codes so you could
do validation which is actually what the
macro I've written for this is is
validation of code without changing the
code that's already there I'm actually
forcing compiler errors if you don't
pass my rules now I'm going to look
briefly at what def macros are we're not
going to write a def macro there's only
so much time but def macros are going to
be written in the same way as we write
annotation macros just they're not
annotations this is an example from
shapeless then I'm going to show very
quickly but these are used to write new
methods and shapeless has ill typed
although miles told me I think someone
else wrote it this is part of shapeless
the idea is what you say is this code
should not compile so you give ill typed
a block of code that you expect not to
compile in this case one plus one cast
to an int compiles and therefore we get
an error and this is an example of a def
macro
or you've written something that's a
function it looks like a new built-in
scala structure Scala test has a version
of this based on ill typed as I recall
bill may correct me on this but I
believe someone told me it's based on
ill typed and that's really cool as well
because you can say should compile or
should not compile and it turns out when
you're writing a validator macro it's
really great to be able to write unit
tests that say this should not compile
an example of macros from annotation
macros here this lets me write
annotations as I said which can be
rewritten or expanded when we compile if
you're familiar with the app tray in
Scala it does not have an attribute of
hello or a member of hello and test
clearly does not have a member hello and
what we've done is we've written
annotation that under the covers rewrote
the object test and added a member
called hello so that when we run our
code at runtime hello is materialized
into this code and that's one example of
what I could do with an annotation and
there's a lot more so I probably should
have started with this but I like to at
least give you an idea of where we're
coming from I am pretty new to macros I
literally as I said I learned these
specifically for a talk that Dustin
Whitney asked me to do I've been
learning more the original talk was
based on the docks now I've written my
own macro I'm trying to avoid the macros
everywhere urge which people fall into
but i want to share knowledge hopefully
from a little more than a beginner's
point of view now but enough that you
can see things from the standard of i am
not a deeply scary sorcerer who
understands this stuff at a fundamental
level i'm fairly you know the idea was
macros for mortals here so we're going
to look at it from fresh profusely
bleeding eyeballs because I'm hoping
that may not be a side effect but I
should warn you that that may be a side
effect of this talk so once upon a time
the only real way we can add compiled
functionality to scala was by writing
compiler plugins and it was esoteric it
was a little hard to ship because you
had to have people add a compiler plug
in the svt happens have a nice ad
compiler plug-in thing but at the same
time you're adding phases that the Scala
compiler you've got to be aware of where
you're plugging into it's a lot harder
to not necessarily mess things up and
there wasn't at the time a lot of good
docs or examples I tried a lot I helped
maintain a compiler plugin years ago
that generated syntax diagrams and it
was really confusing was that had no
real sources other than source code for
how to do this and most importantly you
needed to know the ast the abstract
syntax tree of Scala which you can think
of as really nested classes that
represent a tree to be converted to
bytecode except that's not entirely true
anymore because it might be converted to
JavaScript as well if you've seen Scala
j/s or martin's talks lately martin
talks in terms of targets no longer
being just byte codes and I think that's
really fascinating from a community
standpoint that we've gotten there where
we have different targets for what we're
doing I've done a little bit of compiler
plug-in work as i said the AST can be
really tough to deal with however some
of the tools that we get in in macros
now have my understanding as are
available in compiler plugins as well so
if you really did need a compiler plugin
you could here is a little bit of a
taste to wet our palate on what an AST
might look like and I apologize in
advance I've written a simple class here
with a couple of members and a print
line what this looks like in the ast and
I see miles nodded in the back I don't
know if it's because he knows what's
coming or you can see why maybe writing
the ast code is a little bit complicated
and the benefit is there but it's really
hard to learn all this stuff and
member all this stuff and the common
reaction is jumping out the window in
fact this room is organized really well
for this picture there's even extra
windows so this is where the macro comes
in to hopefully make this easier because
we still have to deal with the ast but
the macro gives us some interesting with
tools to work with this since 210
they've shipped as an experimental
feature you do have to do an import that
says oh yes I'm aware I am enabling this
experimental feature or I believe
there's a compiler flag they've been
adopted fairly quickly I see them all
over the place I each I keep tripping
over them with every library that i use
and usually in good ways people are
doing good things with macros and adding
cool functionality you saw ill typed
before st knowledge can be somewhat
avoided but not entirely there are some
cool tools to generate it for you I'm
going to show two versions of macro one
with an AST and one without with one of
these other tools that we have they make
enhancing scala much much easier than
writing compiler plugins i mean we don't
have to have users add special things we
can have the code go in we can have
things feel natural and i think they're
easier to debug and test because it's a
lot easier to have code that compiles to
a library and then just test that that
library works the way we think it will
you do have to define your macros in a
separate project from your
implementation or your usage if you look
at I put all the source code for my demo
macro up on the web and i'll post the
link to that you'll notice that i have a
macros project and an implementation
project you can't use the macro directly
from within the macro project you have
to have a separate implementation area
and keep that in mind so pale science
we've got fancy stuff with which to work
with now macro paradise is an
interesting piece that bears mentioning
the project is evolving very quickly and
part of it is macros are evolving
quicker than
dala is and so what they've been doing
is adding lots of improvements to macros
and it's a plug-in you can add that
brings new functionality in before it
makes it to scala one of the features
that's currently only in Mac in in macro
paradises annotations so we will use
that and that needs a compiler plugins
so I don't get to avoid compiler plugins
entirely sorry but I didn't have to
write one in order to use it you can
learn more about macro paradise at the
link here i will post my slides up to
speaker deck when i'm done i've already
exported in PDF so i won't forget and
there's a good link that gives an
overview of the purpose of the project
as well as all the docs for macros
themselves what I've written is a macro
for ATT validation unfortunately there
are some bugs in Scala that make it
impossible given the root of an ADT to
walk down all the subclasses which is
what I originally wanted to do but I've
written something that uses an
annotation to expand to a macro at
compile time and it validates that the
root type of your ATT is valid that the
root type of your adt has to either be a
trait or an abstract class and it has to
be sealed these are generally the rules
we follow when we're building an
algebraic data type we you know think of
an option or think of something else
where you have a closed tree that you
know what it looks like I've done this
to start with with AST manipulation just
so we know what it looks like you can
find the code github recommended Supreme
octa cat adventure as the name for my
repository so I made it Supreme macula
venture just feeling a little whimsical
let's look at some chunks real quick of
scala test i'm going to move through
this relatively quickly because of
timing but i'll point out the things
that are hey this is what we need this
is the annotation in action I've
annotated the trait foo with at adt and
said it should not compile because it's
not sealed
just like the second one the second one
is an object an object can't be the root
of ADT it should not compile a sealed
tree should compile or musket ball I
prefer must mattress to matters it
sounds more assertive and a sealed
abstract class should also compile also
if I have type parameters this was a
corner case that I caught last night was
that type parameters weren't being
matched and it was blowing up my matcher
so the validation there is an annotation
that needs to be defined this extends
static annotation and then we have macro
transform which will call the macro the
compile time only make sure we've
enabled macro paradise without the
compile time only scholar will silently
fail to expand the annotation and look
at it at runtime macro paradise make
sure that the annotation disappears at
runtime and so we this gives you an
error if macro paradise is not included
as a compiler plugin and macros
transformants with delegates to the
actual implementation that validates a
quick note on the anatase variable
because it's weird you'll notice that
we're passing in a varargs this is
called once per annotated class the fact
that it has to take a varargs can be
confusing because it's once per class
with an exception if you annotate a
class or a trait that has a companion
you get the object also but if you
annotate an object with a companion you
only get the object daniel spew it gave
me a really lengthy explanation of it
earlier that i can't rer tick you late
sorry there's a good reason why and and
and I it was oh okay it clicked in my
brain but if you get a trait or a class
and a companion object and even if you
whether you rewrite code or do a
validation what you return has
to include a companion object or scholar
will give you this error then you're
trying to expand into something that
doesn't match what it started with no my
code has a rough overview and it's too
small my speaker notes to see it there's
a couple things in closing position is
the point in the code that we're working
with I alias that to pee so that I can
reuse it in my error messages and I'm
confirm mapping Anna teas from an
expression to a tree and then converting
it to a list because varargs I believe
is an array is what you get it as so
we're using it as a list so we can use
the list matters and then I'm doing
result tree and I've left that code out
and so we can look at this if we wanted
to we do have to return something in
this case I really need to return the
original syntax tree I need to return
the code that i started with unless i'm
deleting that code which isn't what I
want to do we could write new code and
generate new code and spit that back out
of this however so we match a tree here
and these are part of the ast class def
represents a class or a tray there's a
couple of arguments mods or flags flags
are things like sealed final case all
the different things that we would
attach to the beginning of a class or a
trade definition name is the name of it
teper a more type parameters imple is
what's known as a template and it really
partly is the body of our code so we're
saying if this is a class def capture
all these variables and then i delegate
because there's a couple places where we
match to another method called validate
class def the second line if you or the
second match is if the list includes a
class def and a module def a module def
is an object and then we look at just an
object def and there's a bunch of other
corner cases that I've left off for
vowels and bars and deaths and other
things but it's valid f and def def and
then for a valid f you've got to check
if it's mutable or not and then there's
some matches here technically I could
fall through if you
a corner case I don't have a default
catcher but i would rather the compiler
throw a match error if you give me
something weird at least to start with
and we can validate our valid
possibilities here by saying you know
the mods mods has to include the flag
trade and I'm sorry if mods is a trade
it has to include the flag sealed or
there's an error what's interesting here
is info normally you don't see info
messages from the compiler but unless
you turn on I think warnings or
deprecation but you can force it to show
so I spit out a message that says sanity
checks okay and it will show you the
line of code that you actually annotated
and on a companion we match and make
sure that we glue this together I forget
who told me how to glue this together I
couldn't figure out how to return
because you have to return a tree you
can't return a list of tree and this was
using Kwazii quotes which we haven't
talked about yet patching together the
class def in the module def to return a
new tree and there's a bunch of other
checks if it's an abstract if it's
sealed for classes otherwise it sanity
checks okay this is the version using
the a the AST it's okay but it's harder
to read it's harder to write potentially
and there's a better way of doing it it
does lead to a little bit of drinking or
a lot of drinking in this case he
doesn't seem to stop now the ast macoris
still are really built with asds but we
have a better way we have better tools
now to work with the first and simplest
reified does help at least understand
what the AST looks like that's what i
used in that first example so peeking at
my first example i did this with reify
tree will replace the reifies expression
with the AST and show raw converts it to
a printable format I find this great to
get inspiration or understanding of the
ast when I'm working on
thing to see if I'm generating code what
it's supposed to look like if I was to
write that code by hand and it makes my
head hurt a little bit but maybe not in
a bad way Kwazii quotes give us more
sanity Kwazii quotes potentially give us
a better way of doing this this
implementation that i'm going to show
you or breeze through my apologies on
the timing the implementation is about
half the number of lines of the other
one now i'm back and forth about whether
i prefer the AST version or the Kwazii
quotes version because purely number of
lines isn't necessarily better and cool
the quasi quotes matters can be a little
confusing but they're powerful there is
not a way to avoid the AST completely
but macros have some improvements to
make it less necessary and Kwazii quotes
have been added in scala to 11 you also
i think can use macro paradise to get
them into 10 they let us write the
equivalent of string interpolation that
evaluates or generates the Scala code
which is awesome and we're going to look
time permitting we should look in at a
quazy quote version it's macro even if
it's at warp speed but first we need a
bunch of imports and I don't think this
bear is going through just keep in mind
there's a whole bunch of imports and you
can always refer to the docs or refer to
my slide but you have to import a bunch
of things for quasi quotes to work the
reflect here is because I was working on
the Scala console rather than working in
the compiler you don't use runtime
reflect within your scala your plugin it
looks like string interpolation but we
put a queue in front of it so here i've
just written a block of code q def echo
blah blah blah and this generates a
nasty def def that generated a def def
for me i wrote out Scala code in a queue
and I got a syntax tree representation
of it now that itself isn't necessarily
terribly useful except maybe if i'm in a
compiler plugin
need to generate a whole new method like
hello I could just do a quazy quote
where it gets interesting is here I've
written an exception which is a more
complex one and you'll see again I get a
class def but I can extract from this to
Kwazii quotes are extractors so i can
say case class dollars cname class named
dotty params that is known as a splice
it dot dot dollar expects an iterable of
tree which means it's totally optional
so if there are no type parameters it'll
still extract okay the parameters that
go with it extends dollar parent that's
actually slightly wrong that should be
dot dot dollar parents so that even if
there's no parents it matches and with
the traits that mix ends and then we get
a bunch of variables we've pulled out
variables for each of these things so we
can completely extract from any class
using Kwazii quotes or death or any
other piece of Scala code we can extract
out from that and the dot dot dollar is
known as a splicing ranked according to
my speaker notes which expects an
interval of tree I think this is pretty
brilliant I was really surprised by how
cool this was when I first worked with
it having written compiler plugins have
you been playing with this it adds some
really interesting stuff to the picture
so my macro if I was to use Kwazii
quotes I can go to a pure match
statement I can get rid of that validate
class death I could do everything in
line with pattern guards as well so we
write a nice clean quote unquote because
if you look at the code you may not
agree with me a nice clean scala
implementation of a pattern match by the
way Kwazii quotes can generate just
about everything the docs have
definitions for just about anything you
would ever need to do in scala including
partial function case statements etc
and they're really well documented on
what the data looks like there's like a
QP for pattern matches and other things
as I said it's nearly half the number of
lines so here is a match of this so I'm
setting mods I'm capturing whatever
flags are at the beginning I could say
dollar sealed but scholar will not allow
me to say dollar sealed dollar abstract
and by the way when you're working with
kwasi quotes in an annotation plugin it
turns the trait into a sealed abstract
rate so mods captures all of those mods
I had before which are the flags and
then the rest of this looks like what we
saw already we get the body and then I
just have a pattern guard that says if
it's sealed great otherwise it falls
through to an error the matcher in the
macro does not understand that we then
an error stops the world the way that an
exception does so I still have to return
that tree element even though it'll
never be returned the class checks are
very similar unfortunately there's a
bitwise or on flags but no bitwise and
which would have been nice to say has
flagged you know sealed and abstract but
I just check if mods has flag sealed and
it has abstract we sanity check okay
otherwise we fall through to an error
and it's a little it this is one of
those examples of looking at the slides
afterwards will probably be helpful to
digest but we're writing code that looks
like code and with kwasi quotes and
we're just doing a pattern match that's
the internals of my macro that's what it
looks like it's made up of this that's
pretty much the entire macro we have
some checks for things like objects and
the companion checks here I didn't care
what the object looked like so I skipped
kwasi quoting my object for a companion
and just said if there's a module death
so yes you can mix AST matches with
Kwazii quote matches if you need to and
i struggled for a little bit to get the
object match to work and couldn't quite
get it so i switch over to module def
when i realized i didn't care and
finally we check again on the class
module deafplus class for the companions
i'm just about on time and i apologize
for running through this so quickly but
i'm happy to answer questions afterwards
as well i'm happy to sit down with
people and show you my code the code is
also all posted and i'll have brian link
it to people or something similar but
generally my reaction has been this all
my bone itís so a couple of closing
thoughts macros are very cool it seems
like once you understand them just a
little bit you want to go reaching for
them you want to go grab them and be
like I want to use this I don't know
what I'm going to use it for but i'm
going to use macros i had that feeling
when i first learned them i had that
feeling that had to fight everything was
i could solve this with macros when all
you have is a hammer everything starts
to look a lot like a thumb and that's
really what you should consider when
you're looking at macros is that not
everything is a thumb sometimes it's a
nail or worse it's a screw and hammering
screws in defeats the purpose of screws
so they can enable great development but
they can also hinder it think about
maintainability if you're an open source
library author i think it's one thing if
you're working on a team of people who
aren't going to understand macros you're
probably not going to want to take a
vacation anytime soon once you write the
macro so keep that in mind and I think
we have a few minutes for questions
katryn
so the question is what my take is on
exceptions when there's errors in my
macros I don't know that there's excu
mean exceptions with exceptions I right
to tell other people so we're talking
about exceptions that the macro system
gives me because I didn't write
something right it the answer is it
depends like anything else with Scala
they seem to have done a pretty good job
of at least giving me some information
about what we're wrong I show that one
esoteric error message that you get when
you don't return companions and
sometimes you've got to go looking stuff
up there's lots of stack overflow
questions about this stuff sometimes the
exceptions are clear sometimes they're
not sometimes you've got warnings and
the docs that it's going to happen but I
wouldn't say that it's a smooth sailing
experience necessarily so I don't know
if everyone can hear that especially in
the camera but the question was what do
we know about the impact of macros on
compile time i would say we're adding
extra code to the compiler so it's
probably going to be slower it depends
upon the complexity of the macro i am in
the camp of i am willing to suffer a
slower compiler if i get faster run time
i may not be normal for that but for me
I mean the macro gives me power and I'm
willing to sacrifice that especially in
the case of a validator of being able to
say I want to validate that this code
looks like something but I think that I
think it's inevitable that we're going
to take compile time hit in performance
so you're asking if there is compile
time performance to tools to understand
that i am not sure actually i have not
come across anything i don't know how
easy it is to debug the performance of
the compiler but that would be general
that wouldn't just be macros i think
that would apply to anything with the
compiler is why is it taking so long to
do something and given the phases of the
compiler i could see that being a
complicated problem so Daniels Buick has
pointed out order of magnitude wise
there's a lot more complicated things
like trait linearization the compiler
could be doing that's going to make the
mac
crow at least my macro drop in the
bucket performance-wise click we have
time for one more question so the
question was the annotation macros of
and marked experimental for a while and
whether I know if that's going to change
in the future the answer is I have no
clue I think they're planning on getting
them into 212 but it could be wrong yeah
so it sounds like the focus on
development is more on skull and better
which doesn't contain def macros or
annotation macros yet and Eugene could
definitely use support and getting that
stuff implemented well I think Brian is
trying to assemble signal to me that we
are done so i will exit stage left and
