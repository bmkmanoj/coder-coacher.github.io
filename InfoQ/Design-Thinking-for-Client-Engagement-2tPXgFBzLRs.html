lights get turned down how many of you
guys are designers most of you okay and
what about project managers and you can
be one you can be both project managers
great and how many of you work with your
clients on like a daily basis okay so
yeah this is you're here at the right
place so I'm Megan Miller's Andy said I
work at Stanford University I'm with the
central web agency at Stanford and we
serve we're having some fun lights here
we serve all sorts of clients around the
university so Stanford is huge there are
I think 15,000 employees at Stanford the
number of employees to student ratio is
extremely high and there's tons of
different offices and departments that
need custom design work custom website
solutions and so our team is located
centrally in Stanford to support all of
those people and their offices at
Stanford so we're a small team but we we
run a tight ship and we also provide
resources for the whole rest of campus
for self-service web resources so I'm
also designing themes templates you know
get your own website kind of things for
everyone at Stanford including students
faculty staff so there's a lot of things
that I'm working with on a daily basis
and today I'm going to share with you
some of my strategies for design
thinking in the way that I work with my
clients and I'm hoping this can kind of
open your minds if it hasn't been opened
already by the concepts of design design
thinking to rethink your design and
discovery process
oh sorry a little delay there so what is
design thinking I'm going to read this
quote because I think this is really
really like this quote just captures it
for me Design Thinking is a human
centered approach to innovation that
draws from the designers toolkit to
integrate the needs of people the
possibilities of technology and the
requirements for business success so
this is from Tim Brown he's the
president and CEO of I do this is the
firm that really pioneered design
thinking in the workplace and as I'm
thinking across the board for all of us
so how can we understand this
methodology and apply it to our client
relations process let's innovate here's
a traditional design process that I bet
a lot of you are really familiar with we
start with discovery we do wireframes oh
that sounds a little better we do design
comps there are a lot of artifacts that
happen during this process that we use
to document the decisions made along the
way and to help us communicate with our
developers and with the client some of
these artifacts are user personas task
flows sitemaps wireframe style tiles
design comps I should be speaking the
language of your subconscious at this
point essentially these are
communication tools they help us
articulate hierarchy structure
aesthetics and user experience they
facilitate decision-making by
translating our clients desires into
tangible representations of the final
product yet sometimes despite our best
intentions our tools can become barriers
to that effective communication that
we're seeking so here's the real truth
most clients don't understand a lot of
these materials that we find so
intuitive the wireframe for example is a
notoriously problematic tool on one hand
it's essential for visualizing layout in
structure but on the other it can
introduce a layer of confusion to the
client especially now and we have
responsive web design
here's how the story usually goes I hand
a client a set of wireframes explained
that their representations of how we
might structure to their site they
respond with a furrowed brow and they
ask is it going to be gray is that the
font that my sites going to use I bet a
lot of you have had this experience we
then spend the next 15 minutes
explaining what a wireframe is why it
looks that way and then they often
default to what we've presented to them
or they seem frustrated and they want to
see another revision so we're not
getting the right kind of feedback from
our clients they get stuck instead of
understanding the purpose of the tool
that we we are using a wire frame to
allow us to envision possible layout
options but when we hand them a PDF or a
piece of paper they just see a PDF or a
piece of paper and they see static
content stuck into boxes and they don't
understand in their head how to move
things around they might not even be
spatially oriented a lot of designers
are very spatially oriented so in your
head you might be able to envision
things there are some people in the
world but aren't that way I mean it's
we're all different right so I think
what I found is a lot of clients are not
necessarily spatially oriented and have
trouble translating what they're seeing
in the wireframe to what could be what's
happening is the wireframe tool is
making it hard for our clients to give
us the feedback we need they're reacting
to the tool itself not just the ideas
that we're presenting them things are
getting lost in translation here our
clients have trouble understanding a lot
of the ways we communicate during the
design process clients don't speak
designer and our artifacts are not self
apparent we think they are because we're
used to them we've been trained to get
used to that type of artifact but they
don't and they don't know how and this
might be their very first website
project so wireframes and other
communication tools are meant to give
substance to our clients priorities
goals and esthetic preferences yet they
don't inherently enable our clients to
provide the editorial direction or to
make those critical decisions
we need them to make so without that
clear direction from the client we can
spend weeks and weeks in revisions
trying to guess what they want here's
what we're really after when we're
working with a client we're not after
wireframes we're not after user personas
that's something we create for us and
for our team and just as an artifact to
solidify the decisions that were made
but what we're after when we engage with
a client is understanding their
priorities their goals their aesthetic
preferences getting them to make
editorial decision or give us editorial
direction and make those critical
decisions this list looks really
different than the list we normally
think of when we think of a design
process so how can we rethink our design
process to get what we're really after
the problem with our traditional design
process is a problem of communication
there is a language and design literacy
barrier between us and our clients and
we can bridge that gap actually it's up
to us to do that we are balancing
technical and design considerations and
they don't know how to give us the
information that we need and they don't
know where we're coming from we might be
having meetings with our team talking to
development and engineers like is this
even possible the client doesn't know
those kind of limitations so there's a
better way we can apply design thinking
to the way that we work with our clients
let's go back to this quote and see how
we can rethink our client engagements
from a design thinking perspective we'll
start with human-centered I apologize
you can't see my highlighting I should
have made a more high contrast
human-centered our design and discovery
process should be centered around our
clients experiences it's it's about them
the process that we impose on them
during their interaction with us is up
to us for to focus on their experience
of that process
the designers toolkit this is our
arsenal of knowledge the artifacts that
we know how to create and create well
it's our user experience skill set our
skills as designers of experiences come
into play when we design an experience
for our clients so I'm down here the
needs of people we have our own needs
and goals like I said before balancing
technical and design considerations that
we have to think about but the client
does as well and this might seem obvious
but I just want to reiterate so we see
how it fits together in this methodology
their goals are not just to have a good
product their goals are also to have a
good experience during the process build
trust with you is the designer feel
ownership over the resulting product and
understand why we're going through all
these steps together possibility of
technology we talked about this a little
bit but we have to balance not only good
design principles in our work but also
the limitations of the technology on
which we're building we are the bridge
between engineers and the client it's
our job to fully understand those
possibilities and lastly at the bottom
here all the all these considerations
must be aimed toward the goal of
business success we want the client to
succeed we want their product to succeed
and we want us to succeed so let's
design an experience for our clients we
are experts at designing experiences
that's what we do but we need to think
about this kind of on a more meta level
and apply it to our process working with
clients our goals go beyond design our
goal should be to build trust establish
a common language collaborate with our
clients inspire ownership and ultimately
reduce time and control scope these are
things that we're all these this is what
we lose sleep over as designers when
scope creep starts to happen
so how can we do this there's a couple
ways we can create a structure for
conversation that targets the
information that we need from them and
we can inspire trust creativity and
collaboration by creating an environment
for play so let's play why do we want to
play like I said it builds trust
playtime establishes common language
play is inherently collaborative and
when people get excited and enthusiastic
about playtime I know this sounds like
kindergarten but it really does affect
all of us and inspires an ownership over
what's happening the process and the
decisions that they're making the best
part about play is it does reduce time
and control scope usually play time is
like a game and games have structured
limitations think about a game you've
played recently like a board game or
even an ipad game or whatever these
games usually have a board a time limit
rules set up like this these structured
limitations help you achieve the goal of
the game or lose if you're playing
against other people the structures that
we can introduce our physical time bound
and goal-oriented so let's look a little
bit at some game mechanics I noticed
we're diverging a little bit here from
design thinking I think they're really
related the first one I don't want to
talk about is called is called quest's
quests you might think of in a game are
you know I'm a wizard mage and my quest
is to go rescue the maiden locked in the
tower behind the dragon or whatever you
know you've played these games for us
though a quest can be getting the client
on board and excited about the final
goal excited about the why behind the
design process and understanding the
rewards if every party is fully
committed to the quest at hand
if the client fulfills their side of the
bargain and we fulfill our side of the
bargain we're going to have an awesome
product and we need to get them on board
with that vision it's a quest
progression this is another game
mechanic it's relatively simple but
seeing a progress bar is an example of
progression for us we can see progress
by clearly articulating the project's
roadmap and goals and setting really
distinct milestones that you're that you
can celebrate with your client
appointment dynamics this is another
game mechanics term this is usually
related to setting time appointments so
for example here's the game show up at
this location at this time you're going
to get a clue okay for us we can
translate this a little bit to being
time-bound workshops you've got five
minutes let's brainstorm this one thing
we all do this with our teams and with
each other but we don't do it with our
clients often enough and what I found is
that it really gets them excited they
feel like they're learning how to be a
designer and it's it's really important
that they feel that way it builds trust
in you as a teacher and that
relationship the bond that you create
there is really special not to get too
touchy-feely here so for each goal that
we have we can create a tool so here's
catan who plays catan oh yeah we like it
okay in settlers of catan you can build
a settlement and a city and a road and I
guess you get ships and some burdens I
don't have the ship version so each each
little tool is in your arsenal you have
this little tool and you can take it out
and do what you need to with that tool
we can do this as well our tools should
provide structure and assist the client
and reaching a particular goal the game
mechanics we just described can be
applied to specific time on workshops
and materials that we create for our
client
I would like to propose that we use more
physical tools in our design and
discovery process so let's talk about
why physical interaction builds
fundamental concepts this is a quote I
found recently from the encyclopedia of
play which is really an interesting
resource fundamental corporeal concepts
such as near and far hard and soft
jagged and pointed weak and strong open
and closed and so on are rooted in
animate movement when we're children or
more babies and we're learning how to
interact with the world it's the
physicality of bumping our bodies into
things sticking things in our mouths
that help us understand really
fundamental concepts of life we already
have this ingrained in us we naturally
speak the language of the physical we as
designers especially in web design where
everything is virtual we don't take
advantage of this often enough physical
artifacts can act as translators for us
we can use them and take advantage of
everyone's natural ability to interact
physically to translate between us our
goals the limitations we're balancing
and our client so how can we harness the
power of these physical experiences we
actually do this already we just don't
know it sketching and diagrams
brainstorming activities post-it notes
we already do this sketching reveals
solutions to complex problems through
articulating those complexities visually
here's a great quote I found drawing
your idea helps you address its
structure with a different part of your
brain and see it from a new angle this
is really what happens when you sketch
out your eyes yeah yeah wireframing on
the whiteboard this is my life yeah so
we need to be drawing things and we need
to draw things with our clients and it
helps them to draw them as well having
physical artifacts also gives them
something to react to I'm sure you've
noticed when you hand them a design comp
or a wire
name they immediately have a reaction
it's either positive or it's negative or
it's unsure they're reacting to the
physical artifact whether you made it
polished and glossy or you know cheap
print out but they're also reacting to
what they see reaction is something that
the client does know how to do they just
don't know how to give the right
feedback yet but physical tools can help
us get the right reactions if we have
the right tools physical tools also
facilitate communication and
collaboration because we can look and
talk and point at an object pass it
around we can have a better
communication pattern here's another
quote externalizing ideas allows for
closer collaboration earlier input and
deeper thought partnership this
ultimately builds trust sharing the
journey with the client and being
transparent is key to establishing trust
by involving the client from the early
stages they become more invested I know
there's some you know some people have
mixed feelings about whether to do live
wire framing with a client in my
experience I've never found that to be
disastrous often there's a step where I
have to go back and interpret it and
refine it and make it better but getting
them involved in that first stage has
been really important physical tools are
also awesome because they give us just
enough space for creativity within a
predetermined structure that can
guarantee success so here we're at
looking at a coloring book colouring
books are great they they train children
to think creatively within small
limitations it's really hard if you hand
someone a blank piece of paper you know
I don't know if you if any of you are
artists but you see the blank canvas and
you're like oh god what am I going to
put on this canvas right if I saw
something with a few more outlines it'd
be a lot easier to start of course we
don't everyone coming out cookie cutter
so it's something a balance but we can
find that balance and make take
advantage of these kind of structures to
hell
people come up with the right ideas by
giving them structure that makes them
feel comfortable and capable we can
inspire them to take ownership over
parts of the process this helps them
make those critical decisions that we
really need them to make and it provides
invaluable input at every stage and
helps us be more agile the structure of
the tool itself can guide clients to
solutions that we know will work both
from a design standpoint and a technical
standpoint so this is just like what
we're looking at color by numbers right
this is a very simple example but we
maybe maybe I know how a dinosaur looks
because I time travel obviously and I
saw one and so I know the colors I'm
going to write down a code and my kid is
going to be able to color in the right
colors and see what a dinosaur looks
like we got to take the same attitude
towards client discovery we know what
we're trying to get from our clients how
can we help them unearthed it so I'd
like to introduce a new take on our
designer tool kit so if you remember
these were our design artifacts our
design tool kit that we've used in the
past with our clients wireframes
personas style tiles design comps each
of these does have a purpose user
personas help us keep in mind who our
users are task flows help us outline all
the steps in the process etc and if you
remember here's what we're really after
priorities goals aesthetic preference as
to editorial direction decision-making
so I'm going to show you some tools that
I use to get closer to these goals today
I'm going to show you pieces from the
tactile design kit it's available for
free online creative commons so feel
free to use it remix it whatever i have
found this so useful i just wanted to
make sure everyone had it so here's
what's in the tactile design kit and
some of this you'll see kind of
resonates with the artifacts we're
trying to create as designers
in the kit we have a set of worksheets
that are meant to be run in a physical
time-bound exercise with your client so
it's a workshop experience and let's
look at each of these in the context of
a sample discovery and design process so
I have a kickoff meeting with my client
it's your chance to introduce the
process roadmap to get them on board
with that quest the goal that we're
trying to aim for here you can introduce
the specific activities that we're going
to do along the way to reach those goals
and get their buy-in and set the right
expectations and tone for the project
this is a really critical meeting and
it's very much about you presenting this
process to the client and getting them
excited also during kickoff meeting
you'll conduct high-level kind of
discovery with the client interviewing
them to understand their business goals
the requirements for the project if you
had an RFP you're probably going to be
digging into that at this meeting
another critical thing to do early on is
established government governance and
rolls who's responsible for what on what
team this is so important this is just
like a game right whose side are you on
what are you playing what's your
strategy you know what's the gameplay
here so it really is important to
establish those roles early on by
presenting a visual road map showing
phases of the project and also showing
the rough timeline you can actually
introduce from the beginning this idea
of the quest what I like to do also is I
have this spot here on the left where we
actually fill out the dates for each of
these so in the very first meeting we
scheduled it we schedule everything in
advance and it gets them committed and
realizing that they got some work to do
by doing this you can ease the clients
worries about time budget and site
delivery by establishing really clear
goals and timeline this also holds them
accountable and gets them to think about
the impact on their staff resources
alright so introducing now we're getting
into using the kit so the kickoff
meeting is really important it's setting
the stage for what you're going to be
doing with the client the very next
thing I usually do is define user
personas if there is user research
available or if you were being hired to
conduct that you'd do that first you
would then summarize that user research
to the client in some format that they
can digest but I would actually say hold
off on making the personas and do that
with your client so during this session
we are going to create user personas
with the client and we're going to
prioritize them by having these as
physical artifacts we can actually
physically prioritize them on the wall
this is the top piece of the persona
template that's part of the design kit
what I actually do beforehand and i'll
show you afterwards i have the kit here
with me and I'll show you I have 25
pre-made personas that just have a photo
and a name but nothing else that are all
cards and we can kind of play around
with having pictures of people another
way to do this if you want to make it
even more fun is to bring in some like
people magazines or something and you
can lick cut out people's heads and
paste them in so you can make this as
fun as you want or you can do some prep
work on this piece of the kit but you're
prompting them to fill out demographic
information relevant details they're the
subject matter experts your clients
they're going to know who this who their
audience is and if they don't you've
hopefully done some research for them to
help them know but talking it through
with the client helps them understand
their users this is so important we
often just make the persona and then say
here's your user but they don't know
that person yet they haven't become
familiar with them they need to become
friends with this person they need to
empathize with them so by filling out
this sheet we can get that to happen a
lot more so on the sheet I have and
again you can tweak this to be whatever
categories you like but I have loves
dislikes special considerations and
needs to dot where you fill in the blank
this person needs to do XYZ on your
website or with your organization
here's my 25 persona cards which I can
show you afterwards we can play with
them if you want I laminate these and I
use wet erase markers it's like
kindergarten it's really fun and what
ends up happening is we start filling
out passing these people around getting
to know them we start to refer to them
by first names the client starts to
refer to them by a first name they get
excited about knowing these people and
the more they know these people I mean
they're going to love these people
though their customers or their audience
if they're not doing a you know sales
website so we can actually set these
cards up and reorder them to prioritize
them having a physical artifact lets us
do that easier with our clients okay
moving on another thing we have to do is
determine their aesthetic preferences
this is hard this is really hard I don't
know how many of you struggle with this
but I really did for a while and what I
found is the reason that this is hard is
because the client doesn't understand
what we mean when we say bright or
modern or friendly they don't
necessarily understand what that means
in terms of design there is a gap in
this design terminology we have a lot of
terms we use to describe how designs
feel and we've developed those as
designers over a long period of time our
client has no idea they just I mean they
have their own concept of what those
words mean and it's usually within their
context so we're playing a little game
of like finding clues to triangulate and
understand what they mean when they say
drab you know boxy if they want to
choose one of those words we need to
figure what they meet because it
probably doesn't mean what we think it
means so here's what I've created to
help with this i went online and i
searched for like every list of
descriptive words I could find on the
internet and I cold these and I
collected them and I created very these
are very personal collected groups I
thought they were you know roughly okay
so we've got on the Left bright clean
crisp fresh sleek light open minimal
subtle subdued modern we have another
group intelligent scholarly editorial
neutral objective so I have all these
words here because what I found is when
I show a client something they don't
know what to say like we I like it they
don't know how to do critique they don't
know they're not trained in this so
we're going to help them by giving them
this one sheet that's a visual
vocabulary reference and the words are
grouped in such a way that they could
kind of find like words so if they
didn't like a particular one but wanted
something in that grouping they could
find one and I actually run this in
conjunction with a website design review
so what I do is I prepare like five to
six example sites of like peer websites
to my client so I just did the
Department of English at Stanford and I
showed them Harvard Princeton Berkeley
you know some of the other big top Ivy
League schools we looked at their
websites and I had them have their
little vocabulary reference and we have
this worksheet I know it sounds really
silly but it really helped they they
definitely got into it and what we
answer is four different questions what
words would you use to describe this
site so they look at the roll sheet pull
word out what features or functionality
do you find compelling this helps us
actually get a little hint at like who
they really like that like pop update
and nav thing okay what do you like
about this site just a general
open-ended question what do you dislike
about the site and that one usually has
the most answers and I actually do a
more robust worksheet I actually print
it's a bigger worksheet where I print a
screenshot of the website and I have
these boxes for these different
questions but this is a simple one you
can do and by their answers and I
actually collect all the worksheets
after so I can compile them into one by
what they write down I can narrow in on
what they what they actually mean when
they say oh that looks very modern it
probably wasn't what I thought when I
thought modern so I can translate
between me and them using these tools
and it helps me kind of like discover
more about what they're thinking after I
do a website review with them
oh I forgot to mention so I do pure
institution websites but I also do
websites that I think they might like
just any website that has like an
aesthetic preference I'm guessing they
might like and i choose like a handful
those five or six and we can again we're
triangulating here on the aesthetic
preferences of our client after this
what i like to do is say so we've looked
at all these we summarize the things
they liked the most and we usually
there's one example site that i found
that they really liked so we look at
that again and we say all right let's
choose five to ten words that you want
to describe your website and at this
point it's usually the words that
they've already said aloud from the
vocabulary list that I now have a point
of reference for that we've looked at an
example site for so this is my process
for translating what clients me when
clients mean when they say a word that I
know means something different in design
language here's just a snapshot of
someone working with the worksheet all
right now that we've got aesthetic
preferences out of the way we can get
into the nitty-gritty stuff navigation
and layout I run these as a two-hour
workshop with my clients and I run them
together because i found that clients
cannot think about navigation without
layout and vice versa just the way it is
so I do these together what we're going
to do is define primary and footer
navigation for their website because if
you've got that you've got the basic
structure everything else underneath in
the sub nav can kind of be defined later
and we're going to craft three core
ideas for wireframes homepage subpage
homepage landing page subpage are
usually the depths I work at so i use a
primary navigation worksheet to work
with my clients it has seven boxes that
are relatively small because I want them
to prioritize I want them to come up
with short words that fit in those boxes
and no more than seven and you know
what's really funny they don't even
question this they're like oh I guess I
need to get rid of one because it
doesn't
fit it's amazing to me it blows me away
you would think this doesn't work but it
really does work color by numbers
seriously so I also have a little bit of
extra info here that we can circle and
say oh this is a landing page it goes to
a bunch of other pages so that's a
concept i introduced at that point the
footer navigation worksheet worksheet is
similar very small because usually the
text in your footer is really small text
small and only 6 spots because I try to
limit them and only seven yeah seven
items under every you know heading so
again I'm trying to get them to think
about priorities cutting things down
choosing what's really important for
them I even so I laminate these ones as
well so they have to use a wet erase
which is a fat marker so you know it has
to like fit in the box I know this is
really silly but it works the wireframe
toolkit is my favorite part of the kit
and please come up and play with it
afterwards because I I brought it what I
have are a set of browsers and a set of
blocks and the browser is structured
with a 12 column grid that matches the
theme that I use on my team to develop
with Drupal so we're a Drupal shop the
greatest 12.com grid the sizes of the
blocks fit on the grid no matter what
orientation we put them and I know
whatever they design with those blocks I
can build because it fits on my grid and
it works in that structure of course
you're going to have variations you're
going to have things some clients that
have really strong preferences here this
might not work for everyone but it works
for me leeson what I found so here's my
kit it's all Stanford branded because we
because Stanford requires you to have
the red header and footer as like a
brand so I just put it there because
they have to get used to seeing it from
day one again it's a structured
limitation that I'm building in that
helps kind of articulate the assumptions
that I have as a designer I'm assuming
they need to be okay with the fact we're
going to put the red bar on the top and
bottom it's just part of the
rement so I just show it to them right
there so the kit uses velcro and
laminated cards and what's cool about
this is you can reposition things so
what I do with my clients is usually I'm
the one drawing because they don't
necessarily feel as confident though
sometimes some of them do depends on the
person usually I'm sitting at a big
table and I'm sitting and they're kind
of standing around and we're drawing
together and we're talking about what
goes into each spot then we talk about
priorities which move stuff up and down
we can even talk about mobile because
this is velcro we can start stacking
blocks take them off stack them again
say oh this is how it'll look on mobile
so we've got a responsive theme I know
exactly how it behaves in you know the
way it breaks down at each break point
so i can walk them through so they
understand how the priority here on the
grid maps to mobile within each block
we've got creativity this is that you
know just enough space just enough space
to be creative and it's the right size
that would the wet erase marker you
can't get to detail which you don't want
in a wireframe you don't want too much
detail so another piece of all this
whenever you introduce structured
limitations you have to have a way to
manage extra ideas that come up people
always think outside the box it always
happens and you should have an attitude
of yes and and what we what I do to do
this is I create a stack of what I call
idea cards and I introduce this as part
of the gameplay in the beginning say
okay here's our wireframing navigation
workshop over here are the idea cards if
you come up with a great idea for your
product write it down and stick it in
this pile and later we can manage this
so this is taking a cue from kind of
agile methodologies where we're making a
backlog with them they understand that
it's great to have ideas at any time of
day and that they should write them down
but that the goal of the workshop is
over here the goal of the workshop is
the wire framing exercise so we can
table the idea by writing it down in a
structure that's made to support it so
here's an idea card
add a dynamic events feed to the sidebar
and you can sketch it and you can later
you can write down kind of is this in
scope how hard is it to make this thing
so you can do some analysis with your
team after the fact of these cards if
you run these workshops well you can get
most of the information you need to
create those traditional design
artifacts which we still create I still
create all these artifacts site maps etc
but because I can run these workshops
interactively with my client I find that
I can get to a like a desired result
that the client likes much much faster
we just went through three workshops you
can do that in three meetings if your
site isn't huge and I know some of you
probably work with really big clients I
usually work with like an academic
department it's not the hugest website
in the world you can actually define all
these things in like three or four
meetings and because they've been
interacting with these physical objects
and doing helping you in the process
they have a lot more ownership in the
result some other workshops you might
need to run so I what I do is I think
about this from like a Lego perspective
it's very modular so each workshop is
and each worksheet itself is modular if
I decide a certain client needs more I
can add more in and if I decide that
they don't even need something I can
take that out so some of just a couple
of the others that I do regulate I do
card sorting a lot so i'll do that way
in the beginning we'll do like a user
personas first then we'll do card
sorting and this usually what I do is I
i create the cards ahead of time based
on their current site map and we have
them sort by user so once we have their
personas identified we can lay those out
and start saying alright let's do a card
sort based on those users that we did
last time then you can do a card sort
for other categories or whatever
groupings you might need so I use these
tools in conjunction with other
methodologies and tools also the
interviews focus groups you might need
those as well okay
so let's talk about rules for making
good good tools I really as much as I
want you to download the tech tile
design kit and play with it I really
want you to make your own tools that
work for you so let's talk about how to
do that if you craft the right structure
you can get the right input create tools
that match your technology and your best
practices so let's look at an example so
here's the theme that we use it's our
one of our base themes that we use for
all the projects we do at Stanford we're
lucky because we have a really contained
community and we use the same resources
over and over I know that's not the same
for everyone but you your agency could
develop central tools and themes that
you use regularly with your clients if
you know the limitations of that theme
or that technology you can start to
build that into your discovery and
design process so in our theme we have
only one option for main menu and that's
horizontal so I know that I don't want
more than seven items and that main menu
for it to look good on mobile be
navigable on mobile and desktop I know I
don't want more than seven that's why
this worksheet has seven boxes so if you
have another variation that you like to
use with your clients or that you find
comes up a lot think about whether the
worksheet can be adjusted to fit that
technology as well again our theme
supports a six column footer so I have
six boxes and it seems really obvious
but just think about it your technology
can drive the structure of your tools so
I'm going to talk a little bit more
about the wireframe toolkit now as a
kind of story of how this whole thing
started actually I started working with
Stanford web services and we didn't have
any central resources set up we didn't
have common design patterns that we saw
over and over again even though we knew
they were there we just didn't have them
documented so I did a whole bunch of
research on a bunch of different
websites across Stanford and I looked
for patterns here's an example website
department of physics what i did was i
found elements
elements in so many different websites
that i was able to generically create
miniature wire frame components i called
these common blocks because in drupal we
call them blocks nerd time if you guys
want to talk Drupal after all talk
drupal too late in the evening and from
this research i created a layout library
this is just part of my layout library i
have like many many balsamic screens of
this where these are variations of
different kinds of blocks and the
variations that I saw that we're common
what's really cool so since we're a
drupal shop we work with Drupal features
which are little prepackaged modules and
plug-in components that you can make we
made these we saw them so much that we
just made them into a feature now when I
work with my client I don't tell them
that I have pre-made all these things I
just show them those things and they say
oh that looks great we want that because
I know they want that I've done my
research so they literally just pick up
one of these cards and say oh that work
and we usually rename the top of each
card with the wet erase marker but they
like it they like the way it's
structured because they've seen it a lot
they don't know that I've done my
research and they don't know that my
team has already built their site for
them so I'm showing them like tools that
I already have in my arsenal okay good
tools also facilitate discussion through
thoughtfully being thoughtfully crafted
we need to have a yes and attitude this
is really critical it's something we
learn about through improv yes and never
say no to a client we want to encourage
them to be creative but we want to guide
them towards the right thing so on the
two navigation worksheets I showed you I
have boxes at the bottom for other
important links links without a home
that's what i call them and clients
totally get this they understand that
they have to choose seven but if they
think of another one that can just write
it down at the bottom that's okay and it
just releases
all the tension of having to make every
single critical decision all at once if
you have an icebox a backlog for the
things that are your clients priorities
they start to understand how to do that
prioritization which they're going to
need to do throughout the whole project
we're training them to be good at giving
us that information that we need and
making the decisions and priorities
prioritization that we need them to I
already showed you the idea card this is
again my solution to out of scope ideas
another thing to consider is sometimes
one tool isn't good enough so I have
complementary tools i already mentioned
this but I run the navigation worksheets
with the wireframe toolkit I've just
found that it works better that way
sometimes you don't get everything
finished right away but it gets you way
farther along than you taking a guessing
game running by the client doing a
revision doing a guessing game back and
forth the other thing to think about is
give an example so here I know that what
they want a home button on their main
menu they want to argue with me
Charlotte's argue but I think they
should have a home button on their main
menu it takes up one of their critical
spots it takes up one of their seven
critical spots so I'm giving them an
example of what kind of word to write in
the box and one that I think that they
do want and this helps them kind of get
going and gets their ideas flown
labeling matters so I was really careful
about labeling for these worksheets in
the site descriptor 1 choose five to ten
words that describe your new website the
reason why labeling matters is if you
run a workshop with four or five even
six people they each have their own copy
of these things and they're going to
miss your instructions so we need to
have at least a little clue on the piece
of paper and this helps people who are
more introverted and you know less about
saying things openly write down their
ideas and kind of have their own moment
because I found that some people do have
trouble speaking up in a group
especially in their on their team if
they're not the higher up on the team
they might not feel like their voice
matters but if five of them write down
an idea that no one said and I get
afterwards and I go home maybe that's
something we should talk about I can
facilitate talking about that so
labeling doesn't matter because it helps
people kind of zoom in on their little
worksheet if they want to but don't over
label this is really important so let's
look at the visual vocabulary reference
what i'm doing here is i'm testing my
assumptions in the bottom right of the
visual vocabulary are three columns of
words that are negative kg cluttered
contained rigid complex scatter frenetic
conservative so I don't know if the
client thinks those are bad words I
think they're bad because I'm a designer
I would never want someone to call my
design kg that would be horrible or drab
but they might like that word I might
want their website to feel that way so I
don't label those words as negative
words I just grouped them together and
what I've seen happen is the client will
start reading through the list lebbick
oh that's a bad word I'm like yes some
of them can be some of them can be
negative because I want them to tell me
if they think that they're negative or
not another rule for good tools set
expectations and mindset from the
beginning we have to set a tone of
compassion and fun this is critical to
inspiring the beginner's mind in
yourself and in the client this is a new
process for them we need to prepare the
environment so this is this is a
workshop Iran I apologize it's a little
dark I layout everything I have a little
spot like marked off with artist tape
for the idea cards so when they're done
they can like put them in this little
spot when they walk in there like oh
what are we going to do today and then
they look on the board and I have a
little checklist of our agenda for the
day it's fun it gets them really excited
and it helps them have trust in us that
we know what we're doing we have a goal
we have an agenda and we have these fun
tools what we're going to do to get
there the other thing is when you're
introducing that exercise you need to
set the rules for collaboration
so this might be inspiring people who
don't speak up to you know take turns
and say what they're thinking whatever
it is you're going to have to feel out
the dynamics of the group but you want
to make sure you open it up and say all
ideas are good ideas we have the idea
cards if you think it's a bad idea
whatever just write it down on the idea
card and get people to understand that
they can be open and brainstorm with you
we also need to be agile iterate tests
get feedback iterate tests get feedback
this is critical and every time you run
this process you might want to refine
your toolkit I do this all the time I
don't real am innate every time because
that's a pain but so let's imagine
crafting tools with built-in limitations
that support specific design and
discovery goals can help us streamline
the process anything is possible with
enough time and money but most clients
don't have that much money so we want to
do our best to help reduce the time and
the money spent on their project we have
to balance technical and design
considerations when working with our
clients if our tools can better support
the limitations and best practices we're
working with we can speed up the
conversation you should design tools
that encourage clients to use pre-built
solutions that you know exist and work
well this is really important for
accessibility reasons so let's say you
have a carousel or a slide show that you
know really works well and is accessible
you want to encourage them to use that
one not the other one and you can just
present them that one option if that's
the one you know works and if they
really complain the insurer present the
other options but you know you could
start with the thing that you think is
the best thing that's going to get them
where they want to go create a
repeatable process don't reinvent the
wheel think modular Lee and create
reusable tools that can be reconfigured
into different workshops with different
clients we need to be forging meaningful
relationships between you and the client
and between the client and their product
if they don't have any ownership in that
product they're not going to maintain it
over
I've seen this a lot where we hand off a
website and it just dies because they
haven't been involved in the process
they haven't been committed to it they
haven't understood their users I love
this quote josh brewer design is about
relationships it is it's about our
relationship to other people it's about
our relationship of our product to
people what it means to them in their
life and it's our relationship with our
client our clients are hugely important
to our success as designers in the world
and empathy is the key to that success
so I have a couple links and resources
if you guys want to learn more about any
of these things these are just three
things that I found really inspiring
game storming it's a book you can get
with a whole bunch of really fun games
some of them are more corporate kind of
focus which could be fun but there's
some really cool things in there really
really cool things um introduction to
design studio methodology this is an
article i read in New X magazine which I
had that moment of like gosh I'm doing
that I didn't even know that's what it
was called but that's what I'm doing but
so enemy design studio methodology very
much about live interactive workshops
with clients and if you have not read it
yet a book apart has a fantastic book
design is a job by Mike Montero this
book blew me away and if you want to
develop compassion for your clients and
for your team and just become a better
designer read that book it's short so
you can get the tactile design kit
online tech tile design kit calm and I'm
going to put the slides up probably
later tonight or tomorrow on my website
so you can download them and if you want
to connect on Twitter Megan Aaron Miller
so thanks everyone
yeah so the question is how does content
strategy fit into this process uh I have
like a dirty secret maybe as a designer
I actually think i'm more of a Content
strategist than a designer I mean I do
design as my day job but every single
second I'm like wait I'm doing content
strategy all the time every meeting is
about content strategy getting them on
board with the user personas is all
about content strategy it's
understanding those users so that they
can make decisions later on in the game
that help them get that that content
tweaked to be correct so yeah so that's
why I run the user persona workshop
first because then i go into navigation
what I've layout and we always have the
users there there there in the room and
we go hey you know does this a bit of
textures is this tone fit is this
wording fit with that user are we you
know resonating there so for me it's
very much about a user-centered approach
and that's my angle for getting them to
think about content strategy most of
them aren't going to become content
strategists and they often in my
experience especially at Stanford
they're small teams and none of them are
communication specialist people so I am
helping them a lot and like in the
Department of English website redesign
we did it's very content heavy and we
devised this whole back-end kind of
category tagging for their news based on
their annual newsletter they create over
a year so I did again I picked apart ten
years of their newsletter came up with
those categories I showed them I was
like there's your category did you see
it and they were like oh we see it so
I'm helping them understand content
strategy through all those different
steps yeah so the question is what's the
difference between marketing and user
experience design I guess my short
answer is good marketing should be user
experience design we should be honestly
marketing our products and we should be
I mean I think they should be the same I
think when you feel like marketing is
being false that's because there's a
mismatch between the marketing strategy
and what the users actually want that's
my answer so the question is whether
what's the relationship between using
static prototypes and dynamic prototypes
in working with your clients
um I think dynamic prototypes are super
critical especially now with responsive
web design so i usually get to that
stage but what I back to what I focus on
in the kind of second part of the talk
the physicality of having this printed
thing is really special there's
something like really powerful that
happens when you hand someone this fun
tool kit and it helps them get really
engaged and it's that ownership we're
trying to inspire them to own that
artifact if they can't touch it if it's
in the screen they're playing with
something you made they don't own it
even if you built it built it with them
in the same room because you know how to
code I mean that's scary to them coding
and drupal and whatever this is all
scary to the client we need to make it
less scary so I think there's a place
for dynamic prototyping and I do do that
but I do it a little later in the game
usually after we've gone through a lot
of these workshops i just described so
you can have a idea for some of your
wire frames then you can make us a a
dynamic prototype and show them the
mobile responsive behavior yeah um so
the question is let me see if I got that
right what's the advantage of a gamified
approach to your process with your
client versus an approach that exposes
them to the effect it has on their users
right away yeah so if you want to
introduce that you can introduce like
rapid prototyping and test user testing
in the process so you need something to
do any sort of testing so again this is
really early discovery type of workshops
so you got to get something out the door
to even test it with a real user but
yeah so just like you were bringing up
we could very easily right after that
first wireframing workshop make a
dynamic prototype run a user tests with
one of their users in the room and have
them witness what happens so yeah I
think you can integrate integrate that
type of iterative user testing into the
process
yeah okay so the question is when your
clients have bad taste what do you do
right I mean that's what we're talking
about here what I like to do is show
more and more examples and talk about
successful stories that meet users needs
so I might take something completely out
of their industry or whatever but show
them something that I think is in the
aesthetic direction that might be
appropriate so I'm leading them and we
can discuss why it works if they start
seeing like five or ten examples of
these they'll start to see that their
own preferences might not match up so
it's like a comparison game and at that
point yeah you might run into a stubborn
personality and it's going to happen
ultimately they're paying your bills so
I think read Mike Montero's book he
talks a lot about that about client
clients redoing your design comp but
yeah it's an interesting challenging
thing yeah I've never worked with any
teams that are virtual in this way I
think I think what you could do since
this is a printable kit I mean you can
send PDFs and you can run the workshop
from afar and have them literally just
take phone pictures and scan them back
to you I mean that's what we're doing
anyway in the room it's like I'm walking
around taking snapshots of my phone it
would definitely take a lot more leading
them through the exercise especially the
wire framing if you have to you know
it's harder to sketch from afar but I
think you'd have to think creatively
about how to run a workshop using some
of these principles from afar and maybe
have them set up their own little kind
of area to do these exercises on their
end while you're with them through video
chat or something so I think the best
part there is you need to build an ally
on their team that's going to take
ownership of this again design is a job
great book he talks all about building
allies with your clients so yeah that
would be my answer to that
thanks everyone thanks for coming i'm
going to set up the kit so if you want
to come take a look at the kit i'll have
it over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
