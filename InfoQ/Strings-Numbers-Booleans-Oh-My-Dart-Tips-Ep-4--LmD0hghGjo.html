this episode of dart tips today we
sharpen our understanding of darts basic
built-in types the building blocks of
any program start as support for numbers
strings and boolean x' they are all
objects you can initialize them from
literal values and you can't get very
far without them
let's get started numbers strings and
billions are easy to use because you can
create them from literal values every
object in dart is an instance of a class
but these built-in types can be
initialized without having to use a
constructor with the new keyword let's
see literals in action and start our
tour with numbers dart has two types of
numbers integers are arbitrary precision
which means they can grow to arbitrary
size in the dart VM doubles are 64-bit
floating-point numbers that conform to
the I Triple E 754 standard you can
create instances of these classes using
literals for example here are some
integers notice how you can create a new
instance of a number simply by using its
literal value a little warning though
very large integers will work in the
dart VM but not when compiled to
JavaScript this is a known issue so stay
tuned number of literals with a decimal
point are doubles you can even declare a
double literal with an exponent for
scientific notation both integers and
doubles are some classes of the num
class the operators of plus minus
multiply and divide are actually special
methods defined in the num class of
special note is the difference between
division and truncating division
division with just one forward slash
returns a double truncating division
with tilde forward slash truncates the
answer and returns the integer portion
before the decimal point the num class
also defines methods such as absolute
ceiling floor around and more this makes
sense because these are all methods you
can call in a specific instance of a
number use the static method parse from
the int and double classes to convert a
string to a number and go the other way
from number to string using good old to
string speaking of strings let's move on
to our next built-in type strings and
dart are sequences of utf-16 code units
notice how you can use either single
quotes or double quotes when declaring a
string literal this is awesome because
this lets you
use the quotes that work for your string
writing a bunch of HTML that uses double
quotes great you can wrap the entire
string in single quotes does your string
contain single quotes not a problem just
wrap the whole thing in double quotes
combining and building strings is easy
with string interpolation notice the
dollar sign username inside of message
this inserts the value from username
into the string message dart does not
have string concatenation with plus but
you won't miss it thanks to string
interpolation here's another reason you
don't need plus the concatenate strings
adjacent string literals or two string
literals next to each other are
concatenated for you this example shows
two string literals next to each other
even though they are on two lines the
compiler joins them together for you for
even longer strings you can use dart
support for multi-line strings notice
the use of triple quotes which works
with both triple single quotes or triple
double quotes all new lines after the
first triple quotes are retained this
feature is very useful for small
snippets of HTML for the time so you
need to use special characters like
dollar sign or backslash inside your
string you can use raw strings prefixes
string with the character R to turn off
any interpretation of the strings
contents this is very handy for building
regular expressions the string class is
full of useful methods for searching
creating sub strings matching and more
will cover strings in more detail in a
future episode let's move on to our next
built-in type boolean z' like everything
in dart boolean czar objects
specifically true and false are the only
two instances of the bull class dart
differs from JavaScript in its treatment
of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript
the object 1 non empty string and non
null objects are all treated as true in
dart it's more simple only the boolean
value true is treated as true in dart
all object instances other than true are
treated as false instead of using many
different objects for truthiness and
faultiness you can instead explicitly
check for values or States for example
instead of just checking if hit points
you should check explicitly if hit
points is equal to 0 I personally really
like this as the code is clear and the
developer doesn't need to learn a bunch
of truthy or faulty values the rule of
three is of writing
principle that suggests that things that
come in three are inherently more
satisfying or more effective than other
numbers of things so it's no coincidence
then that you just learn how to create
three foundational building blocks of
any dart program numbers strings and
billions these types are all real
objects and can be initialized with
literal values making them very easy to
use from here we build up two
collections in a future episode thanks
