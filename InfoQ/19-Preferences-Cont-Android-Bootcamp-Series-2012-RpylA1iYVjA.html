this is my username and password right
now it's correct right and that's why
everything seems to work right so if I
work if I launch my appt wanting for now
if I go menu refresh it would be locket
yeah since to work right right ok so now
if I go menu preferences and if I put
the wrong password oh yeah username it
doesn't really matter using a first of
all it wasn't so much weird i'm not sure
why doesn't seem use me because we don't
have it here right
yeah everything's everything else is
fine ok so now I'm gonna put the wrong
use an output student 47 I doubted that
phone exhaust right ah that's why I see
I have what's going on here using
England in capital letters you should
not have done that so let me see why is
their name change the cat one that I did
not know I never changing that should be
like this is me impossible that's why I
was blank that is weird let me do this
I'm gonna blow up this file cuz it's
junk laughing so I don't care
preferences anymore so username oh but
this is not wrong so Mia let me be run
this for some reason eclipse change my
key to why did it all while I was
explaining yeah yeah and then at the end
ten o'clock hi my bad I always blame it
on the club's usually right that's
always all right so menu preferences so
I'm going to put the wrong student
username so student 47 right password is
going to be correct be a ssw 0 rd i am
not sure always yeah
no I mean it's money then you change it
back to the long and Reggie password and
well you think you cannot play right so
we did so it's probably running we can
tell that by we can play we can just
look at it be lockout right but i think
it's running because it's i want to see
what my delays but nonetheless let me do
it the Refresh service right so the
first service is running I have a I have
a wrong usability possible good one yeah
that's what why's that you know the
substance not it's not changing for that
so yeah but let's take a look so this
what we do we get a preference manager
we get preferences in oncreate this
happens only once when the app starts
not on a components are between yet
starts right and but we did register on
share preference changeless know what we
do this right so when the preference
changes it should notify us the
preference changed right and we may have
to read get the preferences so let me
just double check one thing what I'm
interested in is does this say Yamba
does this get called so yamba app star
and star
mm-hmm okay and yes that would in status
activity of saying I'm still referring
to Twitter somewhere no I don't think I
am I changed that too I changed it yeah
I can't even do it because I made
private yeah I mean I'm a Twitter be
private so i can't possibly yeah but i
need have to do this here for four preps
because this is now the new preferences
so apparently the preference object
might have changed so des dot profs
equals crafts that because this is going
to be um so share preferences the
facility problem so the chapel yes this
preference has got to change so we know
the preference chain but why why do the
value stay the same right
because we'd like to be treated yeah but
kept twitter is yes sir get twitter is
going to get null and we're going to
update preferences every single time
right so it's a good
we never get notified in something
changed what's the new preference 36
work boys we which line along the new
preference but we are getting those
notifications like if you look at here
so if i go to menu and if i call
preferences see this gap this grave get
notified again you just get preference
but maybe you never care about
preference object
with that well let's do this let's uh
you guys wanted to go the debugger so
this may be a good opportunity actually
let's do this let's put a breakpoint
alright so let's debug this so we're
going to run this using the debugger
debuggers android application so let's
see what happens
this is starting
I you just slow
so instead look
what why this is so slow I should be at
thatching
Oh as you put thatching or not
is the butter working for you guys
yeah because post is looking at every
time oh it's because it's retaining it
in the service side okay okay that's why
it works that's right yeah yeah because
i normally use the forget france
timeline and that requires
authentication so it works for the post
right okay all right so then that solves
that hurting it's well no it's not a
post Pizza you know no so in our service
in our refresh service and such within
update sir is what we use is the get
public timeline there's no
authentication need for that one SoDo
you specify the wrong username password
VI fails so the better test would be let
me just run it so the better test would
be the post because that requires
certification I normally don't use
France timeline and use a popular Malin
is French diamond and that one does
require identification zone
still doesn't explain like my debugger
all of a sudden stopped attaching I
worked like charm until recently so so
test so if i do a test update that's
going to fail that's going to fail right
now I forgot menu preferences and change
his name to correct username so did we
get the update here we got the other got
changed that worked yeah I said so
everything's been fine all along I just
didn't forget the public from London
business integration and so we did that
we already did the preference register
on change listener I probably got me
this time sure it's the same preference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
