application we're going to make a geo
location based check-in magic button and
to do that we need something in the HTML
to help us out we opened up our home
that handlebars file and magically
you'll notice I got rid of VI and now
i'm in a nice editor here and what we're
going to do is we're going to lay out
what little bit of HTML that we're going
to need everyone who's watching this yes
i know it's an incomplete HTML page at
the moment but we'll see in the other
file how this particular template fits
in with the other template we're going
to have a form we are going to send the
request back home and we're going to
have two hidden fields we are going to
grab using the magic html5 geolocation
API we are going to as the user logs in
find out if we can get their location
from them and we will let the user Geo
tag themselves in the database to do
that we need a button so they can submit
the query we're going to throw some
classes in here because well we won't
spend a whole lot of time on this design
we'd like our app to at least look
rudimentary a pretty and since nowadays
there's many ways and many libraries out
there that we can use to help us with
the design of our page for very little
work we're going to use Twitter
bootstrap that's the form of our page
the way handlebars works is really nice
because this is a partial that fits
right into our main handlebars page
right and get ahead of ourselves a
little bit we are going to go ahead and
add the files that we want to link to
make our page look at least a bit nicer
linking them up
it is quite simple to use Twitter
bootstrap and going with the trend since
we're using nodejs and we're being very
trendy at the moment we will also make
our page responsive with very little
work finally
we will have our own style that we can
add in might wonder if this particular
bit of code actually comes with express
it doesn't we need to download it so we
come back here grab the Twitter
bootstrap download it unzip it and we're
going to grab what we need from it all
we need right now is the CSS we're going
to put this in the static assets folder
that is supplied to us I have to spell
it correctly there we go and then we're
gonna get rid of bootstrap excellent
let's take a look let's see if our page
looks any different back to the browser
load everything up and we can see it
doesn't look that much difference but it
looks a little nicer things have been
spaced out from the edge are tight it
looks better and we have a check-in
button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
