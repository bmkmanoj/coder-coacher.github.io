conference really excited to be here
today and excited to talk about what has
been a pretty fun and amazing story in
our proliferation into the various app
spaces when i joined Pendor in 2004 the
company was in the kiosk business we
sold kiosks for record stores to help
sell cds and there were about five
engineers there the the internet radio
idea was a marketing spec and honestly
none of these engineers really believed
in the opportunity there have been a few
internet radio companies to go out of
business before we embarked on our path
and I think and they had never really
been heavy users it was interesting
Chris was using win it before and I'm
sure many of you as i did use winamp
back in oh 3 o 4 to listen to things
like shoutcast but ultimately there were
many businesses that went out before us
so we convinced them to stay and about
eight months into 2005 we launched our
first application on the web in about
two months after we streamed our first
track we were featured in a article and
dear Spiegel on the print and online
edition in Germany and we had these huge
peaks in the middle of the night and it
took it was actually a couple days to
figure out what it was but I think at
that point we realized that we had
something that people really enjoyed
fast forward to now and as Chris said we
have a hundred million registered users
on over 400 connected devices but the
reality is we feel like we've just
scratched the surface and there's so
much more to do in this space to
continue to bring Pandora to where our
listeners want to be our main goal is to
bring a personalized radio experience to
wherever our listeners are and deliver
music they love and this is from the
beginning we've tried to build out a
platform that would
allow us to extend that in many places
and I think it's interesting here we are
at the developers conference and a lot
of people think of this is just just
mobile or just smartphones base and I
had an interesting question to ask how
many of you are on a single platform
today how many are on five platforms
today 1020 I mean because ultimately we
all want to be on many more places than
we are now and so I think it's important
for you all to think about not just not
just mobile tablets or the like but more
about even some of the controlled
environments like TVs and blu-ray
players things like Roku and some of the
connected living room devices that
present interesting opportunities and
today I want to talk about some of the
principles that drive our product
development and our platform and I want
to walk you through an evolution of
where we started and where we got where
we are today as well as some thoughts
about what's next there are two things
that drive every product decision at
Pandora John mentioned ease we call it
simplicity making Pandora incredibly
easy to use we want your grandma to be
able to log in the Pandora start pandora
on her iPhone if she has one and listen
to music we want her to be able to
create a station we wanted to be able to
easily give us feedback about the track
she doesn't like and does like so that
we can make a better stream for her
additionally we've always valued
accessibility we've always wanted to
make Pandora available wherever our
listeners are and I think it's important
for you all to think about not just the
platform you want to be in but where
your app is appropriate where is the
opportunity and how are you going to get
there our story is one of many there's
lots of other interesting stories about
companies that have proliferated in very
different ways with very different
applications across them the device
world Angry Birds most recently launched
on the Roku device and they have a
bluray connected remote that
you know your kids can play through this
$80 Roku box they can play Angry Birds
on your you know living room TV
additionally netflix has a really
interesting story that's quite a bit
different than ours and I think they're
on a similar number of devices here's a
picture of our of our iPhone app super
simple really easy to grok thumb up
thumb down but first we should go back
to the beginning about six plus years
ago when we launched launched our first
version of pandora com this this
launched on 829 2005 this is basically a
flash tuner a pretty large flash tuner
where all the logic fur is exists that
just sitting in the middle of a web page
and well before we redesign it had a
much more integrated look but back then
it was just basically a flash tuner in
the middle of a page we've done a bunch
from the beginning we made some really
wise decisions around our architecture
we've always worked to delineate
presentation and you I from business
logic and application logic and
subsequently keeping the media server
and media serving audio in our case
separate from all that I don't think
it's worth going into a ton of detail
but some decisions we made here to put
all of the user sort of experience in
the front and set us up well for the
device world first came the our first
foray end devices about a year and a
half after we launched the website was
into two specific living room devices we
started actually with the squeezebox and
they wrote their device against that the
version that the tuner was using which
was great and then and it was a really
good experience for us to do something
different than the web and then shortly
after that we worked with sonos to
launch a version the first very first
version of our
device partner API these partners are
really awesome because they understood a
lot more about the living room in the
device world than we did and they're
also very technically savvy and they
tell us a ton about how to extend the
listening experience into new places I
believe that both of these platforms
have had things like shoutcast for many
years before us so they had a lot more
experience in this space than we did and
generally I found it useful for us to
continually try to find partners we can
learn from and work with closely shortly
after that we started developing for
feature phones at peak we were on over
80 different flip phones and j2me
enabled smartphones my desk was a
complete mess covered with all these
prototypes in some cases modeling clay
covering the exterior because at some
point these device manufacturers really
wanted to get things on their app on
their phones apps on their phones
initially we had outsourced this work
because we had no j2me and experience in
house but ultimately we brought that
development back in and turned a bunch
of Java developers or a few Java
developers into j2me developers the but
these did Platt was a really difficult
platform to develop for when we probably
had six different raisers that we that
we worked on with all sorts of different
finicky little problems there the
displays are really tiny and really
difficult to make a compelling you I in
such a small space and I think the
biggest benefit of this whole project
was that we learned a ton about the cell
networks and how to make a reliable
stream across them and that lends itself
really well later on when it came to the
iOS and Android platforms along with ram
and palm we had a small detour in the
clock radios which was pretty
interesting too this is a chumby and a
receiver based device receive it was a
chipset we supported that probably plays
on
you may be 20 different clock radios
these were interesting and again pushed
us in a new direction there these were
much more competitively priced than the
other devices we'd worked on which means
that they're lacking any sort of
processing power or you know interaction
display and and controls and it was
really hard for us to build a UI that we
reviewed is simple particularly on a
four line display that's a fixed width
and you know one of our fos being one of
our sort of guiding principles being
simple this is a really difficult thing
to do but what ultimately we worked
really close with these partners to try
to build interfaces that work within
their platform and I think that's a
really important learning to trying to
work with your partners again to make a
compelling experience that fits within
the UI for a given platform while also
trying to maintain our principles ah
then came I OS around the office we
called the game changer because it was
quick to proliferate and it's probably
one of the reasons we're all here today
and as I walked into that arm conference
imagining that this conference would
probably be in that place in a few years
and they might be back here as the way
the app world is developing the but
ultimately we were really lucky to be
there on day one with the iOS and
continue to have a really popular app
that works really well shortly after
that we had the next wave of the
smartphone and these were these are all
completely different than iOS different
markets different users and they work in
quite a different way again we wanted to
try to make a UI that fits within the
platform while also maintaining our
simplicity it's interesting because in
the case of Android there's lots of
really well integrated features that you
can take advantage of at the user
interface level
such as the taking advantage of the
notification or the there's a bunch of
integrations with the media player on
Android as well and there's a lot of
pretty cool multi chat multi-touch
gesture features on palm that we wanted
to take advantage of but that was again
pretty challenging and again I think we
got good guidance from our partners the
and I think one thing we think about all
these apses as long as we have users
there they're never really done I think
a lot of people a lot of us build an app
and just put it down and leave it and
expect it to just take off and expect
people to engage with it but the reality
is the networks of changes there's no
changing there's devices coming out all
the time and in the case of android OS
is and you need to be able to take
advantage of what they're doing so you
should always be working on your apps
improving your apps and we sure try to
then we have the second wave in the
living room now this is when we really
started to proliferate towards 400 and
these devices really came in many
different forms from blu-ray players to
there's a picture that the recent Roku
up there to western digital hard drive
media players and this was a really
challenging space to get into from a
resource and development wise to just
managing the various partner worlds on
some of these platforms we've been
working with sometimes three different
partners to get on to the platform and
that that's no cakewalk as I'm sure you
know some learnings here we it's really
important to get face time with your
partners I'm sure we all have experience
to that effect we had one particular
partner who had had a really hard time
getting their app going and they
ultimately sent a couple engineers to
our office and their bosses told them
don't come back till it's done or you
won't have a job and and they were there
for 14 days straight 16-hour days and we
help them
then but it's really meant we've we've
really built a great relationship with
this particular partner we got to know
these engineers and we got to know the
organization that they work with work in
we've also tried in many cases we tried
multiple times to build a an application
that could be deployed in many platforms
and that's also in it's worked out
really well in a few cases in one case
where it worked out we worked closely
with this chipset manufacturer to build
a really compelling UI and and it came
out great it was recognized by the c/e
manufacturers and that particular
chipsets been absorbed and proliferated
managing change carefully that's put all
of these are somewhat obvious right the
we have all these 400 devices most of
which connect directly to our to our API
that the app is baked into many much of
this many of these platforms and we I
think it's happened twice in four years
but just last week we made a small
change to an auth token and just in
length and it broke one particular
device we heard from them within 10
minutes and we reverted a couple hours
later but it was a good reminder for us
to be careful as well because we're
constantly reminding them to be careful
and then again we offer a really high
quality documentation and support for
our partners who are in most cases are
developing them these apps themselves we
have a team of three or four engineers
who work with the partners / email
mostly and we're very responsive and
engaging I think they appreciate that
and we're constantly trying to roll that
feedback back into our product and back
into our documentation I think this is
one of the newer platforms that is
pretty interesting the tablet a lot of
people try a lot of us try to cram our
mobile apps into or expand our mobile
apps into the iPad or into
any sort of tablet space or we try to
cram our website into the tablet space
and neither of those work it's really
important to think about as a new space
it has a whole different feature set
than either at least graphically and
what we did with the ipad is we
developed a whole new interface for it
and one that we're pretty proud of in
our users seem to like as well and
what's interesting about this is
although this has been out a couple
years it was actually the motivator for
the redesigned website we just launched
last month this station lists the
controls and the album information the
bio is all much more accessible and it
had been in the past way more accessible
than that first image of our site he saw
and then we've been working on the car
the car is really interesting because
it's a whole different space with a
whole different set of partners the way
it works is we have we've introduced an
API in our app on the phones on a few of
the platforms and so the we work closely
with the device manufacturers to write
to that API so that when you're driving
you're actually streaming pandora over
your phone but your controls are in the
car on your steering wheel / voice or
even on the dash depending on the
feature set of the phone but automotive
partners are a whole different beast
they work on incredibly long time lines
they have this complicated web of tiered
part providers and partners that we've
had to navigate the first we first the
first wave of automotive stuff we've
done was up in aftermarket radios and it
seemed kind of silly at the time because
these are like thousand-dollar stereos
that you know they'll be lucky to sell a
thousand units but the reality is it was
really great for us it was a great
experience to get to know what it's like
to bring radio personalized radio to the
car and also to help us navigate the
sort of technical work as well as the
partner
partner management another thing we did
with the car integrations is put a huge
effort into understanding the entire
feature set of the platform so the
quality of the Bluetooth stack varies
greatly from auto manufacturer to
automate interaction we know a ton about
how that works and what we need to
prepare for and handle and we also did a
ton of work to understand what the
interfaces are to the to the driver be
it voice in some cases I think in the
case of the for it Ford and in others
it's just in the dash of the steering
wheel because for us to really make a
compelling experience we want it again
to you know we wanted to track feedback
to be accessible and we wanted station
management to be easy and accessible but
we put a lot of effort in upfront and
hopefully it'll pay off many of these
devices would leave it could be around
for decades to come that's probably a
slight exaggeration that because it's
not it's hard to imagine we could all
have an iphone in 10 years but you could
be driving the same car maybe you'll
just keep your iPhone around for Pandora
and then we most recently relaunched our
website and we we spent two years
designing and developing this thing
maybe you've used it again it looks a
lot like the iPad app the controls fixed
at the top the station list along the
left much longer and a lot more stations
are accessible and then again the song
history and the bios but this in this
case it's float the tuners floating
which gives us a little more to do on
the page with RIT with respect to
advertising or other things one thing
that was interesting about this
experience and I don't we didn't really
realize it till we put the whole thing
together and probably a couple months
before we launch is that it looks pretty
damn good on a large TV it's a little
busy here but with the resizable album
art and the fixed controls that really
pop out you can imagine how we could
extend this experience to the Smart TV
so how do we get to this point we were
we try to build really strong business
and technical relationships with our
partners I've talked a lot about that we
try to keep our API simple and stable
but flexible so we have some
tokenization that we can utilize when
necessary we actually had I'm sure some
of you have heard audio ads if you
listen to pandora on your iPhone we
actually had audio ads built into the
API a couple years before we actually
ever played our first device audio ad
but generally that we keep the API
really stable we try to choose our
devices carefully we have to make tough
decisions and we want to be wherever we
can possibly be but the reality is we
need to choose quality devices that are
going to give the user a really good
experience and these last two are
slightly contradictory but the reality
is we're always struggling with both we
want to support as many as we can so how
can we come as you become you as
ubiquitous is coca-cola I think we'd all
like to strive for that we really try to
watch the trends we're trying to make
any snap decisions with respect to you
know which platforms we're going to go
on we want to understand where the
industry is going but generally we want
to continue to work to make Pandora
available in more places I just want to
take a little sidebar to talk about how
the process works because I think I talk
a lot about how all these devices and
how we got there but this is generally
the process we've used for the past four
years we have a dev center where people
can apply for access to our API we go
through some review process then they
start development and they get access to
get a key that gives access to a
developer site in addition to access to
the support team and our documentation
once the devices have proven this is
kind of a key step for us once the
device is developed they send us an
actual physical device that we test and
we run a battery of tests on them over a
hundred tests make sure that thumbs
always register properly make sure that
simple things work and complicated
things work like
simply station creation or station
switching or turning off the device and
where does it drop you back in so that's
been really fruitful for us and very
difficult for our partners it probably
takes one or two iterations we probably
averaged one or two iterations maybe a
few more and with these partners in
getting through the certification
process and once approved we allow them
to launch the product against our
production servers and I guess this
isn't obvious but your account exists
wherever you are so on every platform
and so we also have a sort of device
tying mechanism somewhat akin to a lot
of what the other folks have done like
Netflix so once you tie your device to
your account your stations appear your
feedback is shared across all so what's
really hard for us it's a delicate space
with 400 devices out there and a little
bit stressful like it was left last week
and that makes it really hard for us to
bring new features to the platform we
don't own these app these apps actually
exist on the hardware in the form of
firmware and the management while the
manufacturers occasionally update they
sell them are willing to update our app
so so that's that's pretty hard because
we just made a change to the website
where we shifted to a new sort of a
model for finding tracks and things that
you like with the more modern like
mechanism as opposed to the previous
version which was about bookmarks and
it'll be years before we can proliferate
that change across the platform some of
these partners are putting firmware
updates that have nothing to do with our
app and it breaks and we hear from our
users they hear from the users and we
scramble and also over the years some of
these manufacturers are releasing new
hardware versions with the same app and
a few have forgotten to test so we work
with them and encourage them to test
so what are we doing about it I was
thinking this morning this this slide
was a little more amusing before the
tear gas and bean bag started but I
didn't really get time to remove the
picture and I didn't have a different
joke so I will just have to go with it
particularly cuz our office is about six
blocks from the Okinawa Henry Hank the
plaza and Oakland Frank Frank so what I
was going to say is we should all try to
occupy the device world but uh it's
pretty dark but the reality is we all
want to take control back of our apps
and I don't think I think that will be
beneficial in the long run for all of us
including the device manufacturers so
what's the Silver Bullet we're all
looking for some sort of magical
solution and I think in the space where
the well we should go ask the arm folks
are they going to come with any
standards that could help us maybe we
should join conferences but the reality
is there's no there is no magical
solution there's not necessarily going
to be a way that we can build an app
that it can work on every platform and
not just because the user interface is
different but because the challenges and
technologies are different but there is
this thing called html5 and I think
we're all pretty hopeful that that will
give us a lot of opportunity going
forward so how can we innovate our
product again we want to bring more
features to the platform we want to
another thing we need to do is segregate
our API is a little bit in our
applications where where our devices in
mobile share a share similar API and
they're an entirely different release
schedules and scaling and then
ultimately I think we all again want to
wield back control the product to make
it so that we have complete control not
the device developer or
sure ah yeah so parting thoughts about
the future it seems to me like it's back
to the future the app world is the app
world space is really interesting we get
to it's leveled the playing field you
can make an app you can release it it go
it gets available to all these people
but the reality is it's like shipping a
package software CD because in some
cases it's two weeks before you can
touch it again if there's an issue and I
think that's not going to last in the
long run so it's it's pretty stressful I
mean we find it pretty stressful to have
two weeks tire between some of our app
updates so we'd have to do a ton of
testing just like the olden days when we
were shipping CDs any of you ever ship
CDs I did and then remember the CDR that
was cool and I came out because then you
could do it at the office so anyways I
think the reality is is the device
manufacturers don't really want to be in
the in the app development space either
for them it's a selling units and so I
think they're more than willing to give
us back control but the challenging
thing for them to be to do is to give us
a platform that we can build a really
compelling experience on and so but I
think we're honestly going to see things
change going forward where the app
development space is going to look a lot
more like the web than it does today ah
thanks for having me and hopefully at
least give you some insight into our
story and what yeah we are and we're in
Oakland and it's much safer than it
might seem over the past few days I
didn't I drove right through I did not
smell it to your gas but honestly we
feel like we've just scratched the
surface of a truly ubiquitous Pandora
i'm sure you guys all feel like you have
a ton of work to do there's just so much
there's so many more places we can bring
Pandora to make it an easy personalized
listening experience for our users
thanks for hosting me and I hope you
guys have a good conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
