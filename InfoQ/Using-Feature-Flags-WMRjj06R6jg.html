my all-time favorite techniques for
dealing with large-scale software
complexity and that's a feature flags
now you may have heard of feature flags
under other names that sometimes called
switches they're sometimes called
feature flippers
but generally the concept is exactly the
same and in my opinion this is one of
the highest are roi items that you can
add to a code base
we built when we built these for lanyard
it took an afternoon to put in a basic
mechanism for this and we used it every
day from then on and it gave us an
enormous amount of value so really what
you're trying to get out anytime you're
trying to build high quality software is
you want to bei the mantra of releasing
early and releasing often until your
software is in front of real human
beings you have absolutely no idea how
they're going to use it if you're if
you're if you're even building the right
thing this sum has been further and
further popularized by the Lean Startup
movement which I stole this image from
their website they have this sort of
cycle where you come up with my dear and
then you build it to create the product
then you measure how people are using
the product you take the data from that
you use that to generate more ideas and
really the goal of any startup
especially if you've got a limited
runway is to race around that cycle as
quickly as possible make sure you're
building the right thing now if you want
to build things if you want to iterate
quickly if you want to build things
build things fast when it's just you and
a greenfield development and a text
editor so that's pretty easy you can
knock out features very quickly but what
we found with so we experienced this
firsthand with lanyard as your product
grows and as your development team grows
it gets much harder to build features
and and ship them as what one thing we
found in particular is every time you
release a new feature you have to think
about the way it interacts with all of
your previous features so if it's your
first feature that's really easy but
later on in the development of lanyard
we released a feature called guides
which allowed users to
collect together a set of events s like
my top Python events of 2014 and when we
built that feature we realized that
before we released it we had to figure
out what that was going to look like on
the users page and on the event pages
and how it worked on our topic pages and
how it interact with our mobile apps and
every single feature we'd released
previously was interacting with the new
thing we were building so feature
development takes a lot longer it's a
lot longer to get it writes there's a
there's a lot more complexity involved
it's tempting when you're faced with a
situation to use branches to build a
branch per feature spend spend a bunch
of time in that branch and then merge it
in when you're done but long-term
branches have a whole bunch of their own
problems you find yourself totally
diverging for the functionality of the
main site you're not your new code isn't
getting tested properly and generally
you're you you set yourself up for all
kinds of complexity at the last moment
when you merge it back in and find out
that there are conflicts and feature
interactions that you haven't expected
the alternative to this is to use
feature flags and most companies that
use feature flags actually tend to work
in there in a single main development
branch
they'll spike off little feature
branches for very short periods of time
but but but the aim is always to merge
the new features into the branch as
quickly as possible because what feature
Flags let you do is they allow you to
expose features on your site so a subset
of your user base at first that might
just be your yourself or your all the
rest of your development team you can
then roll the feature out to alpha
testers onto beta testers onto trusted
customers and eventually release it to
your entire audience and this has a
whole bunch of advantages including and
one in particular which is that it means
you can decouple the deployment of the
feature from the release of that feature
you don't find yourself shipping a new
feature and SSA Qing or pushing code up
to all of your servers at once crossing
your fingers and hoping it all works you
can deploy the feature several days
beforehand and then just turn it on when
you're ready to put out your press
release or or do whatever you it is you
would do to to release something it also
gives you Rick's risk free instant
rollback if you turn the feature flag on
and stuff breaks you could just turn it
back off again so I'll talk you through
a couple of implementations of feature
flags and I'll talk about how we did
them at lanyards where we essentially
rolled our own from scratch as a very
simple system and then
I'll explain how Eventbrite does
something quite a bit more comprehensive
using in the open source solution so at
lanyards we had feature flags for all
sorts of things but fundamentally each
one was a identifier which is designed
to be referenced from code and then a
human readable description so we could
tell what the thing was meant to do so
we had a setting with all of our feature
flags in it and then we store the
feature flags in the database there's
not gonna be a great deal of code in
this presentation but I figure everyone
here probably knows what the Django
model looks like so this is a jangle
model for a future flag it has a unique
slug which is that short string it has a
description and it's got a boolean field
saying if it's been switched on for all
of the users of the site or not then we
also have a many-to-many field against
users so we can select zero or more
users that the flag should be enabled
for and we have the same thing against
groups so we can turn on the flag for an
entire group of users and then the
remainder of the implementation is one
method that given a user tells you if
the feature flag is enabled a lot or not
so if each flag is turned on if it's
turned on for everyone or if it's turned
on for the specific user or if it's
turned on for one of the groups that
that user is a member of believe it or
not that was pretty much this was pretty
much the entirety of our initial feature
flag implementation over time we evolved
it a fair bit we added caching to make
sure that it wasn't going to a
completely clobber our database and we
added quite a few helper methods to make
it really easy in code to use these
flags
this is our first helper method this is
a view decorator you can stick it on any
view function that makes up your website
and all it says is that this view
function is only available if the user
has the topic tracking feature flag if
they don't we serve a 404 error because
we don't want people guessing URLs and
sniffing around on a website trying to
figure out what we were going to release
next we have a method on users saying if
user has Flag topic tracking and then
you can have code levels switching
between the featured version and the on
featured version and we also added
feature flags into our template language
we had a custom tag where you can say if
the new Eventbrite flag is on this is
actually the feature flag we used when
we announced the
position because we wanted to make sure
that we put the press release out and
then the an event bright company logo
appeared all over the site
simultaneously so we could flip on the
flag and add that into our footer this
we did add one more feature one more
templates flag because we found that we
had a held a whole bunch of trusted
alpha and beta testers but we turn on
features for them and sometimes they
wouldn't they wouldn't have read the
email saying this was a test feature and
they get excited and start tweeting
screenshots of something that we weren't
ready to release yet so the flag active
template tags means if the feet if the
user has access to the login with
facebook feature and it's not turned on
for every user display in this case a
little alpha only message so they know
not to get too excited and start
tweeting already one very useful feature
flag that we built quite early on which
served us really well was a feature flag
for putting the entire site into
read-only mode and this is it turns out
it's incredibly useful if you're working
with a decent-sized codebase because it
means that you can pretty much freeze
this freeze your site in time do a whole
bunch of maintenance maintenance
activities behind the scenes and then
unfreeze it without ever having to take
the site down and Andrew will be talking
later on about a trick that we quite
quite a big trick that we pulled off
with this so read-only mode you turn the
feature flag on a couple of things
happen you get this yellow banner on
every page on the site and the login
button disappears and we also our
authentication middleware actually
starts ignoring your login cookies so
even if you've logged in already we'll
ignore the cookie and pretend that
you're logged out in lanyards case you
cannot make any modifications it's like
you can't do anything that triggers a
right if you're not logged in so by just
forcing the user into logged out mode
they were unable to make any changes and
we could guarantee that the site would
stay in read-only mode and likewise our
mobile API started ignoring the auth
token so the mobile apps behaved like
the user who's logged out as well while
the while you're in the state you can do
all sorts of things you can clone the
database and do all sorts of things to
the database switch over from one
cluster to another you can do quite
wide-ranging and maintenance tasks and
in fact Andrew later will be describing
how we move from my sequel running on
ec2 to Postgres running on soft
with I think 20 minutes of read-only
mode and no downtime at all so you can
pull up some pretty neat tricks with
with with again just a simple feature
flag now event brights approach to
feature flags is quite different
Eventbrite uses a piece of open software
called gargoyle which was released by
the team at discus the online commenting
the only online commenting system and
unfortunately with all of this stuff
it's quite hard to find decent
screenshots but this one demonstrates
that discuss how switches and it has and
you can set up a whole bunch of
different properties on those switches
so rather than just saying this feature
flag is available for this user you can
say and in fact these are all examples
of things Eventbrite do you can say this
feature is available to any you to these
specific users or anyone who's a member
of staff this feature flag is controls
this is only turned on for these
particular events so it's an event
related feature or these organizers we
use it in our API so we can turn on
specific API endpoints for specific API
keys we can feature fact by country
based on IP address so if you're in
Germany you get some subtle variance and
behavior and we also we can even use it
for those TLDs that nathan was talking
about and to show you how flexible
gargoyle can be and that flexibility
does come at a cost this is the entire
implementation of a rule set saying okay
we want to be able to set conditions on
a switch based on your country and all
you have to do in gargoyle is subclass
condition set give it a storage string
so you can store the country that you
care about it can execute method that
says I I can be this condition can be
applied if you have an HTTP request and
then you have a get field value that
says if the field is country return the
country attribute from the request which
is previously populated by a piece of
middleware you register that and
straightaway you can start assigning
rules to individual feature flags where
you say if the country is Germany this
flag should be enabled there are a whole
bunch of gotchas if you're working with
feature flags one of the most important
to test against is looking out for
unexpected flag combinations it's quite
given the amounts of code that you can
end up feature from and they're playing
behind
like there's always a chance that two
feature flag combinations you haven't
thought of might lead to weird behavior
so generally it's a good idea to try and
keep the things that are affected by
feature flags as separate as possible
and if they are going to overlap make
sure that you queue a things thoroughly
before you before you release them old
feature flag code could get really ugly
these each each of these things
individually it's you know it's an if
this do that else do this it's very it's
relatively easy to it to read but over
time as you accumulate more feature
flags your code base can grow huge
numbers of branches so it's a very
important once a feature is live and
you're sure it's going to stay live that
you strip out all of the feature flag
code for that and that you know that's
that's just generally good practice and
then the last one of course is
performance where if you think about it
any time somebody requests a page of
your website you're doing a whole bunch
of these feature flag checks and so you
can end up doing if you're not careful
you'll end up doing a few like three or
four database queries per page view on
your site gargoyle has a few things in
place to help with performance it's
quite aggressive with caching it'll
cache things in local memory in the
Python process for up to 30 seconds they
will fall back on an external cache
after that but even with all of those
caching layers we found that an event
might scale a huge amount of our network
traffic our internal network traffic was
straight up memcache calls to load
feature flags out of the out of the
cache so we ended up putting a mint a
small memcached instance on every
front-end web server just to host a copy
of the feature flag so at least that
network traffic was was on the local box
and wasn't going out over the network
turns out a lot of companies use feature
flags this is quite interesting this is
the only screen shot I could find a
Facebook's feature flag mechanism which
is called gatekeeper and apparently
allows I think they've extended even
more doubt now they can flag features to
people who've liked a certain thing or
who are employees or have a certain
browser or a certain age or shoe size or
goodness knows what else and back in
2012 let's just cut off there they were
doing over 500 million gate keeper
checks a second and that was a couple of
years ago so you can imagine that
they're doing way more than that now so
this kind of this quite neatly
illustrates that you can scale feature
flags to
so any scale that you like if you're if
you're if you're sensible about the way
you architect them so feature flags once
you have them in place they're kind of a
Swiss Army knife they become something
that you end up hanging all sorts of
other functional functionality off at
lanyard we use them to turn on features
for art for some of our paying customers
so you you know we we didn't even need a
payment system for this initially we
could invoice someone they paid us we
flipped on a feature flag and they got
extra capabilities for their events and
Advent right we've actually been
building an entire a bee testing
framework on top of our existing feature
flag mechanisms so once you have these
this relatively thin abstraction there's
a whole bunch of interesting stuff you
can start building with it
so really the takeaways from this are
you should use feature flags if you're
building pretty much anything at all
it's worth getting feature flags in
there early on and starting to lean on
them don't use long-lived branches go
with get get your code into core and use
feature flags to turn it on and off the
ROI on them as a feature is pretty
ridiculous the amount of effort taken to
get them up and running is tiny and you
will derive enormous value in terms of
improved iteration speed ability and
ability to just get code in front of
human beings and if you are going to
going to going to implement them
gargoyle is a pretty decent standalone
open-source package which will get you
up and running very quickly or if you
decide to roll your own it's really not
a very complicated thing to build and it
can be quite quite fun to get into that
and come up with the exact system that
you want and I've got 10 seconds left I
think there's a question at the back
thank you very much
I wish you told me that half an hour ago
so gutter yep mm-hmm
oh nice okay so don't use garboil use
gutter and zookeeper then awesome
okay thank thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
