how you guys feeling
awake a little pretty good all right
awesome
so I'm gonna talk today about a web
application development workflow which i
think is a really important thing inside
this conference we're hearing a lot of
things around technique and technologies
but I want to spend a little bit time
and focus on how we're actually putting
these techniques to use and what is kind
of the day to day iteration churn kind
of development process that we're using
to do this kind of stuff so really this
is kind of workflow and tooling support
for front-end developers so I wanted to
ask you guys some things so raise your
hands who uses Jas hint or jslint -
that's fine it's good cool okay awesome
a lot who has automated for testing or
deployment so it's not you doing
everything it's kind of some of it's
happening to automatically yeah good -
good - good and who uses one of the
following yeoman live reload or code kit
all right awesome
so pretty much a good 80% of the room
has the use makes good use of tools to
support the workflow and I think this
has kind of been a change that we've
seen over the last few years maybe like
three years ago we didn't have the kind
of tooling support front-end development
that we do now it is and it was more
about knowing the differences between
browser compatibility issues and now
we're able to work directly with tools
that kind of handled that trivia for us
and we're able to operate just focusing
on what's unique about our app this is a
Ran's who used to be an engineering
manager at Apple and he said it's an
engineer there's a short list of tools
you must be rabid about
and he was focusing on his kids kind of
terminal is his text editor workflow and
he's you know be fine what you like to
be passionate about it and care a lot
and so today we're going to walk through
a few things we're gonna walk through
the shell some SSH stuff project
configuration collaboration standards
I'm gonna talk about yeoman for a little
bit do some testing style iteration good
stuff some cool things and the dev tools
and it's gonna be a lot of fun all right
yes good okay first thing with your
shell so commonly if you use you know
OSX and you start up terminal this is
what the shell looks like it has by
default your machine name is like Paul
Irish is MacBook and then it'll have
this little colon and the tilde and then
your name again just for a repetition
and it's just there's no color and it's
just kind of depressing and and you know
like this happened like two weeks ago I
was at a co-worker's machine and he was
it was a new machine and he was getting
set up and I was like okay let's go and
you know install homebrew and he brings
up the terminal and to this and I was
like okay I really don't want to have to
be the guy that's like okay I'm gonna go
fix your machine for you and make it way
better and do it the way that I do
things but like I needed to because this
is just depressing and sad you don't
want this
so prioritize making your shell feel
good to you and it's not that hard so
this is this is my bash prompt there's
many out there this one's pretty simple
and it does a few things but I'm just
gonna show it to you right now cool all
right so let's see I'm just gonna jump
around
a little bit hopping over here touch a
new file hop up here how's it going and
cool so there's a few things going on
here first is that I'm getting the
context to be exactly where I'm
operating I'm also getting information
about my repository status so over here
I was in the master branch and over here
I was in the html5 Devcon branch then I
touched it a new file I'm getting the
immediate feedback that my repository is
a little dirty so I don't have to type
keep typing get status all the time and
then I SSH it into a box that I have and
now I'm getting my username and a
reminder of what machine I'm logged into
just so I can differentiate when I go
between chats the other nice thing that
I have going on is that up at the top
this is this is a thing that I'm really
keen on the name of the title bar
represents the folder that you're in and
this is really good especially when you
have a lot of different tabs being able
to see at a glance as far as what
context you're operating in all right so
good stuff there there's a big community
of people making these kind of
customizations on github these are the
the dot files repositories and so you
can check out a lot of them really
comprehensive stuff all mine are up
there as well I'm going to walk through
a few of my favorites
so this is our just favorite aliases
just a second ago you saw this I'm using
a little directory jumper called Z and
this I can just type in any portion of
the folder name that I want to go do and
it'll just jump right into it
somewhere auto jump which is J is
another one quite similar server is good
for firing up an instant web server so
come back and exit out of this box and
then fire up server we immediately start
up a little simple HTTP server and it
opens up that location in the browser as
well at the same time kind of a good
combo this is a fun one so I recently
found how much I like this
so normally cap will do something like
this and you'll just cut out a file and
it'll look okay sometimes you hit the
hot corner of your screen and then it
locks your screen and then okay good
should disable that but another alias is
C so instead of counting out I'm going
to see it out and so this actually uses
pigment eyes so that I can cat things
kind of basically through syntax
highlighting which just makes for a much
more a nice experience GZ for gzip size
so I can verify that while in fact the
original size of my HTML file is around
127 K after gzip we'll be looking around
24 K good for just kind of on the fly
checks and what I'm actually I haven't
yet found the perfect one yet an extract
function that normalizes between
different types of archives between like
you know tar balls and zips and seven
Z's and all that I I don't remember the
options and the flags for the tar binary
and I haven't found a good one here so
if you know a good one let me know I
suck in extracting archives I'm just
terrible at it alright another thing and
this is okay not necessarily important
but it just is a lot of fun okay first
things first we do a little homebrew and
saw a little app called image snap then
we set up a post commit hook I get
repository just a for liner and what
this is gonna do is take a picture of
you using your built-in camera every
time you make a commit which is really
nice
it can be also like really sad this is
Alex Sexton really just sat you know it
must have been doing like some
document.write hack for ie8 or something
it's just like no but then it also can
capture really successful moments when
you're like yes we got that feature in
hmmm to the repository this is Aaron for
sander who's a developer in Austin and
he just took all of his get shots and
then put them into a single time-lapse
video but it's kind of cool and it's
trivial to to put this together
yeah I can spot there was a short trip
to Dublin in the middle of that that
happens all right under SSH now for the
purposes of this talk I'm just gonna the
backronym I'm gonna use this silky
smooth hopping so if you asses H into a
box and you commonly encounter a
password prompt because it wants you to
log in raise your hand yes good that's
fine the problem I just wanted to
because this is I took way too long to
realize this so the SSH public key that
you made to use github you can use the
same thing you can copy it to your
clipboard this is a little one-liner to
copy whatever to your clipboard and then
once you actually log into the server
just toss the contents of that public
key into the authorized key file on that
server and then you'll never be met with
this password prompt again nice it's
like this small thing but it really just
makes it a lot more powerful now that's
a small one but we can actually make
this a bit better there's a
configuration file for SSH so well we
could let's say we were logging into
this server a few times in the specific
port and a good way to shorten that up
is just to make you a little bash alias
so that we can SSH dev here we can
actually just add this into the
configuration for SSH itself so the
config file looks something like this
specify the hostname the port and then
from there on we can just manage it
there we can also specify identity files
so just point to the public key so if
you want to log in to the same box with
different users it's really trivial I've
never before put an xkcd in one of my
talks but this came out yesterday and I
just had to I'll give you just a moment
to read it I'm not going to
so yeah so this is actually I mean one
of the additional benefits in addition
to just the developer ergonomics of I
log into a box it doesn't prompt me for
a password is when you're sharing access
to a server don't you know create a
login and password and email it out a
much better way is just to say hey send
me your SSH public key they can send
that to you over email it's fine it's no
biggie drop it in and then they can log
in no problem so just a much more secure
and functional way to handle this once I
got this going then I discovered oh my
god SCP SCP is so nice now I can just do
this right from the command-line so this
isn't my dot files it's a little
function where I take whatever file I
have and I toss it up to my web host and
then right after that I copy the new
destination file URL to my clipboard and
just tell me tell me that so that I can
you know I download some awesome
hilarious image and instantly send it up
so that I can share it with everyone
else small handy kind of trivial but
kind of fun deploying on push is
something that I spend a lot of time
looking at and this is probably the best
solution that is not hyper specific to a
specific architecture so you're you're
sending you're working on a repository
but you want to deploy the contents of
their repository whenever you push up to
it and whenever anyone else pushes up to
it too
and you want that just happen
transparently so first throw get on your
server journey an SSH key on that server
and then you add a deploy key to github
and there so there's two ways that you
could have done this you could have
added the server's SSH key to your user
but you can also just add it as a deploy
key to first specific repository the
difference here is that deploy keys are
specific to a repo so let's say that the
server was compromised someone could not
use
someone could only affect that specific
repo and not all the repos that you your
user has access to so it's a bit safer
then this is a this is a short pH deploy
PHP very readable and these are actually
been notes that I'm cribbing these
bullets from this miss Geist
last piece is you add a service hook so
on github you can just there's all these
different kinds of service hooks and you
point to one one of the other hooks that
I use a lot is IRC and so on all pushes
a little bot will come in one of my IRC
channels and just say the summary and
have links to it it's really nice in
groups for collaborating so you can just
have a hook and from then on when you
push to your repo or anyone else does
github posts the Jason summary of it to
the deploy and your server holds em
latest everything's gravy and you're
good alright moving on to kind of
project configuration type stuff so so
this is a pretty exciting spot where we
can actually editor config allows us to
specify some white space policy that we
might have so if you let's say that your
project this is a tabs project or it's a
spaces project and it's a four spaces
project and and yes we do want a new
line at the end of the file and we want
no trailing whitespace so you can define
that declaratively in a dot editor
config file and then there's also
plug-ins for every editor imaginable
that can read in that file and apply
those rules to to your project and so
the cool thing here is that you're able
to
I set up a style guideline for for the
repository and have all the editors do
the work for you so that you're not
keeping track of the standards in every
place another similar one is je s hint
RC so you're familiar with Jase hint
descent RC takes the configuration that
you're using and just makes it into a
single configuration file that's that's
for that repository so let's say these
Global's are allowed and then these
options are allowed here so that's what
that looks like but the cool thing here
is that tools like your editors jsn
integration grunt other tools that run a
linter against your JavaScript can read
that file and and everyone else working
on the same repository is is evaluating
against the same code quality guidelines
so the really nice thing here is that
they're able to standardize your style
guide as a team and agree on what these
rules are but more importantly you're
able to Tula fie it and I think that's
really important I think that all code
style rules should be backed by tooling
you shouldn't have something that is
just a rule that people find out because
they file a pull request and you're like
yeah nice pull requests but we actually
need spaces inside the parens or
something like that and it's just it's
not a fun experience when you're
contributing to a project and the code
review is is style knits right so you
use tooling to defend code style all
right so I'm gonna bring up yeoman real
quick right after I check my slides
yeah good okay great good all right so
who has seen seen a little bit about
yeoman gotten a view of it and who has
used it cool okay awesome
so yeoman is a project that I've been
working on with a team at Google and
also a team of external contributors to
kind of try and codify a lot of the
workflow best practices that we've seen
over the past few years and try and make
that into one kind of one project that
captures this so essentially it's an
open-source set of frameworks tools
tools that exist out there open-source
projects that exist out there with the
goal of building compelling web
applications and so it has things built
into it like Audrina authoring
abstractions linting and two priority is
good developer ergonomics so it's built
on tools like grunt also things like
compass and sass and CoffeeScript
first-class module support with AMD and
requirejs and we also have an experiment
for ACMA script six modules if you want
to kind of play around with that it was
just added to like one script six this
summer and you can author in it and
it'll work kind of trance piles it down
bootstrap html5 boilerplate moderniser
Twitter Bauer's package manager the MOCA
test suite phantom Jas headless webkit
and a very rich build system so I'm
going to show a little bit of what
yeoman does we're going to hop over here
and I will make a new folder and call
off yeoman init
well alright so first it's gonna ask me
a few questions it's gonna ask me would
I like to install Twitter bootstrap yes
and the j/s plugins yes am I gonna use
Andy modules yes and I'm gonna skip ACMA
script six modules for now and that
sounds good to me
well okay cool cool all right
so I answered those questions twice and
then and then as a result it created a
bunch of files so it scaffolded out my
files is we have bootstrap in here we
also have a mocha test suite and so
let's just start it up I'm just gonna
get a hint cool so there's just a few
commands in in yeoman itself and I'll
kick this off so yeoman server does a
few things and not only starts up a
little preview server and it opens up a
tab but it also is handling a watch with
recompilation built into it so I'm not
bringing this down here switch over here
and open up my editor now cool so let's
say body background app IO whip it's a
fantastic color
oh and so faint teal okay that's much
better so I'm just hitting save and over
here immediately my watch task is
noticing that the file has changed we're
running compass on my styles and then
doing a live reload on the page itself
I'm gonna add in a few more things to
say I'm gonna take actually the
container of the page and I'll just set
it to 500 this is a yeah cool this is a
new tool called Emmet which is made by
the guy who made then coding and he's
like we should do the same thing in CSS
so you do W 500
and it expands out to with 500 and then
you do something like transform with a
dash you hit tab you get some of this
it's pretty cool and I'll just add in
some little bit of rotation yeah sweet
now that's pretty rad but we can do a
little bit more inside yeoman and so I
want to kind of walk through exactly
what we do but first one of the
priorities that we have with this
project is that we want to be able to
continue to improve it based on how
people are using it so part of the
project is actually a small tool called
insight and what this actually does is
it's instrumentation that users can opt
into that reports what these commands
are so I just ran yeoman init and yeoman
server and these can get reported up to
Google Analytics if you're okay with
that and and then we get a pretty cool
report so this is the report and this is
publicly available and so this is not
website data but this is traffic from
traffic it's use of the actual command
line tool
and so you can see this was launched and
then it kind of like slowed down a
little bit people like no not so sure
and then they're like okay maybe it is
actually okay that's pretty fun and so
these are the kinds of things that that
people are doing running yeoman server
and yeoman init like we just did but
also starting off projects with angular
and backbone or adding handlebars to
their application so the cool thing here
is we're able to see kind of what the
most popular javascript libraries that
people are adding to their application
are and also answer questions like how
long does it take for people to upgrade
to the newest version of yeoman after we
ship it so it's nice to have that
tooling in there but at the same time
one of the other things that we've done
is we've had an auto update to it so the
tool is itself command line tool updates
and this is based on semantic versioning
so major minor patch if the patch
version goes up we're just going to
update you automatically but if it's a
minor our major change will prompt you
in and ask you if you're cool with that
first and then yeoman is really meant to
not only provide you a good workflow but
be a kind of community watering hole as
far as figuring out what the best
practices are for application
development and kind of have consensus
on this and so it might change over time
but we want to be able to identify
exactly how we're going to do things
with with the whole community involved
one of the things that we did inside the
developer community recently is uglify
j/s which is when the most popular
javascript minifiers was doing a
campaign to raise money to to write the
new version and so yeoman and actually
chrome developer relations was happy to
contribute to that campaign and one of
the things that were very excited to see
is it'll be gaining the ability to
generate source Maps when you minify
javascript which is which provides a lot
more rich debugging and experience
now I wanted to talk about package
management and kind of what we're doing
inside of yeoman to handle this well
first of all package management is
really important because client-side
dependencies are a chore and I can say
this because in part of my 20 percent
time at Google I work on the JavaScript
libraries CDN and so we actually have a
good idea as far as of all the jquery's
that people pull down from that CDN how
many are actually the latest version
versus an old version like one point
four point three and a lot of times
people you know don't go back and update
and some of that is due to because I'm
not so sure if that jQuery plug-in that
I was using was actually tested on the
new thing or the jQuery UI is one point
six and does that work on the jQuery one
point eight I don't know and so there's
this dependency management that is not
exactly clear and and you have to figure
that out on your own so what this
happens at an ecosystem level is that
common code gets duplicated even just
writing our project like shipping a
library and saying that you depend on
jQuery is becoming almost uncool these
days so everyone is writing their own
small Ajax helper or you know their
underscore equivalent that's not good so
this is leading to library fragmentation
disjoint communities and I think it
could get better a lot of times I look
at kind of the node community's packaged
ecosystem or rubies and I'm just like I
really I want that like Ruby community
is like very active about learning about
new packages and finding ways to
integrate it so that you don't have to
maintain all the code in your
application and you can leverage other
open source projects that write that for
you so we can address this and I'll show
you a little bit about what we have
inside yeoman for package management so
all right cool
so inside yeoman we're using Twitter
Bower which is a package management
package manager that came out just about
two months ago and so I'm gonna first
search for all the backbone packages
that are available inside the registry
and there's quite a few of them the the
normal backbone is here but we also have
a lot of libraries that sit on top of it
so in this case I'm just gonna install
backbone RPC now the cool thing that
happens here is that I want bakwin RPC
and this is a add-on to facilitate RPC
with backbone clearly but it depends on
backbone obviously and backbone depends
on underscore and jQuery so this is
actually fetching all these formants
recursively handling my dependencies and
ensign them and now it's pulled all
those down I can verify what exactly is
now in my repository with backbone
underscore and jQuery and also do one
other pretty cool thing so I'm gonna
also pull down another app another
package called backbone local storage
yes
so this is a really fantastic because a
lot of times in your app keeping track
of all the new versions of everything
and making sure that you're running the
latest ones with any sort of security
issues or just speed improvements is
kind of annoying so in this case we can
actually read out we can get a listing
the fact that this dependency I have
installed one point two point six but
one point three point three is now
shipping and available so I have this
information right here displayed to me
so I can go and make a decision about
how I want to handle resolving that all
right next is generators and this is a
pretty cool feature that we didn't get
to talk quite a bit about so far the
generators is actually what I used when
I said yeoman in it and it brought Oh
created all those files for me but it's
a totally configurable process so we can
start out new projects with a number of
different kind of boilerplate templates
but it's a lot more customizable than
that so we can pull dependencies and
filter down you know I want backbone but
I really don't want it the test suite or
I don't want to you know pull down the
minified file that's normally included
in the repo they can wire things up to
make sure that you're required j/s
configuration is actually now referring
to this dependency that I just pulled
down and then we have sub generators for
augmenting the application with new
models and new views and I'm gonna show
a little bit of this the generators that
are available right now look like this
we have support for your common
JavaScript MVC libraries angular
backbone ember backbone boilerplate and
we're gonna show a little bit of what it
looks like with the amp angular
generator so come back here I'm gonna
make a brand new project and I'm going
to kick off the whole thing we
an angular generator that's created a
bunch of files and so let's start this
up The Omen server nice
all right
so
all right so we have a basic look it
looks like we don't even have default
styles but it's booted up and this
application is has angular available and
I'm gonna pull up one of its controllers
so this is its may not even clear this
is one of the controllers for angular so
you can actually see it's defining an
array of things and if I augment it and
hit save again yeoman is detecting that
file changed and we can take care of a
reload just for us now I'm gonna add I'm
gonna add a small little piece of
functionality to this application see if
I can do it quickly yes yes
good
you see yeah one of the things I like
here is that I have Jase hint running
live against my against my code and so
I'm getting these little white
highlights and if I look down at the
bottom it tells me that I have a missing
semicolon so I can make sure that I
correctly add a semicolon and deal with
that so now I'm gonna hop over to the
view that controls this and let's see if
I can deal with this all right input
ng-model
new awesome thing and then button
that's right yeah I think let's see
let's try it out
what do you think
yeah this scope is totally it undefined
oh this is what you're saying
Thanks yeah that's nice okay that's fine
all right so this is pretty rad aside
from my bad scope this is that's why
there were white borders around it I was
like why it's still yelling at me I put
the semicolon there no you're totally
right okay cool good so now I've just
added interaction to the application in
a quick short time so this is a kind of
rapid iteration that yeoman is is
providing alright let's come back here
and move forward
so in summary scaffold out new projects
and augment them very quickly library
compilation of sass of CoffeeScript live
refresh of that action
AMD module first-class support and even
I didn't get to show this but writing
unit tests running your mocha or Jasmine
test suite inside a headless webkit
automatically for you and a very very
robust build script that does all the
things that you want to so good so 109
for is out there you can check it out
more on yeoman i/o and also the github
project where there's a big community
having good discussions there so I'm
gonna move on to testing there's a few
things in here that I think are really
rad this is local tunnel a quick little
app that you can just take and say I
want to tunnel out my local port 8000
and it just creates a publicly
accessible version of that this is good
not only for just sharing your localhost
with another developer but also if you
have an application working in local
host here you want to test it on your
phone something like that
testa is a really exciting project that
I've been watching closely
and this is a able to tackle running
your test Suites
in the command line via browsers via
headless webkit so I can have my test
suite defined inside mocha for instance
and then run it all in kind of this
tabbed interface where I can get my
success reports or my calls or my back
trace on any sort of air
it handles launching Chrome and Safari
and opera all for you and kind of does
those awesome work for you and even has
good continuous integration set up and
lastly on device testing if you're doing
mobile work dealing with the different
devices that you need to make sure you
have compatibility for of course is
pretty challenging but the story there
beyond having these devices yourself is
getting better you probably are aware of
browser stack where you can log in and
test desktop browsers but they also have
a lot of mobile browsers through
emulators which is not as good as the
real thing but it is still pretty good
so you can just log in they use a kind
of a flash virtual thing just test that
out app that app quack is has a new
service that's available where you can
take a site and say I want screenshots
of this in mobile browsers and it's
actually going to take screenshots of it
and about I think 30 different phones
and all the browsers available that it
can so upper mobile Android stock
browser dolphin Firefox beta and chrome
on Android so this is really good
especially if you have a Content site
where you need to make sure that the
compatibility is really strong across a
number of different combinations and
lastly there's a new kind of ecosystem
of open device labs where you can just
go to a place in person and they'll have
a bunch of devices and you're welcome to
kind of test things out there there's a
great one in Portland there's one in
Oakland there's one in DC and there's a
lot in Europe and this site lab is
focused on identifying all these places
pointing you to them and providing
support for for those labs so that they
have all the devices available and kind
of work with browser and device
manufacturers so that they can get good
ones all right last thing on testing is
just to have fun with it
this is a test reporter made for mocha
instead of the normal fail never
and detects we go through you get a nice
all right cool
all right on to style iteration I like
to spend a little bit time on this
because we do spend quite a bit of time
tweaking our styles and going back and
forth so I'm gonna do a little bit of
demoing and hopefully hopefully it works
out you there yeah okay cool now all
right so this is html5 please I've
running it here in localhost and first
thing I'm gonna go over here and just
pretend like you never even saw what I
did great alright so if I bring up the
dev tools and I select this section here
now we have this h1 we have some styles
and I can click over to the source file
exactly this part of the source file and
I can do a live at it right here
and so maybe you want to kind of tweak
some changes here and just have you know
full live at it as if it's a as if it's
a text file or a text editor now that's
pretty cool
but if you notice actually this was
compiled from SAS and so it's kind of
silly to be editing this when the
original source is incest and so a lot
of people have asked about a better way
for handling this and so this is
actually the first time that I want to
preview a feature in the chrome dev
tools to deal with this so right now I
just hit question mark which is a
keyboard shortcut for shortcuts but I'm
just using it to get over to here which
is some fun experiments so the one that
I'm looking for is
for sass and so I'm going to show you
what it does but it's pretty cool
alright now refresh the page bring back
up dev tools and Risa liked this h1 no
there's a slight difference in what
we're seeing here
we still see our rendered styles and we
can edit these but we're actually
pointing to the s CSS file right here on
the right hand side and if I click
through to that I'm now looking exactly
at my original sass file with my extends
and with my nested selectors and if I
actually enable and say library load and
then I make a change like let's augment
this this text shadow I right-click and
I hit save as and I just have to do this
once just once I hit replace and now I
got a change so this is pretty rad I can
be able to make changes on the fly
inside my sass and get immediate
feedback without having to go back to a
browser or worry about that just to make
it a little bit more fun I'm going to
drop the current text shadow and turn it
up a notch
semicolon yeah
that's pretty hard it's just abusive
text shadow with sass that's good cool
so now we have a finally inspection and
support for for sass and this is kind of
be in progress a little bit more of the
feature is gonna be developed before
it's ready to ship but I'm really
excited about where it is right now all
right coming back
I'm going to show off live at it so
bring out webstorm webstorm is a
fantastic ide for doing web development
and they've quickened their release
cycle so I think they release every six
weeks or so but they're very closely
tracking what the community is doing so
they have jazz hands they have to ask
things like this so it's really exciting
so the first thing that you'll notice is
that as I'm selecting just I'm I'm
literally just clicking around in my
HTML but chrome is always aware of that
and it's it's highlighting these
elements as I'm clicking around and now
if I turn on live at it and I'm gonna
bring this over here and I'm live at it
any change that I make inside webstorm
will just be represented immediately
over inside chrome it was really cool I
think
yeah
lastly I just wanted to bring up guard
guard is kind of the command line
version of a lot of this sort of thing
of just when files change monitor it
because I'm gonna do some action the
slides that you're looking at I actually
used guard to develop them so I'm gonna
bring up my slide my slides cool so
here's my slides I wrote most of them
and basically marked down and then I
wrote my Styles in in sass so what I
have is actually this is my guard file
and I can basically just say hey
whenever the slides markdown changes I
want to run this a little bit of Python
that's gonna take care of rendering out
the markdown into my HTML deal with the
templating do that whenever my style
sheet inside sass changes please run
compass against it and so I could just
do that and over here all I run is guard
and it just takes care of all the rest
for me so it's kind of a nice low-tech
way of handling that kind of power a few
more things inside chrome dev tools that
I want to show real quick we have a lot
of people asked about a multi-line
console and I want to show you kind of
how does it works now so if I open up
sources you see we have this new
navigation panel where I can collapse my
abuse bring this back you'll notice this
third guy right here which is snippets
and so snippets is basically a
multi-line console but persistent so I
can create a new item here we're just
right-clicking and calling it whatever
it is and then let's say I want to just
write out any sort of function
I don't know what I'm gonna do
console.log success and then bring up
the console and we hit play just
evaluate it so we have syntax
highlighting and it all works but it
since it is persistent you're able to
retain a little bit more of the common
things that you use so this here is a
script that I typically like to use so
first it's a small little get script
handler just to you you pass it a URL
for a JavaScript in it guts it and then
inside we're gonna do something so first
I'm just gonna make sure that this does
indeed work okay cool
it is working now put back the good
stuff oh yeah that's good that's really
good yeah my favorite part about corn fi
is that it adds these adjectives in
front of all the headlines so fun html5
pleased and lovely animations happy
audio wonderful so good alright the
other thing I should point out actually
on this topic is that because these are
treated as basically JavaScript files
that operate inside the context of your
application we can do a little bit more
than you normally would be able to do
with a multi-line console so I can set a
breakpoint and then hit play and we're
totally just broken it's broken like a
normal break point where I can
investigate what's going on here and see
what's up and if you notice there's a
new feature just to remind you that your
page is indeed paused you're not going
to be able to to to do anything with it
so don't try okay sure
good now over for mobile there's a few
new features that might not know about
so this right here is a multi-touch
finger paint demo that I worked on with
some friends but it only works with
touch and so I'm actually clicking right
now but it's not doing anything because
it's it's simply only bound to touch
start and touch touch move so I'm gonna
bring up the file I just hit command o
for this little shortcut guy and down
here you can see we're just binding to
touch that in touch move normally that's
a pain and you're like well I gotta open
up my device and test it over there but
nowadays we can come over to our
overrides panel inside the chrome dev
tools settings by the way I am using the
question mark to bring this up but I
could go down to the bottom right where
this little there's a little cog icon to
bring up this now in here is emulate
touch events so now if I select that and
refresh I can now get my touches so this
is huge for dealing with with mobile
development so that you can be able to
maintain your development on the desktop
for a little bit longer but let's see
you'll notice that on this page when I
change between here and here we have
looks like a CSS transition and probably
media queries that's optimizing this for
a little smaller screen let's take a
look at how I'm doing that I'm going to
hit command a command option F for
search across all files and I'm gonna
search for a at media just see what
media queries are active click over to
this and okay cool so we have a little
media query and I'm max width of 780
it's making this happen now normally
let's say I'm gonna go in here
and change this to max device-width flex
device width is specific to devices and
you can't emulate it on the desktop
normally but now inside the same view
you're going to click off device metrics
and then you can even come up here to
your the user agent spoofing and say I'm
gonna spoof let's say next s and it
automatically populates the device
metrics with the the metrics of that
specific device which in this case is
480 by 800 and so it resizes the context
of the page and that's why there's grey
is here so we can kind of test around
and and any of those sorts of device
media queries will be emulated as well
as okay in this case the user agent and
some other great stuff in here like
overriding geolocation and device
orientation is really handy for testing
all right
is not the end of my talk
okay
good great okay it's close to it though
all right
in closing find your tool chain be proud
of it don't this is a this is a great
site called set up where you can catalog
what software that you use I'm also like
things like Chrome extensions and
sublime text plugins that you use can
just be populated here and there's
actually a client there's a there's a
little app that indexes your system for
you so that you don't have to do all the
work it's really nice be proud of the
tool you are you know you should feel
rabid about the tools that you're using
and the other thing is also don't be
content with the tool chain that using
think about like possibilities there's
that this is a number of workflow
resources out there for optimizing your
workflow and other other experiments
people have tried and written up so I'll
send out the slides link later you can
click around these so your job as a
developer isn't just a developer but to
continually learn how to develop better
so be open to kind of what you could be
do be impatient with your workflow with
any sort of repetition and think about
crazy ideas that could happen recently
Pamela Fox said imagine if we had a code
coverage for front-end integration tests
so all the things that users are doing
on the site we know that all of those
are captured by our selenium tests that
would people I don't think we're very
far off from that things like the github
commit status API was recently added so
what this does is let's say this is a
pull request on moderniser and it's a
small fix and we're getting this
feedback here that it's good to merge
Travis for a continuous same integration
has taken this patch applied it to the
host repo and run the test suite and
it's green after doing all that work so
that's a really powerful continuous
integration set up and I encourage you
to think of other ways to kind of
augment and create a richer continuous
integration story for your code so in
summary if you're repeating your
Oh chances are someone's written
software to automate it and if they
haven't you're about to and you should
one feature that is brand new it is a
big deal i'ma show you to you now it's
I'm really excited styled console
messages guys this is so good all right
console logs right I'm gonna open this
guy up bring him down to the bottom and
jump over the console now if I bring
these out yes
nice boring one oh good looking one so
basically all this is is just a little
bit of style to apply over here and we
play it with the C Firebug already has
the support it's now in chrome dev tools
and in fact I think I might actually
have another one over in snippets yes
okay so here's another short message but
this time we're going to take a little
bit more CSS and apply that maybe some
text shadow some good stuff still output
it here see how this goes oh yeah oh
yeah that's good all right guys that's
it for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
