going to be doing a hands-on deep dive
into the code this is a much much higher
level talk hopefully will be refreshing
to you since you've been crammed full of
lots of tidbits and great things to
build your skills which is awesome and
now i'm going to share a little bit
about how you can take those skills back
to the World Wide Web yes the World Wide
Web so I'm Diane by the way my name is
Diane Tate and I work at Mozilla and
I'll share a little bit more about the
group that I work with because it ties
into exactly what I'm going to share
about so the whole idea of giving back
with your skills in your coding ties
directly to the Internet itself and the
principles of the internet and the web
and this screen shot right here is a
picture of mozillas mission and values
we call it the manifesto and some of
these are the core principles of why
missoula exists and those are
inextricably linked to the world wide
web itself and some traits and
properties that we believe the web
embodies and a lot of those encapsulate
the ability to give back to contribute
to create Mozilla as an organization
believes that the web is a public
resource that lives and breathes and
thrives not only through people
consuming it but contributing creating
and building it and that's where
developers really come in developers are
critical to this so I just circled and
highlighted some of the key concepts
from our manifesto that embody this it's
a public resource it offers everyone the
ability to shape that so it's not top
down it's not command and control it's
truly a universal resource that is
shaped and built by everybody so why
Mozilla so there's obviously lots of
things you can do on the web lots of
places you can go lots of ways to
contribute and I am a huge cheer leader
and advocate of all those ways there's
lots of nonprofits out there that you
can use your coding skills for and this
talk in no way minimizes those if you
feel a passion or have an affiliation
with a group that is serving people
through your coding skills by all means
do it get involved and follow your
passion and give back where you want to
give back
today I'm talking about Mozilla one
because it's where I'm from and I know
it and I can talk about it but also we
are a non-profit and that's something
that a lot of people actually don't
realize that by giving to Mozilla you're
not giving to a corporation you're
actually giving to the web directly our
entire mission and purpose for existing
is to advance the health of the web so
we don't make money off of our users in
the ways that other companies do and
we're not our target is not to grow each
quarter or grow our profits grow our
users we want to do that to have an
impact on the web and it's all about
making the web healthier and better for
everyone to contribute and to advance
those core values that I was just
talking about so that's why I can with
good conscience encourage you to
participate and contribute and some of
the things that I'm going to share about
Mozilla because it's a direct line item
to the web itself so to speak and one of
the things I'll share when I'm talking
about all these programs and all these
things that are at Mozilla it's really
about people I just added the slide now
because earlier I saw this and granted
it's for bittorrent so there's a little
bit more backstory to this slide but i
loved the tagline of its people over
servers and at mozilla if there's
anything that i hope you will take away
from what i'm going to share with you
today is that by contributing or getting
involved at mozilla you are not creating
a product for somebody else to monetize
or capitalized but you are joining a
community and community is absolutely
what lets us do what we do in in an
amazing David and Goliath type of way we
are only less than 1,000 employees and
yet we compete with companies that have
far more resources than us they dwarf
not only our staff but our budget and
it's all because of our community we
have people all around the world that
help and join alongside of us and they
are part of our community so at the end
of the day when you contribute and
participate you become a Mazzilli on
which is awesome so enough context
setting hopefully you're excited now so
i'll just get into
specifics that's all I'm going to do for
the rest of this this very short talk is
just to share specific things that you
can do in ways that you can plug in and
yes you can find them on a wiki on a
website but there's so much information
and so much out there that it can be
overwhelming so I'm going to just lay
out a few ways that you can plug in just
to whet your appetite and hopefully that
will be helpful and so I'll start with
some of the things that are in the area
that I work on which is called developer
relations because again it's about
developers as people and holding hands
and joining forces to make the web
better so the last talked briefly
mentioned stack overflow I'm sure most
of you are very familiar with stack
overflow so a couple of months ago we
launched a Mozilla area on stack
overflow and this is a way for you to
get your toes dip your toe in the water
I should say so we have a section that
talks about our developer tools which
I'm sure a lot of you have been talking
about today so it's a it's a way not
only to get information and to ask
questions but if you have information
that you can share to help others using
developer tools stack overflow is a way
to get involved without too deep of a
commitment it can definitely be an ad
hoc way to participate and contribute
and included some of the links to the
mozilla section on Stack Overflow here
so that's just one lightweight real easy
way to get can get started and
contribute another resource that we have
at Mozilla is called the Mozilla
developer network and it's we get over
two million unique visitors every month
so it's something that a lot of people
use whether they come back regularly or
they just find it on search most that
people actually find it on search it's
basically a vast repository of
documentation on various open web
technologies so this is not the Mozilla
stack this is the web so you can find
stuff on CSS html5 JavaScript you can
also find stuff that Mozilla is
specifically championing like our
Firefox OS mobile operating system but
in comprised largely of web technologies
so this is a great resource and it is a
huge wiki so in addition to consuming
content from it in the spirit of the web
you can also contribute you can QA
documentation
you can localize it we have a number of
people that actually localized various
portions of the web we have a team in
Italy that translated all the pages of
this in Italian we've got lots of active
people that localize this so that people
in their own communities can take
advantage of it and then of course you
can also code for it you can contribute
code as well another way that you can
read write and code is on hacks so we
have a blog called Mozilla hacks and
it's a way for developers to do a deeper
dive into specific use cases or problems
that they're facing and other developers
are able to share so this is not just a
blog that Mozilla staff people write and
share about what Mozilla is doing this
is a developer centric blog and we often
have guest writers in fact we love it
when people do guest posts so if you've
been working on a problem and you want
to share about it and you want to go
into the code and outline how you solve
that problem hacks is a great
opportunity for you to do that if we get
200,000 unique visitors every month the
hacks blog and people are very targeted
it targets developers just like you so
it's a great way to also get involved we
also have something called the Mozilla
marketplace this is for apps web apps
both desktop web apps and the mobile
operating system apps that we are
launching in developing countries all
over the world so you can certainly
submit an app to the marketplace which
is awesome you can also review apps so
you can join hands with lots of
contributors in fact we get about four
hundred apps every week and the bulk of
them about ninety percent of the apps
that are submitted are reviewed by our
community members so again it lets us do
so much more people like you and people
in the community enable us to actually
offer a global web offering around the
world so the app marketplace is a great
way to also just take on work as you're
able to as your workload allows yeah
it's more like a review process although
we do have people reviewing the code so
that's a great question I'm pretty sure
you can do both i'm not sure how we work
with contributors in the code reviews
but contributors do everything at
mozilla so i'm happy to get back to you
actually and find that out so yeah I'm
just I'll have my contact info at the
end as well I'm just died at mozilla com
but so I'm sorry the question was as can
contributors actually review the code
within the apps or do they just review
the apps for the standard things that
reviewers review like how usable is it
how useful is it does it crash that kind
of thing so I will definitely get back
to you good question and then of course
the new schwag today our phones so we
have phones if you are an app developer
and you say you've built an app on
Android or you built an app on iOS and
you want it to be a web app we have lots
of programs to encourage you to migrate
your app or port your app over we've
partnered with Adobe and Cordova on that
and we have lots of programs to
encourage successful app developers to
build for the web we want the web to be
successful and so we want good apps to
be in our app ecosystem so you can check
that out that we have we basically have
phones for apps and so we have a
developer reference phone called the
flame phone we came out with a different
phone about a year ago called the geeks
phone and these are for developers to
actually throttle performance and play
with different settings so the phones
are optimized for that you can purchase
the phone on a retail website and if you
don't want to buy it like I said you can
actually port your app over and
participate in one of these programs and
there's details on the hacks blog so if
you just look up flame or Firefox OS
phone and if you can't find it on the
hacks blog for some strange reason you
can always email me and i'll send you
the links to those phones for apps
programs a neglected to do that in this
slide and then finally events today
we're in an event they're an amazing
opportunity to learn to connect
contribute and because we're a global
organization were all over we're
constantly going to events of various
sizes events are a big priority for us
this year and we go to a number of
JavaScript events as it should be
obvious to a couple of big events that
were target
this year our Brazil j/s next month I
believe these are both in August and jas
conf you and again this is something
that is not a top-down effort not much
is at Mozilla so we really partner and
work with our communities to have a good
solid presence at these events and it's
a great way to meet people at Mozilla
meet other community members and we want
to be creative so if you have creative
ideas about how to make a mark or have a
good fit print at an event rather than
just the old booth or speaker kind of
thing we are totally open to creative
solutions and ideas for that and the
link that I included at the bottom of
this slide is just how you can find out
where we're at so we have a website that
just says where is Mozilla and this is
all kinds of sizes and flavors of events
around the world and then finally this
is just kind of a summary of the
resources some of that I've talked about
and some of them will take you to
resources so you can get plugged in and
then that's just my website down there
but my email again is just my first name
Diane at mozilla com and that's all i
have for you today so we have a few
minutes if you have any questions thanks
for hanging
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
