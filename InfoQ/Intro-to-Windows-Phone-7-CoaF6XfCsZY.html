minutes and then my colleague Reza here
is going to come up and walk through
some of the basic development techniques
for windows phone that's more what Reza
does in every single day so you may have
been aware that Microsoft had a product
before Windows Phone that we had a
windows mobile product you may have
heard of that it had been around for
some time and you know it was an
interesting product for its time and but
but the rest of the realization had hit
somewhere around 2007 around june two
thousand of seven exactly that maybe we
had to rethink the way we were doing the
product and so the first thing that
happened I mean you know we sat down and
we said what the heck do we need to do
here and basically you know the
realization was and I know this sounds
like not rocket science but the phone is
not a PC and then fundamentally you
really have to approach it as a
different thing altogether from an
end-user perspective from a user
experience perspective and and so you
know when it came to framing what the
tenants of this new phone product was
going to be the everything had to serve
driving and outstanding end-user
experience that was really the primary
primary goal driving the prime directive
if you will around the whole product
secondly hardware here we wanted to
enable third-party OEMs to innovate but
we didn't want it to come at the cost of
a stable and standard application
platform because we do recognize we had
this problem with windows mobile there
were millions of different types of
devices out there with thousands of
different types of hardware and what it
meant that if you
an application for a windows phone or
windows mobile device you weren't
guaranteed it was going to work on every
windows mobile device because the
hardware varied so wildly so we knew we
needed to have a model that imposed
standards of some kind the third item
was platform here because if you want an
outstanding product I mean you
absolutely now stand a part of a key
part of an outstanding end-user
experience on a phone is thousands of
apps and games with which to customize
the device and Microsoft is no stranger
to development platform we've been
focusing on development platform for 35
years has really been a core focus of
the company and you know we wanted to
take all that knowledge in history and
assets and you know the products that we
have visual studio.net framework we want
to bring that and leverage all of that
to create an outstanding platform that
would jumpstart a new ecosystem so this
is just a little bit of about what was
some of the design inspiration here and
we shown this slide so much I you guys
probably seen it you're basically
international transportation signage was
part of the underlying design
inspiration of this product because it's
instantly recognizable it's clean it's
focused on the content itself not the
chrome and you know it has a global
presence and and so we wanted to create
a product that echoed these themes and
and / mutated these themes and and so
this is what we came up with which is
what we call the Metro design system for
windows phone and I'll show you this on
the phone actually because I don't want
to waste too much time on you know I
mentioned hardware's consistent hardware
specs you can find all of this online so
I'm not going to waste time on the
slides
so I've got a got a Windows Phone here
running there we go so the first thing
you'll notice here and so this is a
little program that's streaming the
video directly out of the phone you'll
notice you're the first thing we're
showing we're showing some information
on the lock screen we're showing
information that's relevant to you on
the lock screen the idea as I said you
know we talked about outstanding and
user experiences what were some of these
things how did this manifest itself well
one of the things that we wanted to one
of the guiding principles in that in
that in that area was being getting
people access to the information they
care about as quickly as possible so you
obviously you care if you have an
appointment coming up and so we show
appointments we show missed emails we
show and this is not anything you know
rocket science but it does demonstrate
some of the key principles behind the
user experience you know and we can
enforce a pin for based on your email
server and this is our home screen the
start tiles the live tiles this is
completely user customizable the user
can remove anything no operator OEM can
put anything here permanently you know
per our guidance you know the user has
to have complete control of the system
and you know they can change the color
the accent color here they can move the
tiles around and they can pick different
applications to put here as well so and
these are not just static buttons
obviously you see there's things
changing here and moving around and I've
got a traffic status there this is a
these are live tiles they update
dynamically third-party application
developers can leverage this with our
push notification service to create an
experience that updates dynamically on
screen so I've got whether dynamically
updating here I've got traffic status
and then some of the native experiences
I've got an email message sitting there
and I won't go through my email right
now but yeah and here's a Twitter client
showing me number of tweets that I
haven't read yet obviously there's a lot
of tweets out there and you'll notice
the third party applications actually
leverage some of this look and feel as
well we make it very easy in Visual
Studio we have templates and I'm
you sound a bit like a salesman here so
I'll tone it down but but the third
party templates actually make it very
easy to create applications that
leverage these these paradigms this
panorama control that we're looking at
here the panorama basically is sort of a
compelling manner to look at all the
animation everything you get for free
you just you drag and drop this control
or you create a new panorama control
project and residents show you this when
he gets to that but the other paradigm
is you let me show you the People Hub
first though because this is actually
where some of our principles come
together is quickly it's a little hard
to do this with one hand so the People
Hub here is where all of your people are
aggregated not just from your email
services but from social networking
services as well contact will be
automatically aggregated together
depending on and I can jump to anywhere
in the list right away like that and I
can look at a contact and if I look at a
contact you'll see this contact the
information is coming from Windows Live
outlook and Facebook all three being
aggregated in one place I can also see
social networking activity for this
person right here and so it will go up
and get social networking activity from
facebook from Windows Live and I think
my network connectivity is a little bit
more in here so right now initially
we're supporting facebook and Windows
Live for social networking in the people
of itself but a lot of third parties are
writing applications that support many
other networking social networking
services as well and it is a goal of
ours to provide extensibility like that
as you can kind of tell by this model
what we're trying to do is provide
people access to relevant connected
types of information and experiences
without making them go to a separate
application so and and then you know
recents are listed here social
networking activity is listed right here
aggregated across all of the contacts
and you can go right in and see what
people are saying about this person's
comment
you can put a comment on it yourself
right here so a lot of the very basic
things that people want to do
immediately are taking care of their now
another thing that i want to show and
check in the time here I think I'm only
five minutes in okay so if i go to my
contact i know has an address you know
it is very possible that you may want to
find out where that address is if you're
looking at a contact so you know we
activate that link and it automatically
will take me to the mapping application
and bring up now I haven't launched maps
since I started you see we asked people
if you want to lab the phone to track
your location you'll notice that so very
people like to be asked so and you'll
see here the maps application came up
this is our standard Bing Maps
application leveraging the Bing service
Microsoft has a lot of these service
products and so we've tried to leverage
all of that in creating a great phone
and you know the thing that's nice here
is that without doing anything else I
can actually go and say you know I want
directions to this place from my
location and click go and of course i'm
in san francisco right now so this is a
very long trip you'll see here it's
going to take me 11 hours by car and
these are all the step by turn-by-turn
directions here so and i can click in
the map if i want to see the map and
zoom down you'll see the scope of the
trip i am about to take but anyway i
mean i hope i'm getting across to you i
mean this is the sort of thing that we
focused on this product is like creating
making it as easy as possible to execute
these very basic things that we thought
people wanted to do and we did a lot of
usability work I mean these are these
are things we think people want to do
another interesting experience here is
the calendar here we aggregate calendar
services from a number of different
providers and we're adding more in the
next release but one of the really
interesting and this is actually kind of
nice from a stylist
perspective you know I've got this Dave
you here where I can see when time is
free and i can go through the days and i
can look at my next days and and since
this is based on exchange server you
know i can actually go in here and i can
see who the attendees are in a meeting
and i can actually reply to this meeting
right here i can accept tentative edit
and i can also say late which is
something we use at microsoft quite a
lot to say i'm going to be late to
meeting and it'll automatically put
together an email here saying i'll be a
bit late so that's very useful microsoft
we have a problem with being late but
then you know here i can zoom out and
look at that month you and you know i
I'm getting kind of older so I can't I
don't think that that text is really
that readable but I don't think that's
the point really because it does give
you some kind of idea about basically
how busy you are in any given day and I
can quickly jump through the months here
and go what am i doing on that day and
so it's a pretty cool user experience I
think our user experience team did a
really excellent job on the things I
thought last thing I'm going to show
here I mean there's a lot of stuff here
obviously Xbox Live integration and the
third party apps are fantastic too and
in an explorer we can just announce that
we're going to have internet explorer 9
and our release coming out later this
year which we've been calling mango you
may have seen that this is actually
being built exactly by the ie9 team so
they actually have the same code tree
they're generating ie9 for both that's
how how close if you want to get an idea
about how ie9 on the phone is going to
work it's going to be virtually
identical to ie9 on the desktop except
where it doesn't make sense with some
extra things for example it's going to
be able to get location information let
me just show you pictures really quick
because here I get to show off my 20
month old daughter so here we got some
interesting pivots and the idea behind
this pivot control is that it's it's
actually a new paradigm for showing you
filtered cuts of data I mean there's
nothing really knew about the type of
control it's essentially the evolution
of
have control but but what's really cool
about it is it kind of gives you this
cool interactive way of looking at data
in different different ways so here I'm
looking at it by date I know I had a lot
of pictures here I can click on the date
and go right to that month but then you
know I can bring up she's really cute so
and you know we support all the same
things that oops I hit the search button
you know you can actually zoom in here
and get this little film strip you so
anyway I you know I I suspect somebody
didn't have it hadn't seen the phone
before and I just you know I know
Microsoft comes across as being
corporate and dumb blonde ugly I mean
we're aware of this I mean you know but
but but this is the thing I mean with
this phone we tried to really start over
and do something what's that show xbox
okay I'll just do whatever you tell me
now I'm just like so this is xbox live
support here in the phone and right now
this is what it looks like today you we
have there's over 65 Xbox Live titles
currently and we support avatar
gamerscore leaderboards so you know I
can get I can get achievements here in
hexic and and this will add to my
overall gamerscore which is very
important I can come in here and you
know so it's this is all managed code to
people say managed code is not
performing but we have since we know the
hardware spec here we're able to create
some and this is not a you know it's not
first-person shooter or anything but
it's an interesting interactive little
game obviously we have been jeweled to
as well we've been with all the game
publishers to get as many as we can I
think like I said they're 65 Xbox Live
titles we're over 14,000 applications
right now over 40,000 developers have
registered to
applications so and that's and we've
only had the phone mounts since
September I think so you know we're
really excited about the amount of
reception we had and furthermore I you
know I think we announced this deal with
Nokia where we're going to become their
primary smartphone operating system so I
know Nokia doesn't have a lot of
presence United States but if you've
been outside the United States at all
you'll notice that virtually everybody
has a nokia phone which is it's kind of
shocking sometimes how many I mean
everybody has a nokia phone so anyway
that's the phone and I didn't really go
through my slides I mean one of the
things I did want to mention and I'm
almost out of time here is you know like
I said you know I talked about the goals
of the user experience you know the
goals of our application platform were
around enabling these user experiences
so you need thousands of compelling apps
and games so we wanted a platform that
drove that and we want to drive
developer profit as well and so we have
a marketplace program we do require
certification unlike Android but we do
feel that end-users need to have a
guarantee of a certain level of quality
so we're trying to be very very open and
transparent with developers about
exactly what those requirements are
we're sending very detailed reports
people when they don't pass
certification so you know there's a lot
of things we're trying to do that like I
said I mean from a from a developer
ecosystem perspective we have a lot of
history of working with developers so
it's something that we're very strong
yet I'm not going to talk too much about
what the platform entails we kind of
resins going to show you instead of talk
about it we very powerful tools which
we'll talk about I mentioned this a
little bit these are just numbers is
boring marketing stuff but the platform
is evolving at mix two weeks ago in Las
Vegas a conference microsoft house we
announced windows phone mango the
application platform for the next
version this is coming out at the end of
the year by the end of the year the
application platform tools are going to
be available in a couple weeks by the
end of May so you'll be able to download
for free
visual studio express 2010 for windows
phone mango and it will come with a copy
of expression blend as well which is our
is a very powerful unique tool that we
have that enables you to build
interactive experiences and it will do
like if you need to do some complex
animation it's really neat you just set
keyframes and you show where you want
components of the screen to be at those
steps and it will build all the
animation automatically and you can even
do easing functions and so forth so it
makes it massively easier to build
animated experiences much easier than
almost anyone else I haven't seen a tool
like it on other platforms there
probably are but focused on ours but
anyway in mango we're actually moving
forward because we know that our first
release was missing some things in terms
of the platform so and we're adding
multitasking this is one of the main
things people were asking for lettuce we
have multitasking the operating system
obviously we do not enable 3rd party
applications to continue to run in the
background today but we are going to in
our next release and so this is what it
is about you know these are sort of the
four different primary mechanisms we're
going to provide for that a lot more
information about this is going to be
online so I'm not going to spend too
much time some of the new capabilities
one thing that's really interesting here
I'll mention briefly access to the raw
video stream is going to enable building
augmented reality type applications on
Windows Phone very very easy to do so as
well and support for gyroscopes we're
going to have a spatial framework this
is basically going to enable you to
leverage data from accelerometer GPS and
compass and gyro with one API set and
it's going to make it it's going to take
a lot of the complex math out of
leveraging the accelerometer data socket
support something people want to sequel
siiii on the device and some new
controls focus on performance making it
easier to write
performing applications does anyone have
any questions before I go because I'm
just about to get out of here so we have
a program through our site creative sdn
com is the site where all of this lives
by the way and on that site we have a
program you register for you pay ninety
nine dollar fee a year if your student
you can get this for free I believe and
once you've done that you can unlock a
commercial phone for development
purposes so you can test against it and
you can submit applications for
publication and when you submit an app
then it goes through the certification
process whereby we test it for certain
characteristics and performance and
quality and a number of different
criteria we've got a pretty easy to read
document about it on online now we're in
the process actually tomorrow we're
going to have much clear documentation
we're continually working on this as
clear as possible and if you fail
certification the first thing that
happens when you register to be a
developer's we have to validate your
identity because we're going to be
signing your apps with a certificate
when we distributed so there's this
validation process and then once you
pass through that then you can submit
apps and we certify them and I think our
turnaround time is about two days now on
certifying application so it's not
that's the average time right now and
like I said we've got over 14,000 apps
we published so far and many many more
waiting so and maybe one more question
the question just the user base so we
were brand new platform and we've
officially stated that we have we
provided OEMs two million licenses to
Windows Phone at this point so the OEMs
then that does that's art that's art
that's our cell in numbers we're not
that's the only numbers we're talking
about this time we are a new platform
and we understand that sockets are very
important for developers when
determining you know where I'm going to
how many people can buy my app why would
I adopt
platform if not people thought people
can but we think the opportunity is huge
based on our based on the numbers based
on our agreement with Nokia and IDC and
gartner just came out with new studies
showing that they think this is
extremely aggressive they think we're
going to be in this number two position
that by 2015 so there's been some
independent research in that area that's
and a lot of that's based on a
relationship with Nokia but Nokia is a
very very big deal okay i'm going to
turn over to reza now thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
