talk is banana clogging and you I'm
Martin Schneider from wingspan
technology wingspans document management
applications for regulated industries
and what I want to talk about today is
how logging practices haven't really
kept up with the complexity of
applications and this this has really
created a mess for a lot of people the
first one is that the immediacy of
logging implies synchronization in your
code and what will happen to some people
is you have some transient problem and
you decide you're going to try to
diagnose that by turning on max logging
you turn it on the problem goes away it
goes away because your problem may have
been caused by timing or synchronization
and when you're going through the same
code path with logging you know writing
to a shared log device a file or
something like that
you're gonna lockstep the exact program
that you're trying to take a look at and
that that kind of neutralizes some of
the benefits and even if you don't have
these sorts of problems turning on
logging in a situation like that will
affect performance right you're going to
synchronize code which may not have been
previously synchronized this gets into a
lot of functional programming things
we're introducing there's a side effect
there but the side effect is
synchronization which turns out to be a
really terrible thing to have the
conditional based on settings so the
next problem is you have some scenario
the user can reproduce a problem
it's a multi-user system though when you
go and pull the log file everything's
interleaved with all the other users of
the system and you know this one person
was going down a path of failure but you
have a tough time kind of collecting all
that you can mitigate that pretty easily
I mean you throw a thread ID in there a
request ID a user ID but at the moment
you're trying to log things you may not
have that information you can introduce
those dependencies to your code but that
doesn't seem like a great idea either so
there's there's a couple of risks of of
going down that path yeah so now in this
case you're in a stateless cluster and
again the user you know knows what
they're doing they can reproduce the
problem and all you got to do is collect
the log file but now you got to collect
log files from every single node in the
cluster and you got a hunt and find the
one that corresponds what you're looking
at and that's you know that's that's
unpleasant you can mitigate that the
easiest way to mitigate that is to
Splunk or anything like Splunk and those
tools are great and I'm not saying don't
use those tools you probably use them in
addition to anything that I'm
recommending
but it's kind of it's unfortunately the
answer kind of leads towards greater
complexity and
think that the functional programmer is
that's something that we're trying to
avoid the fourth one is similar you're
in some multi tier application might be
simple when you have two tiers or it
could be you could be doing micro
services you could chain all these
things together and something goes wrong
at some point you know in the process
and what you really want to see is that
orchestrated log of everything that
happened across all these tiers and that
turns out to be inconvenient to collect
and again Splunk will help you with that
you can also create an artificial
request ID and kind of propagate that
forward and stuff but again you're
introducing things to help you with with
logging that you may not really need to
to deal with what we're talking about as
the answer is a monadic logging and
we're gonna breathe through this because
I think most people here are pretty
familiar with basic concepts like a
writer monette this is the shortest one
I could write I was trying to fit it on
the slide it basically will just pair a
value of any type with a list of string
messages and you can see how you can
accumulate those messages over time and
you can kind of build a narrative of how
you arrived at some value and then we'll
look at a use case of there this we
don't really need to look too closely
but in the center of the main there's a
for comprehension and that's kind of the
key element of using your writer monad
is you have some way to compose these
things together where you have a path at
execution and that's accumulating the
log messages and if you look at the very
bottom we'll see that we have the the
outputted the formatted string and it
kind of carried those log statements
that it got from the top methods and it
can output them all together at once and
then a logging monad is is the same
thing I mean a writer monad I think is
classically exactly a list of strings
I'm just you know suggesting some case
class that has more log information so
it's whatever really you want I'm in
this case we have a time stamp and a
string you can imagine a log level you
can do a elapsed timing of how long
something takes to execute that's what
really anything you would want to throw
in there you would throw in there but
the composition this is exactly the same
so so now we're ingratiate if we've
solved all the problems the first thing
that we've done is that because the log
entries are being accumulated as you
execute then passed back up to the
original call sight there is no
immediacy right the log is accumulated
as you execute but it's not written to
any log device until you mechanically
choose to do so so so there is no ocean
of synchronization and locking doesn't
really have an impact on the performance
of your application from a
synchronization
effective the other thing is that when
you do have a log file itself you're
going to have fewer total rights the
rights will be larger you're gonna be
sending the same information there but
you'll have fewer rights have fewer
contention on the resource the
interleave log entries again this is not
right out of the park no longer do we
write log entries as they are you know
appear in the code now you've executed
the full request you're back at the
original call site you're getting ready
to terminate or you know send the
response or do whatever it is you're
going to do and so there you have all
the context information you can omit one
time in this case we have an IP address
we have a user ID we have the URL of a
request whatever it is that you consider
to be the context that appears at the
top of a banner followed by all the log
entries everything is in one atomic unit
the context is there with the log
statements themselves have no awareness
of that context you didn't you did it
all without introducing any additional
dependencies and that's what this can
this can look like here we have a just a
brief example of that banner so again
that clustered server scenario we have
to go and hunt to find the log file
we've solved that as well in the way
that we solve that if you can take that
log information you can do whatever you
want you can write it to a file you can
do normal things but in this case we're
going to put the log entries on the HTTP
response itself so we're imagining we're
a restful service you know we've gotten
some some requests we've accumulated the
response and as we're about to distri in
the response will put the headers in
first they have all those log entries
and now the caller has that information
as well you can combine that with a
client log or any sort of of other thing
it's the same information now there's
different ways you can you can do that
you might have you can put it in your
hyper media format but some services
might have multiple formats like you can
do XML and JSON so it can be convenient
to throw it into the headers to avoid
having to kind of manipulate your format
the other case something that we do at
wingspan as we do a lot of dynamic
generation of PDFs and there's no
convenient place in the output format to
put this sort of information so putting
it into the headers is is very nice now
of course the one note I think probably
a few people or sniffing this one out is
you'd want access controls if you did
this I mean you wouldn't just want to be
sending your server-side log to every
casual user of the system the cross to
your car correlation is the same thing
if we just build off of that
the HTTP response answer in a multi-tier
application you can imagine each
subsequent requests to sending its lock
back to the intermediate service and
then they accumulate and they Peck leave
pay it forward you know that that's
based on everyone participating the same
way which I think today and probably
tomorrow is is unlikely so it's a little
bit of a thinking dream for now it's
unlikely to happen just you plunk and
consider yourself lucky that we've saw
three or four problems for sure
so the title of the talk is monadic
logging in you and it turns out to be an
important distinction because this isn't
the kind of thing where I can be up here
talking about an open-source library
that I've published in maven that I want
you all to include and used instead of
log4j or something that's not the way
this works because logging is a lot more
about the practical use of logging than
about the library that you use I mean
you can usually switch blog potations
pretty simply for that reason so so the
real thing
less so than using these mechanics or
doing anything's in one particular way
is changing the mindset of logging to
kind of be more compatible with what
we're doing is functional programmers
okay so the first message for everyone
is to log less okay the purpose of
logging is to provide insight into
running code that's the most important
perspective to maintain here and if
you're doing functional programming
correctly there's a lot of cases where
you just don't need it right I mean
that's what we're trying to achieve if
you have you inputs and the outputs and
there's no side effects and it's
provably correct you have trouble unit
testing sometimes some because it's just
it's so obvious that it works correctly
and there's no need for logging in those
cases um but that begs the question what
we're a deep logging and there's there's
two really good targets I mean the first
is any i/o boundary anything with
involving a network call a database call
or something like that and you'll
probably already have these marked in
your code because they're gonna have a
try or some result type that recognizes
the fact that hey I don't know exactly
what's going to happen here as I'm
writing the code I'm gonna find out
later that's exactly where you would
want logging on the other thing is that
sometimes you want to time stuff like
you don't really see when you're writing
code how long it will take and I know we
want it to go you know fast as fast as
it can go except in cases where you're
doing the best example of this is you're
trying to compute a password hash and
it's actually important how long it
takes you don't want it to be zero
milliseconds you also don't want it to
be you know a minute and a half you want
it to be with one to two hundred
milliseconds you want to tune that over
time so there's some times where even if
you do have functional code you
still want to login I consider those to
be pretty pretty rare so the next thing
is you're going to want to combine your
result type with your logging Monad um
the reason you're going to do that is
just because Scala is not great at
handling nested monads and you can use
something like a monad transformer and
there's other techniques as well but if
you do use this thing you're gonna use
it a lot and it's not a lot of to
handwrite you're better off just having
some straight line implementation that
does exactly what you want to do the
result type doesn't make a difference it
turns out this this is very easy to
write the the writer monad interface is
quite simple the result type interface
will typically be quite simple and
really compatible because the writer is
doing accumulation and the result will
be doing a conditional execution in a
flat map or something like that so that
you really don't collide very much you
can just Union them together and and go
and start start using it so one thing
that comes up a lot is when people are
doing traditional logging they have like
a debug statement that will build some
expensive string and so they want to do
deferred string construction yeah
they're always thinking well how do I
avoid doing this work in the case that
this entry isn't needed you can run into
a lot of problems here okay this is
something where if you carry this
practice fork and you're doing
functional logging using monads what's
changing is that the the line of code
that executes the log statement and the
the materialization of that log entry
are the same basically that's the
immediacy thing and now that we're no
longer immediate you're stretching these
things out potentially pretty far and
you can close over something and if
you're lucky you're going to close over
something like a result set where when
you go to commit the log the thing is
out of scope and closed down and it'll
just break and then you'll know right
away but what the worst case scenario is
you close over something you're in some
like you know for each or something
iterating ORS and you close over data
structures you weren't really expecting
to and your conditional logging ends up
changing the memory allocation so things
that were expected to be you know wound
within a single a for loop or a tight
call stack end up going all the way up
to the top to the call site and that can
that can cause those issues we've been
training to do this with the bug logging
um so it's something that basically if
you combine that with log less maybe you
can just say I don't need to do this I'm
not creating enough log
trees where I need to do this deferred
constraint construction I can just
construct them all the time and not
really worry about it but it's something
that it's kind of implementation
dependent it depends on all your
circumstances so that does that does
come up a fair amount conditional
logging sports the next one log levels
they always you know what if I only want
to do this in debug scenarios the first
thing to to note here is again if we're
logging less we don't really care of it
but more importantly I think conditional
logging you can change your perspective
like what if you could say um you know
now that I finished executing this and
I'm about to return the results of the
caller if it failed
I want the complete log and if it
succeeded and it was fast it was
succeeded in less than twenty
milliseconds I don't need to see any log
entries there and if it succeeded and it
took in this time range then I want to
warn and if it succeeded in took in this
bigger time range then I wanted to bug
what if well you can do that that's
exactly what we're talking about is you
accumulate the log through execution and
then is to commit it or not commit it at
the call site when you're all done and
so you can do conditional logging on
parameters he didn't have access to
before that's one of the more powerful
elements of this the other thing is that
if you do choose to do conditional
logging down at this statement level I
recommend that people actually pass a
log level to the method so right now
there's this implicit to participate on
that log configuration file if you make
it and you can use Scotland places but
if it's part of the the the type
signature of the method it indicates
things to the callers the exact same
logic why you would return a try instead
of just throwing exceptions you want to
indicate to people hey there's something
going on here you need to be aware of so
one one thing that some people end up is
that they block problems right when you
have an immediate log you can use the
log by deadlock issues and it's pretty
simple right it's like the process is
hung show me the current log the last
couple entries in there that tells me
what I need to go and look at and
because we've lost immediacy we're going
to lose that facility completely so
there's two recommendations there the
first is that you can actually if if
you're your log statements are timing
their interiors right so the log
function itself is a higher order
function it executes the thing that it's
passed but you can time the allocation
you could then implement deadlock
detection pretty simple you can store
something
in a static you can have a timer job
that monitors things and say hey by the
way you know be deadlocked and this
thing has been executing for 90 seconds
and I can tell you everything I know
about it is you can do stuff like that
again my my solute my solutions are
based on simplicity rather than
complexity so I don't like that very
much what I would say is just stop using
logging for that instead let's just use
tools that are better suited to look at
a home process and tell you what the
call stack so our app dynamics and a
variety of others so just one second
that's that's everything I have we are
we have time for one question since
Daniel got got in first well I'll give
it a quick shot and then I'll stay
afterwards during the lunch break for
people that would like to yes
Daniel's just asked a question which is
too complicated the answer for the time
we have allocated but we'll definitely
talk about it but I know if we write up
on the little pasty intended bunch stars
so thank you and thank you for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
