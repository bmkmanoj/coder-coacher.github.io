about MVC who else is here to talk about
MVC
I think MSE is awesome it's might not be
my talk but I do think it is awesome it
was introduced 30 years ago but we're
not going into the history I have been
using MVC for more than 10 years now I
actually started off with a Java
developer 10-12 years ago and something
called struts and that was my first
introduction to MVC yes yeah it was so
simple it was the node.js back in the
day and I've done like a butter doesn't
frameworks till then and what I realized
was we kind of keep churning back the
same thing over and over over nothing
really changed
it's just buzzwords but there has to be
something about react I've been using
react for about one year now mostly
enclosure script
and one of my biggest issues was to
understand well what is wrong with MVC
right like I mean naturally I tend to
ask being a writer I asked like why is
this this way and nothing is wrong
really I don't think not there's
anything wrong with MVC jQuery or
backbone but I do think it is limiting
based on the kind of projects you are
and that was been my experience it was
sort of designed for like back in the
day 80s 90s where was when small talk
was booming I was coming up GUI was huge
so you if you look at that context it
kind of made sense to have a structure
but everything was chaotic we're sort of
in the same place again but I do think
that it made sense back in the day but
have a look at this website or not a
website anymore but there is a huge web
app so what do you think is going on on
that screen
there's like a real-time feed there is
some sort of pre cache static assets
showing up the list on the left
your friend counts for example there's
some sort of buffered time batch sync
going on for the newsfeed there's also
these ads that I'm not sure if I'm
interested to click on that and there's
a search one now I'm not building apps
at this scale and guessing you're not
either but there's something to be
learned from this right
and that's when I started to figure out
because my favorite language in
JavaScript was actually library wood was
actually jQuery who likes daiquiri here
I think it's like if if not for jQuery I
would not be a front-end developer
that's that was pretty much my thing
because I still think I'm poor in
JavaScript but jQuery was awesome so I
said how do we do this in fact I didn't
do this someone blogged about it I I
think it was one of those blogs that
actually helped me understand the react
ecosystem better because I was mostly
into closing script so I'm just gonna
paraphrase what he did maybe with a few
extra slides so let's actually open this
and see what it looks how it looks like
slow ting
there's just a button
it check it when you click it attach
numbers and if you say red it shows red
in red color right it's fairly simple
and what we have is two inputs one
output right
that's how you will do that's what I did
I go up for a long time right
on click handlers change things done
it's so simple
I still do my website this way actually
I don't know use react I just mail it to
jQuery but things can get tricky let's
consider this example but in this
example we have multiple inputs actually
click handlers many buttons and when we
add something the words get added like a
to-do list and there's also an undo redo
let's have a look at look at that
so add a button add a word what adds go
there the most classic to do but much
strip down to see the essence of what it
is right and I can go back hey you don't
need we get who says you need react this
is it right guys then I was really
impressed up by the blog of course and I
I played it on an included script
version but I did keep this example
because I think it's more relevant for
all of us so then I looked up like
what's what's so great about it except
it definitely doesn't scale right you
have so many events and so many elements
you have m cross n how do you scale that
can we try this one can we introduce
state and then say that perhaps there is
some guy who's going to take care of
this and not me
that's the first refactor step this is
all in jQuery so writer you introduce
state you say a var and instead of
putting the color inside your function
you just put it outside the first step
and basically trying to copy react in
fact the author I'm not going to take
credit for this but this is the this is
the essence write update you I put it in
a function same stuff next we have said
what do we do save it
how do you see realize it well you can
put in local storage right very cheap
now what so we serve state mood its mood
outside the states utilize it now
instead of copying every time can we
make it more efficient turns out
JavaScript arrays are actually quite
efficient and copying if you use the
right data structure to do it but
do you want to do this take a look at
this example in which copying in fact is
this is I'm not going to name what this
is most of us most of you might be
familiar with this called immutable data
structures but this is kind of the
beginning where you have a list and a
new list is simply when you add 9 to the
head of the list it's pointing still to
the original so these are some of the
tricks I found when I was working in
both in react and closure script that
might be saving you time and it's more
efficient the same thing so by pushing
towards a state model where we put
everything in state optimize the state
use it nicer data structure we can
actually now preserve state and page
loads how many of you three have
struggled with the issue where you
refresh your big MVC app with a form and
then everything blows off I've done that
so many times in so now maybe there's a
way to kind of preserve the state and
then save phase reloads it also helps
you look at the users because now you
know which state it was in and that's it
well this is grossly exaggerating but
that's how it looks
back button next button have a history
with array roughly sort of an algorithm
now this is where react was promising
luck react says it has this thing called
virtual dumb I don't know what what is
virtual dumb so it turns out it's
actually deeply embedded in this notion
of give me a state I will render it on
virtual Dom HTML so this is how it looks
like if you this is actually not virtual
job this is optimizing rendering so if
what I'm saying here is instead of
putting it inside of a HTML HTML move
the HTML inside JavaScript now so now I
have a single function that generates
the HTML called render now update UI is
getting the selector and updating that
through that render function using that
state the nice thing about this is that
you can call render state with that
state it always renders the same exact
HTML right these are concepts of react
but now you're doing it in jQuery the
last one and I will touch touch on this
one towards the end as well is
persistent data structures
we can spend a whole day on this in fact
I do have a workshop tomorrow and
clojurescript where I am more than happy
to show obviously there that will be the
best blister this but but the idea is
I'd like to concise things this is how I
learn
is that you have two elements and one is
a subset of the other now internally
it's a tree and if you think about it
they're sharing the same memory right
there is a sub no sub tree here and
there's this tree is a sub tree of that
tree so Phi essentially is the extra one
and everything else is shared between
two this is my in my head this is how I
think like 40,000 foot overview so
persistent data structures essentially
gives you shared memory behind the
scenes it's works on immutable data
structure so you can actually do this in
JavaScript
you right now we can do this it's kind
of ugly because you have to now start
tracking things like this
each node literally will be a key it's a
big JSON object you have to maintain
right and you have to maintain the
entire structure for that node and for
every addition you have to maintain a
previous next I was in school back in
the day sometimes I have one of spend
time on the application so this is where
I can see why this can be pretty
complicated turns out this is a problem
that has been solved by someone smaller
than me obviously and there has it is
inbuilt in closure script and it is now
a library in JavaScript ecosystem
immutable j/s is one of them there are
about 10 of them so
fast forward this a hundred times more
complex more efficient we have a library
now
and the last one and I did skip this
earlier as virtualizing Dom what that
really means is instead of rendering an
HTML now we're back to that same example
actually we have done state we've moved
the state out we've made it immutable
we've made it persistent well we ended
up using a library now we're saying
instead of rendering the HTML I'm
rendering a data structure instead of an
HTML and what is that data structure
it's just an array right you have each
node as elements in that array ordered
exactly according to your Dom because
Dhamma is a tree structure so this is
obviously an exaggeration but you can
see now your update UI is saying render
state you get some sort of V tree you're
doing a def next time right isn't that
what reactors it is patching the
differences between a Dom structure when
I have a HTML div with two elements now
I have a third element on a click of a
button the next time you're rendering
you have to see if there are three
elements two elements before therefore I
add up one element that's that's really
it at the end that's it so you look at
the previous state and then find update
the pointer so this is essentially
reactive in I believe ten minutes or
less it's it's it's the fact that it
moves away state entirely outside makes
it a dumb data structure quite efficient
in manipulating itself using api's to
manipulate it and using a virtual Dom
because you don't want to do that if for
yourself you want an engine that is
really smart that can do this and these
are the three lines it's really
when direct updated process the input
updated and rendering that's that's
react
and how many of you actually have been
doing react should have asked the
question there you go
well this is an introduction part so I
hope some of it might be helpful
some of the cleaner in es6 it looks like
this
and what I learned from react is that it
actually focuses on the two things that
we discussed earlier using the jQuery
example is that it renders the UI from
state in response to user events those
are the only two things what other
problems does itself and this is a
representation of that
it's just a pretty picture but also what
it's trying to do is that if you can
take now each individual HD HTML snippet
in your page you can think of that as a
component and essentially what you could
do or what I've realized over the last
one year is now you can start section
cutting down your page into sections and
render that and hopefully if we know
that cycle and which is the biggest part
by the way it's not rosy there are more
issues coming soon but that's the that's
the order right well you have the state
component renders it and then updates it
to the state and then back so based on
the state you always render that the
reason it's more efficient it it vendors
from scratch it renders every time from
scratch and because of the things that
we discussed earlier on react behind the
scenes is efficient in rendering the
differences because HTML
navigation can be complicated
behind-the-scenes but it's not more
efficient generating that from
JavaScript does give you an advantage so
I did have one issue and that is where I
wanted to spend the next the remaining
of the talk is how do you manage state
because this is all fine V Thomas seems
to be doing its job now how do I manage
state because I don't know how to manage
state I can do it in other ways
shouldn't we try to figure out what is
state in the first place
it seems like a very basic question but
but most of the times if you're thinking
in object orientation in that model
which I which I was thinking as well for
a long time that you're always looking
at class has objects and that's it
you're not looking at what the object
lifecycle is right and it turns out that
the identity of an object essentially
and I can ask you ask anyone a question
if I ask you a question what did you do
today you will have an answer and if I
ask the same question ten minutes later
and you would say something else you as
a person answer that had those things
happening over time right so state
essentially is not one thing status like
recording that events on that person
yourself over time so that's what really
that's what it boils down to is that an
identity is just a succession of states
we were looking at that data structure
we thought initially
it's a succession of states and it's
just a value doesn't change so that's
all great how is that related to UI
these are all the questions I've had
actually and I'm hoping it makes sense
eventually to other people who are
struggling with it because I did
struggle with it for three or four
months so if you have a state and a UI a
lot of times we'll be building we ask
those questions like what happens when
this form is submitted there's a
validation error what should happen at
this development on the right side
when there's a request coming from JSON
what should happen like all these things
are essentially answering how should
your UI look like right but doesn't that
depend on state turns out it does
and the more I understand react the more
I see how it is possible to view
something like something as abstract
like this one where you're looking at
just data structures where you know that
this part of that data structure means
this view of your UI this part means
this view it seems abstract I sometimes
I do spend time looking and other ideas
and to me that's how I look at it is
like you have the same data structure
now it is possible I don't know how but
I will figure out how to view my UI in
different states that said oops
so at the end when I tried to nail down
at least in my understanding what MVC to
me was because my goal was to actually
map our unmapped MVC concepts and see if
I could reuse those concepts right
because I can't throw away ten years of
my knowledge I don't think anyone would
like to so how do I map it to me what
I've learned is like if you look at
model instead of putting business logic
instead of thinking it as a domain
representation if we can go much more
low-level at the data level what at the
JSON level even at the JSON level what
is that specified right if you can look
at that as a state
that can visually represent your UI that
is that's the starting point
sensitive model I think state as data is
is how reactive is is pushing forward
it's not saying that's the way to do you
either it's one way to do it right
instead of views to me its components
and remember render every component has
one function
just render and it has life cycles to
manage the hooks for the activities
around Dom but now instead of viewers
I'm going much lower level I'm thinking
of small components instead of views
it's actually more object oriented more
object based and then I'm looking at
looking at them as rendering themselves
using a single function which is that
accepts the state as an input and third
which is the most which is the difficult
part even in most languages because
there is no answer how do you now
communicate with components so to me
that's how it is
MVC is great it does give you a
structure but if you boil down most of
us are actually trying to address some
of these problems is how do you manage
state how do we build small components
so instead of looking at a bigger
picture now we'll focus much more on
elements and perhaps we can optimize and
be more efficient in these aspects
there are other problems I will be I am
NOT an animation expert over here but if
is there anyone into css3 animations
because it's something I think that's
exciting because I did say life without
em you see but life without em you see
doesn't mean that you're not building
new ice you are now open to other ideas
I think CSS now Flipboard team has done
something really cool they've actually
views react and then instead of using
Dom they put it on canvas because the
requestanimationframe
has a limitation and because react was
actually slow for their requirements
they just implemented an entire new
stack on top of react and you can do
really cool things because now you can
start optimizing on the critical render
path because you have again those three
things State and components you're
actually looking at a very low level and
that gives you chance at least some of
us who are into that level it gives us
chance to now see what could be
optimised for example at using the css3
layout specs in a really large table
table GUI right so it's possible to look
at that in isolation because again a
component is simply a representation of
state we open a chrome debugger you will
be able to see how many times it's being
rendered right
and and I want to focus and just give
you an overview of what I've learned and
close the script
and even though you may not be a closer
script developer I would urge I would
urge you all to like like look at both
documentation because I do think there
is an overlap of ideas quite a few ideas
in ecology script starting with ohm and
other libraries on top of react are
being now like inspired and their
libraries in JavaScript so I think it's
we have similar concepts and why I like
closure script in react is because the
the whole the notion of what state how
do you manage state what an immutable
data structure these are all foreign
concept to me at least two years ago and
the fact that it is built at the
language level to me was huge even
though I may never look at that source
code because now we have filters that
low-level primitives built in the
language not a library because I will
trust the language designer in this case
so I can focus on the app so what does
that mean if you're looking at a
different MVC stack now you have these
concepts should I pick a framework
should I pick a libraries but these are
the things that I've learned while using
a multiple libraries actually not just
one is that diffs are more efficient
especially in further script for reasons
that it is immutable data structures so
it means that you can you don't have to
check the node each and every node value
every time because you just check the
identity the other things that are nice
is that patched updates if you have a
really fast UI that is almost always be
rendering really fast you don't have to
render them in like at sub millisecond
level you can bash them for
requestanimationframe what that really
means is that 16 frames per second X
frames for a second you can bash them
for that or you can if you want you can
also implement your own strategy it is
not actually built out of the box
included script it turns out that it's
actually
fairly simple deployment on Iran this is
from one of the libraries called brew
Tao actually I would recommend this if
you want to just just learn how closed
lips in taxes it's less than 100 lines
library for react it's really elegant
and this is how it looks like and you
can you can see there I'm mounting a
component and it's on
requestanimationframe and the brackets
there just says that it's it's a
function cup so but regards the state
management
cursus has been a concept that has been
popularized by ohm but it is it is now
available in JavaScript is there if
anyone use it you please happy to
recommend which which you think is good
but the idea is if you have state I'm
gonna repeat I'll try to repeat this
because this is I keep saying this to
myself because the MVC took a long time
it took a long time for me to get MVC
out of my head for these kinds of apps
so to me global global state management
was a whole new a whole new thing but
what it doesn't essentially means in
libraries which give you cursors is you
can have components manage their own
state in a global data structure for now
we can think of that as a JSON in flow
describe it's called Adam what it means
is it gives you access it gives you a
pointer axis like in this example it
gives you component the components on
the bottom can be accessed I can access
the data in this global map it restricts
that using a pointer concept called
cursors
and all this to me means that there are
much higher api's that I can deal with I
don't have to invent all these things on
my own I can use a small library and use
this as my building blocks it's the same
concept that I just said big map of data
you can have small components and if you
have restricted pointer access to the
top you can now push data to that right
there are other things but I am running
out of time slightly but there are the
things the reason I mentioned these
overviews is not that we all understand
this there are a couple things that I
picked up last last month the reason I'm
bringing this up is I said earlier on
that why why not NBC what's wrong with
it there is nothing wrong with them you
see the fact that these concepts are
actually coming out means that there are
new ways of doing things now and why
would you want new ways of doing things
in in my experience I note notice that
if there are smaller and smaller
libraries that do one thing and really
efficiently I can now rely on those
libraries for example in state
management alone there are a dozen
libraries both in JavaScript and closest
trip I can do things like mix-ins which
is using sass like I like the concept of
make sense
that which is not necessarily available
either in JavaScript or even produce
trip now we can have state management in
this library called rum which gives you
much more lower-level building blocks to
do state management I say that hey I
want a static state management for this
component whatever that means you can
read it you can read the docs
and the docs will say that just give
this state to this component it will
just render it all the time but you no
other person can update this component
that's the specs it's like a plugin so I
use that as a mixin and this is how it
looks like
and the idea the reason I share this is
not is because I can now start picking
libraries like this small libraries that
do this and if I focus entirely on state
management and I can start building my
components rather than relying on having
an entire model up and then having you
know controller logic which is fairly
imperative to decide how to how to build
your state this is another example I do
have a to do at the end but let's see if
we have time and and the third thing
that I found is that I never mentioned
templates all right how many of you who
are doing react nests templates I
certainly missed the nice thing
JavaScript obviously as JSX but what
I've learned that if you have something
like react which does not enforce you a
templating language but enforces you
that you should you must try to build
HTML as as much as in JavaScript as
possible then you can write your own
template language or you can bind other
templating languages and I'm not making
this up Google actually released a
competition that this a few months ago
which is a similar concept but
completely different and this example is
important include the script community
because in in clgs I can write templates
in three different ways I can write pure
HTML and let react library process that
I can write on HTML closure strip
JavaScript reactive can do that too or I
could do my own templating language and
again I wasn't able to think like this
in MVC stacks it just opens doors for
new ideas for me
and I do want to end this with a few
things that I mentioned earlier that
like to me was like this whole big storm
coming in like this react react what is
react like I love em II see but slowly
after about a year it takes time and I'm
still like picking up a few things
what I've what I've realized that life
isn't that much different it's actually
coming back full circle and and there
are some really interesting things
happening and that is where that is why
I think it's worth worth checking out
because now we're now there are
libraries coming up Facebook just
announced this thing called relay and
graph QL so just have had this thing
called data script for a couple years
not for a year now actually sorry six
months what we're doing now is take the
same example of statement I'll tell you
how it's all full circle at least in my
head we said that state who is put state
will put data structure will give a more
rigid functional programming concepts we
will manage state all this is good but I
missed my database someone said I've
missed my database and they put the
entire database in the front-end
client-side in-memory database that's
where it's headed now and I don't know
but an MVC I wasn't thinking the same
right nme see I was fairly structured
and it did solve certain kinds of
problems the fact that someone is even
thinking and coming up with these ideas
and it's actually fun I will show that
small example where is an entire to-do
app in 200 200 lines or less with a full
query engine in memory in the client
side local storage I think this is fun
because now I can work with the same
concepts as a baton engineer with
database concepts I don't think it was
possible in MVC because we were not
specializing in state management right
this is how it looks like there's a
dispatcher and
and remember we had the storage this big
immutable data structure now we want to
make it much more refined because you
have a very special problem and you
understand how your UI looks let's say
it's something an established Enterprise
project so now you can have database
concepts in it you can have logic
queries actual queries you can have
server sync this is actually happening
with Couchbase and other things but now
you can do it in JavaScript or show the
script in this case and then finally
tell react to render but you now
essentially taken State is that
immutable data structures whatever the
nicer more efficient data structure
concept you kind of open that and it's
now open to specializations and that's
what I mean by at least that's why I
have learned that if you kind of divide
into these simple things at low level
now they can be specialized and expanded
to these kinds of things and I think it
is exciting because we we were not able
to solve problems this way
and that is actually close grip but
those are queries that's if you can
think if you see that this thing
it looks like sequel right it's actually
datalove it's say it's showing the
turtle still turn and I will show you
that example it's saying to deuce on
that view show it by doing query on my
in-memory local service database plain
ole query concepts it will take a time
to it took time it takes time to learn
the syntax like in any language but now
we have a query engine in the JavaScript
you can use pouch TP in fact I'm not
making this up there is a pasta query
act binding happening as we speak right
so it's actually fun and I do want to
show that for a minute to see how that
works
so this is a demo put
so this is that to do and we see it's
not my demo I would not take for it it
is by the gentleman who called on ski
eyes this guy has been doing really cool
stuff last one year he's done a react
library and also data script levy and if
you see this is not your average to the
list this is actually a small baby
project management thing steel Jas
so you can see that here I'll show you
the console it's serialized it's
obviously serialized to local storage
but once it's utilized as an entire
transaction is serialized stored in JSON
in local storage it's a matter of
syncing with the backend server right
firebase touch base all those concepts
as you can see this is actually full
such apt
complete my task everything is now back
behind the scenes if you look at it it
is serializing the state is now
serialized as an object in a transaction
and now you can sing that in a database
and if you want that you can filter them
- you can switch oops
and the code it's called data script and
this is a the to do app it's actually
presented in the data script okay da
github so if you look at the source code
and sometimes when I look at source code
in a language that I'm not comfortable
with the first thing I look at is that
ok how many lines right can I is there a
namespace is there a module how many
lines what are the dependencies so if
you see this there actually this is just
a utils so we can actually ignore that
these are also you toes but the real one
is actually about 300 lines and yeah
this is just a small thing in in 300
lines you have a small project
management map with a database in the
front end and
and to me this is exciting right because
now we can do something really fun and
fast and this will scale wow it's so
scale because we of those libraries that
are that have taken care of those
concerns when I was an NBC I was
spending most times doing this stuff on
my own and then I spent 10 years and I
still haven't figured out how to do it
really really well so now I can take
this small libraries that are
specializing in things like state
management communication acing like
whether these promises or features again
it's these are all libraries but as an
app developer you're focused on using or
choosing the libraries for your tasks
right so I can now mix and match and
just to look at one last time over this
example
so this I'll just show you a couple
chords here you're looking at your
persistent how you can also for one of
the example is how can I now serialize
state right using this really
complicated database thing this is what
you guys are thinking well this in this
case it happens to be a single function
and it's saying that listen to my
persistent connection and
and then persistent
like most libraries you you'll end up
looking ducks you'll follow them and in
my case that's what I did and put an
example and I'm most excited about these
things facebook also has one I haven't
looked at real a part um has released
something in the same lines it's a
different concept altogether actually
but I wanted to stay on just in the
concepts part like a very high level
only because I I want maybe some of you
to get excited about reactor or big fans
of MDC because I was one of them and to
me the fact that now we're able to not
only localize and specialize in state
management and how they communicate
which are essentially what you guys are
all about design being a completely
different orthogonal but important
concern I think it opens doors new kinds
of you guys if not the expected the more
rigorous dashboards that we'll use to at
least that's what I will before like you
know
much more complicated products query
stuff dashboards and now we're opening
two new things we can have a much better
persistent query - but if you want I
think and
I think I'm running out of time but I
will end with this guy
that I haven't had fun for a long time
first ever since I started learning new
languages one of the things I realize is
I'm always obsessed about connecting my
past learnings like Oh thinking mvc2 my
new stuff so my two-and-a-half in my to
two and half years of functional
programming and other things that I've
learned I do get excited again because
it's it's actually not that different
it's that they're not that far off from
what they were before they just need a
shift in thinking that is how I learned
anyway and as I said and I hope I was
able to communicate in at least two of
these slides that MVC boiled sounds to
basics and react is taking advantage of
the fact that it is all about state
management and we'll put that in a data
structure and we'll manage that more
efficiently and libraries like
clojurescript of languages like Clojure
script being a more functional
programming language with a more
functional programming language paradigm
they take advantage and then they push
the boundaries and to me what it means
is I can build apps faster didn't
because that's my only reason and I can
build apps faster if I can look at code
base and then learn something quickly
because before I could not like those
are things I'm looking for and I I think
I I think it's exciting and I hope you
are too because
javascript otherwise has so many ideas I
think this is one of them I can take a
couple questions setting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
