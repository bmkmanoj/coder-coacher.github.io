and CEO of a company called bug snag
today we're going to be talking about
some deep internals of error monitoring
in bugs neck in javascript but hopefully
it's going to help untangle any problems
that you have so yeah i'll kick right
into it so i run a company called bug
snag bug snag is san francisco-based
developer tools company and we help you
detect and diagnose errors in your
software so today we're talking a lot
about javascript error monitoring in the
browser and a node but we actually
support more error monitoring in desktop
in mobile in backend in javascript in
everything so we have plugins for every
platform and every programming language
that you can imagine we're also hiring
if anyone's interested in a job come and
talk to us our booth later today but
yeah today i'm going to be talking about
javascript errors and javascript stack
traces so i just get back a couple we're
diagnosing errors in the browser and
diagnosing errors in general is a
difficult problem some browsers make it
easy some browsers make it hard isn't
that the case probably with everything
in browser JavaScript though one of the
key tools to javascript error monitoring
is understanding what's happening and
why it's happened and to get that
information you need a few things but
before I jump into that what the hell is
a javascript error wider errors happen
in the first place so as a ton of
different reasons errors can happen in
your JavaScript application there's some
gross ones like maybe you're using eval
and you've got a typo in there don't do
that don't use eval but then a lot of
errors are caused by just bad data so
you might be expecting a string but
you've got null data that's probably one
of the most common ones that we see in
javascript errors or maybe you're going
outside the end of an array or maybe
you've tried to request a URL
when doing an AJAX request and it's a
typo in the URL a lot of the time is
data is something you've set up at
runtime it's not something you have you
can test to every scenario before you
ship out to production but there's a ton
of different ways you can cause an error
most of my phone is an exception and
when they happen in production it's a
problem when they happen in development
no big deal so you're you guys are
probably familiar with this little
developer console right here but if you
have an error in your browser your fire
open your developer console no problem
you can see exactly what's going on in
here or go into the kind of structure of
this in a second but it gives you all
the data you need to go and find and fix
that error once you ship your code out
to production you're going to see the
whole different array of problems so
production error monitoring we like to
call the wild west of arrow monitoring
you go out to kind of tying in with the
Clint Eastwood theme there you kind of
send stuff out to production you've got
people running mobile browsers you've
got people running IE 5.5 you've got
people running browsers you've never
heard of and then you've got this whole
problem with the environment environment
not being inside your control what if
people have run out of RAM on their
browser and that's cause chrome to crash
what if people have got bad data in
their local storage and that's being
sent into your application and causing a
crash there's so many scenarios where
you literally cannot predict them all
and test them all and development that
you need to find errors in production
solo bit harder you can't sit and look
at the chrome console for all of your
customers in production so how do we do
this how do we find errors in production
in the wild so luckily JavaScript
provides a couple of hooks for this in
the browser number one is window dot on
error I'm not sure if you guys have seen
this before it's a callback function you
can hook up that when an error happens
on how to exception is caused it will
fire this window Donaire modern browsers
also support subscribing to the error
event so you can add an event listener
to get the error event there's a little
problem with this because you want to
see as much diagnostic and debugging
information
as possible so this is what we want to
see we want to see the class of the area
the type of the era was this caused by
bad data was this caused by a bad URL we
want to see a message that tells us what
exactly was happening and then more
importantly we want to see this thing at
the bottom here the stack trace and
that's what I'm going to be diving into
a little bit in this talk but what the
hell is a stack trace so when you run
code you've run a series of functions
function a call this function because
function see that sequence of functions
is known as a stack trace and the easier
way to say that is what the hell was
running what code was running when a
crash happened you need to know what
code was running at the point of a crash
because you want to go ahead and
reproduce these problems so you want to
come in and say was this caused by me
how do I fix this can I put the same
data into this this function to cause a
crash to happen so stack trace is pretty
much an essential part of the debugging
process but it's a little bit hard to
get in JavaScript land so can we always
get one yes the terms and conditions
apply so as probably everybody who's
worked with browser JavaScript knows the
biggest problem is that you have to
support n browsers so there are good bad
and ugly browsers chrome and co do a
good job but some don't so I kind of go
into the hell aware now so as of about
two or three months ago firefox's in
this club now these callbacks I talked
about earlier windowed on error and
adding the error handler the event
listener for error now give you an error
object and an error object contains a
stack trace so great if we are doing
production error monitoring we can hook
into one of these two function calls and
we can inspect the stack trace and at
this point in time it's up to you what
you do with that so presumably you want
to send that error report back to your
servers maybe you want to send an email
to your developers saying this happened
or you use a tool like bug snag that
does this all for you I'll get to that
in a minute but in chrome in Opera which
now uses that
the chrome engine and in Firefox no
problem easy peasy don't have to do
anything unfortunately some browsers
make this difficult so IE 9 plus and
safari support stack traces but only
when you catch an exceptional catch an
error in a try-catch block like this so
okay we can get half the way there but
what if we want to not wrap every single
piece of code of try-catch everywhere
this is a pain we don't want to have to
do this almost certainly you're going to
forget to put a try-catch block in
almost certainly there's gonna be air is
happening in asynchronous JavaScript
that you're going to forget and won't be
covered in a try-catch block so how do
we automate this so step one what we can
do is we can wrap functions let's try
and make a way to add a good error
monitoring too bad browsers so what
we've got here is we've made a function
called wrap and you can then pass any
other function into rap and it will put
a try-catch block in but also wreath row
the exception so won't change the
behavior of your code but it will allow
us to get this error object that catch
either that error object that contains a
stack trace that essential debugging
information but we don't want to have to
go and put rap everywhere in our code
that's a that's a big pain in the ass
let's let's make this happen
automatically how can we do it better
well cool thing about javascript is it's
a prototype based inheritance language
so we can do some crazy stuff like
monkey patching or editing add event
less than a remove event listener now
you might think this is crazy it is a
little bit crazy but it works and it's
really really powerful so that wrap
function we built earlier what we can do
here is we can automatically wrap any
callbacks that I sent in to add event
listener and a removable listener now
you may not be using an event listener
yourself but the browser is jQuery is or
Ajax events using this all Dom events
using this so this is kind of like the
low-level event listener function any
code that is running asynchronously is
going to go through here so this is the
place to hook into so putting that all
together we can make a rap function we
can add an
you event listener and then we're golden
except on old ie the bane of all
JavaScript developers so there's not
even a stack trace in a try-catch block
in old eyes just to make this hard for
you so all you get is then error name
and an error message that's it it's
awful but there are still many people
out there using these terrible browsers
and we have to support them so how do we
do that let's get dirty let's make our
own stack trace let's do an approximate
here so this is the final piece of the
puzzle the cool thing about older years
the window dot on error is called in
line so function a called function be
called function C which crashed then
calls window down arrow so we can
actually do something really cool and we
can unwind the stack so using arguments
collie Cola this is a really cool kind
of cool / scary feature of JavaScript
where you can introspect the who called
me as a function we can build our own
fake stack trace it's not going to be as
good as the ones that come native in the
browser but it's going to get us ninety
percent of the way there so we can say
right let's look at who called window
and arrow is function see who called
function see I was fun function be who
can function because function a got it
now I know how the user got into this
state but putting all this together is a
bit of a pain so we've got something if
we want to write this code but we don't
want to have to write this ourselves
right so two things you can do number
one go steal this code we did all the
hard work for you so now github if you
want to write your own error monitoring
in production it's out there go steal it
if you want to have a better solution
we've built it so cool thing about bug
saying is we detect these crashes in
every frame work every browser every
program language and then we group them
together okay my resolution doesn't look
super great on here but each one of
these kind of rows in our dashboard
represents a single error so it doesn't
matter if it happen in old IE if it
happened in chrome if happened in
firefox we by using that stack trace
information we're able to group them all
together
and say hey this error is happening
thousands of times or millions of times
go ahead and fix it but yeah if you have
any kind of questions if you want to go
deeper into that feel free to grab any
one from the bugs 19 we're just over
there and if you want to no doubt about
javascript error handling come and come
and say hi to me afterwards any
questions in the meantime I'll put the
slides up after the presentation and
i'll make sure to link to all the scary
things the automatic wrapping and all
that kind of stuff a link to the github
so the code is available any other
questions I mean one of the things the
reason I said steal our code here do you
mean so the question yeah absolutely so
the question was there any good examples
of production code or open source code
that handles errors really well the idea
behind it's all like bug snag is that
you don't have to worry about handling
these things very well because we have a
single script tag that you can drop in
at the top of your page execution and it
just does all this for you it automatic
instruments try catch blocks it does
everything but in terms of good error
handling it kind of depends and I know
that's a broad question but if you're
using plain old JavaScript there is no
good example of good error handling
because everybody does some things
things our own way if you're using a
framework if let's say you're using
angular or ember or not react but
angular remember these frameworks have a
single place that you can hook into that
says hey when errors happen in my
JavaScript code go and jump into this so
if you are using a framework I recommend
going and checking out the error
handling callbacks that embo angular or
some other frameworks provide and they
have really good examples of his where
you should catch errors and here's how
they end up in this callback for that
make sense awesome any other questions
go ahead we get threw up in fact that
might be a good example of error
handling code that you want to take a
look at I don't know if I can pull this
up here this is
this is bug snags bug snag right so this
is our javascript errors right here and
it saved us a ton like we there was a
really cool thing that were bad thing
that we did only affected a couple
people because most of the people use
our software software developers so
they're using modern browsers but we
rolled out some code that used array dot
index of in javascript which i think is
an extra five edition and it was just
such a natural thing to do and we're
like great it works it's all good and
then suddenly all these arrows started
coming in from ie9 and we were like okay
let's jump in and fix this we don't have
a radar index off let's put it in there
but yeah we definitely use it we dog
through door what do they say the nice
version of that drink your own champagne
any other questions yeah good questions
so we actually support I mean these are
our ones here but we support pretty much
every platform every programming
language every environment so browser
JavaScript back in javascript in node
all pretty much back in languages
php.net java Ruby Python everything and
also mobile so we support iOS and
Android monitoring as well so the idea
is that we do all the hard work that's
platform specific like for example
javascript is a big pain mobile is even
worse and we kind of modernize it and
bring it into one nice clean dashboard
any other questions go ahead yeah good
question so the question is that is
there any technique for filtering out
noise like browser extensions and things
like that so there's two ways to do that
in if you were going to roll your own
then you could inspect the errors and
stack traces and the messages before
sending off to the server or to wherever
you're sending it to what bugs naggers
done is two things number one we
automatically discard chrome extensions
errors because they're just noise and
the second thing is we allow you to do
things like domain whitelisting so you
can say I only want to see errors that
occurred on my website or my CDN or
whatever we also have a client-side
layer where you can run code before any
errors are sent off to our servers so
you can inspect what's about to be sent
to bug snag
then strip it out so this is junk I
don't care about this and that also
helps with things like stripping out
sensitive information maybe you have
credit card numbers or something like
that you don't want to ever send that
off to a third party so you can expect
that data and then stop it from being
sent out cool any other questions yeah
it's a good question the question was
how do we deal with minified code so we
minify we use a lot of coffee script bug
snag don't hold us all that against us
and we also obviously minify in
production but we support source maps so
I know this is a bit blurry here but I
don't if you see / source here what we
do is if you use the source Maps spec
and most tools that generate minified
code automatically support this you just
have to do a dash dash source maps
equals true or whatever at the end we
output a source mapping file so that
will say this is your minified code send
that out to your customers and here's a
source mapping file that takes
compressed function names and file names
and line numbers and turns it into full
ones if you use uglify jas or any of
these minification tools they have this
built-in and what they do is they add a
little comment to the bottom of your
javascript file that says here's where
the source map can be found and bugs and
I automatically ingests that and then
outputs full code so this was eventually
bubbled up this is an error that
happening inside jQuery but obviously
we're minifying jquery this is not what
the code would look like if you were to
look at the file originally but we've
automatically pulled out the source map
and then we're showing you the actual
original unmarried code source code
that's something is almost a whole other
talk about that there's kind of a real
complicated thing to do but again we
handle that for you yeah any other
questions the question is does this
affect performance at all so the
techniques I showed on the on the
presentation back there the only one
that has a even a minor impact on
performance and it adds one millisecond
to every second is in our measurement is
the case where we have to generate our
own stack traces luckily this only
happens when an exception is thrown and
secondly this only happens on I below
the nine
a lesson 9 so we think the trade-off is
is is worthwhile to get that extra
debugging data everywhere else because
we're hooking into prototype callbacks
that overhead is very very minimal and
not measurable in almost all situations
good uh basically our script works in
strict mode ish but obviously arguments
dot cuillean and that kind of stuff is
not allowed what we've done there is we
have a modern browser version of bug
snag and we have an old verte browser
old browser version of website if you're
targeting strict mode you can use the
modern browser only version which
doesn't have any of the trickery like
this in here all that means is you will
lose out and seeing stack traces on old
versions of ie but if you really really
really need strict mode that's the way
to go also because all of our stuff is
open source you can download this you
can remove anything that has anything
you don't let any code that you don't
like or make calls strict mode
violations and you can host it yourself
cool any other questions cool I think
that's it yeah so give me a shout we're
over here bugs make booth you have any
questions or you want to talk more but
thanks to your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
