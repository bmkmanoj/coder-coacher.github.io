the members of the ops team here at
rapleaf and we have a deployed system
called Pentagon okay so what are we
looking for in pentagon we were looking
for these things we want some it's multi
user with a simple simple ACL we also
want something that's what one deployed
going on / time / project and we also
want to be able to disable deploys for a
project now in case the builds broken or
something so what are the pieces here so
we have screen now screen allows for a
multiplex window system that's attached
to a virtual terminal so when someone
types exit or you know leaves us the
session it doesn't go away it's still
there you know for anybody to attach to
later it's also using a shared screen
system so that means multiple people can
be logged in and view what's happening
and see what someone's doing and then
that allows us to easily coordinate
between two large number of developers
now we also use Capistrano I don't think
we're going to get into cups Toronto
because it's pretty typical out there
it's a really great work horse for
automating deploys doing all the stuff
that takes to push your project out to
your system and make it run we also use
svn now we're not particularly tight svn
it's just that that's what we happen to
use here at RAF leaf put those all
together and you get Pentagon so a
Pentagon is something that we store in
svn typical we can selectively lockout
modifications to certain deploy scripts
for example DNS should only be done by
the people who touch DNS website by
people who touch the website but in
reality here rapidly if we don't really
do that for too many projects now since
it started we know we start it in a
restricted shell now restricted bash
shell means that you can't on set or set
environment variables you can't type in
command to start with /
and you can't see d so it kind of lock
people in without having us do some
crazy footwork we also do a convenience
we also alias exits now it's not a
security measure that's just a
convenience because how many times have
you been just like rolling around doing
your stuff and you type in exit out of
habits you don't want to do that in
deploy system we also have kept files
now cap files again typical Capistrano
stuff one cap file / one project and
it's very easy to see what this projects
going to do when you deploy it we also
organize our stuff into a comment sort
of functionality into the / the lib
directory now that directory it's just
like again more convenience stuff so
there we're just going to do stuff like
hey take this in and out load balancer
you know Cody's ability there's some
other stuff that we do here at rapleaf
like we do sandy checks and svn
reversions don't deploy a non-existent
svn version number so why do we start
screen as a particular user we do that
because of the limitations of screen so
in our setup we have screen run as a
certain deploy user and that's attached
to a virtual terminal aha here you can
see the the RC RC script that we use for
screen as you can see here we set the
history to something insanely high this
allows our people to log in and go back
in the history and see what's going on
with a deploy see who deployed it and
what was the status and what were the
error messages that get generated we
check that into svn so now you know we
can monitor it and roll back and do all
the stuff that we want to do we also
redefine ps1 to say this is the deploy
system and we also override path
eliminate them to a specific restrict
set of bin commands so how does this all
work so first are to put our engineers
will log into the machine the deploy
machine and type and deploy and that's a
batch trapper script that will connect
them to the screen what session using
screen they can then navigate to the
deploys what you can see here sorry it's
kind of blurry but that's our list of
deploys
they go to the deploy window and then
they type please deploy that's it it's
so simple so what's happening when they
type in please deploy well it runs a
batch rapper script that wraps cap and
you're probably wondering why well why
not just run cap itself since we're
running as a shared screen user and ours
in our screen sessions the deploys of
running as that user not as a person
who's logged in so since we want to
create an audit trail of who deployed
what we asked we create this wrapper
script that asked for their username and
password and then we'll run the deploy
will run the Capistrano commands as that
user we also have a little easter egg
that some of our developers know about
we Elias pleased with damn it so instead
of saying please deploy you could say
dammit deploy this features so with a
small number of users it was really you
know enough to say hey don't run the
deploy I'm about to like do something
you know as you get your grand bigger
than your infrastructure that's no
longer really doable so we have a
feature of lock so please lock which
will then ask for your username and a
message to display to people that she
displayed for people who want to deploy
it you can see it a example of it right
there where I say hey you know don't
deploy this the build is broken the next
person comes in and will say hey please
to pull a and I'll say no no can't do
that yet to remove that lock anybody can
log in and say please unlock you know
it's not really necessary for us to have
the person who set the lock to unlock
its too much maintenance the fun stuff
so deploying Pentagon from with Pentagon
will cause Pentagon to do an SV ends up
so that's pretty easy but also that
since our Capistrano things run since
our task run the Capistrano is on demand
they don't catch those cap files in
memory you know just simply replacing
the files underneath Pentagon means the
next person who runs the deploy will
then get those new set of files and the
new set of task
when you to add or remove a deploy is a
little tricky and we have some bash
magicas isms that will take care of that
for us so first it will you need to edit
the screen RC file and there you will
add or remove the project deploys you
will then add into the dirt or cap file
directory structure the deploys project
from svn so everything matches our
structure and then you'll deploy
pentagon from pentagon to update the svn
s and then outside of pentagon you will
start and stop it now that's where the
bash magic stuff gets really tricky
because you don't want to like stop the
whole deploy system well in someone's
running an active deploy that just
sounds really bad so when you restart
the screen it'll do a certain steps
number of steps apt it updates the
caption field in every single screen
session to indicate that hey we're about
to restart the deploy system please hold
off and then it will get the pit session
of the script get the pit of the screen
session from there it will get the
children of that pit session or of the
screen and those children represent
every single deploy that we have at the
moment then the script will look for the
children of that children of the screen
session and hence that's grandchildren
now those grandchildren represents the
running active deploys and then we just
sit in a bash while loop waiting 40
grandchildren grandchildren means that
you're someone's running into dr. deploy
at the moment once we have no
grandchildren we know it's safe we stop
the screen and then restart screen and
then voila we have added or removed
screens from our projects from our
screen sessions so what's the future
hold for our system we would like to tie
this into Hudson a little more elegantly
so we don't deploy broken builds that's
something that still happens once in a
while something else is that we're
hoping that we whether we we need to
figure out how to get a use we know that
screen captures the user who logged in
is attached to that virtual terminal
we don't know how to get that user name
from screen if you know how please let
us know we've been hitting it head
against that no wall for a while that's
it I like to give a special thanks to
Brian Ethier for hosting for sponsoring
this event and also similarly own who
was the original developer implementing
this project any question the question
was how many people do we have typically
deploying these projects so our teams
are about like 5 to 10 people per
projects you know you can imagine that
you know when we're like in a huge
sprint rush that they're just doing
massive you know iteration after
iteration after iteration so again it's
only one person who can do a deploy at a
time but you know again like there's so
they're deploying so often the question
was can we cue up deploys and the answer
is today no that's not something that we
felt that we need at this point in time
all right thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
