I'm going to be talking about things
that I don't normally talk about things
that make me uncomfortable I'm going to
be talking about how functional
programming is terrible
okay now those who know me you know that
I'm you know I'm a functional
programming zealot and extremists but
I'm gonna do kind of like a counterpoint
to that here now
I'm gonna talk about sort of the other
side of things okay but you know
obviously this is hyperbole and it has a
happy ending so you know if you were
worried about that then you can rest
easy okay so first of all let's talk
about how do I skip to the next slot
there you go so first let's talk about
what functional programming is what do I
mean when I say functional programming
so I don't mean you know a buzz already
fuzzy kind of thing like oh I'm doing
functional programming because I'm doing
maps and filters I mean you know
programming where your entire program is
a single referentially transparent
expression composed of other
referentially transparent expressions
okay no side effects you know no
mutability in a global mutable state and
that kind of thing you still do you know
IO and that kind of thing but you do
them in a compositional way you know
like with the scholars at stream library
and that kind of thing okay so
everything purely functional that's what
I mean by functional programming so
let's talk about the reasons why this
can be terrible so the reason number one
that functional programming is terrible
in Scala is that it insists on tail call
elimination this is not optional and
Scala does not have this so this is kind
of a terrible requirement so what our
tail calls let's first you know get that
out of the way tail calls are sort of
the last thing that a function does
right so here the call B of V is in tail
position because it's the last thing
that this function foo does in the true
branch of the zip statement right
there's nothing further to be
after calling Vav there's nothing
further that Fuu needs to do and
conversely C of V here is a call that is
not in tail position it's not a tail
call because it still has to add one to
the result the result is I mean the the
effect of that is that theoretically at
least the compiler could figure out that
Fuu has no further work to do after
calling B and then B instead of
returning to Fuu could return to the
caller of Fuu and that elimination of
stack frames is tail call elimination
now Scala does some tail call
elimination it can eliminate self
recursive tail calls so here's a a
recursive definition of a factorial
function that is not tail recursive and
so you know no tail calls here we can't
do anything but we can refactor this to
be tail recursive so here we can
actually see that the the goal function
this helper function is calling itself
as the last step and so Scala will
actually figure out that you know
there's nothing else that go needs to do
after it calls itself and so it'll
actually compile this to a jump instead
of a function call and a jump is exactly
what a while loop is compiled to so this
while loop version of the factorial
function is exactly equivalent to the
tail recursive function that we saw
before but Scala does nothing to help
you with inter method tail calls with
tail calls between methods for example
where this foo function is calling be
fun for this bee function because and
this is because of Java's call semantics
so Scala has made this design choice
that Java's call semantics have to be
emulated or you know have to be
compatible with with Scala's and so when
you call a method you know it implements
it as the bytecode you know invoke
function and so
Java's called cymatics require that
there is a stack frame for every
function call and that's a real problem
for functional programming because
functional programming being terrible as
it is it insists
on tail calls why is that why is this
important for functional programming
well it's because in functional
programming you may want to compose a
lot of functions together and you want
it to be completely transparent that
when you have a function and it's
composed of a lot of other functions you
want that to be transparent to the user
but it's not because when you take a
list of functions like this let's say
you have here a list of a hundred
thousand functions then you compose them
all together and then you call the
resulting function of type a to a that
is going to overflow the stack it's
going to just crash and there's some
point at which that that list becomes
one to long and it's not consistent
between you know 999 functions and 1000
functions it's going to just like you
know overflowed the stack at that sort
of breaking point and that's really
terrible the solution to this in
languages like Scala that don't have
tail call elimination is to use
trampolines and the way it trampolines
work is that you have a data structure
that represents your computation so
instead of you know just making calls
you capture you suspend the computation
you capture it in the data structure and
and here's how that works you have a
data type like this here I'm calling a
tail rec it can be one of two things it
can either return a value in which case
it will be constructed as one of these
return cases where we'll actually have a
value of type A or it could be a
suspension where you have a function a
resumption function that you know
something that can call to sort of
execute a single step of your
computation and the result of resume is
another one of these tail racks so you
can imagine that this is sort of like a
list of presumptions where you know you
call one resumption and it gives you the
next one and then you call that and it
gives you the next one and so you can
sort of step through the computation one
step at a time in a tail recursive loop
right until you hit one of these return
things okay then that's going to be at
the very end when the computation has
finished and so that gives you the
ability to do
be tail-recursive so instead of
returning a value that you get from a
function call you put the function call
inside one of these suspensions and
return that and the way that we can use
this in our in our composition here is
we we instead of composing just saying
like and then instead of calling our
functions directly we and this is much
longer you know and more sort of
difficult to see but so we start with
sort of the base cases that we return
the answer right and then sort of at
each element or each function in this in
this list we suspend before we call that
function and so at the end we then pass
you know a1 to the filter result and
that's going to give us a a tail rec
that we then call run on and run is is
you know a tail recursive loop that's
going to then walk over all of those
suspends and is going to you know
actually run the computation okay and a
tail recursive loop like that is called
a trampoline because we're constantly
bouncing back and forth between you know
this function here that we have composed
all and the tail recursive loop which is
the run method so this does not come for
free trampolines have a definite memory
overhead there there's a limited memory
overhead because this these suspensions
are being generated lazily you don't
have all of them you know on your heap
at the same time but they have to be
created and so you have garbage overhead
and that means it is a performance
overhead and it has a further
performance overhead because you're
constantly jumping back and forth
between two methods it's not necessarily
a hot spot so when just-in-time
compilation kicks in it can't
necessarily figure out that you have a
hot loop all right so this can have
devastating performance implications but
function composition in Scala can't be
done basically in any
sort of large degree without trampolines
and monads can't be used like they're
basically useless without trampolines
unnhhh on trampoline monads if you have
you know a chain of flat maps we have
you know something and then flat map and
there's a function that calls flat map
again and if you do that in the loop
that's going to overflow the stack and
there's no way around that except using
trampolines and that is terrible so
reason number two the functional
programming is terrible is that it
insists on higher kind of types higher
kinds of types allow you to to do code
reuse and and so to write sort of
higher-order abstractions that you know
so you don't repeat yourself all the
time you need to have higher kind of
types so I mean Heather talked about
higher kind so I'm not going to talk too
much about what what that means but so
you can think of kinds as the types of
types right so int has the simplest kind
it's it's a kind star or you know it has
no further sort of shape doesn't have
any content and list of int is another's
with a simple type but lists by itself
is not a type it's a type constructor it
needs a type to construct the type so
you know you have lists you give it a
type of kind star like int and it gives
you another type of kind star which is
listed it and then either is a binary
type constructor it takes two stars and
gives you 1 star and monad is a higher
kind it is a higher order type
constructor it takes a type instructor
of kind star to star as its type
argument and gives you a type of kind
star and now in Scala this is annotated
with these underscores and brackets so
if you have a higher kind of type like t
see here a higher-order type constructor
you know you annotate it with these
underscores and open brackets and and
more underscores okay so what is this
bias it buys us code reuse we can writes
functions like this like Traverse and
sequence which are very general and
extremely useful
so traverse is kind of like map except
that the the function f is not from A to
B it's from A to G of B okay where G is
some applicative functor okay and what
that means in practice is that whatever
G may be it could be option or it could
be future or something else what it
means in practice is that you know you
sort of map over this list with with
this function f producing a bunch of
futures and then this function will then
take all of those futures and combine
them into one future that runs all of
those other features in parallel and
gives you a list of the results so you
can see that the result type of Traverse
is G of list of B so a a simple sort of
derivative Combinator that you can write
is sequence where if you have say a list
of futures it can give you a future of a
list of all the answers of those
features we have a list of options it
can give you an option that's none if
any of the input options are none or sum
of all the answers if all of them are
are some okay importantly you have to
write this only once because you can
abstract over the type constructor and
over the applicative functor G and you
can take that type constructor so you
can show a sequence and Traverse have
higher kind of types so you write this
once and for all
so placated functors or things like
future list option and it's used for all
of those things but but here's one of
these things is not like the other write
state here to think somebody talked
about before state is is a way of sort
of purely functionally representing a
stateful computation you know it's just
a function it takes an input state and
it produces an output state together
with a value that's computed from that
state and you know mapping over this and
flat mapping over this are it's just
function composition okay but if you
wanted to use this with Traverse you
can't do that because Scala lacks this
this higher-order unification that Lars
was talking about
so what happens is that because state
has a different kind of different shape
a different kind than option list and at
future Scala will not be able to figure
out that this is okay to do that I can
actually use you know the state
applicative functor here and write this
so it's actually going to tell me that
there are no type parameters no type
parameters for method Traverse that
exists so then it can be applied to the
arguments that I gave it and that is a
blatant lie and I can prove that because
all I have to do is just tell it hey
there you know you there is a type
constructor I'm going to call it lambda
that has the right kind it takes a
single type argument X and it is equal
to state of int and X and then this is
all going to work just fine but I have
to do this now everywhere I call
Traverse with anything that you know I
want to sort of like partially apply
that doesn't fit into this neat picture
of you know type constructors with with
a single type argument now if if Scala
we can imagine a Scala that had this
feature of type currying where you know
instead of having or we could have in
addition to having states that takes two
type arguments of kind star we could
have a state that has you know two type
argument lists very much like we have
curried functions at the value level so
we could have a state that takes you
know a type argument of kind star which
then returns a type constructor that get
takes the other one okay and then we
could just partially apply state with
int and that would have the correct
shape the correct kind to be used as an
applicative and then everything would
just work but it doesn't so we need to
resort to violence like unapplied so
this unapplied thing lets you say if you
have an implicit instance of this
unapplied thing it lets you say that you
know if i want to traverse a list with a
function from a to some other type G of
B I take implicit evidence that there
exists some type constructor
that is an applicative functor and an G
of B can be deconstructed into M and a
so a type constructor M in a value a
where G B is equal to the type M of a
okay and I know this is really kind of
kind of painful to look at but you know
again scholars E and and shapeless do
this boilerplate work so that you don't
have to but you do have to write your
own you know traverse instances if you
if you want to write your own type
instructors okay so when we've written
that traverse U which is written in
terms of Traverse we can now pass it a
state action and everything will be
hunky-dory
so kinds in Scala are really sort of
insufficient for for our purposes here
it's really kind of terrible that we
have to do this this work at all
so kinds are never inferred you always
have to supply kind annotations so you
can't say you know I have some type you
know something m and it may be a type
constructor I don't know Scala you go
figure it out it can't do that you have
to always annotate and not only do you
have to annotate them you also have to
annotate the kinds of the arguments to
your type constructors so when you when
you have you know when you annotate the
kind as a type constructor and that type
constructor takes arguments you have to
annotate whether that type is a type
constructor and what the kinds of the
arguments to those type constructors are
as well so it really gets and variance
is part of the kind of any type I didn't
even mention that
so that's horrible so how can we make
functional programming less terrible
well some suggestions we could have tail
call elimination that would be fantastic
but we don't have it it would be nice to
have kind inference or you know a kind
system at all but you know for for now
we just have to annotate every
thing with with our kinds and sort of
you know use implicit evidence whenever
we need to do anything complicated we do
type level computation we'd be great to
have better type inference you know like
just when you need type inference just
when you need to sort of tie the knot
and say okay figure this out for me I
have a recursive function figure out
what the type of this thing is that nope
can't do it it's a recursive function
you got to give it you know got to give
me a type annotation okay and again all
this has memory overhead so whenever we
do functional programming we work with
unboxed function reference that mean
with boxed function references so
whenever you have a first-class function
it's actually an object and and that's
really just a waste of memory that
doesn't doesn't need to happen
the so the general direction that we
should be going towards is to minimize
the runtime representation of you know
of our denotations of our functional
representations okay it would be nice to
have real existential types but we don't
have those it would be great
you know if when I pattern match on
something that has an existential type I
would get something other than a class
cast and then a class cast exception at
runtime it would be awesome to have
Universal quantification so we can talk
about things like you know parametric
polymorphism and you know rank two and
rank n type functions so that we can
really take you make use of parameter
s'ti and another thing that's kind of
terrible is that you can have side
effects everywhere you can throw
exceptions wherever you want and the you
know Scala isn't going to tell you
anything about whether that's going on
okay so whenever you call something you
can't be sure you can't be sure that
it's not going to you know fire the
missiles right so that's you know that
makes me depressed so so what is
functional programming really for is it
really just a hairshirt
are we just you know putting this thing
on because you know we want to be you
know academics and you know should we
just throw this stuff out and just use
global mutable state everywhere you know
cuz you know that's going to be fast and
and
and and whatever ah and no no we should
not write because why why shouldn't we
well because the alternative is even
more terrible the alternative is you
know global mutable state the
alternative is remaining at the status
quo you know it's it's side effects and
and horribleness okay
the alternative to functional
programming is unreasonable and
incoherent code okay so in truth
functional programming is actually a
huge win even with all these annoyances
and I would say compared to those wins
these annoyances are very very minor
which is why I do functional programming
in Scala at all so reason number one
that functional programming is awesome
is modularity okay now what's modularity
modularity is the property that your
software can be separated into its
constituent parts and those parts can be
reused independently of the whole and
they can be reused in sort of novel ways
they can be reused in ways that you did
not anticipate when you created those
parts all right what does that value in
practice it buys you modularity sorry
what does modularity buy you in practice
advise you reusability because you know
obviously if you can take out your the
parts of your of your program and then
you can reuse them sort of independently
of the whole obviously that's going to
give you reusable code it's going to
give you testability because if you
could take your thing apart you know you
can pull out a part of your program it's
it's not like going to have wires
hanging off of it that you don't know
whether you know what are and then you
can test that thing independently of
everything else you know it's always
safe to test a functional component and
these things are parallelizable as well
because you know it's safe to separate
things out and run them separately in a
separate thread if you know if that
makes sense and you gain this property
for the simple reason that functions are
modular the functions are modular
because you know whenever you have
of an a and you want to be and then you
have a function of type A to B it's
always safe to just take your function
of type A to B and put it there yeah it
always makes sense there's nothing else
that you need to worry about it's always
testable because you can always take a
function and you can test it you can
notice a function of type A to B it's
always safe to just give it its
arguments and look at the result and see
if the result is what you expect it's
eminently testable and it's always safe
to call a function from multiple threads
and the order of execution is not going
to matter because you know no mutation
is going to escape and and you know the
pure function is just going to return a
value all right
reason number two that functional
programming is awesome is
compositionality now compositionality is
the property that your software can be
understood as a whole by understanding
its parts and the rules governing the
composition all right and what that
means in practice is scalability because
large programs become exactly the same
as small programs they're going to be
composed of some parts they can be
individually understood and the laws are
going to ensure that as things get
larger they don't get more complex you
know you're going to just if you have a
function of type A to B it doesn't
matter if that function is composed of a
trillion other functions you know the
interface remains exactly the same and
you reason about this thing exactly the
same way so compositional programs are
reasonable because at every level you
have pieces that can be individually
understood by looking at their pieces
and how they fit together and so you get
this property of composition that come
visit compositionality by the simple
fact that functions are compositional
you know if you have a function f of
type a to b if you have a function g of
type b to c you can always put them
together into a composite function of
type agency and that is also just a
function and that could be composed of
100 other functions and it can be used
in compositions as well
okay so let say gets me through the
third reason that functional programming
is awesome and I think that this is
something something that we don't talk
about enough and and we need to me to
talk about this right functional
programming makes us happy
right cuz because I mean no I mean I'm
being serious
I I really think that you know like oh
we're logical and we're programmers so
you know we got up like no we got to not
talk about our feelings and we gotta you
know just get on with it but no why why
do we get on with it why are we here at
all why do we program well because
programming is exhilarating programming
is exciting it's awesome at least you
know at first when you start a new
project right it's great you know you
start a new project you feel you know
awesome your coding way and then after a
while your project sort of you lose
control of it it starts to become it
starts to feel so yeah I'm talking about
my feelings it starts it starts to feel
like a big bowl of mud it starts to feel
like you're trotting through a swamp
whenever you want to change anything and
it starts to feel you know like you have
a sense of revulsion like you don't want
to touch the codebase because you know
it might break or you know it's going to
be very difficult to get through and so
fixing bugs becomes you know difficult
you start to procrastinate it's terrible
so reasons why functional programming
implies happiness is that you have you
know less of this friction and
frustration because functional programs
are modular you can you know pull things
out and you can move them around so
there's less of this friction that you
know whenever you pull something
something out is going to be stuck to
all kinds of other things but you can
always just you know take something out
maybe throw it away replace it with
something else but it's it makes things
very sort of easy and pleasant things
are more predictable so functional
programs you know they they behave
according to certain laws and so
if you make a mistake you know the laws
will ensure that that you know that
mistake is going to have some effect
that that bitter sort of bounded by
something sensible you know it's it's
not that if you make a mistake over here
then this thing way over here is going
to break that has no seeming relation to
that at all
so is it really kind of constrains
things and you have less cognitive load
because there are fewer things that you
need to keep in your head the only
things you need to keep in your head or
sort of the broad abstractions and the
implementation details kind of fade away
you know and and uh I for myself like
whenever somebody asked me like oh how
does this you know this library that you
wrote like how does it work and you know
under the hood I'm like I don't know
it's a monad you know it's like I I
don't have to know I only have to know I
have to keep in the back of my head some
abstract principles some laws and then
when I come back to it I know that it's
going to make sense because you know I
know that I wrote it according to those
laws I don't really know or care how I
actually did it
okay and the solution space is is
smaller so there are fewer programs that
you can write and that doesn't mean that
oh you know we're constrained and we're
in a you know we're in a straitjacket we
can't you know do anything it doesn't
constrain what you can do just how you
can do it you can think of it as as
roads you know roads constrain you so
that you don't like drive into the
wilderness and get you know stuck in a
in a rut in a ditch and or get killed or
something but they still allow you to go
you know wherever you need to go and so
the search for the for the solution to a
problem is really sort of constrained
along a path or it's sort of a branching
path all right and this makes finding
the solution much more pleasant because
you're much less likely to run into
trouble and this makes you more
productive because you can find the
solutions faster because the space is
smaller and lastly it gives you pride
because once you build something you can
be sort of sure that that it
you know that it conforms to to what you
were trying to to accomplish you know it
looks and feels clean it is a solution
that is reasonable and you can hold it
in your head and you can look at it and
you can say well this is you know this
makes sense it's awesome okay so I asked
some people on on Twitter
how does functional programming make you
feel and the response was overwhelmingly
positive so for example Rob said
functional programming makes me happy
because there's never any unstated
context they have to know about so it
reduces his con cognitive load it makes
it more relaxed and yeah Richard says
makes me feel calm I don't have to keep
as much in my head to get stuff done
my favorite one is by Katie which she
says functional programming makes me
feel sane I feel like a mathematician
and an artist living in a beautiful
structurally sound clean house so I wish
we would talk about you know our
feelings more you know because this this
stuff is is great it's inspiring it
makes me want to work because you know
why are we here at the end of the day I
mean we're not here to you know increase
social utility or to you know increase
the the bottom line for the the company
now we're here because you know
functional programming is where
programming in general is awesome and
functional programming sort of amplifies
that so in summary functional
programming yes it can be awkward and
terrible but the alternative is
impossible right the alternative you
know if I couldn't do any functional
programming in Scala I would not write a
single line of Scala I would just not do
it because the benefits are just too
great to pass up and so we have to
insist that our tools get better at this
we have to insist that Scala get better
at this or we have to just leave it
behind because I really think the
alternative is an impossibility the
alternative is you know the status quo
we have to be able to move forward and I
really think that compositional and
modular software you know and being able
to reason compositionally about software
is the way to get us to
you know programming sort of in the
large and this last point I would just
want to emphasize that your happiness
matters okay like pay attention to what
makes you happy like don't don't
resign yourself to just like working for
the man and like doing the thing that's
pragmatic or whatever but you know pay
attention to to you know what makes you
make you happy as a programmer because
ultimately that's that's what life is
all about and like happiness is how you
experience what it's like to be alive
so I don't think that time for a couple
questions if anybody has yeah can it or
will can functional programming in Scala
get better and will it get better from
what I've heard today yeah it can I
think that you know it's never it's
software right you can do anything it's
never the end of the road and so if you
have something that is intractable and
terrible you can always throw it away
and you can start from scratch I mean
you know there's they're starting over
with this dotty language they're
starting from a calculus that is
reasonable and so ya know I think that I
really don't know the answer but it's
certainly not outside the realm of
possibility another question well I mean
high school does have other problems but
yeah I mean I think high school
generally has the things that I want and
yeah I you know when I'm sort of
programming on my own I tend to choose
Haskell just because like I I don't have
to deal with a lot of these these things
but there are other things that I might
need to deal with if I if I want to
write whenever I need to write something
that's you know sort of for production
or whatever I tend to find that a lot of
libraries don't exist yet and so I might
have to write them myself so but that's
you know that's not a permanent problem
obviously so we can always we can always
get better I don't have a vision for
what that would look like I think that I
think ultimately either Java's call
semantics have to get better or you know
it has to supply a tail call byte code
or something and failing that we yeah we
basically have to just implement our own
runtime and I mean that's you know it's
software ah but it was question I'm here
I'm gonna take more I don't I don't know
that that's true that you can reason
about memory easier you certainly can't
reason about memory usage
compositionally so if you if you start
to you know compose your programs of oh
I'm sorry I'm gonna repeat the question
the question is you do get better memory
usage from it can you reason about
memory usage easier with imperative
programming that function part of me I
think the answer to that is no okay
I thought that's all I'm gonna say okay
