director of engineering for your own
mobile sweet server products that
includes road connect are you might've
heard of our hosted service row hub and
then later this year will be formally
launching row gallery just a kind of a
quick show of hands how many people here
got to see Adams talk yesterday on Roe
connect okay great so I'll kind of go go
quickly over the road connect
introduction since most of you most of
you saw that so what is Rho connect row
connect is a we call it a mobile app
integration server it lets you interact
with your back-end data systems whether
their CRM or field service or really any
kind of back-end system and let you
synchronize your mobile application with
that system in a very efficient way so
Rho connect has several different
clients that are that we support the
most popular ones are the one the the
client that comes built into roads and
row elements so if you use roads or Ella
row elements as you've going through
your sessions here you'll notice that we
talk a lot about the sync client or the
road connect client it's built into that
into the roads framework we also have a
client for just regular Android Java if
you're building a regular Android
application or if you have an existing
iOS application we have a objective-c
client we also have a JavaScript client
rope connect j/s which i'll be showing
later here in the demo this lets you use
row connect just directly from an html5
application for example phonegap or even
a desktop application so how does how
does real connect kind of work what it
does is it you write these pieces of
code called source adapters which Adam
talked a lot about yesterday where you
transform your back-end data into simple
data structures that can be synchronized
and the way that you transform that data
in a source adapter it's a pretty
generic system so what what we do here
with
plug-ins is we build upon that that
concept and you can see we here here we
support some pre-built adapters for
systems like Sugar CRM Microsoft
Dynamics or a coal sales force or you
could of course build your own source
adapters and then for server plugins we
currently support microsoft net MVC ruby
on rails which will be what i'm showing
today and spring MVC for java so
adapters are pretty simple i mean you
saw in the demo yesterday there it's not
usually not a lot of code the kind of
the power and expressiveness of Ruby
lets you do a lot of things with with
very terse code very easy to understand
and read so here's a typical source
adapter query method and here I've just
baked in some hard coded data I've got a
result hash road connects source
adapters have to transform data into
what we call nested hash structure or
hash of hashes in this case I'm creating
a hash that has two objects with an idea
of one and ID of two and everything is
there's a name and an industry attribute
for each one so what does row connect do
with this how does how does rope connect
take this and synchronize it well it
doesn't it what it does with your data
is pretty simple it takes this and it
serializes it to Redis in an efficient
format using Redis sets and we do that
for a number of reasons the most
important reason is Retta supports
atomic dipping on sets and so what this
lets us do is efficiently tell how much
data has the device currently
synchronized and how much data is left
and what are the deltas and we can do
that in sub you know 50 millisecond time
or sub 10 millisecond time so you have
to of course your source adapter also
write create updating delete methods
they follow a similar pattern where
you're taking data that's coming in from
the client and you're transforming it
into a hash structure that row connect
understands and then it saves it to
Redis to
to keep track of what the client is
doing so why plugins well plugins are
simpler why are plugins simpler so if we
look at this example we have a pretty
straightforward structure here it's just
a string object ids and string app
tributes in a nested hash of each object
so we always know that this structure is
going to be there for us we know what
this always looks like so row connect
also has an HTTP API and the way that
this works is your application can make
a HTTP call to this push objects method
road connect will then update the
associating reddest data for an adapter
and the client will get that latest data
when it synchronizes so you don't
technically have to write an adapter to
put data into rho connect you can you
can just do it over over an HTTP API and
it will basically have the same effect
so here's an example using a using this
API to push some data into the same
source adapter example I had before in
this case I'm pushing a single object
with an ID of five and the name is
iphone and this is this is using Ruby so
so using the popular HTTP client rest
client for for doing that so wrote
connect plugins build upon this concept
the idea is you don't you should never
have to write a source adapter for your
application you can just focus on
writing your application whether it's
net or whether it's spring MVC or if
it's Ruby on Rails so you just focus on
writing your web application the plug-in
takes care of interacting with Road
connect and keeping track of the data
that gets synchronized so as I said it's
you can use we currently support for
Ruby we support rails or Sinatra
applications using active record or data
mapper as the ORM s at kind of a lower
level row connect the road connect rubee
library is it sits on top of your model
so it understands how to talk
datamapper or active record models and
then we support done at NBC as i
mentioned in java spring-mvc you can now
that being said you there is always
going to be cases where you need to
customize things so it provides hooks
where you can do something like convert
a date format to an epoch time before
you synchronize it let's say you want to
send down just the integer time to the
device you can do that with hooks and
these are all the available hooks you
have you have an authenticate hug which
will receive the devices username and
password and lets you authenticate the
user in your back-end system row connect
isn't your row connect server doesn't
know anything about authentication at
this point it's just forwarding on the
credentials to your web application and
then you get create query update and
delete hooks as well so you can
effectively right a source adapter
inside of your model if you wanted to
just like adapters and then for those of
you who use Heroku I'm going to attempt
to show a live demo hopefully the
internet is working of using our Heroku
add-on it's a simple way to if you have
an existing rails or Sinatra application
on Heroku you can install this add-on
and everything is auto configured for
you and all you have to do is set up
your models to sync and it'll
automatically happen so I encourage
anyone here who's using Heroku to check
this out even if you're not using her
open you're interested it's very simple
to get set up and start playing with it
so what is real connect RB this is the
Ruby server plugin for RO connect again
it's you're focusing on your model
whether it's active record data mapper
all of the logic around how data gets
synchronized what data gets synchronized
that's all going in your model and wrote
connect has is part of this this concept
of partitions i'm not sure if Adam
mentioned it yesterday where the the way
that we tell ok this particular data set
is associated with this user is by a
partition or we in the rails world I
call a scope and this is basically just
a way to key the day
data for this user so let's say for
example I had a list of calendar events
for for Lars I could log into the system
with the username Lars and there and all
my data would be stored inside of real
connect under the waters keyword so when
you query for this data you query by a
partition the the partition is always
going to be passed on to you so you know
from where this request for data is
coming from and you can build up your
results set so getting started if you're
using Ruby on Rails the canonical way to
add a gem is to put it into your gem
file so we just add this one line into
our gym file and we run bundle that will
automatically add the library to our
rails application just kind of show my
hands is you who hears used rails before
or done development with rails or
Sinatra anyone here yes we have a few so
just kind of as you've heard a lot about
roads obviously and and the raw elements
framework roads wasn't kind of initially
inspired by Ruby on Rails it takes a lot
of takes a lot of the same pattern
development patterns and design
structure as ruby on rails so i highly
recommend if you have some time to check
out rails to to play around with it it's
a pretty amazing framework for building
web apps so the next thing i do here to
to set things up as i run in my rails
app ray Crowe connect set up what this
will do is it'll install an initializer
file where I can configure the plug-in
and this is the only thing I have to do
to actually set up the plugin so this is
the initializer generates there's a few
key things I need to add here since road
connects is a bi-directional system Road
connect needs to know where your
application is hosted so it can talk to
it and the reverse is true that your
application obviously needs to know
where r 0 connect is hosted so I'm going
to sip those things up here I'm going to
set my app endpoint in this case the
rails applications could be running our
local host 3000 actually I
I'm not going to set the location of the
row connect instance here because I'm
going to show that in the demo using an
environment variable which is something
that's sort of key for making your
application a little bit more portable
and then the next thing I'm going to do
here is I'm going to put in my
authenticate hook so what row connect
will do here is it will send the
credentials to my application in the
form of the this credentials hash and
you'll see a login and a password in
that hash so I can use these credentials
to authenticate the user and then return
true or false so in this case I already
have a user model that has an authentic
eight method which is sort of a common
paradigm in rails and this method will
return true or false based on the
credentials that are passed in and it
compares them with a a hashed password
in the database
so the next thing that you need to do is
set up your model in this case I'm using
an active record model that's the
default model type for rails and I'm
going to be building an event model here
so it's going to just show like a list
of events for for example the app form
here and this model is very simple it's
just it belongs to a user so I'm going
to be logged into the system and I'll
have a list of my events that I'm
tracking and the web application will
show me my events first thing I do is I
include real connect resource so what
this does is this is used as a powerful
feature of Ruby called module mix-ins
and it will basically add all of the
functions that we provide in the rails
server plug-in in directly into your
model so your your class now this event
class now has a bunch of methods to find
that come with ro connect that we don't
have to worry about implementing that
handle automatic transfer of data
between our rails application and the
euro connect server next is I'm going to
define a partition so this partition is
a way to get that key of data remember I
was talking about everything in wrote
connect is keyed off of a unique string
and did the most canonical way to do it
is to have the unique string match the
user name so if I log into the system
with the username Lars I need to have
some way to find that user from my event
model and that's I'm doing that here by
using an active record relationship
which is this belongs to user so what
this is going to tell me is this
relationship to the the user for this
particular event is going to be used to
synchronize the data and then the final
piece is I need to define my data set
that's going to be used for query and
again it's using this partition so what
happens is when the device will
synchronize it will tell my application
hey I'm Lars where's my data and the
Rope connect server plugin will execute
this method
passing in Lars as the as the key so I
can do a simple active record query here
that will give me all of the data
associated for the Lars user and again
you know don't worry too much about this
rails or this active record syntax this
is just an example you know if you're
using Java spring MVC you can use the
conventions there for querying down data
so again my partition defines the scope
and my row connect query method defines
the data set so this is a just a quick
just a quick overview of how the Heroku
add-on works so one of the things I
haven't covered yet is well if I'm
running my rails application I still
need to run a rope connect server and
what the Heroku add-on does is it helps
you eliminate that need you can just
install the add-on that way you don't
have to worry about hosting your own
rope connect instance and these real
connect instances they're literally just
and I'll show this in the demo it's just
a vanilla row Connect app that I've
generated I didn't change any code in it
I just generate an empty app and then I
started up we do we have plans in the
future to make that a little bit more
simple where you can literally just
start a command from the command line or
just just run a single command and
you'll have a row connect server running
that can talk to these server plugins so
what I'll do here is I'm going to add
the Heroku add-on and you'll see some
output like this where it adds it to my
application and then Heroku has a nice
feature where you can view the
configuration so everything that runs in
Heroku is done with environment
variables and in this case provisioning
a row connect instance using our service
it takes usually about 20 to 30 seconds
maybe a little bit longer so in order to
tell when it's finished since the Roku
doesn't have a way to to wait for it to
finish you can run this command to check
the environment variables and so
eventually after about 30 seconds or so
you'll see this road connect URL appear
and this this way you know that your row
connect instance is ready and it's wired
up to your rails application and then
for the changes to take effect I go
ahead and restart my app and it's ready
to go so hopefully the Internet's
working well i'll try to a jump to a
demo here
ok
so what I've got here is my Ruby on
Rails application can everyone see that
and as I mentioned earlier I've got this
initializer so I've already run the rate
command to install the initializer into
my application so the first thing I need
to do is I want to add this this line
here so what this is going to do is it's
going to tell my local road connect
instance to talk to the rails
application running on this host and
port and then I'm just going to have
this authenticate method in this example
I don't have a user model so I'm just
going to always return true so it
doesn't matter who I login as and the
next I'm going to go to my model I have
an event model here that I've generated
so the first thing I do is I add row
connect resource to it this is going to
as we talked about earlier it's going to
install all those methods into my event
model class to handle automatic
synchronization and then I'm going to
define the partition I'll just hard to
the username here since i don't have a
user and then I'm going to add a query
in this case I just want to get all of
the method all of the events active
record has a simple way to do that just
calling dot all and so what I'm going to
demonstrate now is running the road
connect application locally and using it
with the server plugin as I mentioned if
I'm using the Heroku add-on I don't have
to I don't have to do this but just for
the purposes of demonstration I can run
this application now an important thing
here is the way that row connect plugins
talk to the real connect instance is
using this HTTP API and they need to
provide a token this this token is sort
of like a you know if you're using
another popular developer API is that
have tokens you have to provide this
token with each HTTP request so Rho
connect knows that this is a
this is a secure request and it can
handle the the data so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to start this rope
connect application specifying just a
junk token here and I'm going to use
that token in my rails application
so now it's started up so some of you
especially if you those of you who
watched Adams presentation was using row
studio to start things and this is
showing an example of how to start the
application from the command line you'll
see this output here I can always if I
want to return to my console i can press
ctrl backslash and it detaches it it's
still running in the background or I can
reattach to it and I'll just bring it
back up ok so now I'm inside of my rails
application starting a rails application
is pretty simple they have this this
rails s command and so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to do the same thing I'm
going to specify an environment variable
that defines how to connect to my row
connect instance and this is sort of a
kind of a principle here of having a
similar environment that I'm running on
my local machine to Heroku Heroku likes
to call it dead frog parity but
essentially it's the way that I run the
application locally should match as
closely as possible is my production
environment and in this case when I
specify this environment variable it's
going to match exactly how Heroku is
going to run it
forgot to run bundle here
okay so you'll see here now my rails
application is started up and I can go
ahead and navigate to it here my machine
and so here I've just got a simple rails
application it has this events model and
I've got one entry here for my event and
go and see here I've got its got to
start time and end time the price
description and a title so it's a very
simple model now I want to synchronize
this data with my mobile application so
what I'm going to go ahead and do is
I've got a I've got a rhodes application
already many of you have seen the intros
here on building raw elements and roads
applications so i won't cover that but
what I've got is a rhodes application
that has also an event model with sync
enabled so this is all i need to do on
my roadside to set up the model for
synchronization and i've generated the
model with the same attributes so it's
got a title description start time and
time and price so when i connect to this
row connect instance i'll be able to see
the data properly and then the only
other thing i need to do is I need to
point this roads application at my local
sync server so I do that by editing the
runtime configuration file row config
txt and i set the sync server property
so now that that's all set up i'm going
to go ahead and run my roads application
and again i'm using the command line
interface here just so I stay kind of in
the same window you could also build
this obviously through Rose studio
so here's my basic event application I
haven't changed any of the default code
here I'm just going to go ahead and log
in and i'll log in as the user Lars
password if you go and log in so you can
see it was real fast because those
running a locally but I've got my data
synchronized here and so the great thing
about this is that's a little bit
different from source adapters is when I
change data in my rails application it's
going to automatically update the road
connects server so this is a little bit
different from source adapters where you
need to run these source adapters on
some kind of interval the default
intervals is usually every five minutes
but what this lets me do is have a more
efficient communication mechanism with
my real connect server I can edit data
delete data update or create new data
and it will automatically update the
real connect instance again for that
given user that's very important concept
here it's not going to just update
everything all the time it's going to
update data for a given user so i can go
ahead here and let's see thirty dollars
is kind of cheap when we change it to 99
okay and all i have to do if i go here i
don't want to wait the five minutes for
this to check the server up and
synchronize it you see it automatically
updated so i didn't have to write any
source adapter co didn't have to write
any code in my model even to facilitate
updating the updating this all came from
the the server plugin
I'm doing time okay so so next what I'm
going to show is taking this application
and installing the Heroku out on so you
can see how to quickly get a row connect
instance spinning up in the cloud and
that way you can test it you know from
your from your devices or when your team
so it's real simple I'll just go ahead
I've already got this application added
to Heroku and it's this application
called stormy lightning and you can see
I've already got the rope connect add on
here I'm going to go ahead and delete
that so i can show adding it oops roku
you
these are kind of some funny names that
they generate so this is going to remove
the ad on and then I'm going to show
here installing an add-on again to this
application takes a few seconds
ok so now go ahead and just add it
and again I'm going to run this I'm
going to run this config command that it
was showing earlier which will show me
that the environment is up and running
sometimes it takes a few seconds
okay so you can see here now when I run
it I've got this rope connect URL this
is my new Row connect and since I was
provisioned automatically by our karoku
add-on and now when i restart my
application what it's going to do is
it's going to tell this row connect
instance about itself it's going to send
that app endpoint and then it's going to
be ready for for using as a as a plug-in
so i'll go ahead and restart okay and
then a useful tool i use is the Heroku
blogs command and they have an option to
tail so I can just leave this running
and this will show me if there's any
problems with my Ruby on Rails
application it'll show up here in the
output so now going to go ahead and go
to my store me Lightning server which
I've got running here it's the same
applications just running on Heroku you
can see her it's got this URL here graph
comm I've got some data so here you can
see I've got this event it's got a
different price and a different
description so I'm going to go ahead and
now synchronize with this instance so
you'll remember from the output here
when I ran Heroku config there was this
URL this URL is important because I need
to use this this particular URL to
synchronize with it so I'm going to go
ahead and go to my web console and grab
that URL
you can see what we have here is the the
rope connect console but it's embedded
inside of her Oh kuz add-on interface so
i'm already logged in because i'm logged
in to Heroku and I just go here to the
backend app URL and I copy this link so
now I'm going to go here and update my
configuration I don't want to
synchronize with local host anymore I
want to synchronize with the server
running on roku and that's all i have to
do there so now what I'm going to do is
go ahead and reset this simulator
and then start this up again
and so this example I'm using their
roads row connect client so you you get
in with every roads in relevance
application you get a built-in road
connect client the nice thing about that
is you don't have to worry about setting
up all the other pieces you can just
enable sink in your model and it's
automatically done for you so here I'm
going to go ahead and login we use the
same user you can see I've got the
different data now why don't I go ahead
and try to show both the windows here
before we can see that okay so this is
my Heroku application and this is my
mobile application here so I can go
ahead let's say I want to change the
price on the device here I know it's not
300 anymore let's say it's 200 last day
they give us a discount so now when I go
ahead and synchronize this it's going to
go the other direction it's going to
send the data from the device up to the
road connect instance and the road
connect instance is going to talk to the
plug-in behind the scenes and update my
active record model
and so I can go ahead and refresh you
can see now the price is updated here so
I can make changes both directions you
know I could delete this or create a new
record and I would see them reflected on
both the web application and my mobile
out so this is a pretty basic
application obviously I didn't show you
know something that has typically a
business application will have 30 50
hundred models and lots of complex
relationships and so it's kind of this
example is a little bit contrived in
that sense it's it's pretty basic so how
would broken egg work in a real
application something that's got a lot
of data it's got a lot of different
models it's it turns out it's pretty
much the same you wind up not having to
write too much code so what I'm going to
show here is we have this popular open
source rails application called fat free
CRM you can find it on the web it's got
lots of installation lots of
installation examples so what I have
here is I have this application running
on Heroku also and I've got it set up
with a row connect with the row connect
add on this application it's got lots of
different business objects it's got
leads campaigns accounts you can see
there's definitely a non-trivial amount
of data and business logic going on here
and be models themselves we go ahead and
open that up here
so the models themselves just have the
the same the same pattern I add my Road
connect let's go take for example lead
I'll add my rope connect resource here
I'll define my partition in this case I
do have a user model so i can reference
that relationship and you can see this
is all stuff that comes with fat-free
serum it's a pretty complex business
object but then at the bottom here I've
just added my rope net query so first I
grab the user where the partition
matches and then i use the active record
where method to return a list of leads
that match the user ID and that's
actually the only thing I've done here I
didn't customize the create or update or
anything it's all it's all done for me
automatically so to demonstrate this
synchronizing with this I'm going to use
the row connect j/s client so we support
as I mentioned earlier row connect from
multiple environments android/ios if you
did already have an existing iphone or
ipad application you can still use row
connect and we also have javascript so
i'm going to go ahead and open up xcode
here I've got a phonegap application for
fat free CRM and this phonegap
application is using row connect j/s so
this is Felicia to now familiar phonegap
its framework that has a similar idea to
raw elements where uses a webview for
the view part and everything is done
with HTML except for phonegap takes it a
step further and everything is just HTML
they just have an HTML as an HTML 5
layer so so what i've done here is i've
configured rope connect j/s to talk to
this instance that was provisioned by
the Heroku add-on and then I just set
some other options here all of this
information is in our documentation and
so if I go ahead and run this
you can see it's using jquery mobile
with phonegap i'm going to go ahead and
log in as a test user they have a test
user Aaron password as Aaron and what
this is doing is it's going and
synchronizing with that road connect
instance tied to my fat for CRM and when
it's done it pops up a message so i can
go ahead and look here if i'm logged in
as aaron and i want to see my list of
leads you can see those those leads here
this is using some different features of
jquery mobile like a pop-up toolbar here
so let's say i want to edit one of these
say i didn't quite get Jacqueline's
email correct it's actually jacqueline h
so i'll go ahead and update that and the
sync button is on this list sent and
push think from here and it tells me
successful so now i can just refresh
this page and i'll see here on the left
recently updated items was Jacqueline
and her email address was updated to
jacqueline h so you can see it works the
the code i had to put in was very
minimal I'm just staying inside of my
rails application I don't have to learn
any new paradigm so I can just write
some more methods in my active record
model and I get synchronization
so I just wanted to mention here at the
end we have our documentation site if
