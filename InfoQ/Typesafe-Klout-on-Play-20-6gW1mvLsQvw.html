engineer a cloud we're long time long
time users of play recording using a
play world are chewing production very
extensively and we're in the process of
migrating to play 20 so I might have
some insight on the on the migration
process we have actually have a minor
application in in production and very
excited to be here talking for you guys
and and that typesafe is supporting a
product like play and is finally out
right should auto so yeah welcome
everyone my name is a period house I
work for type sip and today is actually
a big day because we just release 2.0 so
if you go to the website you can
actually see the shiny new side okay
yeah so I guess the most important thing
to know about the development process is
that like play is developed by sonic
city and type zip so it's kind of like a
co-production between the two companies
which I particle find exciting and I
think before we get started with like
just learning about play or like what's
in what's in plate 2 or why we decided
to create like a new web framework kind
of breaking API compatibility we play
1.0 i figured it's like a really good
time just to really serve a what's out
there in terms of scale of that
ecosystem I think it's a scholar develop
air I feel like we are really lucky that
because I really easily can recommend
any of these frameworks that about I
hope I didn't miss and any of the
existing favors but all of them are
awesome just use them okay so you can go
wrong so like yeah I mean just done a
few words about these frameworks I'm not
sure if you guys
with them I can give a short intro if
that hot but just my version i don't
know like a brainless so i'm peter is
like basically simply api on on top of
like really thin like that toolkit the
main idea is that like you can use like
really atomic scala just to extract you
or any information and execute certain
piece of code it also comes with like
other a hard pairs like web sockets and
stuff like that it's really a nice King
library so if you into like I don't know
just creating like web services or like
something really thin maybe I'm theater
is for you the next one which is also
kind of like a fairly new library his
blue eyes blue eyes is built on like
Nettie and it's like a lightweight
highly productive and highly esteem can
I was like a framework it also comes
with some MongoDB sugar so if using
MongoDB few building like Scala web
services perhaps a blue Isis for you the
next one is traffic bizarre which is
actually like a job or blue framework
but it has like a scala bindings so that
can be appealing if your stack is like a
mixture of java or scala or you just not
sure that their you want to go
full-scale and also if you want to stay
really close to the meta I mean the JDM
and there is also like a very new
framework or spray can which is
essentially just like a tiny HTTP layer
on top of acha she's like an
event-driven middleware also developed
by typesafe and the two I think probably
the oldest web frameworks in Scala one
is collateral which is like Sinatra in
in Scala built on the service API and of
course leaf which is a stateful web web
framework for focusing on like I don't
know security and and JavaScript helpers
and and I guess yeah it stateful which I
think it's like really interesting thing
about Lee so that being said there are a
few a few of these kind of
members that I particularly prepare and
mainly because they share some of that
some of the technologies behind play so
these three just like really my favorite
but as I said like you can go along with
no these six but what I what I really
like about like these frameworks and
that's why I figured that it's actually
good to talk about other frameworks
outside of play is that I think right
now arise in such a position right now
where most of these frameworks kind of
exploring kind of what i use options how
to how to be like forward thinking when
it comes to web web development in Scala
and I cannot feel like you kind of
trying to find out all these kind of
various options and so this is this kind
of like I don't know experimental phase
and I feel like we will diverge at one
point but uh I don't know a lot of
people think that like it's
fragmentation or it's like that for the
ecosystem person I think it's awesome so
I love all of these frameworks but the
kind of the technologies that play
shares with uh with these other
frameworks like a car or that suck at
support or nasty as the the kind of the
domain a HTTP kind of provide there or
like strong java api and perhaps most
importantly that most of these
frameworks are stateless ok so i guess
then the question is the flack if we
have all these awesome libraries why we
need like awesome library plus one so
when we decided that like we're going to
create like a new kind of framework and
play 1.0 actually had like Scala super
but the scholar super was like more like
just like a I don't know kind of like an
add-on and because play 1.0 was build on
many kind of Jamie and tricks just to
provide this kind of special a feeling
if you will the scholarship work was
like really I don't know like sometimes
I think it was like leaking like both
attractions and also we running
too many implementation-specific issues
so that's one reason the other reason I
guess is that we wanted to really move
away from this kind of monolithic
framework approach which was really
typical I guess like I don't know like
2000 from 2004 to probably like 2010
they're like you have the MVC framework
your job is to I don't know just create
your view and you're my controller is
here and I'm just going to babysit a
database so that kind of monitoring
design which was probably I don't know
probably as me this kind of design
really popular was in fact like the de
facto standard for a long time until I
guess perhaps then we are merged with
mer band like they also started
exploring this kind of mobilization and
hard to create like standard components
perhaps people are going to use
databases anymore perhaps somebody is
not going to like my templating solution
or you want to swap out this component
or that component and also like
frameworks starting becoming more and
more a synchronous and web kind of like
change many ways from this kind of pusun
freak thing to more like a push push
centric approach so that that was kind
of like the other underlying reason why
why we decided to create like the new
version of play but then when we when we
decided that we're going to go ahead and
do this the kind of early on kind of
satire goya which was that we're going
to focus on like user experience like we
or I mean our case it's more like
developer experience and what I when I
mean by that like we really try hard to
focus on like I don't know small issues
so for example if you develop in an
application the documentation should be
there hand if if there is something that
the Famer can do for you framework
should do for you without you
configuring anything or you do anything
extra so we like really spend crazy
amount of time for example just to
provide like heavy lifting
layer on top of SBT try to hide some
some complexities of the the beer too
but also like I mean we had did so many
kind of nice features that we hope that
developers will enjoy yeah actually
should talk about this right one of the
things that are really excited about a
cloud or plated ro is for example the
SBT support right it is very difficult
to work across teams right when the when
the build system is a Python script
right which was the case of play 1 dot 0
right 0 1 dot you Ray and the the Java
and Scala support at the end of the day
felted like like Peter was saying was a
wrapper on top of the Java framework so
in your day-to-day you felt the features
were available Scala that were available
Java right and there is differences that
uh that running the application of
day-to-day for example the the API is a
little different the validation didn't
work as well right so the discolor
version of play want our children feel
as polished as the java one did so we're
extremely excited that there has been
consolidated into one API now so that
sounds that's something that we would
actually hopefully see in action so yeah
so the goals that we kind of like define
we're like simply that should be simple
however hard that's still should be
possible and also let's try our best
just to make about ourselves happy right
because at the end of the baby also
developers and so I mentioned that like
we also we also were kind of like
suffering with the play 1.0 is kind of
like magic by that I mean that like many
of the kind of special special things
simply very implemented with for example
by could enhancement and many kind of
kind of a new shot techniques that cause
issues in other areas for example a 1.0
was never in like a maven or ivr
artifact it was really hard to extend it
was really hard to drop in into
existing projects so play one definitely
had this kind of disadvantages in order
to provide us so call kind of play fear
and I guess the easiest way to to
realize what happened in play line was
that so well that the matter the magic
sauce in play 2.0 is Carla and the way
it works is that when we work on any
api's we first create like a scala kind
of like internal api and then we expose
that api both for Java and Scala
developers but underneath everything is
religious scholar but that doesn't mean
that like if you're a Java developer
you're not going to have a really nice
and kind of like any use their java api
so just the fact that the chamber itself
is retaining SCADA I think shouldn't
really discouraged java developers and i
also think the the the differences
without all the magic the development
speed on their own Todaro is much much
faster right so all the fun that play
one thought you provided right on the
java version was a little mitigated on
the scala version right because the
development process wasn't as fast
because of all the magic that happened
that had to happen which on the scholar
version felt very heavy right to da 0 is
is a joy to work with compared to the
one dollar euro version right yeah so I
guess we actually see what this kind of
like kind of like the fact that like
maybe like a standard project really
brings to the table in terms of
extensibility and and also just like
being right more modular yeah so uh one
of the kind of like typical kind of play
a feature is the development console I'm
not sure how many of you play with the
1.0 or like and if you know what i mean
by developer console but that i'm trying
to describe the experience for for those
of you who never seem like a play
application console before so the idea
is that
you fire at this console which is going
to run your application server and then
you switch to your favorite text editor
ID and you're going to start making
changes to your application and say I'm
going to modify like a class and then I
switch to the browser hit refresh and
your change we picked up no extra
compilation is necessary even though
your java or scholar class was modified
because compilation is triggered by that
browser requests if there is an error
your browser is going to show you
bidding the browser which file had that
issue and there i will show you this
really shortly so this feature what was
available in pay porn 1.0 but
essentially you could really enjoy the
benefit of type safety and and kind of
this kind of compile check only if you
work on java or scala classes but in 2.0
we tried to really bring this to the
next level so this is the kind of like a
typical error message then something
goes wrong in this particular case and
this is a scholar class as you can see
there is a typo there so what happened
was that like i was editing this 5 i
switch to the browser hit refresh i see
this page oops there is a typo there i
see what's going on i switch back to my
edit or fix the typo switch back to the
browser hit refresh and hopefully there
or page via disappear I don't know if if
you guys I'm sure you guys using the
developer console frequently but what is
your experience we use it frequently and
and a beautiful part of it like Peter
was saying is that now we get we get
those type of errors right or not only
the scala files but on own routes right
the route file is something that we
frequently had a problem 1 or 0 right
now we have type checking on the
templates on the routes on the scala
files and and it's great not having to
fire the play
and fire off the JVM on on all the
different commands that that we gotta
execute on play right we just actually
used the console and using actually as a
bash console because you can do yeah
yeah yeahs commands which is really nice
right and and because of the magic that
doesn't happen on play truth or oh we
don't have the problems having to
restart every once in a while right
plague was great on one doctor now
having to restart every single time like
the traditional j2ee but on the scholar
versus you had to do sometimes right
that problem has started be mitigated on
to da 0 so that's great we're really
happy about that next time so in like if
you check this slide so most MVC
frameworks have this concept of mapping
like incoming requests or you are asked
to actions some something works like to
keep this information next to the action
like I don't know Sinatra was cholera or
unfiltered in in Scala some applications
like Django rails like to keep this
information a separate file in case of
play this file is called route but
what's interesting about the play
version is that this file is actually
compile so if you make a typo here then
you're going to get exactly the same
screen that we saw in case of kind of
like working on traditional like I don't
know jvm classes you also get the same
error screen if for example you say that
like this controller method is taking
parameters so it's taking arguments
however you just forget to define those
arguments in your at five you also going
to see this error and so basically what
it helps you to kind of capture
potential and current runtime errors
this can be really useful but what has
we tried we try to kind of compile this
time around the next area is the
template previously play use like a
globe eccentric templating solution
probably the closest you
er be familiar with the kind of standard
Reyes template and so the new version of
the play templating engine is using like
a compile check kind of templating
engine solution this is available both
for Scylla and Java developers so if
your Java develop air and you need like
a templating system you can use these
however because the framework is not
really extend extensible you really
easily can plug in your own templating
solution so this is just an option but
we believe that it's like a good
starting point but so we saw that now
compile we compile in classes well I
mean hopefully that's not a big surprise
we also compiling the rat five but I
guess that's a that's something unique
but as you can see the also compile
templates so you can see that like oops
something happened that that customer I
attribute just doesn't exist so we get
the compiler error and another thing
that was great about the compilation of
the routes is now we can use if you use
an option that on your controller method
and on the route the the perimeter is
optional obviously right now if it's not
place automatically doing some
verification for you right when the when
the perimeter was on past which is great
fuse a lot that API feels a lot more
natural scholar then you should do a
play one dot you which you have to
define those annotations right which can
can you're cooking a messy very quickly
right so in the next area which I'm
particularly excited about is compiling
assets I mean I guess the other kind of
like trend that was happening besides
like I don't know web frameworks became
more modular and like you could take for
granted just a few we're kind of like
assumptions about one's kind of tax tag
was that javascript and
front-end stop became increasingly kind
of like more important in fact like I
guess we got to a point there we can't
really talk about like traditional and
we see anymore and all these kind of
funny layers kind of tied together so we
were really keen just to make sure that
like the front end a front-end developer
or like a back-end developer would
experience the same thing so what we did
was we hooked up a JavaScript
compilation into the build process so
you're not only getting that this kind
of in Brazil reporting for your classes
for your rad fire for templates but you
also get this for java speed what's
happening behind the curtain is that we
call for if you put your javascript file
into a specific kind of like directory
then play we will pick it up and we'll
run it through google closure JavaScript
compiler if there is like a syntax error
there and it will pick it up and we'll
provide the exactly the same screen that
we saw before this thing goes over works
with coffee script and last which is
like a CSS kind of transform either kind
of library and in those libraries you
would get the same error message in this
particular case this is just like a
plain vanilla JavaScript file that said
like I mean if you don't want our for
example a pecan pie or JavaScript using
closure compiler you you are not forced
to do that so i guess like our main idea
this time around was that like we're
going to provide all these within useful
assumptions and useful features but we
tried our best not to force developers
into like a specific model so if you
don't want to compile assets fine then
you can just sort of it as normal just
put it like in a different location or
if you want to take advantage of all
these extra features that play comes to
be by any means just then used for
example the asses compilation feature
I'm not sure if you guys using this I
mean the only thing I have to say about
this is how
was that right compiling your JavaScript
that's a great feature right I know I
hate going after JavaScript batters so I
think that's a great feature yeah we use
that I love it love it yeah I mean yeah
I also actually like that one and I'm
actually not even sure but there anyone
else did that so I also feel like there
is some special think about it is not
likely keeping score or anything but
anyway I personally really like it and
use it frequently as a developer so we
use our two so not just you know writing
it but we also use it so the next thing
I want to show you is that why the
framework itself was written in Scala it
has like a really good java api this
particular example is using just one of
the sample applications that take I'm
sweet and I'm just going to show you one
example is like a controller here and
the same thing in Scala so as you can
see we provide these kind of sample
applications both in both languages so
we figured that like it's a good good
thing to do because if you're not sure
whether you want to use scala or java
that you can just go to the Play website
download the whole package and you can
evaluate side-by-side that here isn't
here is a sample application is doing
exactly the same thing one is
implemented in Java when you see
implementing Scala you can see which one
you prepare or gradually you can switch
from one language to another that's
that's also another problem
here we we can see this kind of like a
type-safe tempted in action that a
really special character that you really
have to focus in a focus on is the at
sign that basic it has the plague
compiler that like a scholar expression
is coming after that but otherwise you
get like I'm really kind of I guess nice
and light definitely not logic class
templating solution which supports
layouts and template tags and so I
understand that good is that you would
assume from a framework one of the
things that we have been drawing a lot
is the the new form right the new
validation and the new form support and
play Todaro right one play one dot zero
you have the annotations right which not
only create a lot of boilerplate but the
the view support wasn't as nice as there
was some support on the controller side
and if the and if you're using the plane
model right but if you had anything
anything different than that which is
very common the enterprise right your
forms normally don't map to your model
1ch 1 right he became he became it
wasn't as easy on play 1 dot 0 right
that the new form library of validation
on on chilled ro made that that set up
much nicer so highly recommend that as
well we can take a look I guess later
you guys interested because I don't
think i have the cover the slides but
yeah so the next one is just showing you
our kind of like integration test runner
but what this test run there does
essentially firing up like a whole play
application in context which means that
like if you have javascript ajax cause
whatever that's that's fine you can just
stop use this browser that's that's part
of the API to kind of check with their
certain HTML
on the page this whole thing was built
on top of like selenium webdriver if you
guys know that library just is an extra
kind of dsl on top of it and in this
particular example we for example using
the headless browser called like hdmi
unit but you could replace that with
chrome or firefox in which case if you
run this test that test itself would be
running inside a real browser just in
this particular case because it's a part
of our integration test is running just
like in a headless mode so you can run
from the command line and also like in
our kind of like a CI environment yeah
same API is available both for Scylla
and travie one of the kind of like new
ideas we had about like the framework
was kind of trying to make sure that
like I owe processing is much easier
there are many typical that that task
that these days we have to do that like
baaah I mean is definitely not easy so
for example providing like I don't know
streaming but I spy streaming or just
dreaming to to the browser providing a
synchronous kind of processing in
general which includes like back web
sockets or comet or anything that's not
like the typical kind of like request
response kind of processing and the kind
of the idea we borrowed was this kind of
like a Skype library code iterate e io
sometimes with you guys familiar with
that in Scala I think right now we have
three or four implementations of the
same library from scholars at two I
don't know likely it's as well so I
guess what's happening in that space is
the same as what's happening in a bad
space where people are trying to find
out like which kind of implementation is
the best so of course we kind of had
like a first for the Scala said
was just way too much for our needs so
we try to just really create like a
minimalistic version of that but time
will tell that they're our internet a
shin or their implementation somebody as
implementation of a bit that de facto
stand there I think it's all good for
the community and so here's an example
how you can do like advanced io with
with play III TI o so what you see here
I hope that you guys can read the slide
that like I mean we use the kind of the
standard kind of identity I oak kind of
name so you have enumerators which
essentially pushing data to Twitter it
iterators iterators basically usually
iterators basically providing you the
kind of the input and that's talking up
the consumer end of the object I guess
like of the whole like I owe Singh
enumerators basically responsible for
pushing data from from the source to the
iterators unfortunately in certain
situations the input just doesn't match
the output in which case like you need
like an emeritus and what you see here
is that we defining values an emeritus
that we later combined and then like I
don't know if I can take this guy but
then what we're doing so we create this
to comment warable which is basically
just like to a kind of data transform as
an emeritus combined into one and then
what we call what we do is we call like
this Twitter feed as synchronously and
then we let me take this kind of data
transfer yeah combine data transfer and
a kind of apply on top of like an
iterative now if this sounds like really
crazy an advanced that's what I meant by
that
like that I mean this is like an
advanced technique and by no means i
would say that like this is simple
however they're like if you try to
implement like a comet or WebSocket
implementation before these are not is
simply test but what play provides is
that you can easily create for example
comment services or you can send data in
chunks to the browser which I that's
always what kind of a feature that I
really like and use frequently so in
this particular example which is by the
way taken from like a sample application
also bundled with the framework that we
kind of take like a Twitter stream and
then as synchronously pushing the like
Twitter I think it's a search or
somebody's um somebody stream into the
browser so if you tweet something than
this push-based some kind of solution we
push that result to the web application
so that was eatery TI oh are you guys
using any of these advanced input
processing techniques yeah we're using
some of them and the main difference is
like we're actually even though they
sink processing right that was one of
the things that I talked about in the
beginning was the difference between one
dot zero the java implementation and the
scholar implementation those are those
are features that some of these features
not all of them obviously like the comet
servicing we're available on the java
version but not on the scala version
right so if user so we're definitely
happy that is available there on the
common on the common library now so
we're using some of it but so the next
benefit of the new design is there come
we tried our best to make it like
modular and also really extensible so we
kind of got to a point that you can swap
out any component of play like well I
mean except probably like the the
the beer too but anything that you want
to swap out you should be able to do do
so easily that includes for example that
the writing my own is on the templates
if you don't want to use like any
databases you don't have to you can hook
up any libraries that that you you like
so i'm going to show you guys two
examples how you can extend play one way
to extend the the framework is why are
creating plugins in this particular case
i just copied like some information from
our kind of plug-in repository but what
you get for example without readies
plugin which is freely available right
away that um so the raddest plugging
lets you to use Redis easily both from
Java and Scala and but also the reddys
plugin is implementing a place interna
cache API which means that like if you
start using our plugin is refusing the
in-memory base a cache solution boom all
of a sadhana you can use like readies
for s4 like external cash solution we
play if you want to keep session data
there or anything guys you should be
able to do that very very easily I used
to have access to the underlying the
underlying epi because of course
stratasys is kind of like wheelchair
then just like I don't know providing a
simple get and set for you so you have
access to all those kind of advanced
features both in Scala and Java actually
that's something that we are just
implemented as well just replace the
cash solution with our own
implementation we actually did that
yesterday and it was it was very easy
something they don't play whether all
was a bit difficult right because you
did have to understand the internals of
play to be able to extended the
framework well on played r0 is much
easier like you're just oil so we
actually just went through this process
and
was a joy so so in the next example what
you see here is that we kind of replaced
a playwriting mechanism and instead of
using the external file that I just show
you now we kind of throw in anthea third
kind of request matches and extractors
on top of play and you get this really
interesting hybrid there you can use
unfiltered on top of play which which is
actually something that we use heavily
I'm just building for example like more
like standard web services as opposed to
like a full web application a full stack
of application so as you can see this
application has nothing to do with that
controller kind of approach that is so
before because it's using like a
different kind of API but the main idea
here is that well you know if you don't
wanna use the rotten melanism we provide
hooks that you can hijack the kind of
like the standard request processing and
you can track in your own rattling
nihilism outside of this I I knew that
like one person already implemented
their rails kind of kind of like a rat
humanism really close to rails so now I
am a bit of at least two or three extra
rotting mechanisms that you can plug in
into your application but because these
hooks are so so this this hooks provides
you like access to the whole kind of
request psycho it should be easy to plug
in any kind of rotting mechanism that
that you want to use I'm not sure if you
guys use any of these hooks to are you
doing do stuff we're using for business
logic jacket this is logic into it so
that yeah I mean so yeah this is just
one example but because you can you can
for example do stuff and like a request
comes in before your application starts
after your application starts when the
request comes in so you can execute
pretty much anything one on these events
as far as plugins actually I think we
have already like about like 10 plugins
some of them returned by us some of them
written by the the community we really
hope that we will reach like a really
extensive set of plugins soon this is
partly actually thanks to the fact that
like because play it's a became really
stand there now you can host your
plugins in a standard neighbor
repository using SBT so you should be
able to just define your dependency and
use your own plugin so there is no like
special play repository as we had
unfortunately with 1.0 so it's always
stand there like just publish your
library and then you can reference it in
your project if it's a plugin you have
to just play that it's a plugin so you
have to start up I mean the framework
needs to start up your plugin but
otherwise it's just like a library that
you can you cannot drop into play in
fact even play itself can be dropping to
like any other framework that that you
have so the example I show you before
the kind of play mixed with on fiat
their kind of thing that was like a
standard kind of me than projects so
that was an event like a kind of like a
play layout it was just really stand
there me then kind of layout but because
you can play you can use players like an
HTTP library and just rely on these
hooks now you can use play even outside
of it saying I guess outside of its
normal form for zone which would be like
the kind of like using the console and
using other kind of play goodies and for
the enterprise that the great thing is
like a for example cloud we have a
centralized API that has our business
logic right the reads and writes your
datastore and are we using the this type
of service right to to get to have
different teams writing different
business logic right that can be
augmented into the main NPI layer which
with SBT is super easy right your
publish publish local which one more
notch was very complicated that python
with a with a Python script so those are
those are one of the main advantages of
for the enterprise that I see around 20
right we're using extensively a cloud
and and it's being working rate we're
very happy major improvement over 1000
euro and I think that that was a really
good point because for example Heroku
and that their cloud providers were also
really happy about this thing because
some of these cloud providers requiring
like really specific things for example
like you should be able to just don't
define dependencies and things should be
in like repositories and stuff like that
so it was really painful before just to
provide any support for play for example
and Haruko but now there isn't because
there is no magic you can use play as
just like a library so it should it
hopefully it will help enterprises with
these kind of issues are but yeah I mean
so and there are many many acts of
features that I guess I'm not going to
cover unless like I mean I don't know
where maybe see the form validation oh
yeah well what are the other great
features right is that we can use color
to da nine right which is great right we
can upgrade acha finally because the
integration of vodka on windows 0 was on
the best right and we had to use a much
older version of vodka right and we had
to run the dirt 120 so now as acha is
and play around the decisive umbrella
right the integration is much nicer and
and a lot of the problems that we ran
into the 10 we're not experiencing any
more so the the ARCA integration is a
huge plus as well so I mean on that
point like I mean what kind of
integration we talking about like right
now it's possible to wear right both
play and akka configuration from the
command line you can also pass in just
I can external configuration file both
for aqua and play so that should happen
again i guess like enterprises just two
I don't know fitting like in their
existing infrastructure but there are
some other things right the database
session for example right that was
available on the Play classloader wasn't
available the ARCA class loader right so
if you're running the the old JP a model
right on 10 you had a hibernation
problems right things like that officer
know you you know play towser's doesn't
have hibernate but uh small issues like
that right that are nagging right we
don't have that anymore introduce your
because the the integration was done
from the start rather than as a
community Margit that God added on on
top of the scallop version that was also
added on top of the Java version right
so it is a much more polished
integration also you understand a final
comment about akka and so basically aqua
is used internally by the framework but
we also created like an aqua plugin so
when we talking about a cointegration is
not just that play itself is heavily
using acha for its own internal business
which is mostly just like kind of
dispatching messages and helping with
this kind of a synchronous not the a
synchronous that the premium the
framework provides but because of this
plug-in that that's available for end
users you also can start your local or
remote actors or interact with actors
and we just see a kind of like a smaller
more shortly there for example we going
to send messages to an actor and then
apply those messages to the response as
synchronously and the push it push that
desire to the browser as synchronously
alright so i'm going to show you guys
like a few demos all right um so let
first let's see this like thank you so
i'm gonna i'm going to start like I'd
like an exact so I'm going to start with
just like launching the coin so so I
lunch the console this is like a
standard like SBT console so anything
that else BTW provides should be
available here if you want to see what
the what are the extra kind of commands
that play provides you can just run hub
play and i'm going to just show you
before i run actually the dev server
some of these so one of my favorite is
that now you can execute like share
comments from within the play console so
this is just like a get us I was it
status executed from within the konso
but you also can see or the land and
seas so well i mean i'm using a slightly
bigger bigger phone than usual but
essentially this is going to give you an
idea what kind of charts use by your
application and if there are overlapping
with certain jars then you're going to
see different colors to represent that
so this is just like another nice add-on
so now i'm going to run the server this
is again the so-called like developer
console or developed our server close
this guy and because i made a typo i am
anticipating like an error here okay so
this is the error so i'm gonna switch
back this is there or yes
I'm going to fix it I just saved the
fire I'm switching back and hitting the
browser so this is the kind of user
experience I I was talking about like
this is kind of like I think many ways
closer to like dealing with like dynamic
languages because i don't have the
compilation step and now the application
is is running and then if i make another
change i just saved the file come back
hit refresh so there is a compilation
error anyway so i guess you guys an idea
so let me just start this guy and yeah
let's just take a quick look what what
this application is doing this is one of
the sample application so you guys can
also play with it just you download the
new the new release and then this should
be part of the release I think yes so
again this thing is using the authority
i/o library so first we creating an
enumerator which is again the kind of
the source that's responsible to push
data to to to an iterator and then what
we do here so this is so so we create
this a numerator which essentially going
to update the time so this is the this
is the demo application that we're going
to try to build here so the numerator is
like going to do this kind of an endless
loop and then what we do is that we take
this a numerator and and apply this on
this kind of calm at was an America and
then as the result we creating this kind
of chunk responses and essentially be
sending this new date where the wire
pedagogically this is using comet and
it's using a kind of combat technique
called like was like the iframe yes so
it's kind of basically like using guy
frames just to kind of write JavaScript
patio deeply to the process so in this
particular case we just like sending
this to to the parent of the iframe the
information that's coming from that date
format again like I mean that the idea
here is not that like I mean
you guys gonna understand everything but
I just wanted to give you an idea like
what kind of what kind of advanced io
technique or what kind of techniques
available we play so this is a essence
you just demonstrating how to use
comment easily it played to application
so you can see because it's a it's a
kind of like an open kind of suck at
like you can see that um the request
never terminates so that's why you see
this guy so it's a push application
again not whoo ok so I'm going to stop
the development console and i'm going to
show you guys another application which
is this chat application using acha
actors before I do so I'm gonna hear
this guy
so I'm fine got the console again okay
so it is hard to type but yeah so what
you see here is that using our
characters to to be like a chat
application and what's happening here is
that we sending acha messages over the
wire using the same combat technique
that than before and the net result is
that we will have this kind of challenge
responses sent back to the browser
synchronously and yeah I'm going to just
run this application then so let's
refresh this
so first we just rendering the index
page so nothing funky is going on there
so I'm just going to the church room and
you can already see that like the kind
of the socket is open so I can start
sending messages I'm just going to send
a few all right and wow it's not the
best
so I'm going to join from here as well
and you can see that like that i mean i
have two browsers and this thing is some
sending messages and you also can see
some information about the messages on
that console so again this is just like
a another kind of like a short
demonstration of how you can use some of
the advanced features of both acha and
play kind of like together okay and I
guess the next thing I do you have
anything to add okay um yeah so let's
see that let's see those forms i think
that's a good idea so there is a nice
simple application called forms that
comes of the distribution should
definitely check it out which is what
he's going to be showing up yeah
alright so let's see the forms yeah I
think yeah you wanna explain okay so
yeah so what you see here is that like
this is the Scala API for a form
building the form API provides you like
a kind of like a reached vs 7 comes to
like defining a form but it also
provides you like with validation so you
can define your kind of like form here
define the HTML and then take take a
post and then kind of seed eyes back
into this this guy and if there is a
validation error then that you can kind
of handle the validation error
accordingly so in this particular case
we see that the content a contact form
has just four fields the first food is
just like basically a mandatory field
first name last name are mandatory and
then we have the company name which is
optional and then there is basically an
extra map which contains seem for me
information which I think should be
correctly like this but besides the
point uh and and then like I saw so
these are kind of like the various
validation options that you can choose
so you have email and phone number and
stuff like that and let me try to find
yeah and so this is how the validation
is hot and also this submit action is a
register for the post so when you send
your form then what we're doing is that
here is this kind of like implicit
request that we use to kind of be the
kind of form from so now is kind of
civilized from from the post and then
using forth we can decide
there that there was an error on the
form in which case we just send it back
like a bad request or we can just show
the summary the nice thing is that you
can concentrate on the the actual
business logical you form right define
your feuds and the validation progress
rather than concentrating on the
boilerplate if Alan return to a certain
view right passing the flashback so uh
and and there's a nice integration on
the template language as well right so
you don't have to define your input type
and the display errors and all the good
stuff that comes with you know defining
forms so that's a major improvement over
the 10 version and this is the kind of
corresponding form using like some of
the building template helpers that that
that we provide so I don't know that's
actually a custom one right you can
actually make it as model than that just
using the the input tag right all right
the Scala input tag he's showing you
some customization war comes with
playing right but uh but if you just
want to use what it's a what place
displaying by default right that's all
you really need right and and I can tell
that we use the default very often so
all right I I guess that's it thank you
