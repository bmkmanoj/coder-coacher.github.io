work with Capital One in Toronto and and
I was asked if I would put a panel
together so as you may have noticed as
some speakers have alluded to earlier I
did what all good speakers do and about
an hour ago I went and found us in
people and said hey would you like to be
on a panel and you may think that's a
lie but it's unfortunately closer to the
truth than I'd like to admit but we have
we have six fantastic people here who
have agreed to join us today I'm gonna
let them introduce themselves a little
bit just to let you know and you may
have heard them in some of their talks
earlier today but our purpose here this
afternoon in this in this last little
bit of time is to talk about some of the
things we've seen in organizations as
we've been coaching and consulting in in
a variety of organizations as you look
at this panel here collectively we've
worked in large organizations we've
worked in government we've worked in
enterprise big enterprise we've also
worked in small mid-market
type companies we've worked in small
organizations and we've worked with
startups so pretty much everything is
covered somewhere in in this in this
group of amazing people and we've we've
noticed some things that are common
across across these different these
these different organizations but this
is a chance for us and I have questions
prepared that they haven't seen yet but
really this is a chance for us to engage
and so as we're going I'd like to ask
you if you have any questions if you
could hold any questions until you have
one that would be great and if you have
one we'll certainly involve yours
because that's what we're here to do is
to it is to answer your questions about
what we've seen in organizations and
what we've done about it so in many
cases we see good things and what have
we done to amplify those great things
that we've seen how can we build on
those and how can we take things that
are going well and let others in the
organization in different departments
different divisions on different teams
know about it
so that we can actually amplify what's
what we've seen we've also seen
opportunities things that perhaps aren't
so good and how can we lessen those and
what are some things that we've done in
our experience collective experience in
that space
so I'm gonna pass the microphone along
we'll start with our data and and just
do you know a 30 second introduction if
you can maybe do it in one sentence or
less good okay my name is Toronto agile
coach focus on continuous delivery but
looking from the product management side
of things
my name is Dana Schneider I'm a software
developer on the Ruby agent team at New
Relic and I'm also a core contributor to
cucumber my name is David Alpert I have
used cucumber and I've worked primarily
as a developer and a technical coach
I've facilitated code retreats I've
worked as a an architect as a dev
manager a bunch of different roles I'm
Emily Tate I am a product manager and
product management consultant with
pivotal labs from Dallas Texas and I
have eaten cucumbers does that count
I'm madami Rhett I'm an independent
management consultant working in large
enterprises and I grew I did not my name
is Chris I am an independent agile coach
based in Toronto now shifting my focus
more towards management consulting and
helping leader
leaders change their organizations
excellent guys thank you couple of
things that I'm just gonna add on to
their their introductions here that that
might be interesting to know is that
Chris is also an avid craft brewer
brewing his own beer yep he does that
and applies a lot of agile principles
and and Lean Thinking actually to his to
his brewing Adam is a sailor loves to
loves to sail I don't know how many had
job principles you apply there but he's
also an aspiring chef and if you follow
him on Twitter you will get very hungry
as he posts great-looking food and
perhaps the the the other interesting
thing I learned as I was looking this up
Dana is that that you're a mezzo-soprano
no and I wasn't totally clear where
mezzo-soprano was so to clarify it for
everybody that's between a soprano and a
contra Alto I learned that so just just
a couple of little tidbits of
information that's exactly why I did I
ready to ask what is a contra alto and
that's exactly why I tried to clarify it
that way
all right so maybe we can start and
again please guys if you have any
questions for four you've got a wealth
of knowledge up here I encourage you to
to make use of it but I'd love to start
perhaps if we can start David maybe
we'll start with you if that's okay
because I picked you first but maybe you
can tell us in your career in the coach
retreats you've done in the
organizations that you've worked with in
in in helping with creating great
environments what what would be the
thing that you're most proud of
these are unrehearsed questions first
time I'm hearing this
I think the thing that I'm most proud of
is I would say building a an environment
in which people could come together and
feel like a sense of team was developing
that's something that is really
important to me and something that has
really motivated my own my own career
and my own work is trying to look for
ways to make better environments not
just for myself selfishly but also for
you know I look at the things that I
have not enjoyed and the things that
I've struggled with as a developer
coming up through the course of my
career and I've really looked to create
spaces wherever I could enlarge on small
ways where people like working
conditions could be better or for people
working in software development and so
that's that's great I'm you know go push
one step further can you give me an
example of something that you've done
with a team to to help create those
environments and yes by the way these
questions I didn't let them see any of
these questions ahead of time I thought
that would provide a little bit more of
a truthful on-the-spot type of answer so
these these are totally unrehearsed on
purpose
and the rest of you are off the hook
you're next
so one thing that I have done that
worked really well is that I found
myself working in an environment where
the priorities were constantly shifting
and the development team and the
delivery team was getting blamed a lot
for inability to deliver and when I got
there and I started working with the
team I realized that the team actually
was quite good at what they were doing
but they were working in a very
difficult environment where it was hard
to to be it was hard to get to end of
job when the priorities kept shifting
right so that was one thing so something
that I did to that made an impact there
was I worked to provide a sense of like
a filter and a buffer between the
various requests that were coming into
the team and the requests that were
being provided to the team and the
direction that was being provided to the
team so that buffer allowed a little bit
more stability for the team enough
stability that they were allowed to get
to the end of some work and that made a
positive impact on cool Emily you've got
I'm gonna ask you the same question you
know what are you most proud of but
you've got a different take on it
because we've just heard it from
developers perspective working on the
team from a product manager and a
product management side of things what
are what are you most proud of
so I think there's kind of two aspects
of it um first I'll say it I think one
of my proudest moment at moments as a
product manager was when when we really
started working with our development
team side by side and realizing that we
were one team rather than in the
organization I had been in there was
this concept of the business is the
customer of Technology and I think
that's one of the most toxic lines that
can be said in an organization because
it starts to make this us versus them
mentality and it starts to imply that
the the business or product management
shouldn't care about what is going on
under the hood but at the end of the day
if I want to be the most effective
my job I need to be able to understand
the technology understand what's going
on behind the scenes and work with my
development team and my engineers to
make sure first of all that I'm not
making decisions that make their lives
harder because we as product managers
have a tendency to do that and utter the
words well it's easy right or it's just
this one little thing letting me in an
understanding that technology helps me
make better decisions and then it it
really lets my engineering team
contribute to the product more I know
that there have been several times that
I came in and had a future and my
designer and I had figured out exactly
what we wanted and we gave it to the
engineering team and they started you
know coding on stories and then I'd get
pulled over and say you know hey I know
you said you thought you wanted this but
I actually think if we did this it would
be much better and it was things that I
hadn't thought of because I wasn't
looking at it from the perspective of an
engineer and and features and things you
know were better and done more simply
and quicker because of building that
team together so I would say kind of the
manifestation of that though was when
like I actually came and sat in the
middle of our development team and they
didn't kick me out so no that's great
thank you very much let's maybe just
switch it up a little bit here because
it's it's fun to talk about some
successes why don't you pass the
microphone there to Adam and we'll let
Adam tell us perhaps in his career as
he's been consulting with with multiple
organizations as an external consultant
coming in what have have what's been
your biggest learning opportunity in
those organizations what what have you
learned that's impacted you the most in
a company I think getting to appreciate
the specific contexts of the
organizations that I'm working with and
and avoiding being fanatical about a
solution
and realizing that the only way to be
effective as especially as an external
consultant working with executives is
that you have to find when they're ready
to hear the things that they need to
hear and when not to say the things
they're not ready to hear so that you
can live to fight another day the the
primary it's it's I've I've been running
a community event in Seattle for close
to seven years called Seattle lean
coffee and we have people from at its
peak we'd get people from Boeing and
Seattle Children's Hospital and Virginia
Mason and the University of Washington
and never anybody from Amazon one block
away from the coffee shop where we do it
and some people from Microsoft and
various software companies and we all
have a lot of the same problems but a
number of agile coaches come in and I
have watched so many agile coaches burn
out in a in a blaze of glory from client
engagements that went incredibly short
periods of time and they would be at
lean coffee screaming and breaking the
clouds about how it's unjust and people
just don't do the right things and all
of these clients are horrible and oh I
just I just scored another gig and I'm
going in to do an agile transformation
at this place and they really need my
help and then they don't come to lean
coffee for a month and then they're back
and well they just didn't want to do
what it took and they didn't have the
courage and they weren't willing to make
those hard decisions because they're bad
and you know it's a it's a weekly clinic
in both how to and how not to help an
organization I'm super big into Jerry
Weinberg who defines consulting as
giving advice at someone's request and
that at someone's request is a really
big deal you've got to be willing to
bite through your tongue all the way
over and over and over again if you want
that's how you earn the winds is by not
getting spit out before somebody trusts
you enough
let you change something that matters to
them Thank You RDD you've got a similar
sort of engagement that you've been
through through your company tango and
in Prior prior engagements companies
that you've been working for and working
with maybe you could tell us as well
what you've learned along the way that's
been the biggest impact to you I've had
the opportunity to work sometimes as a
contractor and sometimes as a full-time
employee so I've seen the approach on
both sides it is funny because when I
have worked as a contractor I have
learned a lot to rely on the domain
knowledge of the people that are there
and to get to work with them to
understand what actually is going on
before I give an advice and it is funny
because sometimes people that are and
those companies they work there they
know the right thing to do they are just
not being heard and they use me as an
external contractor to say hey can you
save this because they hear what you say
they don't hear what I say and actually
I tried just to prove that theory and it
worked so it was a surprise that
organizations are not listening to
people that they have internally and
they are paying to get someone that
comes externally looks at the
organization understands the problems
and agree with the suggestions that
internal people give but all of a sudden
someone hears that when I was as in an
internal coach there has been a
different interesting conversation going
on because the expectations that
leadership has on a coach sometimes it's
not understood well and every one in the
leadership team had a different
expectations from what the coach does
and that I believe comes from the fact
from the fact that a lot of leadership
the people are actually not have not had
professional coaching before and they
haven't had any sense of coaching or
mentoring before so they just got into
that position because they were good at
what they were doing and all of a sudden
okay you're a manager and nobody helped
them into understanding well what do you
need to do as a leader
so when coaches go they don't know what
to do with us because they're not used
to have that sense of coaching in a
professional environment all right that
means you must be up next by process of
elimination in your in your biography in
your profile it you've got you've got a
note in there that one of the things
that you enjoy is improving experiences
in process in engineering organizations
I'd love it if you could give us an
example of a time that you did that and
how that worked out for you or didn't
work out you're allowed to pick either
example okay so the so this was actually
this was actually my first consulting
job I am I had a six month contract
working as a quality engineer but the
department wasn't very cohesive and the
organization had a number of a number of
issues so the way that it turned out I'm
trying to decide how to phrase this
exactly how to shape this narrative
there were there were regular quality
engineers and then there was me I was
embedded on a on a team of regular
engineers and they had they had some
serious process issues there
specifically they had a test suite that
took six hours to run the company tried
to release their software once a week
and every time their test suite would
take six hours to run and that made it
impossible for the developers to get
feedback from the test Suites in the way
that they would need to do
you two you know really to really make
this agile process work so there were so
there were a few things that I did that
were that really facilitated a change
there first of all the way that the
Suites were structured is that they had
they had an end-to-end QA suite and then
they had at the level of each individual
micro service each service had its own
test suite that covered that service
only so what I ended up doing was was
arranging to have the individual test
Suites for the micro services beefed up
significantly and also made more
efficient so that those tests provided
more comprehensive coverage and
necessitated less end-to-end testing so
by the time that I left the test suite
run time was down to two hours and that
still seems like a long time but the but
it was a night and day difference for
that organizations process and it was
just an example of how focusing on how
focusing on where to concentrate effort
really can make a huge difference does
that answer the question I I was
actually going to save this question for
a little bit later but I think I'm going
to piggyback right on that one in David
it's it's for you because you've you've
spent a lot of time with automation
building building automated testing and
one of the things that I've heard and I
don't know if that's a common thing but
one of the things I've heard in
organizations is that's nice that you
want to build this automation and they
that you want to automate these these
systems but we're too busy we don't have
time for that we have to get that next
feature out and which by the way leads
into product management which we'll get
to in a second but but maybe you can
tell me how do you make the time to
automate or or to build some automation
into
into your workflow that's a great
question
the first two thoughts that come to mind
one is a slide that Adam often shows in
his presentation that we're too busy to
improve slide and you may have seen it
with the Lego figures brush pushing a
cart with the square wheels right and
the second thing that comes to mind is a
presentation that Amir berroco gave at a
conference here in Winnipeg a while ago
in and someone asked him a similar
question said when is the best time to
refactor and and he gave a great answer
which included you know when your
manager is on vacation is a great time
to refactor and the assumption there
being that when you're not being watched
is it is a good time to do something
like that
where do you get the time for automation
I I find that when a development team is
separating the work of writing
production code from writing the work of
test automation code that's generally a
recipe for failure in my experience
because it allows people who don't fully
understand the effort required to write
stable software or the effort required
to write good automation or the or truly
understand the impact of allowing
technical debt to build up and go
unanswered to make decisions and say
well I'm paying for that and I can see
the value in this code that's production
code but I'm not paying for that the
test code so right so often what I coach
and what I try to coach technical people
and and developers in particular is
don't ask for permission to invest in
test automation instead look to develop
a practice of learning how to use unit
testing and automated testing frameworks
so that you can add automated testing
into your development and delivery
practice so it's no longer a separate
thing that you have to ask for
permission for and it's possible to get
to a place with enough practice where it
just becomes part of how you work and
you get to you you deliver you write
code through automation or you use
automation automated
techniques and automated testing
techniques to help drive the code that
you're writing and then it's no longer a
separate thing that you have to ask for
a permission for it's just part of the
quality with which you know the toolbox
of tools that you use to deliver quality
work Thanks
does anyone else have any questions or
should I keep going okay I'm gonna just
oh we have one from the back there was
that the kind of automation sorry say
that again
so that the question is is their own
sorry okay so the question if David if
you want to continue if anyone else
wants to pick this up is was i
specifically asking about test
automation or are there other things
that that can be automated that I was
referring to in the question and I'll
tell you from my perspective I was
actually specifically asking about test
automation but that no is not the only
type of automation just infrastructure
automation was what came to my mind the
same same basic idea and people are so
busy configuring servers manually that
they can't manage to find the time to
setup
you know puppet scripts and things like
that and deploy like we do in the 21st
century so I think also there's there's
the from a product perspective there's a
temptation to automate every type of
function that your product may do so I
think about this a lot with like
administration panels and things that
kind of that happened on the back end or
a lot of like self-service type of tools
I would categorize somewhere in there
and I really tend to look at it as and
you know when you have these manual
processes that you're tempted to go
spend a lot of time and a lot of money
putting some automation around as a part
of your roadmap start to calculate out
how much time you're actually spending
on the autumn on the manual portion of
it
and don't try to automate it until
you're actually spending more time than
it's worth
little things like you know I used to
have to maintain a phone number list you
know for Airlines and one of my old
product products I would have to go look
at it it would take me two hours once a
quarter to go run through some websites
and check these numbers and people
wanted to build out you know we can go
in screen scrape all these different
airline websites and have these things
and it will automatically come in and
it's like well but if I'm wrong on the
phone number it's not that big of a deal
and it only takes me a couple hours once
a quarter to go do so once we get to the
point where I start spending way more
time on it then I'll go invest four
months of time to automate this this
manual tasks cool so so just just in
case anyone just in case anyone didn't
hear the comment was years ago not that
many actually we didn't use things like
source control and now that's just how
we do our job and automation test
automation should be the same to which
items reply was yeah but that takes too
long and okay did you just want to grab
microphone
Thanks other guys faster because it
doesn't waste his time on all that
automation stuff and it's still in
production I guess it works enough we're
making money so why why waste time we
need to make the code
so let me jump in actually Chris with
with you you've been doing a lot of work
in systems thinking looking beyond just
the writing of the code writing going
beyond just writing the tests to
actually look at the entire interactions
of the system and to Adams point you
know that that writing those tests just
take too long
nobody's willing to pay for them how
does that relate into what you've been
looking at with systems thinking as
opposed to looking at looking at that
the testing the writing of the code you
version control all of those types of
things what what how would you take a
systems approach to to how we write
software though well it's looking at
what business are you in who are your
customers understanding so we just did a
talk right before this one understanding
the purpose and your relationship with
your customer why do we build what we
build to what standard of quality are
our customers depending on us right now
we're in a very interesting era where
we're seeing data breaches and security
breaches occurring on regular frequent
basis Equifax being probably one of the
largest right now but if you look back
it happens just about every year we
probably have maybe a half a dozen that
we know of the many smaller ones we
don't and it's a consequence of the
system that bursts that structure that
in consequence makes bad products that
you know people are not bad I think
everybody in this room tries to do a
level best job but the job that you're
actually able to do in being able to
building quality things that you like
you know like I want to develop in a in
a professional manner I want to make
sure I have testing I want to make sure
that I've got good version control in
history these shouldn't be seen as
things that you need to beg borrow and
steal to do or that you feel that you
need to conceal I used to when I would
coach I would say well if you can't get
the permission or it's an environment
where this will be seen as a negative
consequence do it by stealth you know we
used to talk about do agile by stealth
you just change the way that you work
but that strikes me as a very poor way
to improve an organization
that's looking at it as pieces and parts
and not the whole so when I work with
leadership teams now they have these
concerns most directly they're like well
we don't have time for this that we've
got a regulatory deadline that's
approaching in December we don't have
time for the teams to learn these new
skills we just need to ship something so
I asked them a critical question I said
if you were to assign yourself a letter
grade about what you need to achieve for
your customer what would it be you know
are you doing an a job the job C job D
job are you just meeting the
specifications and that's what they'll
say yeah it's it's meet and I've had
some of them be honest enough to say
well that's that's a D that's a 50% the
question that's never really followed up
they're like well that's all we need to
do I'm like well but how well are you
meeting the specification meeting spec
is not the point anymore so when I work
at a systems perspective it's helping
the leadership begin to see here's the
bigger picture
here's how all of these pieces and parts
relate to you getting a product to your
customer have you thought about the
consequence of this that there are
decisions that are being made that are
being telegraphed to your teams that are
influencing how well they can meet the
specification meet the customer yes and
no shut up no yes and actually the when
I talk about process cycle efficiency
and I talked about typing and a sort of
cheeky pejorative like denigrating
developers kind of way part of my goal
is actually to liberate developers to do
a quality job by taking some of the
focus off of them you know if we look at
the whole system the majority really
greater than you know 80 to 90% of the
delays of the lead time that we have is
in dependencies is in waiting for
something else and it isn't waiting on
an available program and when we have
these portals it is like not automating
not building continuous delivery pipe
lines not doing you know good code
craftsmanship it's all in the name of
hyper optimizing the productivity of the
individual developer and I wish if
organizations took
systemic view they would realize that
not only are they weakening the quality
of their codebase and the quality of the
of the actual code that's being produced
by their company they're doing so for no
good reason they're preventing people
from engaging in really high quality
craftsmanship for no reason because it's
not actually speeding the end-to-end
delivery of value to their customers
I would rather executives took their
focus and looked at the strategy of the
organization and what their customers
want and what the market is going to do
and let their development team alone or
even better actively encouraged and
supported their professional development
so that they could do craftsmanship and
build continuous delivery pipelines and
automate things because ultimately it's
it's 5% of your total lead time it makes
no sense to vulture over every single
developer and make sure that they're
doing as much typing as possible because
it doesn't make you better off that
makes you worse off because you're
encouraging them to cut corners and do
worse job at actually building the
product for no actual game to your
customer so that's why I talk about
positive cycle efficiency is in hopes
that somebody will hear me pay attention
to their organization and allow the
developers to do the good job that they
so desperately want to do one thing that
the leadership it's kind of interesting
they have some of the same concerns
around cohesion amongst themselves and
one of the way one of the ways that I
help them get out of this is it's a bit
of a mental trap for them leadership to
them literally becomes everyday coming
in and feeling like they have to put out
fires and it's a very unfulfilled and
unrewarding way to go about your life
and certainly for yourselves if you're
ever looking at ascending and you'll
becoming more effective in your
organization I would say that don't look
at management as it's been practiced
it's probably one of the worst ways to
look at it we laugh it's a its Dilbert
desk but it's actually something that we
can change and evolve and the leadership
who are in these battles right now they
want to get away from it too so it's
helping them see greater opportunity
that there is a different way that you
can lead the organization from a systems
perspective that makes some of these
thing
that we want to do to make great
products and experiences for our
customers possible I was I was gonna add
that one thing I've seen get in the way
of implementing really good processes or
stay on top of current technologies is
that managers don't have a lot of
awareness about how their subordinates
communicate with them I've seen a lot of
cases where people will approach
managers saying saying things like we
really should be doing this best
practices that you know um bla bla bla
innovation voila industry standard and
what and what management hears is is
look we have an operation to run here we
have to we have to write the paychecks
we have to sell the product and and what
they're not hearing is that people are
treading lightly with them what they're
not hearing is help we're gonna go out
of business if we don't implement CI
right now or that kind of thing and I've
I've literally gone up to a CTO and to
her face said if you don't make
technical priorities of business
priority you will go out of business and
she listens but managers don't know that
that's what people mean when they say
those things so I think both like as a
manager having an awareness that people
don't want to say something that might
piss you off
and also when speaking to managers
recognizing that they aren't getting the
information they need because people
aren't willing to approach them that way
thanks guys anything else that anyone
has right now all right I'm gonna move
on to to the next one Emily I'd love to
get a perspective from you on how you
balance the technical demands of writing
acceptance test version control doing
all of the things we need to do to
deliver a great product and sometimes
when we write when we write software
we're delivering something we we uncover
things that we didn't anticipate up
front and I'd love to get a your
perspective on on how we manage
stakeholder expectations through that
through through that process
what that means when it comes time to do
the we didn't realize going in I have to
be the advocate for the tech team and
help other people understand why it's
important I was doing a talk recently
Burroughs put side-by-side into
technology team you look at like future
work and you've gotta go sorry I was
muted the whole time could you start
over TL DR product manager shield for
everyone else Venn diagram we we like to
play in all three areas so sorry for the
video for later but where was I
yes so you know the technology teams
look at kind of the work and you've got
feature work and then you've got you
know maintenance and technical things we
have to do on the on the back end and if
you show that same thing to someone in
the finance department or in marketing
they see stuff I can sell and stuff I
can't sell and they want me to shrink
that stuff I can't sell as small as
possible but what they don't understand
is if I completely ignore that I'm not
gonna have anything to sell because my
products gonna become defunct my
developers are gonna be unhappy working
in old technologies so they're gonna
quit and I'm gonna get the crappy
developers who don't want to work on
this technology or who are willing to
work on this technology and then my
products gonna fall
behind and so for me it really all kind
of goes back to what I was saying
earlier of when you when you bring
product management in as a part of the a
part of the product team not necessarily
reporting wise but how they're viewed
and how they work with the development
team and as product managers in the room
you need to understand the technology
and you need to understand the why
because I need to be able to go explain
to the people outside of my team why we
need to do this or why this thing took
longer than we expected and it's not a
bad thing it just is things are gonna
take as long as they're gonna take
actually I have that same it's a
different version the same square wheel
slide and the wheel and we don't have
time to fix this talking about this same
topic because if we don't take the time
to do those things and we don't take
time as product managers and people on
the business side to allow for those
things it's gonna hurt us in the long
run and so just make time for it the
other the other side effect of that and
if you're an engineer just don't listen
because it's a part of the trade secrets
of product it will make your engineers
like you and then they want to help you
and then you work better and you get
more stuff done so it's it has very real
impacts on the product but it's also
your relationship and it shows the
development team that like hey we're in
this together if you it it starts to
like cut out some of those games that
you typically end up playing we're like
well we're gonna give you an estimate
that's 20 percent over what it actually
is because we don't want you to come
down hard on us when we uncover those
unexpected things you'll be able to have
real conversations with your team
they'll give you real estimates unless
you're doing the no estimates thing I've
never attempted that but you know you'll
actually get kind of better better
conversations upfront because they know
if we encounter something unexpected my
product manager is not going to come
down on me they're not gonna yell at me
they're not gonna ask me to work
overtime and make it happen and then you
have a better trusting relationship to
build better products which is what
we're all here for RDD you've you've
been working more and more with with
business thus the business side of the
business
it that sounds weird right like it's not
just me
okay you've been working with more and
more on on the business side of the
business what what insights have you
gained in helping them with their
product development and and delivering
value to your customers it's interesting
because I go there as an agile coach to
help the business side of the business
to become agile so we keep talking about
the business agility I don't know if you
have if you are up-to-date with all the
conversations going on around business
agility it is about that sense of having
an organization that acts in an agile
way from the customer point of view so
we're not just executing and we're not
just getting that that the development
team working in an agile way as an
organization we think with the shorter
feedback loops and with a faster
decision making and with a purposeful
from the beginning and delivering value
and all of that so unfortunately a lot
of organizations start thinking like
that when they start bringing the agile
transformation in the IT for some reason
we believe that if we improve IT
everything else is going to be better
and then business is caught off guard
and business as well now I need my coach
to tell me what to do because IT is
doing their thing and they are ahead of
time ahead of me so I hope we get into a
place where organizations don't look
themself as IT business operation we
want to be into this together and we
want to start thinking with a customer
point of view and with proper kpi's from
the beginning so everyone understands
why are we doing what we're doing and
business does have usually some
traditional ways of working they do have
sometimes long processes
depending on some organizations the
layer of management is thicker than in
some others so those are some of the
areas that we usually want to see being
more lean and more you want to see the
work flow faster in those areas so that
it gets into the development teams more
concrete more focus in a smaller portion
so they can deliver it faster so we want
to start with a small and with value
from the beginning and business needs to
business is struggling in some
organization but business is also doing
well and some of them it's not that
business doesn't understand right there
just has worked for them until now and
why should we change until they see some
improvement until they see a team doing
something differently that seems to be
even better than we are and now we own
okay we want more of that so I like to
ask people a lot of times when they say
that it's been working for them like you
know the dr. Phil moment like has it
been working for you you know when we
start talking about deadlines and you
know fixed time fixed scope type
projects and planning and and they'll
say well we've always been able to get
dates on our projects before and my
responses and and how has that worked
like when was the last time you had a
project that actually finished with the
scope you expected at the time you
expected
it's either it goes over time and it
goes over budget or the teams are having
to chop scope and half to fit this false
deadline based off of some you know
random pulling a date out of thin air so
it hasn't been working but it's like a
security blanket that people can't let
go of you're right there are a lot of
organizations that have struggled at the
same time there are organizations that
have been in business for hundreds of
years banks there are very old banks
that have been in business for years and
they can tell the story that hey I've
been here longer than you have been
talking about this agile thing so who
are you to tell me what to do
that being said it doesn't mean
that they are not open to improve right
so this is where we now come into
context understanding where they come
from understanding their beliefs
understanding their successes and
improve them improve their strengths and
reduce the weaknesses I feel like we
could probably spend about another three
days just on this topic alone but we are
coming close to time so I'd love it if
we could if we could wrap up and we can
maybe just just go down the line here or
if you know you guys can decide where to
start but but it's it's in two fantastic
days of a ton of information here in all
of the sessions given that we are the
last session of the last day everyone
will probably forget everything that all
of the other sessions covered so if you
guys could you guys could perhaps offer
the one nugget of advice or direction or
or the one thing that you would like
everybody to take with them when they
leave well what would that be yeah we
can start with Chris no pressure
thank you Adam I think probably they you
know the two sessions that I did were
red bead experiment and what is the
purpose of your system for the folks who
participated in that it's to realize the
consequence of systems and the influence
they have on how people behave they
behave in accordance to the system they
are contained within and if you're
looking at why leaders managers
yourselves why you may struggle to
achieve certain things it's always
drawing upon the wisdom of folks like
Deming and shultiess 97% of your
organization's problems are attributable
to their processes and methodologies and
into relationships 3% are actually
people so focus on that start helping
your leadership and your teams think
bigger
thinking systems rather than you know
Joe is a bad guy or Adam is you know
very depressing
I'll keep mine short and sweet I hope
that in the hopefully near future we all
recognize how stupid the business side
of the business sounds as a concept and
now to me as the business if you were in
my session earlier one thing that that I
really am trying to focus on is is
challenging the status quo especially in
large enterprises where people have done
things the same way the law a really
long time and one way that I have found
to do that is to fight what I've been
calling the mysterious bay so when you
hear someone say well they won't let us
do that or you can't do that because
they're gonna come down hard on this
start asking for the name of they and if
it start at the top the CTO know okay
visit the person that works for them
know and pretty soon you'll walk down
the org chart until you find out that
there is no they and either someone just
doesn't want to do something or people
are making assumptions about what won't
what people won't let them do and when
you start to call that out people will
start to allow themselves some space to
challenge that status quo and if you're
using the mysterious they stop it it's
just a way to shut down conversation
have the have the conversations that you
need to have rather than trying to
deflect we're gonna go out of order here
just for a second if that's okay
Thank You Adam so the the one that I'm
gonna mention is it's actually a point
that Adam mentioned in his brief
introduction to agile scrum and Kanban
earlier he put up the slide of the agile
manifesto which I think a lot of
developers have seen by now and
emphasize the phrase at the bottom that
says though there is value though we see
value in the items on the left we also
see value in the items on the right just
more so and and that I'm not quoting it
properly no I'm not I know I'm not but
close enough you get the idea the reason
that that's important to me is because
it speaks to the fact that it's really
Dogma in any form about any of these
processes or tools or technologies that
we talk about that gets in the way of
people communicating and having those
conversations that are so important to
understanding each other and
understanding what we're all trying to
achieve and to breaking down the
barriers between us and them between
developers and testers between
development and the business around all
sides and opening the ground to have
those conversations that we need to have
if we're going to understand what we're
all trying to do and who we're trying to
do it for and how to do a better job
yeah I think that I think mine would be
similar that it that we're dealing with
situations where we have to interact
with a wide variety of different people
with different backgrounds and recognize
that all of us including our customers
are all working towards the same thing
and kind of stepping outside yourself to
reach out to other people and
communicate with them on their level to
try and make things work um I don't know
if we've spoken enough but probably just
to put a little bit more focus Peter
Drucker is one of the bright minds that
we have around that have been in the
world of business around us and one of
the things they said is the purpose of
business is to make and keep customers
so I think we need to really look at our
organizations from that point of view
are we making and keeping our customers
and start from that point of view into
what do we need to do on operation on
business on finance on HR on technology
on everything not just on one area
don't don't optimize only the delivery
part optimize your whole organization
optimize your whole value delivery chain
that you have in order to keep making
and keeping these customers so you are
valuable so business agility guys I'd
like to just if we could say thank you
to Chris Adam Emily David Dana our DITA
thank you guys so much for participating
in this I hope this was valuable I hope
you guys got something you've got a few
minutes left I think we've got about two
minutes before before they close the
doors and kick us out so if you have two
minutes of questions I'm going to offer
up everyone here to grab that six
minutes I'm told we have six minutes if
you want to grab anyone here you've got
six minutes to to chat with anybody here
about any individual questions you do
have but on behalf of everyone on the
panel behalf of on behalf of everyone I
want to say thank you to the sponsors
thank you to Darcy Ryan and and Steve
for putting the event on and most of all
