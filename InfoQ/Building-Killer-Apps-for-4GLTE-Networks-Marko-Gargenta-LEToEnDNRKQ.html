we get the signal going how many of you
are Android developers here ok and dress
to your iphone developers yeah a couple
I've from developers ok anything else
any any other developers interesting
stuff iphone or android windows got it i
forgot about that one so so we're going
to talk a little bit about what LT is
and then we're going to talk about why
you would care about it and then we're
going to talk about some of the ideas
how you can take advantage of LT so
before we start i'll just tell you a
little bit about myself i'm actually one
of the cofounders of san francisco
android usergroup along with my brother
sasha who you probably know better
because he's the one who shows up all
the time and i just show up occasionally
I'm also the author of learning android
a book published by o'reilly our sponsor
tonight and i'm a co-chair of upcoming
android open conference in October here
in the city so that's that's something
that's very exciting because I think
it's going to be a very sort of big
gathering comprehensive conference about
Android so with that I want to tell you
a little bit about what LT is and why
you would care about it so here's some
of the essential sort of good things
about about LT so LT is faster and you
probably already knew that so it's a
faster network it's it provides for a
much richer content so you can do more
things with LT then you were able to do
before and it's a safer network so
unlike previous 2g 3G networks it
provides for certain security features
not present before so essentially LTE
the point of this talk is that LT is not
just yet another incarnation of of the
no 3g 2g 3g 4g and so on right so we're
going to look at each of these
separately so in terms of the speed LTE
is much faster both upstream and
downstream so that's the quadrant on the
left so we have 86 megabits per second
going up and 26 going 28 going down on
average average speed is between 12 and
5 but most importantly we have a very
low latency so the speed is one thing
when it's all said and done latency is
another so you can a very you have
basically a very wide bandwidth spectrum
on which you can do a lot of you can
push a lot of data you have a decent
throughput and you have a very low
latency that's over fifty percent faster
than our standard 3g networks at the the
together today so what this really means
to you as an app developers that it
enables sokol slew of new services that
you can develop for such as HD video
conferencing things that require fast
interaction back and forth across the
network they're suddenly possible on on
this network so in terms of the
bandwidth these are just some numbers to
kind of give you an idea so the spectrum
that we care for 3g is much more narrow
than the one that we have for for LT LT
provides for way more lanes of traffic
if you will it accomplishes the faster
network speed not just by having more
actual bandwidth or spectrum to work
with but it also got some interesting
things with the using multiple antennas
multiple channels things like that to
actually get that speed going and in to
keep the latency levels down so
essentially 2g was you know 2g and 3g
networks were built to to handle voice
and a little bit of data and LT is
basically built from ground up to be
specifically for data or IP traffic so
that's sort of a big deal around tell
team in terms of latency these are some
numbers
the carb compares to the standards that
we have today so today we have the about
65 to 50 to 65 milliseconds in terms of
the network latency del T that number
goes down to about 10 so it's a
substantial improvement in in
responsiveness we also give a much
better to your ethical toe boots right
so it's one thing to have a lot of
bandwidth it's another thing if that is
kind of like having a freeway that
becomes a parking lot right so it's not
just how many lanes you have but it's
also how many a fast is it moving so
theoretically would LT we have a much
better bandwidth and and then throughput
as well at the same time so that enables
basically richer content and richer
applications when it's all said and done
yeah question the question is what the
blue bars are and they represent
specific LT representation
implementations so we're going to talk a
little bit about later on what LT is
from technical standpoint because it's
really a collection of a whole bunch of
different technologies put together into
one one umbrella and so that's why we're
seeing multiple different bars there as
well technically wimax is also one of
the LT subsets as well so but basically
what we're talking about here is what is
possible with some of the technologies
that that are coming up just a quick
question how many of you know what LT as
a three-letter acronym stands for just
curious all right so what a turd so it's
a long term evolution right so it's
basically a whole bunch of things that
were doing 22 get the network on the
same standard than an IP standard going
forward and so that everything is sort
of unified as opposed to various
different things that we have going on
right now that are all over all over the
place yeah so why max is 3.9 Jesus
standard it's almost LT so it's got some
LT components to it but it depends on
the definition as well oh you know how
how it gets cual classified some so what
LT provides in terms of
in terms of having the network like this
you can basically do a much richer
content in richer set of applications
right so a lot of these things are going
to be up to you to figure out what is
possible what kind of applications
you're going to develop on top of it but
it just gives you an ability to do
things like HD movies HD video
multi-part video right real time gaming
cloud computing enhanced reality so all
these services are suddenly possible
because we have a more bandwidth and low
at a lower latency so far right so
that's that's a that's what it means to
be a richer just to give you an give you
an idea in terms of the actual
identifiers that we use for devices so
in a standard 2g and 3g devices we
typically use a 10-digit identifier to
represent a device well that means you
can only represent so many devices it's
sort of it's sort of like ipv4 right
we're running out of numbers essentially
where we'd LP we're basically using a 15
digit identifiers and what that means is
that we can provide from remote devices
on the network so what does that really
mean are we going to have way more
people are we going to have you know
suddenly go from 1 billion to 10 billion
people it's unlikely that it's going to
happen overnight right but it does allow
for an interesting concept of having
machines also participate as citizens on
the wireless network and that's
something that's very very interesting
about Delta that wasn't possible with
the older 3g technologies just because
we were simply running out of ideas for
for the the actual devices that are
connected on another thing that all TV
provides that's really unique is the
quality of service right so basically
you can have certain traffic at a year
to other traffic so for example if I
want to do video conferencing with LT I
can basically say that my video
conferencing requires priority service
so as such it's going to move to a
faster lane and if you have things that
are that are not as important like for
example asynchronous seem
now that can move into the slower lane
and basically yield two things that need
to need a faster responsiveness so so
that's something that is very very
interesting in sort of new and it
provides for new set of applications
such as like I said the video
conferencing but there's just one of the
ideas it's up to you guys to come up
with other ideas for abs to take
advantage of this new possibility of the
technology what's a multi-part videos
it's basically a video that carries for
example multiple the imagine it's
multiple languages or multiple
soundtracks so multiple points of view
things like that so that becomes it's
basically a video that's far beyond what
we have at the DVD level today so so
basically orem you know or even lower
streaming quality so it's beyond that so
a little bit about the so this is sort
of like what the usage of various
services is today in terms of the Bandit
so basically the size of the little
bubble represents the the data usage so
how much data a certain service use and
then we also you have the doctor put how
much does actual service require so for
example on the top left corner we have
video streaming right so video streaming
requires a lot of is a lot of data but
it's also a lot of data moving at a fast
speed right it's not for example
downloading some file like an ftp
service is a lot potentially a lot of
data but you don't really care that much
about speed because it's not going to
affect your your experience since you're
not really watching unless you're
watching the progress bar move right
then it may affect your experience but
for the movie it does so for example
also a video requires a high throughput
and a lot of data moving at the same
speed where's on the opposite side of
the spectrum we have SMS which basically
doesn't require a lot of data it's
really really tiny in terms of data and
in so lives in the lower right
there is the lower access is basically
how much were using such a service right
so SMS we use quite a bit because it's
really fast and it doesn't require a lot
of data video on the other hand we use
Moodle years as much but it's much more
expensive ok so what LTE is basically
shifting this focus so suddenly it's
going to be possible to move video
streaming from the left side of the
quadrant all the way to the to the total
right side or at least the middle so
we're going to be able to enjoy it more
frequently more often and have a great
experience at the same time right to
kind of pick couple couple extremes
similar a similar thing with audio which
we use a lot to stream music right now
but it doesn't require as as much of a
torpid although collectively it does use
a lot of data it's just because we use
it much more so we're going to see
audience for example become more of a
mainstream type of a service because
there's a question about so the question
is about the additional power
consumption for for loyalty so
ultimately basically did a lot of
surprise one of the very important
considerations for LT will talk about
some some of the best practices but
that's been taken into account quite a
bit and so yeah so we'll talk about it a
little later as well so the short answer
is as long as you're on an IP a network
is going to be much more efficient than
if your flip flopping between different
networks just to kind of give you an
idea what are the expensive things to do
another thing that Delta kind of brings
to the table is that it simplifies the
world worldwide roaming so basically LT
is becoming a standard deny p standard
that is crossing the globe it's going to
become the standard for all the mobile
operators around the world and we'll see
a little bit about the adoption later on
so what that means is that the worldwide
roaming becomes is becoming easier so
it's going to be easier for you to take
your phone overseas I'm not sure how
this may apply to you as an app
developer developing applications but it
could have some interesting implications
one little detail that I wanted to
mention here although it sounds ideal
that we're gonna have
you know the sort of one set of devices
across the globe with economies of scale
the price of devices coming out down and
so forth the devil is really in the
details of the spectrum of the bandwidth
so we're going to still be seeing
certain carriers in certain countries
use different frequencies when it's all
said and done so for the near future
you're likely going to still have
different devices in different countries
but nonetheless the technology is sort
of getting centralized to the same
standard so we should experience certain
economies of scale when it comes to the
price of the actual devices that means
more smartphones in in as a percentage
of total devices on online right so
another advantage of LT is that it is
safer so it's actually not just a here's
the dump pipe that that is going to
carry your bits across faster but it
also provides for a lot of safety
features on the network so basically
network provides authentication so it's
128-bit authentication so you can now
have your users authenticate securely
and so we know basically who they are
and that that can prevent basically
sessions hijacking and things like that
on the network and we have the similar
bust a non-invasive key storage so
there's a way to store in store the keys
securely using the network encrypted
data communications by default all the
IP traffic is encrypted so basically you
don't need to worry about that as much
net the network now handles that for you
and it's given its you know you can take
it for granted essentially some other
features are that identity there's a the
identity protection against the smooth
snooping so basically by having network
worry about all these things it's harder
for somebody to hijack your your phone
phone line and together scandal like
that happen right we can basically a
granular security service so we can set
different security levels in a different
service this plugs back into the quality
of service
features so you can basically have
things like email adhere to different
criteria then things like video and so
forth there's also the ipsec for
tunneling communication so you can now
have certain applications take advantage
of connecting using IPSec tunnels which
enables a whole bunch of new enterprise
features when it comes to leveraging the
network right so you can now have a
safer enterprise experience on the
mobile phones unlike unlike today now at
least you don't have to worry about it
like like you do today so essentially
the bottom comparing sort of the
networks to are the roads right so we
were so connecting point A to point B
and just like in the old days we sort of
had you know single lane roads that were
designed for you know just pedestrian
traffic and such 2g network was really
designed for voice we didn't really have
a concept of a data and back then 3g who
got better so with 3g the third
generation of networks we essentially
enable data as well so we had voice and
data live together on the same network
but that doesn't mean that we had any
priority over voice for its lien company
guarantees didn't have any security
didn't have any quality of service none
of that was available or is available
today on a tone of standard kg2g network
so we basically had a bigger road with a
lot of traffic still stuck on it and
running relatively slow so essentially
what happened over time is we built a
mobile network that was designed for
people talking to people right that's
what we started with this whole thing we
took the land lines we rip them out we
built a mobile network that allowed us
to talk without any any wires and such
it's still people talking to people what
what we're doing with LT is we're
basically shifting gears quite a bit
we're building a much bigger more
important network but what I'm trying to
say here is that the network is not it
just like in when we build a freeway net
in the United States it wasn't just the
faster road it enabled a whole bunch of
new services it enabled interstate
commerce it enabled mcdonalds at the
minim freeway exits it enabled people it
enables suburbs so a whole bunch of new
things were generated out of this faster
prioritized network so LT is sort of
having similar impact or potential to
make a similar impact when it comes to
mobile communications so basically one
thing that I mentioned earlier is what
that means is that we're now enabling
machines to talk to machines as well as
people right and that's a big
opportunity here because now we have
ipv6 available to us which means that
every single device can have a
connection to the same network that we
as humans do right so your your bus
concave connection to your bus stop can
have a connection to your mobile phone
can have a connection to your office to
a ferry to to your bike lock to your
thermostat at home to your alarm clock
etc etc so all these devices can now
live in the same networking can be
interconnected and can actually talk to
each other so we have the plumbing for
it we have the opportunity to build
something with it and what's missing
right now is sort of the intelligent
tabs that take advantage of this
potential right so this is just an idea
that an artist generated for New York
City making a claim for a New York City
domain name right so we have basically
traffic traffic lights talking to fire
alarms talking to the curb talking to
the plumbing to down down under talking
to the subway system talking to the
parking meter to light posts etc etc so
suddenly things can live on the same
network as people so that's sort of a
big deal this is something that was
generated but by sr i-- the consultancy
in terms of sort of what the future of
Internet of Things looks like right if
we draw a straight line where are we
going to end up sometime in 2020 and
they're basically saying you know what
we're seeing right now is we're seeing a
lot of our
fight these some basic things coming
online right so with them near field
communication we're seeing a lot of
devices becoming Network aware on if
onlys for limited distances so far but
with LT we're basically going to see a
much more devices be enabled to go
online and be equal citizens as our
mobile devices are today so this enables
things like surveillance security health
care transportations food safety
locating people everyday objects and so
on and so on so this is we're projecting
quite fun into the future so this line
is likely going to bend in certain other
direction but still it creates a whole
new set of possibilities so in terms of
the adoption where we are today were del
T so this is not just some pipe dreams
it's actually happening and the time is
actually right now a lot of a lot of
carriers are getting online store in
North America and I'm sure you guys have
been watching the all the advertising
that were bombarded with and confused by
with everyone everyone claiming to have
the fastest you know 4G LTE network
Latin America is finding a bunch of
launches this year we're seeing Asia
come online Europe has been doing LT for
some time in their expanding so we're
seeing a lot of new carriers jumping
onto the onto the bandwagon as well so
those are some some country sims in some
numbers at the same time we're seeing
the price of the actual devices come
down quite a bit so on around this year
we're seeing that basically the LT chips
so this is the price of the actual in
raw hardware the actual chipsets that
that you need to enable the endpoints
the actual devices you know either for
human consumption or mercy machine
consumption we're seeing that this is
coming down below the commodity price
right line so essentially sometime this
year it doesn't really matter what it
costs it's cheap enough to plug in into
a lot of different things right so that
that sort of tipping point is happening
right now and this year so this is why
it's the
is kind of timely so just a little bit
about the evolution so on the Left we
have you know certain technologies that
you may or may not have seen before but
they basically represent what we are
using today right so these are the
technologies that we are using with
various carriers around the planet um LT
is a long term evolution for all of
these technologies so the idea is that
we're migrating all these different
standards toward the same standards that
the whole world more or less a grey
scene okay again the devil is in the
detail but we have a pretty good
standard going on so far so all the
roads are leading in that direction so
this is a in terms of the services again
predictions a little bit of a you know
future guessing but as you can see
toward 2015 you can see what the money
is which services are likely to produce
the most returns for you as as a
developer if you're developing new apps
or innovating on top of this bombing
that we have called LT right so we're
seeing that you know the the Sun premium
services are are becoming much more
prominent than before and the reason for
this is because it's possible we
couldn't do it before we just didn't
have the infrastructure so gaming
personalization paid information
browsing p2p messaging music HD video
conferencing data networking and so on
so everything is sort of growing
becoming more prominent in the network
so that's the revenue in that's compared
to the revenue of those actual services
so a couple of best practices review if
you you know if you solved on this you
want to innovate you want to build stuff
on top of l team and you're interested
what is some of the best practices are
here's just a couple of ideas so far
that we have so first of all the world
is not going to be perfect it's not like
all of a sudden everyone's going to
enable this IP based network for us to
work with you as a developer need to
worry about what kind of network the
user is going to be and the user is
going to be flip-flopping between
various networks
so that's happening all the time today
and it's going to be happening probably
for a couple of years until everyone
builds out to their infrastructure so be
ready to to be intelligent about that in
your application application should be
checking for the type of a network and
should you know handle it accordingly so
you know in Android you have you have
hooks to connectivity manager you can
basically find out what kind of
connection you you really are on so it's
not just hey do I have a tcp/ip stack
but it's also what kind of a tcp/ip
stack do I have who's providing it right
so use use bigger buffers so basically
even though on different networks the
the good assumption is to basically
assume that you're going to be in a
faster network so build you take and
make your buffers adhere to more of a
full-on LT size so that you can you can
basically move the traffic faster this
is going to work ok even when you're on
a slower 3G network but but it's going
to make a difference when you actually
are or when your users are on a faster
4G LTE network prefetch for fast
experience so sometimes you your app you
can sort of predict what the user is
going to need so if I'm opening up you
know if I'm opening up my twitter app or
my facebook app I can kind of predict
that the typical behavior is going to be
to check the statuses see with my
friends are doing etc seeking sort of be
intelligent about prefetching some of
the data in the background and taking
advantage of that happening while the
user is doing something else so by the
time the user gets to that screen it can
take advantage that here's the question
yeah it's a good question so the
question is isn't this dangerous is
because uncertain care it with certain
carriers you don't have the unlimited
data plan not everyone is with sprint
right so you have to kind of be careful
about you know using services that are
going to cost the user money at the end
of the day right so they're potentially
dangerous services
so in and that's a correct statement in
android you know we're so we're supposed
to adhere to the best practices of
actually checking if the user is okay
with using the background services right
so if you know if you're an Android
developer you will check what the user
setting is for background services and
you would actually adhere to that so you
would not do prefetching in that case
you currently cannot find from the
network easily if the data plan is
limited or not but you can at least
check the user preference assuming that
the user said the preference is properly
given the network so that's one sort of
way to to handle that you know graceful
him and also expect you know prefetching
algorithms are not perfect so this is
all sort of a guess it really depends on
the type of applications internal
applications it's going to work better
than others right um cash cash more
often so we do have a databases in
android the point of a database is in
android is really to kind of keep the
data that is otherwise in the cloud so
if there's a case where you can keep the
data locally and essentially cash that
may be a good case so for example i was
using twitter as an example you know if
i'm downloading twitter statuses they're
not they're not changing all that often
so i can basically cache the data
locally and in the in that case of
twitter i don't need to i don't need to
basically expire my cash all that
frequently so that's and that's one of
the easier algorithms but you kind of
can experiment with those algorithms in
figure out what what can work well for
you 11 session for multiple gets so back
to the battery life opening up multiple
sessions can cost money or can cause
battery juice when it comes to LT LT has
the feature of maintaining your sessions
for a much longer period of time this is
something we did not have on 3g networks
right so LT is going to maintain this
even though the user is basically
flip-flopping across multiple networks
so user could go from 3g to
12 t and still maintain the session so
you basically want to pull together a
bunch of gets on the same session and
basically do them on the same on the
same go that also limits firing up the
radio so the radio consumes the power
about 10 10 X compared to radio being
off so there's much more you know power
consumption when it's being used so
might as well group does calls on the
same session so for example you know
your Twitter in your Facebook and your
gmail they can basically pull together
and on a DRS level in and pull the data
in the same session as opposed to
opening up multiple sessions for
instance so that should give you a
better responsiveness and and a better
power power consumption on the
advantages of IP network as well are
something that you know you can take
advantage of so basically if you have
you have a very low latency what that
means is that as opposed to if you're
streaming multiple things at the same
time say for example swimming multiple
movies you could actually shut down one
stream while starting the other so you
essentially on simulating multi tasking
if you will when it comes to network
usage just by shutting down one
restarting the other and since you can
do that shut down restart very
efficiently very quickly user gets the
experiences as if they're running at the
same time although they're not so that
essentially limits your network
bandwidth consumption and helps through
the speed and helps you the power as
well so basically starting a stream a
stopping a stream a starting a stream b
and so on in doing that flip-flopping
very quickly I think we're talking about
a couple of you know basically you know
very low latency 20 milliseconds in
milliseconds of latency and very low
inactive to active time of about 10
milliseconds it's really little fast to
turn turn a stream back on right
favorite downloading over streaming this
goes back to flip flopping the net
across the networks so although you may
be streaming a movie if a user is
bouncing
between a 3G and 4G and LTE the
experience may not be all that good or
basically HD video is not going to work
very well on 3g so on favoring
downloading may work better than then
streaming in that case until we know
that we're on a more of a solid on all
IP all the time network so that's just
one of the ideas in one of the last sort
of you know best practices is to watch
for this aggressive aggressive apps by
that i mean the ABS that sort of lose a
packet and then keep bugging the system
to regain that connection back on right
so on this can create basically blocking
on the on the network thread bye-bye
basically not allowing other apps to
participate in the traffic as well in
having an app that is constantly trying
to ping the server connect to server for
whatever reason that is not working very
very well so again you know adhering to
being a good citizen when it comes to
writing writing applications in general
with respect to using using the network
and so finally what what I wanted to
sort of a conclude with you know I
started by by talking about the LT is
sort of like the highway system compared
to the you know the road infrastructure
that that we have so adaptability is
something that that's I think very very
important it's not usually the strong
survives survives it's usually the most
adaptable that survives so this is a
sort of a new network with new features
and we as app developers with typically
I'm speaking for myself we typically
take the tcp/ip stack in a mobile phone
just for granted it's just there I just
use it to connect to the network on what
we have now is an opportunity to rethink
that into basically become intelligent
about how or our apps can become
intelligent about how they use the
network the underlying network you are
connected to so so with that on these
are some of the slides are going to be
available here and I just wanted to kind
of open it up for questions before we
move on so yeah this is the statement is
the basically with LT the range is much
wider so you do not need to be as close
to the tower as you do with the actual
with the actual 3g and 2g networks and
that's correct one thing that LT does is
it's very smart about using multiple
antennas so it can basically be grabbing
connectivity from various sources at the
same time and that's way optimizing the
performance of the network as well so
that's that's correct yeah ok so the
question is if i coded propolis so we
have Wi-Fi today and LT is sort of like
Wi-Fi so faster so what's the big deal
about LT compared to to to Wi-Fi today
so just do it me know briefly compared
to Wi-Fi so yeah so yeah you can you
know say say the speed is comparable on
wife is very limited in range that's
that's one thing Wi-Fi does gives a
security just like LT but it's a
different type of a security so it's not
percepts cry burb a security right so
what LT is allowing for is each
individual device to authenticate itself
on a network using a 15 digit
authentication numbers so basically not
only do you know somebody's allowed to
get on the network but you know exactly
who is that person that that connection
endpoint that's getting online so from
security standpoint it's richer right
because you not only authorized but you
not only authentic it but you authorized
as well right so that's in terms of the
security we so we have drange another
thing that you don't have necessarily on
a Wi-Fi is the quality of service so you
know with LT you can basically can
Kendall different different services you
can have you know HD video prioritize
over email or ftp download and that sort
of stuff so those are some some other
advantages plus it's a much wider range
plus is going to handle automatic
bouncing between various you know LT
endpoints so who decides on a qos today
right on my understanding of that is
that basically the carriers can set
their policies so they can say
you know mime type if you will gets you
know or type of a you know packet gets a
priority over over another so that's why
on what's interesting now is before you
didn't really care so much as an ad
develop it didn't really care so much
about who your carrier is right now you
sort of want to work closer with the
actual carriers because they're going to
have different you know engage rules of
engagement when it comes to their
network vs here's just a tcp/ip pipe
that you know you play with some it's
going to be a combination of those
things right so the statement is
basically that if you have to put n
points a and B one supports Q as the
other one doesn't so yes you got to go
with the least common denominator so
there's going to be some you know some
some you know poor experience at the
point B yes that's correct sorry okay
the question so do i see a case so the
question has to do with the revenue
expectation for services and how
carriers are going to want to
participate in that or today today i
would assume that the carriers are going
to be highly motivated to participate in
the in sharing the revenue from those
value add services now i don't know
exactly how that's going to work yes sir
the question is about location-based
services and i think alex is also is
touching on that as well so that's one
of the features now of the network the
network is modernos much in much more
detail who's who's where so you can you
can use the GPS which takes forever to
to lock it you can use the assisted
network which is not very granular or
you can ask this intelligent network for
where the particular particular
subscriber is right and so that's that's
one of the examples where network is
actually helping right so we're bringing
it to the level of a network we're
outsourcing it from a nap stag down to
the network stack right so so that's
that's an interesting feature payments
are another sort of something that
people are experimenting with the
network level because it's more secure
so you in so it's you know plumbing that
you don't need to build basically
some yeah cool all right thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
