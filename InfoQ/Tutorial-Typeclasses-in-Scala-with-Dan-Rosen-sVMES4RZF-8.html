instructor here at Maracana and I teach
scholar courses and I'm here in Marikana
studios to to talk to you about type
classes in the scala language now type
classes are a design pattern that that
we try to use as much as we can and we
use them really just with one goal in
mind but it's a very important goal in
software engineering which is decoupling
we want to try to keep our software as
modular and as decoupled as possible so
that we can vary our little bits of bits
of our program independently so that we
can swap things out we can reuse them
and so on and so that keeps things much
more maintainable and easier to reason
about over time all right so let's jump
into it let's get started here with with
a simple use case I'm going to define an
algebraic data type that that's going to
be used here to represent mathematical
expressions what's an algebraic data
type well it's it's sort of another
pattern in Scala that you see where we
have a sealed trait in this case it's my
sealed trait called expression and then
a number of case classes that implement
my my ADT trait so in this case we've
got case classes number plus and minus
and the fact the fact that we're calling
it an algebraic data type is actually
has nothing to do with the fact that
we're talking about mathematical
expressions here that's sort of an
unintended pun okay so a number has of
course a value and if we want to
actually evaluate the number all we
would have to do is get its value plus
and minus are sort of our recursive
cases in this little expression language
they have sub expressions on their left
hand side and right hand side and so of
course to evaluate a plus and a minus we
would have to evaluate the sub
expressions first now that's what our
expression evaluator down here is is
doing it it pulls the value out of a
number and for pluses and minuses it
recursively calls value on the left hand
side and the right hand side arguments
and then adds them or subtract some
appropriately one thing that I want to
point out and this is an important thing
to start with is that I could just as
easily have defined value as a as an
abstract number on the expression trait
rather than having it separated out into
this expression evaluator thing so that
would look like you know sealed trait
expression
with a member deaf value that would be
just abstract and then my case classes
number plus and minus would would have
some implementation for value and those
implementations would look just the same
but you know let's say that I don't want
to necessarily bake in the assumption
that I'm going to be evaluating
expressions let's you know start out
instead with the assumption that
expressions could be used for any number
of different things so you might want to
evaluate them or let's say you might
want to serialize expressions so that
somebody else could evaluate them
elsewhere before we look at what other
things you might want to do with
expressions let's let's just take a
quick look at the coupling here that's
that's implied by our class diagram we
have our expression evaluator which
depends upon expressions and that's sort
of what you would expect that that's
that's probably what we're going to
think of as as necessary because you
know what's an expression evaluator to
do if it's if it doesn't know what it's
evaluating right and you know of course
we have some sort of an inheritance
dependency from number plus minus two
the sealed trait that they implement so
again you know we think well you know
that's that's probably relatively
necessary and so you know the fact that
we have decoupling as our main goal
doesn't necessarily mean that that this
coupling in particular is bad just it
just wanted to get get everybody's mind
on how will quantify coupling and so so
that that's this is how we're going to
be representing it okay so we talked
about other things that we might want to
do with our expression hierarchy and
indeed let's say we wanted to serialize
it so let's say I want to serialize
expressions into JSON the JavaScript
object notation so once again I have to
find a new algebraic data type this time
for Rho for jason and this this
basically just mirrors the spec so I've
got adjacent value a DT with case
classes JSON object array string number
boolean and null which you know nothing
ought to be too surprising there an
object is just a essentially a
dictionary from from field names to
their values an array as a sequence of
values and then the rest are basically
our primitives again we have sort of a
little class diagram here that indicates
what what kind of couple
implied by implied by this structure
Jason Reiter we haven't looked at yet
we're going to look at that on the next
slide but the goal of course is going to
be to serialize Jason values out of
whatever type into into a string so that
we can send it over the wire so you know
of course we think that a jason writer
has sort of a necessary dependency upon
jason values and then and then of course
the case classes that implemented by
virtue of extension those are those are
also going to have dependencies on the
jason value trade again not passing
judgment here just observing what the
what the the degree of coupling that
we've got is so far okay just a quick
look at the writer i've included in the
included this in here it is sort of for
completeness so if you're following
along and and you want to implement
these things for yourself you can do it
the implementation detail not that
important but you know again we've
separated out the concern of
serialization of these jason values from
from the adt itself again I could have I
could have implemented a write method in
the ADT but I feel like it's a cleaner
approach to externalize it and and then
use pattern matching on the case classes
okay so we said that we wanted to be
able to serialize expressions in our
little expression ADT out to Jason
values so what we want to do is is
utilize what we've got so far we want
some way essentially to reduce that
problem into converting expressions to
jason values because once we do that
then we can use the write method that
we've already defined so down at the
bottom here I've got this this sort of
auxiliary write method it's going to
take a value of some arbitrary type that
I haven't really defined yet and and
return a string and the way that it's
going to do that is by doing some sort
of a conversion to Jason values and then
and then just chain back up to our
default write method the typical way
that you would do this in an
object-oriented design is by introducing
some sort of an interface or a base
trait and things that you'd want to be
convertible to jason values should
implement that trait so this is how this
would typically look I would introduce
some some sort of a trait called Jason
convertible let's say value is going to
is going to have to be a jason
convertible type and then you know when
we want to actually serialize this thing
all we have to do is call convert to
jason on the value so that's what that
trait would look like just you know a
single method trait jason convertible
with that with that one method converges
Aysen again a look here at the at sort
of the dependencies jason writer now has
two dependencies instead of just one it
has abandon C on Jason value and a new
dependency on jason convertible you know
I think that that looks fine so far
so now the interesting part is when we
have expression trying to sort of fit
into this model so we say expression
extends jason convertible and what that
means is is that we have to implement
eight you know def convert to jason
inside each of our case classes number
plus and minus again the implementation
isn't that important here but if you
want to if you want to pause the video
and and copy down to follow along please
feel free so you know if this this
approach that we have totally works we
can we can declare an expression you
know plus with its left-hand side it's
just the number one
the right hand side is a sub-expression
- where it's left hand side is number
three and the right hand side is the
number two and when I go to serialize
that using jason writer dot write it
it's perfectly happy to do so because
expression is a jason convertible but it
really I don't like this approach I
think there's there's too strong
coupling here because as soon as we said
that expression inherited from Jason
convertible we we introduced quite a bit
of unnecessary dependency so for example
here you can look at this at this class
diagram and see that well expression
evaluator depends on expression which
transitively depends on the thing that
it implements which sort of implies that
expression evaluator cares about jason
convertibility which you know of course
it doesn't that that's an orthogonal
concern and also that this this really
goes against the design pattern that
we've been trying to follow so far where
our ADT's were simply data and no
methods attached to that data in keeping
the assumptions about what the data
might be used for external and so that
was that was kind of a design goal that
we've that we failed to fail to maintain
here but you know furthermore what if we
what what if what if expression were
some sort of a third-party library
something that that we we can't edit you
know we can't commit to and therefore we
couldn't modify expression to inherit
from jason convertible if if we want to
be able to serialize these things to
jason so so the approach just be just
completely fails here this this approach
of subtyping subtype polymorphism which
you know again is just expression being
a subtype of jason convertible it's not
going to work for us so we're going to
introduce this notion of type classes or
ad hoc polymorphism as compared to
subtype polymorphism to try to eliminate
that tight coupling now ad hoc
polymorphism or type classes or you know
maybe sort of fancy sounding computer
science e terms but it's really quite
straightforward whereas we had a trait
before that was going to be convertible
to jason we're going to externalize this
jason convertibility property into a
helper object
so now our auxilary right method is
taking two arguments it's taking a value
of some type a and this this is an
arbitrary type that's just noted in the
type primer and a converter for type a
so we've got two arguments here and this
is doing essentially the same thing as
we had had with subtype polymorphism
it's just sort of splitting it out so
now instead of saying value dot convert
to Jason we say Conniff dot convert to
Jason with the value and we can then
pass that to our default write method
again so again what does this look like
well we've got now our Jason converter
for type a so it's now a parameterised
trait and convert to Jason now takes an
argument some value of type a our
dependencies again look fairly similar
Jason writer has a dependency on Jason
value and on this jason converter trait
and i've colored this jason convert a
trait in green to indicate that it's
somehow different and what i really want
this to highlight is that jason
converter is now what we're going to
think of as a type class it's it's
something that i can implement for
anything that i want to be convertible
to jason without having to you know make
that thing extend from sun base type so
jason converter is is going to be our
type class here so the benefit that we
get from this is that expressions now
get to be just what they were before
they get to be raw data with no with no
methods polluting them so we've got the
original expression adt and we've
separated out the logic of how to
convert our expression adt into our
jason value adt this is great now we can
call jason writer dot right with our
expression again and as long as we pass
in the expression jason converter that
we just defined we still get the value
at the other end that we wanted to but
looking at the at the class diagram here
you can see also that that the fact that
we've separated things in this way
eliminates that coupling between
expression and jason well we what we had
previously called jason convertible
now the dependency is is encapsulated
just in this one value this expression
Jason converter that's of type Jason
converter for four expressions so you
know again what we had observed before
is at the expression evaluator which
depended upon expression seemed to have
this transitive dependency upon jason
conversion or jason convertible and that
is no longer the case it's quite nice
now we have you know really just just a
minor problem at this point and that
minor problem is essentially that it's
that it's slightly more verbose the the
fact that we have to explicitly pass
this expression jason converter in is a
little bit more clumsy than what we had
before with their subtype polymorphic
approach and you know it we can also
sort of consider it a minor fail that
you know nothing that we've done so far
is really special to scala we can take
this design pattern that we've
implemented so far
straight out of the Gang of Four design
patterns book and you know implemented
in Java or in C++ or whatever and you
know Scala doesn't doesn't offer us any
special advantage so far so here's where
we're going to see scholars expressive
power using using implicit so just a
quick review for anybody who needs a
quick brush up on how one place its work
in Scala I'm going to go into my scholar
interpreter here and just to find a
quick add method it's going to take two
arguments X and a Y and add them so
nothing too special
I can also curry those parameters into
multiple parameter lists and this this
looks a little bit unusual if if you're
more familiar with Java or C++ or some
language like that I've got two separate
parameter lists each of which just
contain one member X&amp;amp;Y separated out and
if I want to call add I can do so I just
have to make sure to pass my my my
parameters in separate parameter lists
there as well now the next thing I can
do is say that the last the last
parameter list you know I can have an
arbitrary number of parameter lists
right but the last one I can optionally
include this implicit keyword
and what that says to the compiler is if
it's able to find a value in this case a
value of type end in implicit scope that
the compiler should provide that as the
argument to that parameter list now I
can call add here just as I had done
above I can explicitly pass in 1 and 1
and you know it'll still give me the
result that I expect but you know let's
say that that I want to actually use
this implicit power to try to just add
one and pull pull my second end value
out of the ether so let's try to do that
I'll now try to say add 1 and it says oh
no I you know I couldn't find an
implicit value for parameter why well
that's because I don't actually have one
there is not an implicit int in in scope
so let's introduce one we can say
implicit Val one of type end is equal to
1 and now I can just call add 1 and the
compiler or in this case the the repple
will provide that implicit value as the
implicit parameter for that in that
second parameter list ok so that was
just a quick review
but basically armed with this power of
implicit we can now take this converter
parameter that we had explicitly and
separated into a separate implicit
parameter list all that we need to do
now to to satisfy the requirements of
implicit resolution and say that our
expression Jason converter that we had
defined previously is going to be an
implicit Val
I haven't made any any changes to this
thing otherwise and then finally you
know we get really the essentially the
complete win here we can say Jason
writer dot write just pass it the
expression we no longer have to
explicitly pass the the type class
instance that we had defined this this
expression Jason converter thing and you
know so this syntactically looks exactly
like what we had when we were using
subtype polymorphism but of course we
have you know removed all of the
adjacent converter stuff that were that
were the
was polluting the expression ATT so this
is really great and you know if if
you've followed so far that is really
essentially type classes in Scala you
don't need to you don't need to learn
anything more to use the type class
pattern in Scotland so you know if you
feel like that's enough to absorb then
feel free to stop the video right now
what I'm going to show you from this
point on is is sort of a bonus it's it's
going to be a syntax that will help us
deal with type classes as even more of a
sort of the first class language
construct so above we have just what we
had before we've got our two parameter
lists one taking our value that we want
to convert to Jason and the second
implicit parameter list taking our type
class instance but we can express that
in sort of like I say a more first-class
way in the language using this context
bound syntax where we say that a is
context bound and that's what this
Collin means by the Jason converter type
class or you know another way of
expressing that is a is a member of the
Jason converter type class and this
should sort of remind you of of how you
would have you would put upper or lower
type bounds on a type parameter to a
method or to a to a class that you're
defining it's supposed to be sort of
reminiscent to that syntax and so that's
quite nice that the only downside here
is that we no longer have this this
variable named con so we have to create
one I've done that by calling the
implicitly method this is something that
that scholars pre def provides for you
and that basically pulls our JSON
converter out of the implicit scope and
assigns it to a value conf so you know
that has an advantage and a disadvantage
the advantage is we get to say we get to
use this context bound syntax to say a
is a jason converter so that's kind of
nice it provides a sort of a
documentation of what a has to be to
satisfy the constraints of this method
but the downside of course is that I've
got to use this implicitly method on the
body so I want to try to clean that up a
little bit and the way that I'm going to
do it is a really straightforward
refactoring we're just going to rename
jason converter
we're going to call it Jason because
we're thinking now if the Jason type
class what we're not thinking about
conversions we're not thinking about
about sort of the verb we're thinking
just about the noun Jason as has a type
class in its in its own right we're
going to say that the type class has a
method called Jason and then the way
that we're going to use that in our
jason writer is we'll say you know a
again is a member of the Jason type
class that's using our context bounciest
syntax and now we can say a little bit
more fluently that if at when we want to
call right we'll use the implicit Jason
type class and we'll just call it Jason
on that now thinking about it this way
actually gets us back to a class diagram
that looks similar to what we had before
using subtype polymorphism using our
inheritance right we have Jason writer
Jason value and Jason all sort of
interdependent and we have expression
evaluator dependent on expression and
those are those are sort of as we
expected and now we have this thing
using context bound syntax that makes
expression look like it sort of is
inheriting in some way from the Jason
type class now of course we know that it
isn't in reality it's using this this
implicit plumbing and so expression
doesn't actually have any dependency
upon Jason but we can write you know
this this dotted arrow here to sort of
indicate that expression is a member of
the Jason type class and and that'll
help us think about things a bit more
succinctly alright so now that we've got
this this kind of mental model for how
we're dealing with type classes let's
see what else we can apply this pattern
to let's say you know we started out
with the assumption that expressions
were going to be a closed ADT that is
you know we had a sealed trait
expression and we had number and end
plus and minus that inherited or
implemented expressions but let's say
that we want now to open that up and be
able to treat anything as an expression
in some way
the same way that you know we we had
Jason as sort of an open type class as
such that anything could be treated as
as a Jason value and just you know for
the sake of example here let's say we
want to use skal has been built in int
and and tuple two or or pair types two
to be able to treat those both as
convertible to Jason and and in
treatable as or evaluatable as integer
expressions so we're going to use the
same type class pattern for expressions
as we use for Jason so I'm going to
define an expression trait and that's
going to be my expression type class so
again you notice the expression now
takes a type parameter some some type a
and our value method is taking an
expression again of that type a and
yields an int the expression evaluator
that we had before now gets very much
simplified we we now just have an
evaluate method that takes an a of the
type class expression you give it an
expression of type a and it uses the
implicit expression type class instance
to determine the expressions value so we
no longer have to do any sort of pattern
matching on the on these the concrete
subtypes our expression adt those those
no longer exist now and just to take
another look at what our class diagram
is going to represent in terms of
coupling we've got our jason writer
family off to the left and we've got our
expression evaluator family off to the
right but those are no longer tied at
all to the concrete implementations of
the things that we're going to be
converting to jason are the things that
we're going to be evaluated as an
expression so int and tuple two are both
members of these type classes now but
again I've represented these with dotted
arrows to indicate that there's no
actual dependency there okay so let's
let's look at how we declare type class
instances for these for these two type
classes for in for int and tuple two so
let's start out with jason in the
companion object just you know so it's
sort of for for convenience sake in the
companion object for our jason type
class i'm going to declare these two
implicit one is going to be the type
class instead
sort of the assertion if you will that
int is a member of the JSON type class
and the assertion that pair is a member
of the JSON type class these are our
type class instances so for for int
obviously I'm just going to give back
adjacent number anytime you anytime you
ask for the adjacent value of an int and
for pairs
I'm going to perhaps somewhat
arbitrarily say that that JSON object is
how we're going to represent these pairs
so so it's going to be a JSON object
with a with a map with the fields first
and second and now we do something
interesting we've made the assertion
that pair is a member of the JSON type
class but we've put the constraint on it
that that you know a pair of type t1 and
t2 is only a member of the JSON type
class if t1 and t2 themselves are
members of the JSON type class so okay
so given that assertion now we can call
our implicitly method again to pull the
JSON type class instances for t1 and t2
out of our implicit scope we'll call
Jason on those and thus we can convert
the first and second elements of our
pair to jason recursively another thing
to sort of point out here is that this
is open to extension so you know if
somebody else provides some other jason
type class instances that are available
implicit scope then at the point where i
am doing my jason my jason writer dot
right as long as those are all in scope
I can call it Jason I can call pair
Jason and I can call whatever other
jason things are provided implicitly the
the compiler again will take care of all
event type class membership through
implicit resolution now we get this nice
symmetry with with jason instances and
expression instances again in our
companion object for the expression type
class I've gone ahead and defined two
implicit which again are asserting that
int is a member of the expression type
class and pair is a member of the
expression type class with the
assumption that of
course pairs constituent bits t1 and t2
themselves also have to be viewable as
expressions so to evaluate an int well
the value is just the value of the
number right and to evaluate a pair
again a sort of arbitrarily I'll say
that a pair represents addition so I
will implicitly get the V value for t 1
and the value for T 2 out of our
implicit scope again using whatever
implicit sar available in implicit scope
at the time so we're not just limited to
your instant are pairs we're open to
extension again and you know so I'll get
those values and and I'll add them and
that'll be the value for our pair plus
expression so this is great
given that those things are in scope
again by virtue of the fact that that
our our companion objects are declaring
them I can say you know Val vu is equal
to this tuple of 1 and an inner tuple
two and three and I can call jason
writer dot right on that and I can call
expression evaluator evaluate on that
and in fact since we're using implicit
resolution we can not only provide
additional things to be treated as
Jason's and to be treated as expressions
I can also override things that I've
defined before so let's say for example
that instead of treating pairs as
addition when I when I view them as
expressions I want to treat them instead
of subtraction so I've overwritten
essentially by by virtue of how implicit
scope resolution and the precedents
they're works out I've basically
redefined pairs to to be treated as
minus so so if I call expression
evaluator not evaluate on food now using
the same foo I haven't done anything
different I'll get to out the other end
instead of six so this is great to
summarize you know a type class is this
thing that we've that we've seen
basically a trait with a single type
parameter you know for example jason of
a and that defines operations on its
member types more advanced actually you
can get into multi parameter type
classes where i could have you know
sometimes some type class with the a and
a B parameter or so on
that's bit more advanced and then for a
type T to be a member
of this you know some type class TC
there just has to be a value of type T C
of T available in the implicit scope and
again you know that that's that's really
the essence of what the type class
pattern is all about in Scala if we want
to get a little bit more you know sort
of syntactic sugar II and treat these
type classes is kind of a first class
member of the Scala language we can use
context bound syntax saying T :
TC to indicate that T is a member of
this type class and again that's that's
supposed to look similar to to lower or
upper type balance right so finally just
to summarize the thing that we'd used
initially was something called subtype
polymorphism which you actually have to
use sometimes you can't actually always
use ad hoc polymorphism there's there's
some cases in which in which you can't
get away with that but the disadvantage
to using subtype polymorphism when you
need to is that you get this sort of
tight coupling where the subtype by
virtue of in its inheritance is tightly
coupled to the super type now in the
cases where you can get away with ad hoc
polymorphism it's generally a very good
idea because when you use type classes
there's no coupling whatsoever between
the type classes and their members I can
mix and match instances of the type
class these these vowels that are in it
that are in implicit scope or these
deaths that are in implicit scope I can
mix and match those as I want to
so that really opens up the door for
quite you know quite powerful decoupling
and modularity I can do things like
dependency injection using this
technique and that's going to help out a
lot with with testing in in large code
bases I can reuse components that you
know we're designed for some problem
domain a in some new problem domain B if
I can provide appropriate instances of
the type class for this for this problem
domain B so this is really a powerful
tool for for software engineers and one
of the big appeals of Scala and and
other related functional languages
thanks again for watching I hope you
guys understand now how to use the type
class pattern in Scala to really keep
