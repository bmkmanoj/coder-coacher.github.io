is seated so I'm going to get started
it's attached so I can't do a mic drop
okay my name is Estelle while and my
slides are up at estelle github I owe
flash components if you just go to stout
just remember my name is still it's not
that hard go to my github page and
there's not just this deck but there are
on all the decks for all my
presentations so you can learn this and
you can learn other stuff too a little
bit about me I can be found on twitter
at Estelle V W I am a twitter whore
please follow me that is the only reason
I speak at conferences and these are
some of the books that are written or am
writing and mobile html5 the the
conference bought a bunch of them and
we're going to be selling them for
donation of four black girls code so you
can get whatever donation you want but i
think i'm going to be at the
registration desk doing that so if you
want a copy of the book it would be
great if you made a donation um okay so
let's talk about web components one more
thing if you guys have your computer
open and there's little arrows here
they're going to be in the top center of
the page that actually links to the
example that I'm talking about so
there's the example code for everything
that's in this in this presentation and
if you are on a page and you want to
take notes you can just hit the number
four and it's saved in local storage so
you can just type in whatever you want
and it goes away and it comes right back
and safe so if you want to take notes
that's a good way to do it okay so let's
talk about web components what our web
components I'm going to read you a slide
because you guys don't know how to read
encapsulated and reusable components for
the web what does that mean let's show
you by example this is the current state
of affairs can anyone tell me what this
is it has two hints in it as to what it
is but it's completely non semantics
if you look up here this looks like it
could be speech and if you look down
here it says Google logo so my
assumption as to what this is is that
the little icon in the right-hand corner
of the search box on Google home screen
that is the completely semantic
interpretation that is the code that
they put behind it you used to be able
to use just you x dash WebKit speech and
then when you clicked on that icon you
could actually talk and it would
recognize it but they took that out of
WebKit and this is what we have now
unfortunately it's not semantics but can
you imagine if they simply put in speech
dash icon speech trash icon and that was
it well that would be a web component it
would be a semantic way of explaining to
you what an element does and it's a
custom element it is something that you
create so we do have web components in
this right here is a web component this
is one line of HTML and one line of CSS
to create this sure is better awesome
okay thank you so what is the code I put
one line of CSS that says display block
and height 600 pixels pretty pretty easy
and then it says google map which is a
custom element it's that element does
not exist and it gives you latitude and
longitude and it ends the google map
pretty simple it has a template behind
it and this is what i'm importing and
the import is basically the google
directions and a google map and it's in
the template template element is
something we're going to cover basically
web components are four components
there's custom elements import template
and shadow Dom so the import is a top
line I'm going to explain this three
times by the end you will get it the top
line says link rel import and it imports
an HTML file and in that HTML file that
explains everything that it needs to
know and that the code below its below
that and there's a fallback
because if the browser doesn't
understand the google map it will still
read what's inside so in this case we're
just sending a giant ping PNG and that's
what we get so web components enable us
to create semantic code it enables left
two completely separate out JavaScript
for behavior p CSS for presentation HTML
for content in that first example of
that search speech logo or speech
capability there was a lot of you know
it was separated there was CSS that was
JavaScript and there was HTML for
content but it provided us with like 412
divs and spans that really were not
semantics and really weren't content
they were for presentational reasons or
as hooks for javascript it allows us to
silo our code it allows us to
encapsulate CSS when problems we've had
with CSS is CSS hits the whole document
we can actually with web components make
CSS just hit the one element that we're
creating its native so instead of
importing an entire framework like
handlebars it's right in the browser so
it has better performance and it reduces
the number of Dom nodes which if you
know especially in the mobile space when
you have a limited memory and Douglas
Crockford said that people have
gigabytes in their pockets that is
inaccurate the iphone has one gig the
the latest Samsung just to be different
has three but the most popular phone
sold in India is 128 Meg's so depends
who you're trying to hit but if you're
only trying to hate iphones you can only
hit iphone 5 and 6 because the before
that it was a half a gig okay back to my
talk okay so i said there's four
components and now we are going to
actually cover the four components
template shadow DOM and the content
element most people think the content
element is part of the template it's
actually found in the shadow Dom so
that's going to be a little bit
confusing HTML imports and custom
elements
so our task for this is to design or
develop the name tags for this
conference unfortunately I did not see
the name tag until today they were
supposed to send me a copy and I could
have made it really pretty but instead
we have this hideous shade of brown
which looks even worse up there than it
does on my screen but the HTML that I'm
going to be using in the end is just
named ash tagged with the role of
speaker and the name of its del while
and it's going to invert it so that
Estelle while is on top and it's going
to put the header in the footer and make
all the colors beautiful but our HTML is
just going to read that so that's our
goal so how would we do that now oh
sorry I jumped ahead of myself so oops
in the end i'm going to create a
template it's going to have this
document fragment so it's going to pull
in all the bells and whistles just once
and that's what templates to help us do
it's going to create a shadow Dom I'm
going to queer going to create a shadow
Dom so the CSS for that name tag is only
going to be for that name tag it will
not affect the entire document so that
font that I'm pulling it not actually
point in the phone it's just using a
font that's on the computer but that
font is only going to hit the h3 or the
header of that name tag because it's
going to be in the shadow root I'm going
to actually import that name tag
template with an import so my HTML will
only have those three name tags in it
that is it will have one import and
three divs within it with roles and and
names and then i'll be using the custom
element of name tag so that is what
we're going to do so is this supported
of course I'm up here and there for my
wireless is no longer working let's try
it one more time
nope okay so in terms of support it's
partially supported in a lot of browsers
and chrome and opera have full support
right now and ie has no support
whatsoever if firefox did say right now
import is behind a flag they've decided
not to ship with it but they do have
polyfills so can we use it now yes we
can with these three libraries of
polymer xTag or visonic i'm not going to
talk about the polyfills because what i
want to do is I want to teach you what
the how to actually code it that way
when you use polymer or x tag or visonic
you actually know what's going on behind
the scenes what is it Paula filling I
want you to understand how web
components are developed so this is how
we currently code if I want to do my
name tag right now I would create a div
with an outer shell with the logo with
the tag line with the inner area that's
going to be back round of white with my
name and the role in the correct order
and then the footer and the thing is
this is how most people are programming
it so we could add a little bit and make
it more semantic by putting a header a
main and a footer but main is only
supposed to be one of us on a document
so that's not the best because we
actually want three if we were doing
this from the server side you know and
having many name tags this is what the
code would look like if we doing it
client-side we could pass an object or
JSON with the roles and the names and
then we would create an element and then
we would iterate through it and then we
would create the template without of the
head or the P the main the name the role
the footer then we would add the four
classes and then we would actually
append everything it works but who wants
to code this so we have templating and
this is a handlebars template but who
wants to import an entire framework just
for a name tag I don't so this is what
we're going to in the end end up with
semantic element called name tag we know
exactly what it is and that's going to
be it
we're going to import the rest and use a
few lines of JavaScript like five lines
of JavaScript to make the whole thing
work so let's start with the template a
template i'm going to read again is a
document or file having a preset format
use that as a starting point for a
particular application so that the
format does not have to be recreated
each time it is used that is it's a noun
okay in terms of developing a template
is what it gives you is absolutely
nothing you load a template on the
screen and you get with all of that
content in it that we're going to have
with the header in the footer in the
main it's going to be blank there's
nothing going to show in your document
because that's what it provides you it
provides you with something that is
invisible that you can actually take it
and clone it and replicate it multiple
times so you can you can pull it in
without using it and you can pull it in
and use it later or you can pull it in
and basically put your video in there so
that you have the link to it but you're
not downloading the video or the
JavaScript whatever you put in it is
innocuous it doesn't impact your only
basically pulling in the bites when
you're pulling it in in rendering the
template element represents nothing so I
already said this it's inert until
activated it has no side effects so if
you don't you just call it in and you
have a JavaScript it won't actually run
anything inside your template element
will not run or will not download images
until you actually activate it you can
put it anywhere you can put in the
header or the body or even between the
two and i actually think there's an
added benefit if you're not using this
for web components if you're just using
it as a template it can actually improve
performance by enabling you to make
fewer ajax requests later on because
your content still there and you can
just pick and choose and so you're not
waking up the radio if you're on a
mobile device and another thing with it
is designers can use it to create rich
interaction without actually impacting
the rest of them of your of your code
okay so how do we use templates we
feature detect we declare the content
and then we activate the content
in terms of browser support apparently
now I have internet access um oops
you'll see here or this is template it's
very well supported except for ie and
then the other red is a opera mini which
that's normal they try to improve
performance and they give you already
pre-made pages okay so how do you
feature detect you basically say is
content in a template when you create a
template either yes and then you can use
it or not then you have to use a
polyfill then inside your template
element you have a template element you
can have style you can have content then
you can have the content element and
then you can have any scripts or you can
have any media you want as well so this
is how it would look you have the
template up top as the shell I'm giving
it an ID I don't have to but I'm giving
an ID just to make it life easy for
myself so I can call it later and then i
have this element somewhere inside
called content and that is where the
content within my name tag will go so in
the case of our template for our name
tag we have template called name tag
template we have a bunch of CSS to make
it really ugly and then we have the
header the footer and the main and
inside the main we have the content
which is where the name and the role are
going to go go I didn't have to drop
down i added a slide so that i wouldn't
have to go down but i did okay and in
our HTML we have this simply div class
name tag with the three names what does
our JavaScript look like the simplest
way of doing this and the the most HTML
like this doesn't give you the shadow
Dom but the simplest way is you just
basically say hey find the name tags get
the element that is the template and
then loop through all the name tags and
copy the the the contents of the of the
template so what we're doing here is
with a clone we do document import node
the template content is true so what
does that do that takes what was in our
little div class name tags the name and
the role and it pulls it in where the
content element is template content
right there there's two different ways
of doing it we have what we've done up
here which is document import node
template content true or template
content clone node true you can do it
either way they both work and what does
that give us it gives us this that works
except for this scenario right here my
speaker word is first and there's one
other thing that I don't like about this
which is if I do a body outer might this
is the CSS is for the whole document and
it is impacting my template content and
that's not what I want so what we're
going to teach you is how to make it so
that this doesn't work that you would
actually have to do shadow outer and
right now that's not working but let's
get to that okay so before we get to
that the HTML that was basically created
because I wasn't using shadow DOM is
with the content of clone node I just
put the the content into these two into
this element right here into the content
and then with this method I also
replicated the Styles three times and we
don't want them so let's figure out a
better way of doing it with to do it a
better way we use shadow DOM and the
content element the content element is
actually part of the shadow Dom
specification so the content is the
insertion point where we're going to
take the content from our custom element
or right now just that div with a class
of name tag and that's where the content
of that div is going to go so right now
the role in the name are going where the
content is right there in the yellow or
right here for people who are colorblind
I'm highlighting it so these two lines
are going to go into one these two lines
are going to go in the neck
and these cook two lines are going to go
into the third so what I do is VAR
template this is what we had before this
is the exact same code that we had
before the difference here is I'm
creating a shadow root and there's two
different ways of doing it again so
basically the only difference is instead
of appending it to the parent div the
class name tag we are pending a shadow
route to that parent name tag and we get
the exact same look and feel with
speaker and my name here but there's a
difference and the difference is right
here it says shadow root we have name
tag then we have this shadow root that's
created and then we have outside the
shadow root the role in the name and
these two are not actually displayed
what is displayed is basically it sticks
it in here so we've talked about content
but my name and my role a speaker are
still in the wrong order you can however
have multiple content elements if you
use the Select attribute and the Select
attribute uses a CSS selector to place
the correct element or the correct
content in the correct location so if
you had noticed before oops I'm going to
inverted the slide sorry here I have
content select name and content select
roll so the the element that has the
class of name will be in the top and the
element with a class of role will be in
the second one and so here when I had
inverted it it will actually go into the
correct location so this is my original
code and you see that I had the class of
a role in class of name so in here it
will go to the appropriate location and
I'm its exact same
a script it's create shadow root and a
pencil template content oops okay so
what we have is a simple HTML as a
template what so you probably you're not
asking because you're nicely polite and
quiet but what about if you don't
actually like if you have information
that is not in doesn't have the class or
isn't actually captured by anything
originally we use just use content and
you grabbed everything right and then we
use use content with the Select quote
name and dot roll and so it grabbed just
those things with those selectors to
grab the rest of the content or what we
did originally which was grabbing all
the content you do content simply empty
or with an empty select or with the
global selector and then we'll grab
everything just note if you're going to
do any one of these three this has to go
last because it collects whatever hasn't
been used yet so if i had roll name and
company it would actually grab company
but if i did the the global selector
first it would grab all three and then
it wouldn't have anything left for name
and for roll okay so what does this
create remember the last time when i did
a body outer it turned red they change
colors now it doesn't because it is
scoped the CSS that is in the template
is scoped to that shadow root so if i
actually want to make it red i would do
shadow so you can communicate with CSS
between the parent document and the
shadow root and from the shadow root to
the parent document but it doesn't do it
by default by default when you're using
the shadow root the CSS is scoped show
you this by a different example here I
have the page CSS which says h3 color
red and then i have the scope CSS which
says h3 color yellow and
going to do em text decoration underline
just in case we do have people who are
colorblind so the first one is
underlined those are h 3's and this the
second one is also the red one on the
bottom is an h3 but it is not underlined
if I did this shadow um oh it doesn't
work because I didn't type it correctly
yep okay it's a double colon notation so
here in this example you saw that I was
able to go from the page CSS and
actually target the shadow Dom but I had
explicitly state that I wanted to and
then here h3 I could do and there i
added host h3 and so it underlined it
for me so you can actually communicate
with the CSS between the two but you
have to explicitly choose to do so so
it's really nice to finally have scoped
CSS okay but you've also you've probably
come across the shadow Dom many our
shadow it many many times this is a
picture of an input type of range and
you have a little thumb and it has a
pseudo class of WebKit slider runnable
track and you can actually style that in
some browsers in this example you have
the day picker and here you can actually
pick dates or get the calendar and it
has right here shadow root that's
produced by the user agent here you have
the video controls again it's part of
the shadow root so you've actually come
across this many times it's been around
for many many years but we're finally
getting access to that so shadow root is
not just important in web components
it's actually a really cool feature
overall so what we've created so far is
I have a name tag with roland name and
I've created a shadow root with all of
that information and the name in route
goes there
I think I've covered everything in this
slide so I'm not going to cover this
slide okay okay so I'm going to do one
more example which is I'm going to
create a shadow root and I'm going to
put a paragraph in it and here you see
it's red all right this is the page CSS
and this is part of a shadow root so why
is it red it's still going to inherit
some features from its parent a color is
inherited if i change this I over to pee
and we all know it's a pee from the
previous page it won't in it because
it's not inheriting from a parent
paragraph it's actually its own
paragraph but if I did shadow p then it
is red again okay so let's okay so
here's a few CSS selectors that you
might want to know when you're talking
about the parent and imported import t
there's unresolved so when you create a
custom element and the javascript hasn't
actually happened yet you want to list
it as unresolved and you probably want
to do a display none or opacity 0 it
maybe not want to display none because i
don't want display but at least that way
it won't show until it's resolved so
there is actually a pseudo class until
the the javascript has created your
custom element then there's the host
which is the parent you can actually
target something within the parent with
the parentheses and do all that so the
shadow root is everything that's within
the shadow root and the host is the div
name tag and if you see down here this
is part of the host these two lines but
this is not rendered the host is not
rendered it's the shadow root that is so
this will show up in your in your
developer tools but it's actually placed
within here okay I think I talked enough
about that so let's go into imports with
with all used imports before yes
and everyone that imports the shadow Dom
supports it so this should have been
something at the beginning whatever
should produce shadow root supports
content okay so import with are we this
is from 1999 I actually pulled this from
a site of mine when I did a perl script
and it wasn't actually a template
because I just wanted to see how many
people have visited my site and not that
many did but I had a little counter and
I basically use the CGI for an import so
we're kind of used to it but now we have
it basically on crack so it's the link
element and is it supported you just do
is an import you create a link and
you're like is import in it if it is
it's supported if it's not it's not
supported unfortunately right here it
says Firefox have Firefox is going to be
a no right now it's behind a flag in
Firefox but they just came out and a few
weeks ago and said that they will not be
supporting it into current setting but
there are probably feels for it okay so
how we actually import we do a link rel
import we can do you know a path we can
do make it HTTP or HTTPS depending on it
or we can have it actually on an
external site just note that it needs to
be kors enabled you have to give the
right permissions for the you know if
it's on a different server you have to
actually write on your server that that
is okay a course stands for cross-origin
resource sharing so in our case we are
importing our name tag very simple I'm
cheating a little bit for space and I'm
putting my event handlers directly on
the element don't do this put it put it
in your script but i just want to show
it up here so we're gonna have a load
handler because there is a load event
and there's an error event and so we're
going to import it and were going to run
a script once it loads and if you look
here the only thing i have is my three
name tags I don't have the template
anymore this is a really short document
to send this from the server is awesome
and then it pulls this other file and
the thing is if I import this import 27
times it will only import it once and so
this is my name tag template it has the
template as a show the style and the
HTML that you saw oops I went in which
direction
that went pretty far okay that's it
that's a template the CSS in the HTML
okay so what do I do this javascript
looks familiar to you for the most part
except for import the content i'm
importing content from the form i import
I'm saying query selector link rel type
import which is the one that in the
header and here it will just pick the
first cuz i use query selector I could
have also done query selector all if I
had more input and then loop through it
and I import them and the content of my
template is the content of my name tab
template that I imported this being the
content here and showing it again here
it's not a special I probably should use
a different variable but it's the
content of my template or my import that
I'm now putting in as my template and
then I'm looping through it for all of
my elements and cloning and creating the
shadow root that's one way of doing it
until we get to two custom elements I'm
going to actually have to loop through
them custom elements will do the looping
for me because it will say every time it
hits a custom element it will call that
function again so that's why I keep
looping through it but at the end you
don't actually need to cut through it so
when I import something it's similar to
the shadow Dom where you have basically
two Dom interfaces you have the document
Dom structure or dom tree and then you
have the shadow root or in this case the
template the important Dom tree so we
can use all the JavaScript that we've we
know how to use but they're under two
different basically two different trees
so that one thing won't impact the other
so if you actually did how many outers
do we have on a page there in the shadow
root right now so it would be zero right
but you could actually say within my
shadow roots how many hours do I have
and it would find the three of them okay
so how do you activate it
well nothing happens until it's
activated and we activated with a few
lines of JavaScript so we import it we
import the node and then we append the
child and we're good to go so i'm going
to show you an inactive if this loads
okay so i've i've loaded this template
but i have not activated it yet so now
i'm going to open it up again oops come
on let me do this there we go and here
one thing to note is the media has not
loaded because there's a so even though
the page loaded first and then it
activated it it did not actually load
the image and so I prevented it with
this alert and now it's going to load it
so when I was saying that you this that
custom elements actually allow you to do
better performance it's not loading all
the assets until you need them but
realize that so you can preload the
assets if you do need them but it's a
good way to improve performance okay the
only part that was uncovered okay so
imports allow you to include and reuse
documents or just simply document
fragments because I could have put 16
templates in that element and I could
have just gotten done by ID it has to be
same origin and the dock and the import
share a window so window dot will hit
both of them but document dot is
actually just the parent document and
I'm showing this here which is the
importer is the parent talk or the
document and the import T is a document
current script owner document okay so
last we have custom elements so we're
going to get to wear to the point where
we just have the word name tag and so
this is a custom element it's very
semantics but it doesn't exist so we
need to create this element so that we
can do stuff with it we could actually
use just name tag and the CSS in most
browsers except for ie8 and earlier will
actually render it but it doesn't
provide us with
all the whistles and bells so when you
create a custom element there's two ways
to do it either just by saying name tag
you know creating your own element name
or by using an element that already
exists and that the prototype of that
element will be the prototype of this
custom element so this div is a name tag
it's basically extending the existing
element of div but you could extend a
button or whatever and if you do want to
create buttons with all the features you
might want to extend the button instead
of creating a new element so to create a
new a custom element the name has to be
two words you know I mean it could be
more I guess but it has to be all
lower-case and it has to create contain
that hyphen otherwise it won't work and
then you so that's step number one is to
come up with the name step number two is
to define its prototype and step number
three is to register it so the custom
element that you import you don't
necessarily need to import it but
because you can have in the page but
just to show that all of these four
features are used together the custom
element that you import creates a shadow
Dom from a template and then you
register it so why register a prototype
you get four features when you register
a prototype you get for callbacks you
get the created call back the attached
call back the detached and the attribute
change call back and they're kind of all
self-explanatory as to what they do so
to register an element you basically
just say register element and then you
give it the custom element name I guess
that would be in quotes and by default
that custom element will have the HTML
element prototype like just a regular
nondescript but you can actually give it
a specific prototype you can declare
which prototype you want so in this case
right here i created the prototype using
the video element and then you can
attach all these callbacks and just as
this example here i'm going to open this
in a new window and I created this
prototype of a static button doesn't do
anything
if I actually open up here and I go to
console you'll see that those callback
events were called it created a custom
element it was added it was created and
the attributes were altered and it was
added again because there's a lot more
JavaScript that I did if you did do a
few source just to make those happen and
we exit so that we can go back to the
talk okay in Equus Crips six and we're
not there yet you'll actually be able to
do a class my button extends HTML button
and you'll be able to do the the syntax
which is for some of you is much more
familiar for me I prefer the old style
JavaScript because I do I'm used to it
okay so then you register the element
you've created the element than you
register it and you just basically
document register of element and you do
my button and whatever the prototype is
you can do this is the default so you
could just leave this no this is not the
default the default is um I believe that
okay then you can create with a specific
you know the it can just be one that
exists or you can create a very long
prototype and then once you create an
element you can either create it you can
create a different element based off of
that element you can actually use the
prototype of an element you created so
you can extend your own elements so to
include it including these new elements
this is my favorite way of doing it it's
just saying my button and putting it in
my HTML but you can attach it with the
Dom as well okay and then here this is
an extended and it's extending button
which I prefer because it actually uses
the native features of the button
element in the browser the other way to
do it it sounds like it would extend the
the default of the browser but it
doesn't it actually just you have to
reattach everything to it so if you're
going to use something with a GUI you
might want to extend it this way
okay so I talked a little bit about this
i won't go into the depth about it
because we're running out of time but
you have unresolved elements you can
reach the shadow you can reach within
the shadow and you can target the
elements with CSS okay and you can
target the host context okay so what do
we have we have these name tags now that
we've going to register they have names
and roles we create a call back we
create the element and when it's already
in the document so you see here in my
HTML I have this nametag I have it three
times so unlike when we were using the
template right and we had to iterate
through it every time it hits the
element name tag it's going to run
through this so I don't want to have to
force it to loop it loops on its own
because every time it hits the name tag
it actually goes through this so it
creates a call back it creates the clone
and that's when it puts all the content
into that parent name tag so we went we
now have this as our HTML and this as
our output so I know creating a name tag
is not the most exciting thing in the
world but I want to create simple code
that you can go back to and actually go
and because this was a probably 30 to 40
minutes now instead was just 30 minutes
but that's why I went before lunch
because I knew we were going to go over
and this showed you how to do it so
hopefully like you understand the
general ideas but all the code and every
single is there and every single one of
these has the actual code example for
the example on the page so it's right
there you click on that and you're good
to go so that's basically it for my talk
but I do want to say this is the link
for it it's going to be up there forever
it might have a different look of a
different name tag is that one is just
really ugly and I might do this talk
again but here are is the polymer
project for a polyfill here is web
components org which is great articles
about web components and if you want to
follow me or do anything this is all my
contact information so thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
