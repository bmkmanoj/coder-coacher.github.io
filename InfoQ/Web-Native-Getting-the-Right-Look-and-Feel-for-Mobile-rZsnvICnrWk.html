sketch actually somebody else did but I
was the creative director at center for
the past three years how many of you
guys know sencha yeah all right how
about jqtouch I made that forever ago
all right yeah you're all kind of like
embarrassed because you're like that
that old thing but yeah I've been doing
some of this stuff in mobile making
websites that feel like apps for a while
now I killed it also just curious how
many of you guys were here about five
months ago we did something very similar
html5 def con Oh like none of your and
full I should have just repeated the
same deck anyway we're going to talk
about html5 I could get into the whole
stack thing and how we're approaching
native and you know that whole bit but I
guess I was kind of brought here to talk
about design so this is about design so
this is what the web used to be not even
that long ago like 15 years ago maybe
tops you know links were blue there were
brochures basically every every website
was the same thing it was a brochure
that link to other brochures and there
was actually something kind of nice
about it because it was simple things
were clear like a nap was something you
launched and you know how to function
and then this is where you got wet and
like read articles and you know looked
around now the web can do stuff like
this and this is a sencha touch app
which actually is also deployed in
phonegap but i'm showing it right now in
the browser so literally this is
something running in the browser and
it's a web app it's just HTML CSS
JavaScript
they made that whole keyboard in CSS a
number pad anyway you get the idea right
it's a bit different than them where we
were at 15 years ago and it's a bit easy
to see why there's this sort of
confusion over what is a web app what is
web what's native what's in between all
that so we're hitting a little bit of an
identity crisis I think I mean I think
most companies I talk to and work with
already have a brand issue already have
an image problem in one way or another
and to come into this you know sort of
app or mobile web world and face the
second issue of are we a nap are we a
website just compounds that problem so
in order to solve it i'm going to start
some of the basics some design 101 if
any of you guys started with like a
design background this will seem
familiar if not hopefully just shed some
light on what it's like to design this
stuff so first thing important to know
is design is language it is not made up
of words but rather symbols and colors
and things like that if you were to look
at stop signs from all across the world
you know you find some patterns you find
similarities in color and shape some of
them in fact are triangles they look a
little bit more like yield signs but but
a vast majority of them feel very
similar and this is kind of important i
mean this at some point even before the
huge digital revolution you know the
world as a whole decided it's important
that when people are driving to be safe
we have a consistent schema for how
these things look form follows function
how many of you have heard that before
yeah boring so this is like designer
speak as a way of saying if it doesn't
work first and foremost you know the way
you decorate it doesn't matter so much
this is a good example of that this is
you know the most successful ugliest
thing I could think of
you know they actually just mentioned
like a day ago or something they're
going to hire read it like a designer
and get a proper redesign hooray but uh
but it's pretty amazing that it's
remained this popular for so long
without even an API no less but uh yeah
there's people just screen scrape the
hell out of it but uh you know blue
links it's basically the same as the
first screen I showed right blue links
directory listings pages content but for
this type of thing it works bless you
and this is this is probably my favorite
thing and and I'm totally stealing this
from Hoefler frere-jones Jonathan
Hoefler gave a presentation like a year
ago talking about typography and how
form follows function and digital
typefaces and whatever and I'm totally
ripping that off right now but the
important thing is the idea of something
the concept of something is completely
different from the form the form is the
manifestation the idea of a to-do list
app has nothing to do with checkboxes or
things being crossed off the idea of a
to-do list app is a series of things
that you would like to do and your
ability to mark them as complete so in
this in this sense a website and a nap
both however you build it web or native
are all part of the form they don't have
to do with the idea and I apologize
without like the presenter notes I'm
just going to have to like see what the
next slide is and then wing it so to
take this a step further you add context
in context is sort of the filter that
turns an idea into the form and so if a
website or an app is our final form the
context is really the OS or the screen
that we're on you know right now the web
is seeing this huge revolution in that
it's it's in your TV's Google wants it
to be in your friggin eyeball you know
and then even on top of that if you look
at the web as accessed within a browser
you also have the OS to deal with
you know are you on iphone android iOS
android whatever and so if we go back
about 80 years at this point back to
some of the old sort of rock and roll
hatch hatch print posters you know
design at that time and knowing your
context and creating a forum meant
knowing the printing process super well
it meant using that printing process to
create some of these effects and knowing
your limitations and sort of embracing
those constraints bringing it forward to
today and sort of back to that to do
list metaphor this is things this is the
to-do list app i use it's pretty feature
full but also kind of clean it's kind of
along the GTD methodology but this is
almost you know a literal adaptation of
what you would consider it to do list if
you had a blank sheet of paper you could
pretty easily see throwing out some
checkboxes and you know writing down the
things you have to do they take it a
step further and sort of embrace the
idea aspect and say once you've
completed it to do that that item is of
much less interest to you so we're going
to gray those out this has nothing to do
with a real-world interpretation of you
creating a to-do list pen and paper you
know they gray out the check boxes they
had different color checkboxes stuff
like that on the flip side of this if
one was to take the idea of a to-do list
and really almost as andrew was saying
take out everything unnecessary take out
all the decoration you would end up with
something like clear clears a to-do list
app that launched on the iphone i think
it's been ripped off like 50 times so
far already by the way i took this slide
out but as i was doing some research
there are seven hundred and twenty to-do
list apps on the iphone app store just
saying don't enter that market so what
clear did was say we're going to
leverage gestures
to basically boil down a list to
seriously its most basic form you know
they add some of this color gradation
for style and effect but ultimately you
just have rose just rows of stuff that
you need to do and I guess you know I'm
just diving ahead so as web apps and
looking to leverage web technology you
know our context is growing daily again
with the Google Glasses thing we don't
know exactly where stuff is going to be
or what we're going to want to target
soon and also just to come back to that
to do this thing I'm not here to say
really which way is better than another
like I said I use things i love the
minimalist approach of clear but it does
have enough features from me and that's
kind of as an aside i kind of worried
about you know is the sort of uber
minimalist thing that's coming up in
Android and Windows 8 going to be enough
to support some of the more feature full
apps it's going to be interesting so
anyway coming back to context on the web
we have a completely dynamic context
basically once you strip away that
browser Chrome that whole sort of big
rectangle in the middle is ours to play
with you know if you were to think back
to I don't know amazon 10 years ago you
know we all made really ugly stuff like
all the time there's not a person in
this room who hasn't made an ugly
website at some point i would imagine we
kind of had the freedom growing up with
the web to do whatever we want if we
wanted giant glossy orange buttons we
made giant glossy orange buttons a nap
though for a while now has had this
other context you've always been given
this room to sort of play and you know
move around but but really an app has
always been much more bound to the OS
and tied in terms of the visual language
it uses to the OS and now we have a web
app and and again this is coming back
this is the identity crisis we're in how
much
of the native OS do we want to recreate
how much of our brand do we want to
utilize where do we fall in between so I
guess my most important message of
anything would be to know your context
and know where you're targeting know
where you're deploying and again as of
pure web app deploying through the
browser this is incredibly difficult and
you could almost say impossible to know
what the browser is going to be even if
you were to say smartphone for example
you know most of us think of a sort of
vertical rectangle right away right you
think either the iphone or one of the
billion androids but a lot of you
probably probably don't think about the
blackberry with the sort of horizontally
rectangular screen where now they have a
great web kit in there but you're still
constrained to about I don't know 500 x
250 pixels enough to see your top banner
ad so we have this scale right I'm sure
you guys have seen a million this is
like the most simple thing I could throw
together you know all the big players
use both sides a lot you know Twitter
Facebook they'll have native apps they
have web apps but really the importance
and I'm sure all of you guys get this
because you're here at an html5
conference the importance and the real
benefit is coming out of the html5 and
the website right now you know if you
wanted to make the devil's advocate
argument you could say what about
Instagram they did pretty decently as a
native app right i mean they were like
iOS only native only for forever but to
that i would say look at who paid a
billion dollars for instagram it's a web
app it's been a web app forever they
just launched within the past year they
launched their first native app which
was the ipad app and or the iphone app
and you know and they just came out with
a thing last week saying they're still
getting twice as many visits to
m.facebook.com
as they are to all of their mobile
native mobile apps combined so for
whatever it's worth if you are targeting
the browser if you're going straight to
the browser also i'll just take an aside
one of the benefits of coming up here
and talking for 20 minutes is i don't
have to have the whole answer and so all
this stuff these are just ideas to go
off of you know so i'm not going to give
you a final you know everything has to
be the hybrid app and built this way i
just want to look at how we use html5
and how we design with it so this i just
want to stop hearing the whole one web
thing how many of you guys have heard
one web as a thing or responsive design
really not a lot all right all right
well it's a big thing apparently you
know the big example lately is the
Boston Globe and so they redesigned
recently they use media queries now so
the cool thing is you know this is the
site that you get on the desktop and
then when you go to mobile you get
something like this all the whole thing
sort of reformats itself the nav
collapses into a menu button and for the
vast majority they do this with CSS and
this is cool it's a great technique it's
I kind of compare it to something like
CSS sprites it's a technique it leads to
best practices but it's not a solution
in and of itself ultimately this is what
you get when you're loading the Boston
Globe website if you are using an iphone
which has a pretty tall screen pretty
good pixel density that top part is the
screen that you see and then to get to
that article down there you scroll to it
and you know as an experience designer I
would say there are better ways there
are better ways to utilize your screen
space you know there this site came at
it from the approach of what are the
tools available to us and again as a
website that's basically reformatting
itself for mobile they did a great job
but to say this is the experience that
you should get on mobile
whether it's on the web or not is it
right because we can do better so this
comes back to some of that form follows
function stuff you should know basically
what you're doing and I didn't have
enough time to make good graphics there
so I'm just going to say no what service
you're providing and look at it within
the context of the industry it's
interesting to look at how people use
web apps in the browser verse apps or
hybrid apps that they get through the
app store if you are in news publishing
or or you're in e-commerce especially
people still put way way more value on
the browser interface you know I don't
have any good numbers but if you look at
the usage of ecommerce sites verse apps
it is still heavily heavily on the site
side whereas games even social sort of
in between fall more to the native side
another quick thing to note if you are
developing in the browser that browsers
impose the design language the the
design language of the OS that you're in
even in that 0 video I showed earlier or
twitter com you know they put in a
little JavaScript so they hide the
location bar right away but you're still
stuck with that little bar at the bottom
and you can never get rid of that thing
in the browser right so no matter what
you are going to have this light blue
glossy thing with recessed icons with a
one pic shadow heading upwards and it's
worth keeping that in mind and knowing
that that's what's going to be around
you at all times again context now if
you go the other way and you want to use
a native rapper you want to use phonegap
and get into an app store but use web
technology it's important to remember
that's too light every OS has its own
language has its own design language and
I highly recommend every major operating
system right now is actually getting
better
pretty much led by apple obvi at having
some form of interface guidelines and i
highly recommend reading them all if
you're getting into this field i will
fully admit I haven't read the
blackberry one yet but Windows 8 metro
Android for apples hig human interface
guidelines for iOS and everything they
all have great tips and great ideas and
there are a lot of similarities within
them people like to criticize web apps
because you know the mystery meat the
you know you're faking being native but
really at the end of the day that's up
to you to decide how much you want to
fake or not you know one quick example
would just be iconography symbolism you
know it's interesting that certain
symbols like the magnifying glass and
the trashcan are basically set you know
there's a few very subtle differences in
by the way if you didn't know android
for iOS and Windows 8 but search trash
these things are common and I think
because they've been around for so long
we've all kind of consolidated on them
interestingly enough share which is a
newer concept to the web or it's a
computing almost is the one that's the
most different that everybody's
basically thrown out an idea I find it
really odd that windows 8 went with a
gift when when they're going and I think
they're doing a phenomenal job but like
they're going for the most minimal you I
that has ever come out like the UI
language or system and so to go with a
whole like fake box with a ribbon I just
find surprising but uh it's also kind of
interesting to see the progression of
the bookmark icon how it's somewhat
relates to a book and then somewhat just
relates to a favorite a you know the
star so i have to give android props on
that one because i think the way they
mixed a literal bookmark in a star is
beautiful but anyway you're not here to
just
hear me talk about icons all day so
sometimes you know you could basically
you could take that example icons and
you're making your web app and you want
to wrap it up in phonegap and deploy
everywhere you could go through the
trouble of actually differentiating the
search magnifying glass based on which
operating system you're on you probably
don't want to it's I mean that's half
the benefit of the web is you know
cross-platform so you know one good
example and this is coming from the
desktop but we have modal's on the web
as wells or on mobile so modal's on
mobile so you know the important thing
is to take take existing concepts and
think them through this basically dialog
boxes have been a problem for desktop
designers for cross-platform desktop
designers for a long time because the
two main operating systems mac and pc
have always done the exact opposite
thing and they continue to do so the mac
will always put the confirm or sort of
the you know go ahead action on the
right and windows will put it on the
left this article came out I stole these
graphics from an article that came out
about a year ago talking about why the
Mac way is better now obviously we're
designer so like we all always think the
Mac way is better but the research they
did was very beneficial and and this is
what I would recommend you do when you
come across some of these circumstances
where there is no technically right
answer there is no platform consistency
to follow which is to think it through
so you know essentially if you haven't
gathered it already the the gist of it
is if you have the ok button on the left
you have to bounce back and forth if you
want to proceed basically because we
read left to right obviously this all
changes in different languages but we're
not going to get too crazy about it you
know so you have to you first look at
the ok button then you look at the
cancel button then you realize I want to
hit ok so you have to go back in terms
of you know your eye
enter the speed at which you can
comprehend things having the okay on the
right is better because you go in one
direction it also as a follow-up
represents the directions which are
going basically so right is forward and
left is backwards in addition to that
again this is basically sort of the top
point re illustrated as you're taking in
the whole design element all together
you're reading left to right and so
again it just follows your sort of
normal scan line and this is the kind of
research you know you should be doing as
you start to think about how you want
your app to feel across all the
different platforms all right so
skeuomorphism verse minimalism how am i
add on time just curious okay because
this one takes about an hour now this
could literally be its own thing
probably so for those who don't know
school morphism is you know I should
have gotten the fancy Wikipedia thing
but basically it's an artifact of visual
artifact of something that doesn't
actually have to exist within a design
you know Mac basically Apple has been
going crazy with them lately again I'm
not here to say what's right or wrong
you know so our address book on the Mac
is literally looks like an address book
as well bookmark thing you're kind of
like how is there a search bar in my
address book but you have the stitching
inside the middle and then to contrast
that and this is seriously one of the
most worrying and interesting things
happening in in UI design right now is
you have android for where an address
book looks like this you know basically
the complete opposite and and how you
mitigate you know that difference if
you're targeting both platforms is going
to kind of fall onto you just to
reinforce you know here's just windows 8
verse mac you have
on the mac you have a glossy 3d doc with
little glowing orbs to represent the
apps are on and all the apps have a
shadow and a very set angle that you're
supposed to be looking at the apps serve
like a 15 degree you know if you're
looking down on it it's very set and
then on Windows 8 you have some
rectangles and shapes and I don't mean
that critically I actually think it's
totally beautiful but uh but it's a
tough problem so my only recommendation
as if you run into this and you're
starting to battle start on the minimal
side it can be very easy to want to do
something like address book or you know
even GarageBand if you're going to get
crazier but the problem is you'll
probably end up with something like this
and that's just the last place you want
to be so really I am Flipboard I should
have included some more screenshots
because there are other good examples in
here but i would say Flipboard is
probably one of my favorite iOS apps
definitely I think the most amazing iPad
app out there but it's basically always
look like this which is interesting
because they really need a detail view
but essentially they use some of the
conventions from the OS that there are
on iOS meaning that magnifying glass is
the exact right magnifying glass for for
iOS but generally everything else is
custom and it's very minimal and there
is some texture in that little bookmark
thing that you can pull out on the top
right there there's a little sort of
ribbon texture there's a little shadow
to it and then everything else goes back
two rectangles and boxes and I think
that's like a really nice sort of mix
between form and function even the the
covers the way that they show this is an
RSS reader by the way of sort of for
those who don't know the way that they
put the titles on top of the photos and
all of the titles have this little three
pixel shadow black shadow underneath of
them that serves a significant purpose
if your photo was white you would not be
read the text you know on top of it and
so they add just enough depth so that
everything works and they can work with
dynamic content but again it almost
comes back to what Andrew was say it's
it's about just doing enough however on
again to present through the other side
of that to have some texture to have a
little ribbon to use skeuomorphism can
be a purpose in and of itself you know
our our purpose as an app isn't just to
function a lot of times it's to convey
an emotion a lot of times it's to make a
user feel comfortable with the
technology that they're not used to and
that actually is a big reason why I
think Apple has been using school more
so heavily especially in the ipad and
iphone world it makes these apps more
familiar off the bat and and less scary
too I guess you could say the sort of
very old or very young those who are
like new to computers or those who are
new to touch devices you know having
your address book feel like a book or
look like a book having ibooks where you
turn the page and it matches gives you a
feeling as you use it and that feeling
helps your user believe it or not and it
helps your brand last thing I'll point
out before I'm finished Twitter does it
really well as a couple things one they
set on a definitive we're going to use
top tabs only and that goes against the
iOS standard even on iOS as you load up
the mobile twitter site in your browser
the tabs are on the top which is
unfamiliar to most iOS users it's
actually the default for all the Android
users but it's still perfectly usable
and you could almost say I don't want to
like suppose I know what's going through
their heads but you could almost say
they did it because of the context as
well because they knew that they could
get rid of the top bar but not the
bottom browser bar and so now their app
is balanced they have a top toolbar a
bottom toolbar and the middle content
the other thing I'll point out is the
Home icon is
basically again a generalized acceptable
version of home you know which is very
common iconography that's established
but they turned it into a birdhouse to
import their brand into it and and sort
of made it a brand piece on its own they
don't go with edge-to-edge lists on the
mobile which actually I disagree with
because that's just everywhere and
there's kind of just wasting space it's
not really a brand thing to have a
little gray bar around everything but
anyway I'm just going to keep plowing
through so ultimately in conclusion
there is no answer this book by Mike
Montera design is a job actually is
completely not about what I'm talking
about it's about getting paid and stuff
like that but but I mean this is why
designers are here and hopefully this is
just shed if you need a designer some
things on you know what they should be
thinking about and and the type of
designer you want to look for so that's
it
