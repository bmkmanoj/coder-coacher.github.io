I'm also thrilled to see so many of you
here with me as Randy mentioned I'm
gonna talk a little bit about evolving
microservices architectures and I think
one way to start is to set the stage by
telling a story so this is March 11th
2017 earlier this year the place is
Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City and
this is the stadium for Kansas City's
major league soccer team the Sporting KC
it's a couple of hours before even the
earliest fan will come into the venue
but for the handful of psychic employees
that flew in from New York this morning
that morning this is an important day
it's also important for the team this is
the first time it's first of all it's
Kansas City's home opener for the 2017
season but it's also the first time
let's eek eeeek
traditionally known for secondary
ticketing will be primarily responsible
for ticketing a u.s. pro sports event so
see geeks history is for those of you
that don't know so start up here based
in New York City it's about 7 years old
its history is one of aggregation it's
traditionally been a source that knows
how to go to the markets and brokers
that have tickets and provide user
friendly ways for fans of concerts and
live events in general to obtain the
best tickets from wherever they may be
and recently within the last two years
seeking brought commerce onto its own
platform becoming in reality a secondary
ticketing market along with the likes of
StubHub and vivid seats and at the
moment is in a push to grow further
still into the primary ticketing market
the first sale for pro sports teams and
that was pushed a lot by about six
months ago or rather a little bit longer
now a deal with Major League Soccer
which made SeatGeek
its primary ticketing partner and
Sporting Kansas City was the first
client resulting from that relationship
so back to this empty stadium you know
at this point we had sold all the
tickets and this was the culmination
of something like six seven months of
hard work to retune an existing product
dedicated to the secondary market to
work in a completely different market
and if this were a commercial right now
I'd be saying something like
micro-services made this possible and
it's true in a way but let me ask a good
question how many of you have or work
with a micro services architecture okay
at least a third and how many of you as
a secondary question would like to have
a micro services architecture okay other
third so for the third of you that
didn't raise your hands there's a sort
of tongue-in-cheek quote that you
probably already have a micro services
architecture whether you want one or not
and as I said it's it's sort of
facetious but it's also sort of true in
the sense that all of our systems are
connected to other systems whether it's
payment or logging and I think it's
important therefore that we all have
some understanding of how to evolve our
micro services architectures in reaction
micro services are fundamentally about
change right it's as an architectural
pattern it's one that embraces change
and understands that change is going to
happen and essentially includes it in
the model as opposed to being too
academic about it and things that change
include maybe technology right
technology evolves you want to stay on
top of things you're using a new thing
right now than you were two years ago
and you'll be using a new thing two
years from now scale certainly causes
change the things the technologies that
worked in the prototyping phase perhaps
inappropriate for the hockey stick
growth phase and then organizations as
well as organizations grow Conway's law
comes into place that idea that systems
or organizations that design systems
design them essentially mirroring the
communication structures of the
organization so as the organization
changes the communication structures of
the architecture change and so one
question might be how does a micro
services architecture help in the face
of all this change and the answer is
that or one answer at least is that
Services is part of this brand or
category of architectures called
evolutionary architectures right this is
as I was saying something that has baked
the idea of change into it so it deals
with it rather than fighting it and
microservices tend to be organized
around capabilities this is you know
essentially something helpful in terms
of mentally organizing our thoughts
about what this what the architecture
should be and where the boundaries
should be but as I'm talking today and
I'll go into detail as I'm talking about
evolving a micro-services architecture
assuming you already have one it's more
than just architecture that we have to
talk about and I think that's the point
that I'd like to try and get across is
we're talking about architecture
certainly but there are also develops
concerns with evolving a micro-services
architecture and there are even strong
cultural concerns with evolving a
micro-services architecture and being
successful in that evolution involves
addressing at different points in time
each of those but let's start with
architecture all right
so quick review for those of you who
haven't been in the session in the
morning heard more about this micro
services are all based on the idea of
atomic components really well-defined
interfaces and communication over dumb
pipes or simple protocols right and this
idea of atomic components one capability
per component it's very very difficult
to get that right the first time if you
are transitioning from a more monolithic
architecture to a micro services
architecture chances are you're going to
get some portion of it wrong in the
beginning and so it's important to then
think okay
how do we change this let me give you an
example of an area where Sikhi can
encountered this this is an event ticket
okay as six or seven pieces of important
information on here you see your section
your row the event date time place but
it is remarkable how many different ways
that information can be represented on a
ticket and it's actually incidentally
one of the interesting things about
working in the ticketing space is that
things that seem like they might be
trivial in the end are actually
difficult technical challenges because
of the complete lack of standardization
in this industry but back to this ticket
if we wanted to know what section this
ticket represents okay this ticket says
F for a DA what section is this if we
look at the venue manifest for the same
event we see it's this one labeled F c4
alright and this is just a ticket from
one market if we have tickets as it a
great from many arc markets we end up
with a situation where lots of different
representations of the same piece of
inventory are need to be aggregated into
one common thing so that they can be
anchored correctly on our map and
displayed to users in a way that users
know exactly which seat they're getting
and we accomplished this through a
process called normalization or section
normalization and so to get just a
little bit more technical here this is a
cleaned up view of a portion of C Geeks
infrastructure architecture that
essentially reading right-to-left
represents what happens when a client a
user asks for available seats at a
particular event first step in this
organization is it hits us something we
call a listing feed who's responsible
for communicating with all of the
markets that might reasonably have
inventory for this particular event
those markets are actually communicated
with via specific API integrations that
we have with each of the markets that we
work with and those markets will return
us real-time information about what
seats are available at that point in
time but they do so using that markets
right you know terminology and so the
same section may come back from multiple
markets with a completely different name
and needs to be normalized so that's
something that currently happens in the
listing fee if we look here there's also
something labeled DQ which stands for
deal quality and as the name suggests we
make an effort whenever we get inventory
information from a market to assess the
quality of the deal from a user's
perspective how good is this value how
value-add is this seat compared to this
seat historically compared to the other
options available and we calculate a
score essentially again
because we're comparing this seat to
itself in other markets and itself over
time normalization plays a role and so
here's an example where Sikhi moving
quickly probably did something bad in
the sense that while the normalization
code itself changed infrequently it did
change and when it changed it was
essentially copied from the listing feed
component into the deal quality
component and we went on with our lives
but then we made the situation worse as
I mentioned at the beginning of the talk
we introduced this idea of consumer
inventory which you can think of as a
completely new market that is
individuals individually uploading their
own seats for resale okay so in order to
support this type of PDF based upload we
had to introduce a number of new
components but as you can see now we
have people uploading a PDF much like
the one I showed and they've got their
own section row seat information from
arbitrary sources so we need to parse
that information understand which seat
that user owns so that we can list it
appropriately again normalization so now
we had a situation where that same
capability needed to exist in three
different components so we had a choice
number one would be to duplicate that
functionality once again into this new
component that we were building number
two would probably be to promote the
capability into its own top-level
component and number three was to do
some sort of monkey work with the
listing feed to adjust its interface or
add a couple of new endpoints to expose
some portion just the normalization
portion of that service so that we could
consume it and you know it's it may be
obvious listening to it now that that
option to here is is is probably the
best way to go a long term but when
things get messy and deadlines are
coming definitely options one and three
are absolutely on the table but you know
we ended up doing the right thing here
architectural II and taking the
normalization capability and making it
its own first-class component of the
architecture and I think you know one of
the lessons here is avoid duplicating
capabilities thinking between components
right thinking in terms of capabilities
and trying to make sure that if
something and something else share a
capability then perhaps it's time to
treat that capability as its own
first-class citizen and one of the ways
we can think about how or when is to
consider the relative cost maybe it
didn't make sense for us to do that
months ago years ago when we just had
deal quality and listing feet but now
that we were obviously growing and a
significant amount of traffic was going
to come through consumer inventory we
needed to do it the relative cost of
waiting yet longer to make this happen
was completely you what drove us to do
it at this point
alright so considering the relative cost
of either doing the work now or putting
it off until later can help make the
decision a little bit easier another
architectural consideration is scale and
when we're talking about scale there is
a misperception among micro-services
architectures that because I have a
microservices architecture if I add
another component it will just work and
let me give you an example from hard
learned experience where that falls down
on its face again revisiting in this
part of the part of the architecture
you know we communicate with a number of
different markets great and they give us
information back about seats but as I
mentioned at the beginning of the talk
we are now moving into the primary
market where we ourselves are a primary
market for certain events and we knew it
was a big deal we knew also that we
weren't going to be able to build it
ourselves in the amount of time that
would be appropriate and have the
quality and so we made an effort to go
out and buy it by our problem away all
right so that's great we've got sixty
million dollars less and we've got a
world class reserved seating
season-ticket capable ticketing system
on our hands
so in principle at least that's fine
except this is a enterprise c-sharp
monolith that we needed to drop into our
essentially scrappy startup
micro-service architecture so a little
bit as to give you a sense of why I say
scale is the problem here because there
were many problems but scale is the one
that I'm going to focus on if you look
at secondary listings for any particular
event you see something like this it's
sparse any particular market knows maybe
1/2 percent at most of what's available
for a particular event but when you are
the primary ticketing system for that
event and you're about to set that event
on sale you know all the seats which
could be in some cases 50 60 70 thousand
listings coming back through your
primary ticketing system into your
system into your architecture and in our
case this c-sharp monolith was emitting
thirty to fifty megabytes soap messages
which because our in our interfaces were
clear and fine and that was good but
using dynamically typed Python to
consume messages like that was never
ever going to result in a performant API
so C key took its very first steps with
dotnet core I mentioned that and in
dotnet core is a fantastic piece of
technology by the way we're extremely
happy with it but it was just something
that we had no familiarity with
whatsoever the conversation between our
CTO and one of the engineers you know
the first first crack at it using the
wisdom generated two hundred thousand
lines of auto-generated c-sharp that was
something just outrageous for us
something we'd never really encountered
but the point isn't really that it's
that we needed we looked at it as the
solution to a problem which was we were
never going to be able to parse using a
dynamically typed language the type of
information that was coming out of this
system so we had three goals one we
wanted to encapsulate the soap suite the
rest of our architecture didn't know
anything about soap and we wanted to
sort of limit that too we wanted to
interpret the messages meaning the
primary ticketing system is oriented in
terms of seats because that's what it
knows but the rest of the markets think
in terms of listings groups of adjacent
seats that are spread out throughout the
system and so we wanted again to try and
see if we could
the messages from the ticketing system
to look a little bit more like what the
rest of the architecture was expecting
and then the third thing is to present a
standard interface all right so we're
gonna present a standard restful
interface that looks a little bit like
what see Keeks architecture might be
used to consuming so these were all the
goals and then these were supposedly the
capabilities that we wanted out of this
new component that we invented right to
sit in front of the ticketing system and
that's what we built we built this thing
called the SeatGeek open api which
basically lived in front of the much
more powerful but very awkward api that
this new component that we had just
bought presented us and what it allowed
us to do essentially was achieve the
goal of treating ourselves as just
another market but it had the additional
benefit of by making it public we were
then able to treat Sikhi as just another
one of many potential distribution
partners achieving one of the primary
goals of calling it SeatGeek
open the idea that anybody with an
innovative idea for incorporating
tickets to live events into their
offering might be able to have
essentially equal access to the
ticketing platform so you know capacity
planning call it what you will but it's
important you cannot just imagine that
your micro services architecture by dint
of being a micro services architecture
will simply absorb any component that
you have to put at it it is important to
think a little bit not just about the
interfaces but what you're gonna push
through those interfaces so switching
gears a little bit I mentioned at the
beginning that this is more than just
architecture and I think the you know
the talks in this session have touched
on this a little bit but you know micro
services as an architecture and platform
as a service as an infrastructure
paradigm they essentially go hand in
hand
let's face it if you've got and micro
services architecture all your
components spread out but you're
deploying them to a single line ode
instance you're missing out on a great
deal of what that micro services
architecture has to offer
see geek happens to interoperate an
internal platform-as-a-service
technologically it's based on Amazon Web
Services we use a set of open source
technologies like console for service
discovery and nomad for scheduling and
executing batch tasks and then on top of
that we layer a an assortment of open
source tools and homegrown utilities to
help us implement our continuous
integration pipeline our deployments so
Jenkins and Travis we are a little bit
unusual I suppose in that we build
everything to Debian packages it's
essentially a holdover from the way we
used to do it and we haven't yet changed
it completely but are in the process of
moving to docker and essentially what
this gives us is a couple of nice things
especially in the context of evolving in
architecture number one we have
independent deployments each component
is completely self-standing minimal
coordination required the component can
be deployed without any help from any
other components and there's no
synchronization necessary and we treat
our infrastructure is essentially
expendable no machine local state and we
deploy a lot the screenshot here is from
a two-hour period on a random day from
10:00 in the morning till noon and it's
something like 25 different deployments
so deploying is a consistent part of
operations at Sikhi all of it is
orchestrated though and how does it hang
together through essentially an
application manifest which is basically
a description of how this application
should be built how it should be
deployed how what environment variables
it depends on and all that information
is wrapped up in a JSON file that lives
with the application itself is owned by
the team that builds the application
that needs to be maintained and kept up
to date the ops folks basically just run
the scripts and it's important because
it gives the team ownership over how
their applications are actually
configured and deployed into the
production environment and the other
nice thing about having a consistent
format for this is that as you introduce
new technologies
and new runtimes that you've not seen
before it's actually possible this is an
example of one of our Python components
it's using pip to install a set of
requirements and the difference between
that and a dotnet c-sharp application
running on dotnet core is essentially a
difference in the build command-line so
as I was talking about how difficult or
painful it was to integrate the actual
component into the architecture from a
deployment perspective having a platform
as-a-service architecture from an
infrastructure perspective incredibly
valuable incredibly helpful in helping
us literally to absorb this component
into our system without a whole lot of
re-engineering and certainly without
impacting any of the other components
again from an infrastructure perspective
and I think the second piece of
infrastructure that needs to really be
considered and can be particularly
helpful when you're changing your micro
service architecture is the monitoring
been some talks about that already this
morning I'll just reiterate how
important it is to have a unified view
of a micro services architecture there's
a stack out there colloquially called
the tick stack which is basically an
acronym for the first letter of each of
its components this is not a seat geek
diagram this is open source software and
basically what it provides is collection
storage in a time series database stream
processing for alerting and
visualization and together those four
things because they're uniform across
the entire architecture provide a really
nice base for gathering the information
you need storing it in a way that can be
asked questions of now and in the future
and then also visualizing it to do
real-time alerting or react to it and so
see geek uses a slightly modified
version of this where we pull all of our
metrics from Amazon Web Services and
from our legacy metrics collection using
telegraph we write it into influx DV
which is essentially a time series
database
and then capacitor as I said provides
stream processing to identify anomalous
events that can be worth alerting on and
chronograph and Griffin I put together
options for visualizing these things so
to give you an example of what I mean by
visualizing the neat thing about the
system is that you can query it it's all
metrics based but you can clear it using
my sequel or sequel like queries and put
the results the resulting visualizations
next to each other in ways that help you
tell stories with your data or at least
be a little bit more clear about what is
happening in your system in real time
and historically we've found it to be
incredibly powerful in terms of being
able to go back and look at what
happened at a particular point in time
identify correlations between different
services try to figure out if one thing
caused another thing or if it was the
reverse having that information has been
a you know a lifesaver in more than one
occasion just as an example of what kind
of stories the metrics data can tell
this is an example of an on sale which
is for a concert it was done via radio
code that got broadcast over the radio
at 11 o'clock and you start to see
people at about ten fifty eight to 11
o'clock that knew the code already
trying it out it's not really working at
some point around 11 to 1102 the code
gets broadcast over the radio and lots
of people who are interested in the
concert come in to go take a purchase
and it tails off so all of this not
having any other source of information
being locked in a bunker somewhere you
get a sense of what's happening across
your system which pieces are working
correctly and which pieces are starting
to suffer under the load
speaking of suffering under load this is
the second story that we discovered
again shows the value of having this
this is relatively recent for seeking
I'd say within the last five months and
it's something that we've come to rely
on on a daily basis this is a story
about an eight-hour period leading up to
one of the Sporting Kansas City events
and it represents the number of times
that a user requested to download a PDF
of their tickets which is something that
we pride ourselves in not happening too
often because we focus on mobile tickets
and it was particularly strange
that in the hours and minutes leading up
to a game we noticed almost a 10x
increase in the number of PDFs that
users were requesting theoretically if
they're standing at the gate they can
just show their phone and they don't
need to download the PDF so what was
happening so this graph actually allowed
us to begin asking that question and the
answer was a little embarrassing it was
basically our mobile apps specifically
our iOS app was showing a PDF thumbnail
of the PDF and in the process requesting
the whole PDF from the service so we
during a time where we wanted the
systems to be nominal and not experience
a lot of high traffic we were sort of
ddossing ourselves and and we fixed it
and and and so the good part of the
story is that having this metrics and
being able to identify an anomaly like
this led to conversations that led to us
finding out what was going on so I think
the lesson out of this is essentially
having monitoring all over is really
something that can be valuable in a
micro services context where all of your
components are separate and points of
failure can really be anywhere so I
think the last thing to talk about of
the three is really from a cultural
standpoint okay and specifically I'm
talking here about alignment when c
geeks set out you know this is again
that whole idea of Conway's law right or
organisations that design systems are
constrained to produce designs that are
copies of the communication structures
of these organizations and it's true and
we got a first hand education in
Conway's law in the process of
integrating all of these new components
to try and build SeatGeek open starting
out things were positive and things were
going well but C key we started missing
a couple of our internal deadlines and
you know we care about these sort of
things and it was sort of there was the
result was a set of meetings set of
investigative you know poking around to
try and see why were we not delivering
as well as we thought we ought to be
and part of the reason was that despite
having a team structure that was
oriented around largely around
capabilities we didn't have a team
structure oriented around the
capabilities we wanted given this new
business all right so this is an
extremely simple view of see geeks
engineering and apologize if anybody is
watching and belongs to a team that I've
left out the point is that this is how
the world looked as a secondary market
before we tried to move into primary and
once we acquired this new ticketing
system we built a team around trying to
integrate that system into our existing
system so this team was responsible for
figuring out how to get this ticketing
system and make it work the challenge
with that was that making it work from a
product perspective involved aspects
that were the responsibility of each of
these other teams see geek open see
geeks check out needed to know how to do
fulfillment for primary tickets the
platform needed to adjust the way that
transfers and resales
were handled so that we could
accommodate communicating to our own
ticketing system instead of to a third
party market you know the mobile device
needed to show the barcodes correctly
and the web team had the biggest changes
of all because seeking as a company was
now dealing with things that we never
thought we'd ever have to deal with who
are season ticket members and why do
they need to manage their accounts well
there was a huge change to our web
facing product well the problem here is
that nobody owned all those changes
organizationally we had all these new
capabilities that we were building but
no one team was essentially responsible
for owning them and so in addition to
making architectural changes and in
addition to working on all of our
development and operations we needed to
rethink our lines of responsibility
organizationally in the engineering
department to accommodate this change so
we created a new team that we called the
greater sea geek open team much to the
dismay of the sea geek open team and
resent relized all of those
responsibilities that still existed but
had no primary ownership into the
primary domain of this team and we took
members from each of the teams to form
this so the domain expertise was there
and the responsibility was there and and
we began to start to hit our milestones
because the right people were thinking
about it and the right people were
responsible for the changes that need to
be made so I think one high level point
that you might take away from this is
that if you're going to evolve your
architecture if you're going down this
path it's not purely an academic
exercise that happens in a vacuum there
are real people and there's real
consequences to missing things and so
it's sometimes maybe it involves taking
another look at the organizational
responsibilities specifically around the
development and delivery of the
components that you've got I think any
discussion of evolution and change in
software is probably incomplete without
mentioning documentation it's it's
something that we all understand that we
need but it becomes incredibly important
in a microservices system and to the
extent that like the micro-services
mantra is you should be able to
integrate with my service without having
to talk to me because I've got these
really well-defined boundaries and
everything is is you know easy to
inspect that only works if the knowledge
that lives with the team is published
somewhere knowledge lives with the team
and that's fine but the reality is that
teams obviously change over time and
that knowledge gets diluted as people
leave the company or maybe a component
just works and nobody's touched it for
years if that is the case and there
isn't some documentation for it then
when it comes time to start engineering
change you're gonna have to rediscover a
lot about your architecture this is
something that Sikhi absolutely fell
into we are much better now than we were
at the beginning of this year we've gone
through an entire corporate push to
rediscover some things honestly about
our components see key
approximately 40 to 50 services in its
micro-services architecture that
together comprise our product and I
would say that in some cases there was
one or two people that knew some of
those services very well and in some
cases there were zero people that knew a
service very well and I think that's a
situation which is okay for a while it's
never great but it's okay for a while
until you start trying to change things
and you need to figure out well what's
the impact going to be what's going to
happen when I shove ten times as much
data down this pipe which component is
going to start complaining so it's
important to think I think you know one
tongue-in-cheek way to say it is that
your documentation needs to be highly
available in a micro-services
environment right I need to know where
to go to get it I need to know that it's
going to be comprehensive I need to know
that you know consistency among the
documentation is important it's really
an enabling tool for a team as a whole
that's in the midst of growth like C
geek is and like many of your companies
are I'm sure it's really an enabling
tool to have a centralized repository of
information that a new hire can come in
and say you know what I don't know
anything about this thing I know my
little corner what does it connect to
and how does that work and to branch out
from there so let me go back to March
11th 2017 empty Stadium as the time
started to draw near to where we would
finally let fans in to the to the event
a number of us were packed up in one of
the press booths where they usually do
the radio broadcast and everybody was
tense everybody was looking at their
screens wasn't an outlet to be found and
this is really as I said the culmination
of about six months of hard effort
organizationally infrastructure
architecture teams coming together
trying to make decisions about how do we
change this company's engineering
culture engineering architecture to
support this brand new business
opportunity
and so what I would say is that as the
stadium actually did you know we had
sold all the tickets we had connected
everybody we had figured out all of the
engineering challenges with getting
these people's tickets and barcodes to
show up on their phone the one thing
left was could we get them through the
gate would they would they come through
the access control or would we have a
riot on our hands and so the feeling of
going from that empty stadium to one in
which 17,000 fans excited to see their
team take the field and play their first
game of the 2017 season it was fantastic
as as I'm sure you can imagine you know
when when the national anthem played and
the Rockets went off I think it was a
big feeling of relief but also of
accomplishment and I think at least for
me personally I went around the whole
night feeling about like about like that
because it was the feeling of a lot of
hard work coming done and also to know a
little affect the feeling of knowing I
had a job on Monday because it had can
it had all worked so you know it was it
was very important and I think you know
I said at the beginning that
microservices made this possible and I
think maybe a more appropriate
constructive that would be we
microservices are the reason we could
even begin to think about doing
something as ambitious as approaching
the primary ticketing market by buying a
company and integrating it and doing it
all within six months and ticketing a
pro sports team from a company that had
never done anything like that
microservices absolutely made that
possible but it was the evolution of the
micro services architecture that that
took us to the edge more than once
but I'm convinced though that as a
product we're stronger
we're operationally stronger and
certainly as a company we are much
stronger for having gone through that
effort so my hope is that as each of you
take on your ambitious projects and
audacious goals that some of the lessons
that we've learned at sea geek with
respect to evolving arc
texture and working your architecture
and your DevOps platform hand-in-hand
and being willing to examine aspects of
your culture that may need to change in
sync with your architectural change hope
that some of those lessons will help you
of all of your architectures faster and
with fewer headaches Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
