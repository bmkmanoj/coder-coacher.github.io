home for me was the the real slide
that's something that's affecting me
currently for my love for cyanogenmod I
came from a motorola droid which had a
pretty decent support and it's 3g radio
was was all well and good recently moved
to a samsung stratosphere which is an
LTE device on verizon obviously the the
real has not been reverse-engineered etc
i was hoping you could maybe go into a
little deeper and see like what kind of
work were you guys doing in terms of
taking a chip manufacturer because i
know the the real on my phone is very
very very similar to the Galaxy Nexus
they use the same like it gets like a
via 3g radio and i think it's a samsung
specific LTE radio um i know there
there's been some source code that was
not released I think for the Galaxy
Nexus just that particular radio was
still kind of a binary or something I'm
not sure if I'm getting all this right
but I was curious what kind of work you
guys won't be doing to generalize work
for for certain radios like like an LTE
radio or you know some some new 3g radio
that might come out okay first off
that's the cdma radio right that's a
cdma device yeah figured as much uh cdma
is a bit of a mess and when I say a bit
I'm well not a bit it's quite a huge
mess actually to the point that Google
now appears to be disavowing all
knowledge and relations with with cdma
devices if you pay close attention to
what you're doing with the Galaxy Nexus
and even with an xss they've moved the
software images and the proprietary
packages to an archive section and it
stopped releasing stuff for cdma so
broadly
as far as LTE goes we support it pretty
well currently with GSM CDMA we are
currently dealing with it on a
case-by-case basis especially because
you don't really have even though gsm
appears to work the same way with every
gsm carrier the cdma carriers especially
in the u.s. sprint in particular is
particularly and being redundant Sprint
is is pretty hard to deal with they have
a lot of weirdness going on with their
with their devices the whole concept for
instance of having an LTE device without
a sim card is if you told me three
months ago that it was going to happen I
would would have told you it's
impossible so there's a lot of weirdness
going on there and CDMA is really being
dealt with on a case-by-case basis we
ongoing work right now in cm9 the gs3
devices the samsung galaxy s3 s4 sprint
and verizon and evo LTE for instance on
sprint are being actively worked on and
part of the trouble is coming from the
from the rail because Syria will be
became the whole radio interface took
some weird turns between Gingerbread and
ICS we've managed to work around it
Steve mentioned it earlier we subclassed
a real to a point where we actually have
something that works very well for gsm
cdma not so much yet we're it's it's an
ongoing thing right now so do feel free
to come by San janma dev
the people working on the CMA cdma
devices are there and I'm sure we can
pull some information and get something
running but again it's being dealt with
device by device because as far as we
can tell no two devices are the same hi
my question concerns security how does
the security on a cyanogenmod build
compared to the official builds or to
the AOSP builds well compared to the
official belts you'll probably find that
we're way more secure you're not going
to pick up a cm device it's running the
latest version of CM and run one click
root on it it's not going to happen
we're always up the game with the latest
code we we know we pull in whatever
fixes for whatever CDs we find you know
we are actually in contact with some of
the security people from google so we
keep it up to date as we can you know
that said and we also provide root
access so recently in cm9 we also
provide the capability of turning off
root access so if you don't want to use
it you have no need to use it you can
turn it off and no problem it's not the
default the default is that apps can
still get root but they'll be prompted
but you can't just plug in a USB cable
and get rid on anymore so my team we
were working on a project we were doing
a custom build off of AOSP for some
specialized hardware and so we got the
beefiest server we could get the
beefiest machine and started doing our
modifications to AOSP and it would take
us about an hour to do a full built so
what I'm wondering is you guys what you
guys create nightly builds for I don't
know like almost 100 devices what's
what's your build infrastructure how
does that work it's actually a rack of
servers it's sitting in my garage
yeah i'm yeah i'm not even kidding so I
mean they're there they're pretty
powerful machines you need a ton of RAM
to build the latest version of Android
you need like 20 40 gigs of RAM at least
yeah I mean unless you want to wait
around for an hour if you want to go too
fast you need delegate ton of ram and
you know the more CPU is the better but
the build system itself isn't totally
perfect you know like when the contacts
app is building it's going to take five
minutes to go the context up because the
apt is in multithreaded you know that
part kind of sucks but there's there's
other tricks you can do like you can use
see cash see cash will speed things up
you know if you'd have an SSD you can
put your out there on SSD that'll speed
things up some crazy people actually put
their out there on ram disk you know
because because they have 64 gigs of ram
that they don't care about um you know
our build servers they can they do the
building about um they do about it about
10 minutes yeah it actually takes longer
to upload it from my crappy connection
in my garage you know to the mirrors
then it takes to build it if you use the
standard like Google build scripts for
AOSP or do you have some custom build
scripts mostly as far as the bills
themselves go yeah it's pretty much
Google standard stuff the only thing we
did have to modify was the environment
setup because it's where it works fine
when you have a handful of devices but
while doing cm7 we have about 80 devices
on the tree and the whole process just a
process of setting bootstrapping the
environment took about 10 minutes so we
we had to redo the levels dropping stuff
but the building itself yeah it's it's
pretty much standard standard Google
at one point you mentioned having sony
ericsson help you out with camera issues
and drivers and stuff i'm kind of
curious now you have numbers like two
and a half million users at least
submitting or using your builds i see it
starting to see more support from
vendors like sony ericsson or even you
mentioned security help from google
stuff like that yeah I mean it's a it's
a pretty big number that's that's
running cm and in other custom roms in
general so I mean there there's really
no choice but to kind of take it
seriously you know cuz I you know as far
as Google is concerned if there's not
really a they don't really have a work
in relationship or anything like that
but if we're talking about merging
security fixes yeah you know they'll
help Assad whatever its kind of as far
as vendors go and Sony Ericsson has been
very very cool with us Samsung has sent
of stuff LG's done stuff with us so I
mean really you know these are their
engineering departments and they love us
i think we're awesome now their product
planning and their marketing teams they
might not think the same thing so and
nothing's really on the record hi my
name is avi and I'm from the Bangor and
we do as a group so you just said like a
lot of LG sort of likes you guys right
so has there been any effort to come
pre-installed on a device or has it been
like meh whatever yeah there is but what
it really comes down to is that
everybody's making that it's making
these hard with this hardware um they're
trying to build their own brand they're
trying to build TouchWiz they're trying
to build optimist or trying to build
sense hey they're not interested in
having another LS running on there but
you almost have it two and a half
million user base right isn't yeah
that's not exciting for them i I wish it
were more exciting
you know um I III would really like to
see something like that happen I would
really like to see a CM device or you
know something that's built just for it
but it's it's difficult I mean there
there's even more concerns than that you
know these these these manufacturers
there they're well versed and things
like patents you know there's a you know
whatever sort of intellectual property
is involved I mean it's it's it's more
than just a technical issue I'm a sound
designer and I was wondering the best
way to contribute audio resources to see
antigen to the themes where where would
I go to to do that audio resources or
audio code all your resources are your
resources well I mean we're always
thinking you know ringtones and things
like that one of the things that I
actually proposed like a month ago is um
like to see an audio manager in cm so
that you know you can do things like if
you don't like the notification tones
and all that stuff there's not really an
easy way to change those right now and
I'd like to see like a little manager
type app for that but we haven't done it
yet so um you know in the in the short
term we're not going to change that
stuff but in the long term I do want to
change that and you know have stuff that
you know if you want to make an audio
theme or whatever and make the click
sound different stuff I definitely want
to do that ringtones and stuff you can
just upload in the garret or you can
grab one of us on on IRC if you don't
wanna do that and just give us a link um
yeah you know basically just track some
killer business cartoon you know hi um
is the core team like any push to
include in the Naaru to chain to BOS Ang
Mo
ok so the linaro toolchain and there are
actually two sides to that one is that
even though linara did an excellent job
with the toolchain itself we're
basically talking about an optimized
version of GCC 474 arm what lennar did
that was actually way beyond that was
that they went into the Android source
code and fixed a lot little of little
issues that existed there that prevented
recent versions of GCC from working we
have been merging that parts of the
linaro work we the RC one that Steve
mentioned of cm9 already includes a fair
bit of linares changes to Android itself
that allow it to be compiled with more
recent versions they don't have any
effects on themselves so you are not
going to see optimizations coming out of
these changes and actually using another
tool chain is something that will
probably take a bit longer I mean we
really want to from our our experience
this far that will change or the changes
needed in order to use that tool chain
somewhere in there something in there is
creating issues for specific bits of
hardware the camera on the Galaxy Nexus
for instance gets kinda messed up or
non-functional at all was oh I think it
was Tony Slayer that that was playing
with that GPS and some other devices is
also broken so there are still a lot of
stuff that needs to be tested and we
basically need to test it across the
board because even though linaro tested
it on the pan abort it was a very
specific piece of hardware and doesn't
really cover
all the stuff we need to support so
first we're just merging the changes
into Android and make sure that they
don't break anything we actually already
had 22 fixes to submit to linaro about
that and then we'll try try and see if
we can update the toolchain even if we
don't go to the narrow tool chain itself
we hope to at least be able to use GCC
for dot 6 which is much better in terms
of generating arm up codes in when
compared to the current for that for I'm
not a developer room just a user but I
have a cushion um back in cm9 like the
early nightly builds trebuchet you still
have like an icons option so my question
is is trebuchet gonna support icons like
natively before like a TW used to or
well we have the full theme engine so um
really we rather see you use that I
don't think there's any plans right now
for for for that it's kind of meant to
be a lightweight launcher with some
extra options so there's probably going
to be themed support I mean maybe he's
got that on the on the road map and I
don't know about it but yeah I mean yeah
it might just be easier just to steves
of Famer and it just includes the icons
out of curiosity when you are ready and
support for the new phones how many
devices gets broken in the process well
not many um it's it's really hard to
break the stuff now there's been recent
issues with certain devices where you
know there were some leith kernels out
there that if you were to format the
cash with these leaked kernels it would
break your device yeah that's that's
really bad well you know it's late code
you know you get what you deserved but
it happened to a couple of people but in
the development process that it doesn't
really happen I mean for the most part
it's pretty recoverable and you know
depending on a depending on your own
your knowledge
of the hardware what one person might
see as a brick might not be a brick to
somebody else um you know unless you you
know unless you run it over with your
car something did you also mean when
we're bringing in code for a new device
how many other devices does it break is
that one of the things you're asking to
at that if we were to bring it in
without setting things up specifically
for those devices then yeah I would
probably break almost everything else
that's why I mentioned earlier if death
thing and many other methods that we use
for narrowing changes down to specific
devices so that it doesn't break
everything when we bring them in yeah
there's a maze in there if that's two
separate one thing from another and you
know we'll do things like put guards in
the in the in the make file is to make
sure that you know if you're building
for MSM 8660 you know you're not going
to possibly include khodro map so yeah
you know we try and we try and keep it
separate but it happens from the
timezone so after uh after servers are
doing this do you feel like Android
development is getting more kind of open
or standardized or less so like um you
know or is it just kind of like a watch
like suddenly everyone's using a similar
real but six months from now you'll be
dealing with the fact that everyone has
their own NFC implementation um I mean
you mean as far as I'm like running apps
on CMR yeah it's kind of like this work
like a wrist engineering um all these
proprietary extensions getting easier or
harder um well I guess it's kind of
staying the same in the beginning it was
really hard now there's just a lot more
of it but its more common and it's kind
of um some of the rate of change has
slowed down like when you go from like
MSM a 662 msm8960 platforms you know
they're different but a lot of the code
works the same so you know if they take
too deep but
kinda what I said before like once you
give one device working you'll get a
whole bunch of others going and certain
subsystems are kind of the same and like
a cross vendor it's like audio like if
you get audio working on on a platform
you have a pretty good idea how all the
audio for all the devices that event or
supports is going to work now at the low
level it might not work the same way but
the high level the concepts are the same
so you can figure it out so it's getting
bigger but I don't think that it's
getting more difficult first of all
thank you very much for helping to start
and maintain an awesome community and
has been said enough and it needs to be
said more so thank you for that question
I have in your slides you had a lot of
things that you were discussing that
we're pain points problems things that
obviously made it hard for these things
to develop to new devices and obviously
the boot loaders are a constant source
of weeping and teeth grinding in the
community but from a from a development
standpoint what do you think is is the
greatest blocker to moving things on to
new devices into new chip sets and
things like that time really um you know
we're starting to see kind of with the
last question um and we're starting to
see less enormous changes going forward
there's not any radical shift select
from one chipset to the next you know
they're starting to kind of work the
same and things are starting to solidify
and they're kind of starting to do
things the same way so yeah
at the same time we're also starting to
see new players getting into the chipset
market we I mean Android started out
with the g1 and the few following
devices it was all Qualcomm I think the
first different one was the motorola
droid which came out with a TI chipset
but still both Qualcomm NT I have been
the different extents but have been
pretty open with what they do I mean the
reference called for their reference
designs exists it's out there you can
use it not always complete but you can
for the most part figure out what you
need to complete that the I won't call
them up starts but the new guys and
coming into the markets I'm not sure if
they're trying to get their footing or
trying to figure out how things work or
in some cases and I'm seriously not
trying to generalize but silicon vendors
like allwinner or rock chip and a few
others coming out of Taiwan and China
are not as forthcoming with our source
code as calm and Ti and as we see new
especially tablets come up with those
chips we're still not quite sure how
we're going to deal with them I mean I
think old Weiner has in the meantime
published a bsp about a month ago we
still don't have anything for the rock
chips and then there's the case of
nvidia which i think most of you saw the
video from Lena's
so yeah they're pretty much the despite
their polite but pointless response
their positioning in mobile is pretty
much the same as the it is on on desktop
I mean yeah we support all the chips and
we are everywhere but if you actually
want to do something with those chips
that is not what the vendor gave you and
you don't have a commercial relationship
with NVDA you're screwed so Steve it
came out a little while ago that you
were hired by Samsung so just wondering
is Samsung paying you to work on
cyanogenmod and does that mean the
Samsung going forward is going to be
more open with their code or you can
have more access now it has it has no
relationship you know I I just it's my
day job that you software engineering I
do work on phones and tablets but you
know as far as cm goes yeah they think
it's cool they're not paying me to work
on it maybe I have a little bit of pool
on the inside and maybe I could throw
some ideas around but you know it's I
don't have as much influences I would
hope you mentioned the racks of gear in
your garage and I was wondering do you
have any sponsorship did you buy all
that hardware yourself or is it donation
based or we bought that hardware from it
was all donations um we we pretty much
outgrew what we had before well the
hardware that we were previously using
for builds we had some a massive cluster
at it was some you know used for
academic research and we lost access to
that so for a while we weren't actually
doing nightlies or we were but they you
know they were actually more like
weeklies so you know we ask community
for some help and we got a ton of
response it was completely awesome we
actually had to say you know please stop
giving us money because I'm scared
we have a bunch of money really quick we
bought a bunch of the answer is from
Dell and they're running in my house
until you know chriskiss he
infrastructure up at hurricane electric
and we ship them out there we also do a
sponsor's I have a fancy Mike we have a
there's a company called bite mark that
has donated a couple dedicated servers
to us that are actually in the build
clusters well and then we have an ISP
called reflected net that donates a lot
of bandwidth to us and if anybody here
has access to massive bandwidth we
always need it we usually don't take
mirrors unless they're at least a
gigabit on gigabit ethernet and you know
willing to let us use a gigabit but yeah
so we it's kind of a little bit of both
what about with phones do ppl donate
phones or do do any of the major
companies donate phones or is it mainly
just people hacking on their own stuff I
mean it happens from time to time we all
think we get offers all the time people
saying oh let me buy you guys a phone
and this and that but we don't want to
take somebody's hard-earned money in the
form of a phone and then not be able to
actually get signage Ramon running on it
so I think usually it's just whoever
goes out and decide so I want this phone
i also want see I'm on it they're going
to make it work have you guys ever
thought about forming a nonprofit
organization to make donations easier or
anything like that oh I don't know how
to answer that I mean it's kind of
something we constantly talk about so
what's the ETA st yeah um I mean we're
there's there's a lot of things that
we're not sure about that you know
whether or not we're allowed to be doing
certain things that we do and we're
doing them anyway so yeah when one of
the problems we've accepting donations
in the form of devices or 2i device
is that there's an expectation that we
will then deliver something we're still
not sure we will be able to so for the
most part we tend to politely reject
offers for that kind of hardware because
it's really hard to be absolutely sure
that you will be able to deliver and you
never know so we did have some hardware
given to us by the manufacturers
themselves sony ericsson samsung and LG
that i know of have all donated hardware
to see em we have some very very few
cases of people who have accepted
hardware for the specific phones to work
on but they are by far the exception
what we much rather have is a developer
donate their time with one of those
devices in order to work on doing it and
it's been mentioned before where we're
very accepting to contributions to the
project when I started doing this I
started working with coach on the the
original droid he was working in the
platform side and gotten very far along
but needed somebody with working on the
colonel side so I start working on the
colonel side and donated some time for
that and and we got the original droid
supported quite well for a while there I
then switch over to a viewsonic tablet
that had come out and I worked on that
that was probably the first full device
that I had supported and everybody is
very helpful in helping me get the code
submitted helping everything get
integrated into cyanogenmod itself and
get it up and running since then I
haven't had a whole lot of free time so
my time has been limited which is why
the current device that I support is is
one of the ones that are unlocked and
available mostly in AOSP so it makes a
lot easier for me to put my time into
that one but if somebody has free time
in the coding knowledge please we'd love
to have it
assuming assuming that you know you you
guys want to grow this community will it
take you know to overcome all these
challenges in hits you know 10 x or 20 x
essentially 20 40 million users what are
the kind of here to prioritize these
these you know stumbling blocks how well
you know won't be the first three for
example you would like to overcome my
guess is awareness you mean and we also
need to not only make people aware of
what we're doing we also need to get
your interested to maybe do it in the
first place unless we're actually going
to ship on something that you can go to
the store and buy um because right now
the current state of things is that
you're buying a I mean you're buying it
appliance you know I mean in your you
know you're buying a car with the hood
welded shut on it so you know there's um
before we can move on to you know 10 x
or whatever I mean that I I think the
idea is more to make it known that yeah
you know we're actually two influential
force you know in the industry I mean to
Neverland users I mean ok so maybe were
you know Oh point one percent or
whatever but still i mean it's it's it's
non-trivial i mean anybody would love to
have to nap million users so the fact
that everybody wants to do these kind of
things and they're really loud about it
and you know maybe they're they're
actually making their their purchasing
decisions based on that i mean that's
that's what we need to do i mean you
know if if one company is going to lock
all their devices on I mean you know we
need to make it known i mean you know
don't buy that stuff i mean that's not
in your best interest they're not acting
in your best interest at all I mean
that's the best thing we can do if we
want to grow our numbers um what about
obviously all the all the parties all of
it you know to have vested interest in
it's like for example Google what could
they do to help you guys out in the
future like is there anything that they
could learn from what you do like in
supporting this
devices things that you could
potentially or they could you know allow
you to contribute back into the project
to allow you know more levels of
abstraction they could potentially make
it easier to support these devices
already open to this that would be
awesome but I think that if they were to
do that with us they would they would
kind of be playing favorites against the
companies that are actually giving them
money right so maybe you know they tell
us something that's on their road map
but they don't tell HTC and HTC goes and
implements it and they ship it then they
have to do you know and mr to the next
version and something they can't do it
and it takes him an extra six months
because they need to you know change the
file system format or whatever the heck
they did because Google one and did the
same thing that they did what they did
it differently or they have to take that
feature out so I I don't know um I don't
know how to build a better relationship
there okay so if you don't mind me
asking more questions um what are you
kind of you know given that you've been
kind of playing in the dirt for so long
what do you expect from Android going
forward in terms of the ecosystem or
Google or the platform anything that you
could kind of any any predictions you
could make you will probably start to
see it on more things I wouldn't be
surprised if you sir to see it on
desktops the thing that I'm afraid of is
the sort of idea that it's kind of
enabled and thats tennety is that maybe
it's okay to you know to sell general
purpose computers as appliances and and
you know everything is locked down you
can't change anything and everything
that it can do you know it's it's
actually been limited so that's that's
kind of
backwards to me I'm afraid that that's
sort of what it's enabling so I hope
that there's more of a push forward from
you know groups like us and just general
users saying that you know this is what
we actually want not you know this is
what we're just going to take what you
give us I have to see more of that um
what do you would expect from MIPS in an
Intel you know now they're kind of
getting to this market in terms of
challenges or opportunities for them to
better support you guys any anything I
don't really follow moves I mean I think
in Tulsa contender I haven't seen
anything that's impressed me yet um
other than like tablets with fans and
weird stuff like that but but in terms
of like you just support do you think
it's going to be easier to support until
these devices for example yeah I don't
see why not I mean as far as like
running Android on intel i mean you can
do that now that that's that's not
that's not an issue going forward i mean
there's no reason why intel shouldn't be
it they shouldn't be a player in this
market i mean there's no reason why fur
that they're not there already other
than they really want to maintain
compatibility with you know the x86 and
everything like that there's all the
errata doing that um yeah I that's I
like to see it happen sure but I think
for now I mean even from like a
technical level if you've ever looked in
x86 assembly versus arm assembly arm
actually makes sense I mean it's
actually really it's actually really
alien I mean it's it's a yeah it really
doesn't make sense Intel is kind of
building on lots of legacy stuff i mean
i think in mobile its kind of biting
them in the bud and one last question
how do you guys in you know know where
you know like what else do you guys do
where your day jobs this this sort of
stuff isn't will document that it says
you know all the challenges you have to
overcome you get you know some sort of
support from the end
years from his vendors you just spend
nights and weekends you know figuring
this salad by going through the source
code how do you guys you know do what
you do I think all of us just started
learning it ourselves I mean I've always
kind of had a self-starter attitude
that's when I first started using
internet I didn't really know much about
it I just kind of delve into it I I had
been working in in software development
systems engineering things like that for
you know a time before that and that's
how you do is a day job I think that's
pretty much what all the students at a
job is you know we all we all work in
that field somewhere but this is not
really and there's no company out there
that's telling us how you know how to
learn this stuff we're just taking it
apart and figuring out how it works
because we think it's cool to do but do
you get any any help from the engineers
other than you know rotating devices do
they ever tell you oh this is how this
particular Paul is supposed to operate I
never have I have yeah I have as well
but it's I don't know it just kind of
happens post a question on google+ and
paying a couple people in our network at
Google and all of a sudden there's
people commenting and telling me what's
wrong with this app I'm trying to write
or something like that so it happens but
not that often it's not that there's a
formal channel for it to happen but I
guess we managed to get followed or
follow or make acquaintances with a lot
of people that are either at Google or
in vendors or just spending nights like
we are and have ran into into the same
problem before so we do get help from
sometimes very strange places but yeah I
have one question is that
kind of driving people towards good
Hudler that trance I imagine so what are
your recommendations like what are some
good vendors did I mean I don't want to
kill to like okay I spoil your
relationship with other matters but kind
of white what's your recommendation I
think we'll try not to get the guy who
works at a vendor too so does any of you
Nexus devices are the easiest ones to
maintain these just ones to unlock the
easiest ones to relock the ones that are
supported in that way that make it
really easy for you to be able to
install custom code are the easiest for
us to deal with this isn't exactly a
position we have as as a group I I don't
think we ever tried to approach it as CM
but a lot of quite a few of us have a
long time talked about it in Twitter or
G+ or whatever and I think the consensus
is that if a company if any particular
hardware manufacturer repeatedly tries
to prevent us tries to prevent you from
putting whatever L you want in your
device why do you keep buying no rule
you're not you're not slow k likes
cranked up it's okay those guys or cdma
the radios but that's a completely
different story especially here in the
US but motor those guys are not a vendor
I would recommend HTC isn't one either
even though they are very very popular
the whole bootloader unlock thing Steven
briefly mentioned it earlier that it
works for some it doesn't work for
others it doesn't quite do what we
needed to depending on opinions it what
they're doing right now goes from
paying lip service to being perfectly
fine I honestly don't think that a
solution that doesn't really allow you
to update a phone unless you plug it
into a computer and that's what the HTC
unlock does today you cannot update a
phone unless you use a USB cable and
plug it in the computer if we have an
over-the-air infrastructure for updates
and we're working on that by the way no
no ETS but if we have an over-the-air
updates infrastructure we could not be
using it for HTC devices because you
cannot write software from within the
device itself so I think you really show
as consumers we really should pay
attention to what any given company has
been doing before we decide to buy if
you want to hack on a device I'll go
with Beckett suggestion go with the
Nexus if you want to support a company
or don't want to support a company go
with our history really at the end of
the name samsung or sony ericsson you
said that samsung had given you some
devices and i was just wondering which
ones and and i guess you kind of already
answer that how easy or difficult is it
to work with the Samsung devices then
kind of similar now that Google is
bought Motorola DX is there any evidence
that maybe there'll be a little less
annoying I have no idea what Google is
doing with Motorola I mean my suspicion
was to build set-top boxes but you know
for Google TV but I really have no idea
what they're doing there I uh I don't
know if they'll have any sort of
influence and changing the way that
Motorola does things are not well thank
you so much guys appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
