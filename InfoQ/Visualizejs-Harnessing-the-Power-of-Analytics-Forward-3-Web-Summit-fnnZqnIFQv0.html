many people here in the room today I you
know what I'm really going to be going
over is tibco Jasper sauce analytics
engine that allows you to power data
visualizations reporting and also you
know you're doing a lot with actually
being able to control the analytics with
the engine so to give you some idea
visualize digest that's typical
jaspersoft has has this JavaScript API
that allows you to take what you're
doing with this back-end so you've got
your you're connecting to your data
sources whether it maybe Cassandra
Hadoop MongoDB and then you're very
easily able to make the connection so if
you're using d3 you really have a front
end but I mean we can connect to that
but if you're using jaspersoft what's
thus allowing you to do is to actually
have an entire engine behind that so
it's really your hub for connecting all
your data sources creating that meta
data layer so you're creating doubt over
your data and it's able to really so you
don't have to update or change your
actual data underline and then you have
your authentication on that so if you're
doing analytics and you're trying to
show your data this is perfect because
this allows you to do all this so you
have your business user maybe or someone
who's building your reports your data
visualizations here and then you have
your developer here who can with using
visualize jas embed that directly into
their application seamlessly so let's
just take a quick look at what is
visualized ijs so visualize digest is a
JavaScript framework that allows
developers to quickly and
cost-effectively and bed those analytic
components so an example of this and
I'll actually go to a demo I don't want
to spend too much time on demos so much
is on actual code but here's a front-end
application for an example so here we
have this food delivery service and so
what we wanted to do is we actually
create some pretty simple visualizations
and we did this using jaspersoft studio
which then you can of course those
things you build a studio you put right
into the server
so my first visualization is a brand
chart and so that was embedded into the
page using visualize jas but what's
happening is actually controlling
another entire report or chart or
visualization below it so then that
visualization updates based on what the
user wants to see so what this is really
for is to allow the end users of the
applications to be able to do analytics
to be able to be empowered to do more
than just see what you maybe you put up
there statically so if they wanted to
change a chart type they can do that and
then with the HTML you know with
JavaScript you can then because this is
all being done with JavaScript to
visualize da GS you can pass parameters
back and forth so whether it's going
into the report or out of the report
it's opened up it's not like an iframe
obviously right so you've actually got
the ability to do a lot more with that
let's look at one other pics a couple
others so here's an example of your pass
seen you someone built this
visualization in the business team and
your embedded into the application for
them so what we're looking at here is
you're actually using the visualization
that's been put out there with a Jasper
report server and it's controlling
what's in application so you were do you
do that with visualized i Jes I'm going
to show you some code in a minute here
another use case would be you know say
end-user embedded the mapping into their
application so then you have the power
to pass the parameters from this
department that's updated by city and
then the end user could just say okay I
want the lowest price for that
particularly so just that fast they've
selected their city if selected the
department and then they've got the
pricing that they want so the power of
this is that you give the end user a lot
of ability to control these things then
the nice thing with visualize the judge
is is that the exporting features are
built in so you don't have to go out and
rebuild that or construct that that's
there and it's simplistic code for doing
not so with that kind of quick demo and
I can demo more later as well you guys
can come to the booth there's a lot more
I could show you on the server
particular I'll just go into that really
fast here I want to show you an example
of so this isn't studio so studio you
would maybe be doing more finite
detailed things but this is actually our
ad hoc editor so if you need to pull a
chart in or remove a chart you know say
I want to delete this chart pull this
one up you know then we're going to save
this thing save that dashboard and then
we'll go back to the application and you
notice here I'm login because this is
based on authentication so depending on
who I login as that's going to change
what you can see at the data level let
me do that again
okay so the first visualization that way
I show you so here's the one that we
just updated so just not fast you could
go in and update on the back end and it
would be there within the actual
application an example of a dashboard
that has a lot of built-in features so
if you didn't have any actually any
programming experience you could go in
and create this dashboard in the actual
Jasper port server so that dashboard
could control various parameter passing
so here we have a case where one dashlet
affects the other but then if you did
want to have this interact more with
your actual application you as a
developer with JavaScript could also set
it up so that you were updating things
from the page itself so now that's
passing a parameter in here in changing
the actual department or the group so
let's jump into the presentation and
some of the code that's really what I
want to show you guys right now like I
said I can always do more demoing you
know at the booth later okay so what you
really have going on here is you have to
think of this in kind of a new way so if
you're using d3 or something like I've
had questions around III again you're
getting the visualization maybe you're
using JSON with that but with it this
you're really able to connect to
whatever data sources so tibco
jaspersoft java jasperreports server is
with the central hub or location or
engine it's running all this so with
that you're going to have you know let
me actually go into the presentation I
might be helpful so with that you're
going to have you know your analytics
you're going to have your interactive
reporting and you're going to have your
data visualizations that are built in
you can also pull data visualizations
and from other things like d3 is well if
you needed to so here's an example of
some code very simple right you're just
pulling in the visualized ijs API here
and then here I have a couple examples
i'm going to show you right so you might
have an authentication bit of JavaScript
may have a dashboard bit of JavaScript
going on and then here is your container
for holding if you were just doing one
visualization or report so this is
really simple at this point so let's
look at an authentication example so
here what's going on is you've got
visualized as being called here in the
in the JavaScript and what's nice about
this is that all of your authentication
is being done with the jasperreports
server so anyone could be doing that on
the back end and then what this allows
you to do is it allows you to set up
token you because here's a simple plain
text but you could be doing token
authentication we do that a lot you also
have your organization so you have multi
tendency built into the Jazz report
server so if you're really trying to use
a true business case with this or any
type of organization you're going to
have different users are going to have
different needs to connect to that data
and different rights at the data level
so that allows you to that you could
also add things like time zones and
whatnot in here and then where the
action occurs is that function V so that
V is the object you're pulling from the
visualize that Jess API that we called
earlier and that really is saying okay
in this particular case and you could do
this a couple different ways but in this
particular case you're creating a
variable called report and then you're
connecting an object there so now you
can add things to V report okay so you
might have a particular in this case I
remember our container so you just say
okay this one report I want to embed it
in that container so this is a really
simple use case but you know you may
have another place where you want to say
here we have a hard-coded parameter
right but you don't have to hard code it
I mean you could do whatever you want to
pass that parameter into the code so
this allows your application open up and
allows you a lot more creative ability
in terms of building something out in
the application of course all of our
error functioning is there as well and
built in from the start okay now here's
an example a little different this is
dashboarding and you're embedding a
dashboard so basically you have maybe
several visualizations of reports that
it didn't even have to be a developer to
build that out it could have been anyone
that used the Jasper report server so
visualize says okay same stuff right
I'll sent occation in this particular
case I'm saying let's connect V directly
and pass that directly and then that's
being passed to the dashboard so it's a
little different but very similar wave
so there's different ways you can go
about passing that would be so yeah so
now let's talk about if you were doing
more with parameters right so if you had
say several some of the demos you guys
may have seen that I was doing earlier I
showed you a little bit just now shows
several visualizations interacting with
each other so you're going to have maybe
a master report and slave report and
they're controlling each other you could
also have the application of the web
application directly controlling the one
report you didn't have to be multiple
reports but it's up to you how you want
to set that up so what's happening here
is you're saying basically you're
trading your initializing that report
and this initialize report half so here
we have that so we're going to come back
to that but really at this point what
you're doing is you're trying to get it
started so you're rendering that report
and you're doing it dynamically so the
URI is being pulled in as a resource
versus being hard coded or static so you
have that obviously that's that makes
sense that you could do that and then in
the end what you're the triggering event
is it's just saying okay so now if it's
available that event click function is
now of your once it hears something back
from that it's going to be able to run
that event and it knows to pass the link
so once you see the other half of the
code this will make more sense but this
is what actually what happens is that
brand is updated so this is the product
it would be the master and then it
updates the actual or actually excuse me
the master would be the brand and the
products would be the slave report so
it's basically saying let the the master
report pass that parameter and brand
name over into and so when we go over
here now
we can see that's exactly what happens
right it updates that brand and passes
it in and so you can do a lot of things
too like if you needed to pass like say
the brand name into the actual HTML you
could add that there or if you wanted to
have it so it's just updated the
visualization you could have that there
but ultimately what you're going to
choose between is do I want to have this
to be really detailed do i need my
visualizations to be finite and very
detail that you would use studio right
the studio our product allows you to
create reports very particular colorants
basing everything you need in terms of
very custom if you decide okay I just
want to do this maybe internally or
something very simple with dashboarding
you don't have to use studio you could
just simply do that with the actual
server itself and do the analytics
directly on the server in fact well
that's what a lot of people do they use
the analytics truck man the server and
so what I wanted to point out here and
the reason I mention that is that in
this case you'd need to use studio
because studio is as you set that in
studio that brand is the parameter in
that visualization that updates so
that's how it knows because parameter
brand is set in studio one other piece
of code that i want to show you and i'll
show you a fiddle of this and actually
couple others but what this really is
saying is you've got end users that are
going to the visualizations and what
we're trying to do with visualized ijs
what jet with jaspersoft is trying to do
as much as possible is if you just have
a static visualization like what we
commonly do as developers it doesn't
allow the end user really a lot of power
to do the analytics so the whole point
here is that they may have made a change
and they click on the button save and
it's going to save that particular set
so an example to be they change the
chart type they can save that so that
it's now in the server it's permanent
but it's not something to be hard to fix
or change later another example would be
with reporting they might change a
filtering they might any number of
things they can save that and so what
this allows them to do is
say that report save and really
everything else is very similar right
you've got your same authentication and
in fact let me go right now to that
fiddle if I have it up here right so
here it is so in this case let's just
quickly change the chart type this has
been sitting for some time so we'll just
refresh it so what it's doing right now
is this point in that particular report
and then it allows that person to change
it there save it so now if we refresh
you know and even if we went to the
server right now you'd see that it's you
know it's that particular view now and
that's one example there's several
others as well of ways you can do that
so let me kind of move over to there is
server now to get you more look at the
back end ok so the server there's a
couple things you should know about the
server so first of all your data resides
where you want to reside it doesn't have
to reside on our server that's not the
way it works so the server is something
you either install on your you could do
it on your local system right so you go
to Jasper's Ofcom get a 30-day download
install on your system start playing
with it locally that's possible to do
that you could also go to amazon and if
you put in like business analytics into
amazon we're going to be the first one
that comes up there so for less than a
dollar an hour you can start to play
with this and get a feel for it before
you scale it out so you know if you need
to expand your bandwidth you could
obviously but the nice thing about that
is that you can start playing with this
today really at very low cost so you've
got your data sources you've got your ad
hoc views so ad hoc is just basically
saying if I wanted to you know go into
one of these ones here this is pull up
one actually but rather than doing I'm
going to go into a dashboard and ad hoc
is in the dashboard as well so let's
pull up an expense metrics dashboard
so again this is not studio so you're
it's a little it's not as finite but
what you can do is you can obviously you
have all your different chart types so
if I pulled in another chart here and I
can select from whatever data source i
already have set up or domain i have set
up domain meaning your meta data layer
so data on the data so you don't have to
change your underlying data sources so
here you have your maybe your inventory
maybe you pull in say city or state and
then we're going to pull up maybe
something like units ordered change our
chart type
let's pull the different chart type
so yeah this is necessarily the best
example but there you know in other
words you can now save that dashlet and
that's in there now and so you you can
do these things very quickly you know
you can bill our dashboard very quickly
with ad hoc and then what that allows
you to do is you can scale everything
here very fast you can add your filters
so if you need to add a particular
filter say if you want to have one
dashlet control another dashlet that can
be done right here so you don't have to
actually code that what visualized ijs
allows that you wouldn't believe you
just here is it a lot it opens up that
that entire workspace so you're not
embedding as an iframe you're obviously
right you're embedding it with
JavaScript and so it allows you to have
more creativity you can have you can do
more in terms of showing off how things
are interacting with each other how the
page is interacting so it's more about
actionable data you know so a lot of
times when we think about people looking
at data they're just kind of seeing this
static view of whatever it is that
they're looking at you maybe you've done
it with crazily the d3 and it doesn't
matter what they really they may change
certain things change that particular
view but what they actually in the end
need to do is maybe selectively in that
visualization that powers the entire
website so if this allows you to do now
as it allows you to open up the entire
website visualize Jess can now control
whether it be the reporting the data
visualizations whatever it is you're
working with can control the menus in
the site can control whatever is
happening in this site it's really up to
you because you've now are using
visualized i Jes which is JavaScript and
API so yeah so at this point let's open
it up to questions I'd love to hear what
you guys are thinking just another
thought I'm going to pull up where you
can find more information and then also
I want to make you all aware of the fact
that right now we're at kind of a
pivotal point with visualized i Jes and
that we're trying to figure out what the
best pricing model is for developers in
particular so the timing of this is
perfect this event because we really are
trying to garnish feedback
from the developers as to how you want
to ultimately consume this and so right
now we're doing the cloud right you can
go to the cloud and do that for a
certain price but some people are
finding that API calls do make sense do
we want to do API calls do we want to do
a license well so we're we're going to
be sent out a survey so feel free to
come to the you know we can share more
with that and leaving your information
will get you that in you know so you can
give us feedback because we could really
use that at this time tipco is is
several thousand employees jaspersoft is
right here in potrero hill we've got
about somewhere around a hundred and
twenty hundred thirty i believe right
now on our team and what we really are
focused on with jaspersoft is reporting
embedding analytics into your web
framework and that's where they our main
thrust right now you pull up little
information yeah i want you guys to
build a seat you know where you can find
more info so you have to simply go to
jaspersoft calm and you can just put in
to visualize that visualize j/s and
you'll find we've actually got 15 years
behind us with an open source community
so visualized i Jes is not open source
in the sense that you can just go start
using it without the actual
jasperreports server but you can start
using certain versions of the Jasper
report in terms of jaspersoft doing
certain things with reporting is open
source and especially our community has
grown strong because I've been doing
this for so long so when you go to this
you'll actually be transported to the
community site and you'll get to see a
lot of what we're doing there and we're
actually enhancing that a lot right now
so feel free to reach out to me directly
as well especially if you have questions
around the pricing or you have questions
around what kind of opportunities really
reside with visualized i Jes I really
only kind of just started to touch on
some of the things you could do so yeah
again let's open up to questions love to
hear from you guys what you guys are
thinking right now
great question yeah so the question was
how responsive are these charts
especially so we do have jaspersoft
mobile which I also work with right now
so we have a mobile application you can
consume the reports and we also have
SDKs for using that in your applications
with that being said let me show you an
actual which I did not do an actual
example of how this scales so I'll just
use this one here for an example I guess
but it's very scalable I mean obviously
if you have a report you have to say I
mean you need to say the height right
but in terms of like the visualizations
whether it be built in jazz report
studio or whether it's being built on
the server it's going to scale nicely to
whatever you're building how many data
points like how how far can you go with
this yeah so this was built with big
data in mind and so we this is the as
far as the upper tier I mean what the
server was built with the thought of
we're going to get thrown a lot of data
and so there is as of now I don't know
of any just the limitation we haven't
yet we actually haven't even come near
it in fact that's one of our things
right now is we really want to get more
people on board using bigger and bigger
data because the capabilities they are
huge and the performances we've built
the performance for that so yeah great
question
yeah no that's that's a very good
question that's one of the things I
really want to make sure everybody
understand so you could go to jaspersoft
calm and download the 30 day trial
install on your local system you mean we
have to be on the web and start doing
this and for that matter if you were to
purchase the product using visual sjs
you are at that point you're connecting
to your data sources so we're exploring
like whether people that's a great thing
for you guys to give us feedback on
right do we what do you we're trying to
find what people want us to be able to
start providing more data storage
services as of now we've stated stay
clear of that we've just you know just
said hey let's provide people the
ability if they want to pack to
Cassandra MongoDB whatever it is that
they're trying to connect to and it
could be obviously multiple data sources
coming in from all over so this is
really for especially if you have a lot
of things happening with your data this
is really nice because it allows you
with you simplify especially with meta
data layers really gives you away that
kind of not have to mess with the
underlying data so back to your question
with the cloud though the cloud is again
you're not storing your data with us on
the cloud this the cloud simply allow us
to have that Jasper port server with
Amazon and they so if you go there and
you put in a business analytics in the
in Amazon they're going to come up and
you're gonna be able to basically just
get bandwidth on their server so you're
using their server now versus maybe you
have your own web server or you're doing
it local and your system and the pricing
there is really nice if you're just
starting out with it because it's less
than a dollar an hour to just start
using it so if you're just testing out
you say ok I'm done I just turn it off
and you know it's not running then
you're not getting having to pay for
that yeah so basically how often are you
connecting to the data source so like
how live is it is that kind of what
you're okay great question so this is
not true live in terms of like if you
were to set this up and then you expect
to like see things coming in every
second so the question of live that
that's like okay so what is live is that
every minute is that every 30 seconds so
there are things you could do to
definitely to hack in and start to do
that for certain but as of right now
live streaming is not
supported and we're working hard to look
at supporting that so that's good
feedback if there's those of you are
thinking like this does not really like
to have but I really want to live you
know live streaming it's really
important to me like let me know that
because that's a big part of what we're
developing right now we've got a sizable
team here in the US and outside of the
US that's working on this right now so
right now I actually don't know the
answer that question how often because
it's not it's actually not like a set
thing it's not like you just connecting
this often it's it's like you know you
actually have to set it to like refresh
at the rate that you want yeah yeah but
it's not still not going to be even if
you set it to refresh the right that you
want it's still not going to be able to
refresh at like per second or like what
some people consider to be live
streaming in yep yep yep I kind of
briefly mentioned i didn't get i'm going
to go into it so we do have a custom
visualization component that we finished
and so you could connect to like d3 or
you could connect to whatever it is that
you're trying to do like that is that
kind of is that what you're referring to
in terms of right so yeah it so
basically what you saying is they have a
data aggregator system already in place
and they want to be able to sort to use
that with a jazz report server so we
have data connectors that are more open
ended so maybe it requires just a little
more work but yeah it is if you're if
you have a data source you can connect a
data source however you set that up in
your location so that's what we've
really tried to focus on is to not like
limit where you can connect that to you
know we kept that in it so the Jasper
report server is java based obviously
we're embedding with javascript but yeah
so it's java-based and so so that's
we've really worked hard to get the
connectors in place and you do have the
ability to have custom connectors like
that yeah anything else in the back I
want to miss anybody
alright well good yeah feel free to come
by the booth get more info see more demo
actually there's a lot more I can show
you especially on the Jasper report
server so yeah come on by and we're
really glad that you guys are here
