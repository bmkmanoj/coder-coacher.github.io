instructor and i'm here today to talk to
you about html5 forms and more
particularly how to override the default
look and feel of the validation messages
within html5 now I'm not saying that
html5 form validation UI sucks per se
I'm just saying that once you know how
you can override this and make it look
as you need it to biggest problem with
html5 form validation is number one the
browser's they see them completely
differently it's not like a slight color
change between Firefox and Chrome they
are drastically different it's almost
like night and day that's number one and
number two is that the chrome developer
tools when you inspect one of these
elements and try to adjust the CSS it
doesn't let you do it you can't go in
there and just a box shadow and then
save it out to your CSS file it won't
let you do it so you have to go under
the hood and learn how to do this and
that's why I put together the screencast
to show you how to do that so I'm going
to create an html5 page we're going to
open up Chrome we're going to look at
the inspect tools show you the default
behavior and then I'm going to show you
how to override it and get it looking
just as you need it to so see you in so
let's start with creating a html5 page
just got a simple text editor open and
we're going to start with a simple html5
page and we're going to inside here I
think I should add a form of some
description okay so let's just try form
and call it sample form inside this
field set I'm going to add a couple of
labels so user name is probably one
maybe choose a username
I'm in more sense and required field
this is standard html5 which will force
some validation which I'll show you in a
second let's do another couple labels
about gmail address so enter your email
address sounds good to me
um and let's do another one label for
password
and choose a password okay what I'm also
going to do is I'm going to set type to
equal password here and I'm also going
to do type equals email here and you'll
see why in a second and then probably
have a submit button okay so let's just
open up this in localhost and so it
looks like on Chrome okay so we have a
standard form here soon as I click
Submit
you got please fill out this field fill
something in please file this field fill
it in and it says please enter an email
address so you have to have some sort of
email address and that will not validate
and then please fill out this field and
so on so that works
that should support form validation what
I want to show you is how to override
this stuff also this doesn't really tell
you when something is valid or not
and apart from having these quality
balls it'd be really nice if we're going
to have some highlighting or maybe an
image here saying it's valid or if it's
a required field so let's go / - let's
go over to a text editor and let's try
that out one thing I'm going to do here
is well I'm going to have a pattern
match for the password this is an again
html5 feature and we can just do
something like this um backslash yes I
think this will probably do the trick
absolutely do let's try that I should do
the trick there and what we want to do
is bring in some CSS so let's bring in a
CSS style and call it well first of all
let's do some page Styles and also we
need to bring in some input styles and
then the second we need to bring in the
fancy stuff which is a call-outs okay so
let me just try and find these files I
did a little bit earlier on page CSS all
we have here very simple we've got some
background color color on the body
send the font size we've got the wrapper
which is this thing here okay so
identifying that and we've got a header
area and a footer area and the reason
why I'm including a header and a footer
to this form is to show you how we can
stylize something that relates to the
actual page that you're on so for
example if we wanted to do a header we
could say something like this we could
go h1 sign up for a free account and
then maybe an h2 saying no credit card
required it's it is free
something like that and then in the
footer and walking point here for now
maybe we'll just put our copyright
whoops
future-proof it right so let's have a
quick look at what this looks like so if
we have a particular style that we want
it to use and we need to stylize the
form accordingly so let's just open up
inspector tools for a start so we can
actually see what we're dealing with
here
inside here we want to actually start
stylizing some of these things as well
so let's bring in a page format as well
so Broughton page and let's bring in
puts got CSS let's just check that point
into the right place it's actually input
CSS I'm going to take class for now just
just go back to Chrome so all we've done
here just stylize this a little bit and
what you'll notice is there are some
little icons here for different
mandatory fields and so I'm using the
pseudo selector here if you can see this
way you have input required you can also
have plenty of others as well which
which I'll show you in the forum I'll
just show you here
okay this stuff so you can have required
valid invalid focus and all we're doing
is adjusting a background image and also
just in the outline so the overall
effects of that is depending on the
state of the inputs it's going to change
what it's going to look like so let's
have a look what that does look like in
chrome so if I click Submit now still
get the same validation bubbles because
we haven't actually addressed address
that but you get this saying please fill
out this field because at the moment
it's an invalid state what you'll notice
is you don't get the invalid state
showing up so if I add a word in here
this is now valid and again you're not
showing the valid state except this has
changed so inspector tools helps you in
a lot of instances but in this instance
doesn't really help you out
you can't go here and just kind of
change to a valid or invalid state
doesn't let you do it like you can with
hover States which is little frustrating
so you have to go through here you have
to go through all this process and then
try the password again and again when
you've got the right mount because this
is looking for six digits you know that
becomes valid the problem is we want to
just this we want miss in the style of
our website and there's no way we can
actually adjust this if I go over here
and I try and inspect this which I just
zoom out a little bit
as you can see there is no way to bring
up this button nothing is changing an
inspector so I can't go in here and
adjust this drop shadow or or I can't
even change this arrow here can't change
this image there's no easy way of doing
it however if you know you CSS you can
get around this and that's what I want
to show you we can adjust the call-out
so I've created a quiet CSS file I'll
give you all these files not that much
as you can see what you can do is you
can do the WebKit validation bubble
message and in this instance I've just
stylized it I've got some texture which
is the same as the header and footer and
I've adjusted some of the borders and
text shadows etc even brought in a
different font so as we're bringing in
this font I'm probably going to need to
bring down in a second
this is a tricky one okay because once
you find the validation vote bubble
message and it has a child div which
again we need to find anything that
immediately follows it because you can
control a title tag and that will
stylize this differently I'll show you
that in a second and then we can choose
the bubble icon bubble arrow and one
thing that I'm doing here with a before
filter is adjusting this WebKit
transform because by default the
validation bubble arrow is rotated so we
have to adjust this to get it lined up
in the way we want it so we have in this
instance I'm going to bring up an arrow
and it's going to be kind of tilted okay
so first things first let's go and bring
in that fun and we can do that with
Google web fonts so let's just nip over
to Chrome and go to Google web fonts
steady Z and the front we want to use
Lobster still quick use
head down there back over to sublime
paste it in job done okay so now we can
use lobster font which I've declared
here as you can see okay the other thing
I want to do and this is good practice
for you guys is to use normalize if
you've not heard of this I suggest you
check it out okay and it allows you to
reset your style sheets in a pretty
efficient way so we go over to the
download I'm taking this here going back
to sublime and I'm going to paste this
in oops I need to do a link type and
then paste that in let's get rid of that
and now let's see what this looks like
in Chrome
it's just needed up a little bit now
this is an extreme example obviously
it's not I design it I just want to show
you the way you can override it this
important thing so here as soon as I
click Submit now we've able to stylize
the arrow we're able to stylize the font
and everything so much the particular
style of the site one thing that is
interesting to me is adjusting the title
tag I'll show you this so you choose an
email as if noticed it doesn't validate
properly but have - - html5 validation
works for email this there is some more
information here we can say you know
this requires six digits okay and the
way you can just that is with a title
tag so let's go over to sublime unless
adjust it
okay and then you see what happens here
oops
this is stylized as a title tag
underneath it
okay so you can get pretty good
customization as long as you're willing
to work on these call-outs and again I'm
going to give you these in the body of
the tutorial
but it's nothing more than overriding
the bubble arrows a bubble icon and
bubble messages and this is the title
area underneath it so just by adding a
few styles here adjusting some pseudo
selection here for your required valid
and invalid and you know you're able to
match it to the style of your site using
html5 so let's just have a look back
let's finish out submit fill in a name
there you go and if it's wrong tells you
okay so that's how you override forms on
one last thing if you're looking at this
on YouTube should head over to the
Marikana website and you'll see beneath
this video all the code that used
throughout the tutorial hope that helps
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
