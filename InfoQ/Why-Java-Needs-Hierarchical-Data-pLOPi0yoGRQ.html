hierarchy the software tool that we've
been working on for quite some time but
before we begin I thought I'd introduce
myself so I'm Peter Joe head of
development of hierarchy and also the
owner of unconventional thinking and I
have about 15 years in software
development experience I started back
way in the 90s at Microsoft as a lonely
software in turn back when Microsoft had
crushed all its competition ruthlessly
which is a bad thing and I've also been
doing research and software architecture
for the past several years and for the
past five years I've been running
unconventional thinking and then for the
past four years I've been working almost
exclusively on hierarchy except for
about a year stint where I worked on
another project at another company so
today's talk first I'll introduce you to
hierarchy we won't go into a lot of
detail we'll just talk about just the
high-level concepts it's not probably
not worth it to know the the details but
I do want to keep I do want you to gain
understanding of how it works in a
second part will talk about the event
the benefits of working with hierarchy
and I think this will be especially
interesting to almost everybody
hierarchies obviously a very specific
products and in this part I'll talk to
you about specific techniques and
specific architectures that we gained
through our research and through our
product development that is useful
across all types of software development
and in conclusion we'll talk about the
future of hierarchy hierarchy is a
pretty unique product so it really has
the impact the the potential to make a
huge impact on the system I'm
programming in general it could
drastically change java and drastically
change programming in general or if
there's no user adoption it could have
very little packs so we'll just talk
about that briefly and this is kind of
somewhat related but in our research on
software architectures we came up with a
very novel architecture and it's really
useful today and it's kind of very dear
to our hearts and I don't know for help
time to go through it so what I'm going
to do is that it at the end of the
conclusion if people are interested you
know they can stay here to talk about
n-dimensional architecture if they're
not interested then we just don't need
to do it so part 1 introduction to
hierarchy so what is hierarchy hierarchy
is a medical power that extends Java
with new keywords and operators for
working with hierarchical data so that's
a mouthful here's a hope everybody can
see that but that's just a hierarchy
code and if you notice it looks just
like Java because it is it's really just
Java that's been extended it has a class
a method print statements but it has
extra code for working with matrices
which is hierarchies version of
hierarchical data so just think of it as
an extension to job like as if java has
now gained new keywords and operators
but we don't call hierarchy a compiler
we call it a medical Pilar any reason we
call in a medic compiler is because we
take
an embedded java file java file that's
embedded with the new commands for for
working with hierarchical data as you
can see this this bold code is is the
code that's that's a from hierarchy and
we pass it through the hierarchy Amedda
compiler and then what we get is a java
version of that code a pure java version
so it's it's it's really doing
translation similar to the translation
you see in Perl where it translates from
the pearl language into pure see are
into if people know a copy script
coffeescript is taking an extended
JavaScript syntax and converting that
into a pure JavaScript version this is
the same idea so as you can see here it
took it took this this hierarchy code
and turned it into just a my matrix
object access accessing a get method so
it's really just just a translation
technology but what does hierarchy add
to Java hierarchical data so what we
mean by hierarchical data is XML or JSON
that's hierarchical and that it has a
tree structure a way we like to think
about it is hierarchy is like as if XML
have been incorporated directly into the
Java language so
as you can as you can see xml has direct
correlations to hierarchy file types the
dive xml file is equivalent to the dot
matrix file in hierarchy the data x 6
xst which is a schema is equivalent to a
dive schema file and the DA texas-el
that doesn't have a direct equivalent
it's actually a little different an XSL
is if you remember its own language for
manipulating xml data and querying it
and filtering it where's am Java file in
hierarchy is is what you saw it's a Java
file with extended instructions for
accessing matrices and working with them
so I know some of you looked at the
documentation and at the website so you
might remember this example we're just
going to go over briefly for those that
they haven't what we're going to do is
we're going to take a we're going to
create a home page for a website for the
willies pet store home page and we're
going to create a news feed that
displays the current news items for the
home page so we're just going to two of
them adopt a pet and twenty percent off
fanciful dog spread so so so what we've
done and if you can't see the code I put
it on the handout so you can flip to the
handout if you want to what we've done
is we've taken the two news items and
we've put those inside a Maitre see
object so think of it as if in terms of
xml it just says if we had placed the
news events inside an xml document and
as you can see the structure of the file
is very similar to xml it has a root
node
Willie's pet store content is the root
node and then it has a one child node
news and then inside the news node is
multiple news story nodes so if you if
you know just if you if you know XML you
should be able to follow the structure
of hierarchy and matrices really quickly
because it's the same thing and just if
we look at here inside the news story we
don't we actually don't call in an XML
we would call these tags that be the
news tagged this would be the news story
tag but in hierarchy and matrices we
call them descriptors and in XML we
don't have we have attributes and values
but in hierarchy we call those field
sets with field values and field names
so here that's where you stroll all all
the field values for your for each
descriptor now this does anybody can
look at your code does anybody notice a
difference between a major difference
between matrices and XML something that
seems like it's missing right so he said
where our field names that's exactly it
usually in XML you would have something
like date equals and this would be the
date title equals adopt-a-pet content
equals your choice for a your chance to
adopt the flow knee pad is is right
around the corner but in hierarchy you
don't need to do that you determine the
field name by the position of the field
value inside the field set so the first
position is the date the second position
is the title there
position is the content and you define
that relationship in the schema here we
have a schema oh yes go so he asked what
happens if you have an optional field so
there are two ways to do it one is you
is you could just set that feel to know
our default value if you use primitive
types or you can also do the XML style
of attribute equals value that's that's
that's available but what we've kind of
found is that you in a lot of cases
especially in data that's very dense you
actually do use a lot of the fields very
often use maybe like 90 to eighty
percent of it so that's why we also
provided this way because now the syntax
is much cleaner much simpler you don't
have a lot of extra text but yeah
that also implies that for matrices you
have to have schemas you can't not have
a schema like you do an ex mo because
there is no field name so you would
define each of your descriptors inside
the schema and this is kind of the
tricky part but schemas are we worked
really hard I try to make schemas as
easy to create as possible and it might
look a little it's a little non-standard
but really once you understand it we
found that creating schemas can you can
do student in three or four minutes as
opposed to maybe like 10 15 20 minutes
for a complicated or even a simple
schema I'm sorry oh so his his question
was how is this he am i different from
just a regular Java class definition
because it looks very similar it's it's
different because it's very similar
you're right but it's it's hierarchical
it's it's it's structures is naturally
hierarchical so that's a good question
because if you looked at the maître see
news story elements are always going to
be contained inside news elements and to
define that relationship in a schema you
would do the same thing you would just
put the news story descriptor definition
inside the news the parent news
descriptor definition so now you have to
find that relationship very easily
easily and that was one of the goals
like it's sometimes looking at a nexus d
it's very hard to tell what it does and
very hard to tell what the structure of
everything is so it just seemed more
natural that you could find out the
structure just by looking at the
position of of the almonds are now one
of the main differences are one of the
main things that you have to pick up on
and creating schemas is that like like
the matrices you define things in sort
of a row column format so that you
define first all your field names the
date the title the content and the you
define it just just like you do in the
matrices by precision and you would you
define the type in a nested descriptor
again by position date string string
sometimes people take a little while to
pick up on that but that's the major
difference
so yeah it's on your handout so any
questions anybody have any questions on
that yeah it's exactly so his question
was is one of the goals of the schema is
it so you can intuitively usually look
at it and understand it exactly so you
can just I hope you can see that once
you understand the format it's very easy
to understand what does what the
definition is you don't have to work
through a lot of different syntaxes and
like a nexus d sometimes I just I can
never tell what it really does so yeah
since since schemas are a required part
of matrices we really worked hard to
make them very simple to create and we
have we have created real products with
with matrices and schemas and we did
find that creating schemas really do
just take you know schemas in an XML can
take hours but in matrices they really
only take about five minutes this this
would probably take yeah about five to
ten minutes to create any other
questions
as against describing each so he asked
why I'll face it a little bit
differently but why are we defining
things in a sort of non-standard fashion
what we do the row column format is sort
of just taking a field and doing all
this definition and the reason is
because if well the first is because it
sort of mimics the structure of of the
fields in a Maitre see so it has that
same relationship of being positional to
define things so that's a nice intuitive
way to understand your schema and your
field set the same the same relationship
the second is because we also found that
it's much more flexible for if we need
to add new elements of the schema and
actually that does happen so for
instance at the bottom of the schema
let's say you want to add a a new a new
type of way of classifying the field so
that you want to specify how it's used
in a database like database column type
information you can actually add that
directly into the schema by just adding
a database type info descriptor right
into it so it allows for infinite Flair
extensibility
so these are the different parts of the
schema definition I think we all
understand it now but this is a
descriptor definition and that's a
fieldset definition how do schemas work
I think most people have have kept quiet
that was a great question because right
the in a Maitre see I don't know if you
can see this but it's on the handout but
right the first position maps to the
first column of definitions in your
schema the second the second column two
thirds of the third column so that make
sense that's that's the major difference
yeah so now let's take that code this
matrices and will create a console
application that will loop through let's
loop through the maitre c and print out
print out that information that news
feed but it'll do it to the console
instead of to an HTML page just for
simplicity so this is a special file the
M java file which is just an extension
to java and as you can see it looks just
like java and it is it's a package it
has a class it has a main method print
statements the main difference is it now
it has these extended commands for
accessing and working with matrices so
here what we're doing is we're accessing
that that maître see we just created
the willies pet store content maitre see
descending into the news node and then
grabbing all the new story nodes inside
the news nodes and see this special
filter right there means that we're
grabbing all the children in sight at
that level
and then we're taking each the result
that's returned is just a regular Java
collection so you can iterate over it
using just a regular for each loop so
there's the descriptors that are pulled
out of that collection can be set to a
special descriptor variable that knows
where it is in terms of accessing that
maitra see that's what this is it's
describing where it is in terms of that
access so that now this we can use this
descriptor variable in mid axis and
start getting the field values and
printing them out so here's here's the
title the story day the story content so
was it was there a question
this is a little bit of interesting
syntax that it's kind of a detail but
it's kind of something that kind of
indicates what we try to do with
hierarchy annotations now don't confuse
those with with method I tations and
class annotations and these are
annotations that are specific to two
matrices and what it is is that if you
notice there's no exception handling
there's no no checks I don't know about
you guys but I think that all the try
catch blocks all the novel pointer
conditionals it really starts a mess
with the code and it makes it very
difficult to read so instead oops what
happens here is if during one of these
accesses if there's a null pointer if
there's an exception that's thrown
instead of getting passed into a try
catch block it gets passed to this
annotation handler that that will do all
the processing and if you want you can
define this is a default annotation
handler but you can define specific ones
on these these accesses using a
reference notation and inside the
annotation you would also have a
matching a notation handler yep any
questions
so that's just the output that's the
actual output of that program how much
is soo there okay since the end of part
1 so we've created a pretty extensive
document that describes all the features
in much more detail worked really hard I
think that's part of our mantras that we
believe that sometimes open source
libraries as wonderful as they are the
coating is so much work that they don't
have enough time for documentation and
in polish but we really want this to be
adopted and used so we've spent a lot of
time that documentation so you know if
you use it please read it on give
feedback to because we're always trying
to make it better and oh is there any
any questions so far oh yeah
you said a way to change deploy yeah
yeah so his question was in this output
it's displaying the data in a very you
know machine kind of system like way is
their way to format it yet that's a
really that's a really good question
because if you look back at the maître
see another major difference between XML
and matrices is that matrices can have
actually they are Java there's no
difference I mean it understands Java so
you can put real java objects inside the
matrices so that also means that on the
flip side when we print out the date we
can use a format just a standard Java
date formatting objects to format that
text but it just just I didn't want to
add it because it would add complexity
to the code but good question so his
question was basically can you include
one schema in another schema so right
right at this point no and that is a
feature that we're going to add it's
actually yeah we've already suspected
out but we just haven't implemented it
yet so this question is like if you have
a certain you're just you're talking
about fields are actual full tags and
descriptors are both putting the way I
mean yeah okay you subclass that it's up
Oh composition that's a similar to this
question composition is a feature that
we've we've designed for this but we
haven't actually implemented yet so it's
still it's still in the works because it
does it is a very useful feature
definitely yeah yeah so I really free
this drama Lansing right java lamb
Street the time Liam does lady oh yeah
right right right yeah why did you from
the pool oh so his question is why is
for the type it's just to find us
java.util.date but this one is defined
as just string it's just a it's just a
convenience because string is used so
often especially in hierarchical data so
we decided that just as a syntactic
sugar you could do it as java dot Lang
gesturing if you wanted to one of them
so when one new feature that we
introduced into two hierarchy is symbols
similar to to Ruby symbols but I think
they're even more useful because they're
there actually they have a little bit of
type checking that goes along with it so
the plus means that you're creating a
new symbol and that you're not you're
not just using and is this an existing
symbol so
that's a really good question so his
question was can you use like
non-standard class types as types maybe
a class trip that you created the answer
is yes it can accept any type of Java
type okay so let's move on to part two
which is the benefits of using hierarchy
in your own systems and this part should
be is a little more general it's not
specific just a hierarchy if you walk
away from this presentation you can
actually use this technique in your own
software architectures although it is
kind of novel so I think but I think
very very powerful yes so first how is
hierarchy useful
I think of all different ways that we
use hierarchical data in our systems xml
configuration files database results
returned from hibernate and JPA although
they're not really hierarchical they're
really more of a map actually
hierarchical data and matrices aren't
really hard to go either they're the
really maps as well because because
they're just Java they can also refer to
back to the different parts of the of
the matrices spring and it's it's
injection dependency framework web
services and these are just a few of
them and hierarchy can actually do all
these all with one technology and if you
if you I and our believe if you think
about it it can do all these really well
because it is hierarchical data
hierarchical data is the core to all
these different technologies and now
that it's a part of the language that
makes working with all these different
these different problem domains much
much easier oh and Jason
so current XML technologies like jack's
b &amp;amp; j XP they work really well so why
don't we just stick with those i've used
Jack's be extensively in my development
career and I do i do like it i think
it's it's relatively fast to create the
XML to class mappings but the difference
between creating a class and using
annotations and creating a mapping
versus using a data structure that's
natively defined in your programming
language is an order of magnitude more
simple think about that you don't have
to worry about file pals you don't have
to worry about spelling mistakes you
don't have to worry about you don't have
to search for missing tags and
improperly define annotations you the
medical pilar helps you and catches a
lot of those mistakes that you would
make and it won't let you use schemas
improperly if you start to use a schema
that's not to find it will tell you if
you try to use a tag that doesn't exist
in a schemer is misspelled it will tell
you so we it sounds great but in
practice it actually does work I think
that's one of the advantages also of
strongly typed languages is that it lets
you know when you make a mistake and
that's that's really the summary of the
main advantage of hierarchy hierarchical
data now is as easy to create as
creating a class there's no need for
creating an XML creating a schema and
then creating a jack speed class and a
mapping it's all done in one step just
create the mate receipt and create the
schema so why use hierarchy
it's it's really the best of JSON and
Link so I JSON for those that are not
familiar with it is JavaScript object
notation and it's basically as if XML
had been incorporated directly into
JavaScript itself and if you look at it
it looks like XML in fact the original
designers of JSON we're thinking of JSON
as a replacement usage of XML but if you
talk to I know where Java programmers
but if you talk to JavaScript
programmers ones that do pretty much
JavaScript as one of their main main
programming languages they tell you that
JSON isn't just a replacement for XML
it's become sort of the central data
structure for their JavaScript
subsystems what they're starting to do
is actually been doing for years is they
create JSON objects and they put they
collect all the settings and content of
their JSON objects are there jasa there
javascript subsystems and put them into
these JSON objects and what that does is
it creates a central place where all the
major things that change in your system
are stored so that if you need to make a
change your system you don't need to
search let's say you you need to change
the name of the the registration form
from first name to an capitalize first
and name you don't need to search all
the places that first name is used now
you can just go to the central location
this JSON object and make the change
just there because all the settings for
a first name are right there it's a very
powerful architecture that isn't really
utilized in Java because we don't have a
data structure like JSON to do something
like that
and microsoft lync i know we are a Java
programmers so link isn't the most
popular technology but I hope we can
admit that it is very powerful and a lot
of people describe it as is a very
elegant very powerful way to access data
sources and I would agree it it makes
working with with databases and and just
other types of data very simple if for
those that aren't familiar with it it's
basically as if SQL had been
incorporated directly into a dotnet
language as you can see it has a from
clause a where clause and a select
statement and it takes that result and
it stores it into a a dotnet collection
hierarchy can also encompass slink and
maybe do it even better because it used
its results are not limited by SQL SQL
is a technology that was ideal for
relational databases of returning
results that are not hierarchical but
nowadays we realize that our data that
we use is hierarchical that's why we use
things like hibernate it allows us to
have data results that are are extremely
complicated with lots of different
relationships so in a way link is
powerful but it's limited hierarchy can
combine the benefits of both JSON and
link at the same time
and it really does have a lot of
potential because you think well link
was a major technology for Microsoft it
really changed the dotnet platform at
Jason changed javascript but the the sum
is greater than the parts because now
you have one technology hierarchy that
can do both and you can use it in
situations that you would need both
Jason and link to do certain situate
certain activities okay so this point is
there any questions so Alexander's
question was what kind of effort would
it take to add IDE support to hierarchy
and actually it shouldn't be too great
it's not there right now we've only
created the Maine Medical Pilar but I do
you support the main thing is syntax
checking and syntax suggestions and
we've already created the parser so we
just need to integrate the parser into
an IDE but it's it's the next major one
of the next major pieces so your
question basically is XML is a metadata
so that it's it's can be used across all
technologies John Ned Python you know
pearl whereas this technology is
specific to Java so it's limited and it
is limited that is that it's is this
major limitation but hierarchical data
isn't just shouldn't just be a metadata
format which XML is really designed to
do what we realized is that in between
primitive types and and classes we were
missing something we're missing a simple
data structure that let us create
hierarchical data really quickly when
you start to use when you have a JSON
like data structure in your language
you realize that you can create you can
create certain pieces of your system
much more simply so I guess what I'm
saying is XML has its uses it's a
metadata format but it's not the great
integrated into language and
technologies like JSON show that
hierarchical data structures can make a
major impact on how you program if it's
integrated into your language so this
question this is a good question why not
just use JSON or well I'll sort of I'll
even make it tougher like why not just
create JSON for Java which has been
created but it's still just a library
and why not just add JSON directly into
Java because Jason is is it's not really
designed in my opinion it's not a robust
technology it doesn't have types if you
notice that a schema matrices have
schemas and it seems like now well you
kind of added more coding more more tech
technology that you another step that
you need to do to work with these
objects isn't that disadvantage right
json is much simpler there's no types
but we as Java programmers need to do
things like work with databases and and
we need to do high-performance
activities so when we can define the
types we can do things like now we can
we can still do hibernate type mappings
very quickly because now we can map from
from the database type into the actual
type in an application but
30 GS on yeah they you know you pick up
a huge fine and you just scream through
integrator we develop additional files
json file ya eeka java of it on the fly
it's very good alright so that this is a
technology unaware I thought is it is it
is it a library that takes JSON code and
turns it into to java class objects is
that would strengthen to you featured
they drove up from the JSON documents
which reason OIC library so his his he's
this is not a technology that I was
aware of but there's a there's so many
out there there there a lot of catheters
there's jisan which is basically taking
it's doing some type of mapping between
JSON into Java classes but again that's
another mapping technology when you and
I I don't know the specifics but I mean
one of my friends said well why can't
you just use hibernate for a lot of
these activities but think about that if
you if you want to use hibernate to do
and store and create like a table with a
fields column in a field value column
you don't get the ease of use that you
do with with with hierarchy where
hierarchical data is directly part of
your language if you if you look at
technology you know am I believe you
can't think of technologies different
than than a applications or products
ease of use is a really important factor
in whether things are used or not used
them i believe so let me get this
straight so in the schemas he was asking
do the field types support basically
you're asking what can be put as a field
type and the answer is anything you use
in java you can use as a field type in
fact primitives are supported and
complex objects are supported and
primitives was actually much more
difficult to support than anything else
adding that probably added about twenty
percent of unto the development time but
we wanted to make sure that I think for
this to be adopted it needs to feel like
a real data Java data structure and and
that's what that's what it really is
it's really when you see the the high
dog the Java code that's generated by
hierarchy you see that the matrices are
very simple they're they're very
lightweight it is just if you define an
int it really just as an int in the
field set so he's asking if you create
your own custom type do you set is that
also supported yes you can define your
own custom types so his his his question
is this hierarchical hierarchy have
serialization do serialization
techniques the answer is yes and you're
kind of jumping to the end so you're
kind of seeing what's ahead but i'll
talk about that later which is actually
an awesome question because
so he's asking what were the the things
the obstacles that I face while develop
this technology talk about that the end
actually that is a question that I put
in the QA and I'll tell you what I faced
so many obstacles it was extremely
difficult it it was a both emotionally
and financially and technically pushed
me to the limit so his question is all
these examples have been just about
reading hierarchical data what about
actually saying things constant or
modifying it that's a great question
because yeah this is not xml this is not
static files this is a new data
structure for java so you can you can
modify things you can in fact there's a
very simple syntax for for taking a
field and signing a new value to it so
right although you know i haven't
supported final yet finals is coming up
so his question is basically we can't
forget about performance and that's
right performance it that was really so
i said that twenty percent was added to
development time because we wanted to
support primitives because parameters
are very lightweight in high performance
and so formats is a huge factor and we
try to make it almost like as if there
was nothing in the way of working with
the field sense and the descriptors so
that when you access a field there's
almost almost no overhead it is just a
field axis except for there's a couple
if if statements to determine certain
things but right performance is a major
factor that's a an excellent question so
it's I don't know yet know if you're
talking about runtime but I'll dress it
in both ways so he's asking if so
hierarchy is a translator technology
that translates from medic owed into
into a java version
and let's say I'm going to talk about
one thing let's say you you have an
error but it's not really an error in
your medic owed it's an error in your in
your java file will the hierarchy
medical Pilar pick it up it's half the
time it does pick it up half the time it
doesn't it's it's a really major feature
because we work really hard to try to
catch everything but we don't so that's
that's that's a very good question but
it catches half of things in a kitchen
doesn't catch have another half does
that oh and in runtime and then run time
if there's an exception in your Java
code does that map to a line in your
your hierarchy code at this point it
does not but what we also have done is
the hierarchy the medical piled code is
available this is what a coffee script
sometimes those and eclipse extend also
does is sometimes it is necessary to
jump into the medico the compiled or the
pure java version and try to find and
map that to your to your own medic owed
or to your own extended hierarchy code
and that seems like a very painful
process but really especially because we
try to make the generated code as easy
to read as possible and we provide
comments and sort of indicated where you
are inside inside the code so let's move
on and then you can because we're
supposed to finish up this is almost
we're getting very close so this is a
technique that we use with hierarchy so
let's say we're defining a online forum
and it's a very simple registration form
with first name last name address
so think think about when you create a
web application and an online form think
about all the places in your java
application that you have to find that
filled the database thus for instance
let's take a first name and last name
you've created a web form and it has you
know a lodgment fields but what's the
first name and last name you probably
have to create a table called user put
two columns on it first name last name
and then for very complicated
applications we often have to create a
hibernate config file and define the
mapping between the fields and the java
class and then you have to create a Java
class itself to finding first name and
last name and then also usually you have
a JSF page or JSP page or HTML where you
also define the field again that's five
different places you define that field
so if you have to make a change let's
say you you want to add middle name you
have to do you have to make that change
in all those different places and make
sure you don't make a mistake oh and you
also might have a weight that's five you
might also have JavaScript that has JSON
validation technology so you have to
define the field there as well so now
remember this isn't this is going to be
supported in hierarchy but right now
it's just an architectural technique
that you can use you can use Universal
data definition to define the fields in
one location for all its different
usages and so for first name these first
three descriptors describe how the
technology or the the field is used on
the web the web form so it's a required
field it's a text box with 30 characters
maximum and it has helped text that once
you roll over it
it says please enter your first name and
you can also define what the field value
is in the database it the database first
name is on the customer table with the
first same column and savar char and you
can also define what JSON object that
this field maps to it maps to the my
JSON object personname and what's nice
about that is if you think about MVC
architectures I i love embassy
architectures I've been using it for
years but one of their drawbacks is if
you need to make a change you don't know
where all the different pieces you have
to make them you have to jump from the
the model objects to the action objects
the view objects the control objects
this shows you exactly where all the
different usages of that field are it
becomes a map to to what this field does
and if you need to make a change you
only need to make a change in this one
location so remember this is an
architectural principle it's not it's as
the technology that we're also working
on but what you would do instead is now
you would automate the generation of
these elements so once you have once you
describe your your your web form you can
create a loop that will loop over the
maitre see and just generate the forum
dynamically and it seems like a lot of
work what we use this in practice and
the amount of code that you need to do
that is is not great and and I know
there's so many different slated
technologies but we're going to create
we're actually designing libraries that
will generate that that code for you and
it already creates you know have schemas
that already defined for generating
forms so is there any questions this
would this concept is a little so his
question was how would you handle the
aspect of internationalization where you
have to define you know multiple
languages for the same text
so this yeah this is a simpler example
this isn't it really realistic but you
could in your help text you get to find
schemas so that you could nest help help
text child elements that are specific to
each language they also indicate what
language they are affiliated with so
English French German so you'd probably
inside help text you'd have a nested
you'd have nested elements instead of
just having it directly as a part of
help text yeah so this question is
technically we'd be defining a schema
for this as well I yes and this is nice
you can define multiple schemas so that
the schemas are reusable so if you look
right here these are the different
schemas that are used the web forum
schema the database schema and the JSON
schema sorry what's it
all right here so you say yeah for this
is just a detail book for the form
required field that could just be a
boolean field true false that's true but
there's there's one sort of design
consideration when you create when you
use matrices that since they don't have
the field names sometimes you want the
field value to be indicative of what it
does so that's why symbols are so useful
because here it's indicating yet this is
a required element because actually in
real usage form required has has more
fields like also indicates its path and
and the size of our the indicates like
the the required image that pops up if
it's if it's required and the size of
that image in the path to it so so yeah
you just want more you be what you want
to be more descriptive in your fields
yeah so his question was and that's
that's a great question so his question
was if you create this matrix see this
web form is the intent here that you
would create code that would loop over
it to generate for instance the database
queries and database that's exactly
right and in a hibernate like way or
whatever way you want like we actually
created a it was it was a you it created
seek dynamically created sequel queries
on the fly based on this information is
what we created so this question is is
there schemas that are are used can be
used to do alterations on the database
information for instance alter table or
revisions right now there isn't but that
is simply a matter of defining that in a
new schema and also creating I have the
necessary the necessary functionality
around it so the question is which you
are revisions in that same schema well
what we so first this is a Maitre see
yeah so would you start those same
revisions in that maître see I don't
know I mean like I definitely that's a
really good question because would you
want to clutter up the maître see
that's right i don't know or what you
want it to be the end result of what
happened yeah that's very good question
so this question is that you could still
do all this with java classes and
annotations is there a problem yeah the
question is and the answer is your right
and you could you could just use
actually the first version of this when
we prototyped it was just
multi-dimensional arrays is that
multi-dimensional array syntax is very
easy for creating structures that look
like this so yeah I'm saying like
there's yeah even if I think about our
race domain readable yeah so well
there's so what we would do with
multi-dimensional arrays is structure it
not like a multi-dimensional array we
structure it like hierarchical data so
it looked almost exactly like the
structure but I guess what I'm saying is
that you know you can use almost any
technology like like I was saying you
could use hibernates do almost all this
stuff but would it be easy to use would
it be practical and you're right java
and annotations java classes with
annotations it's a pretty close parallel
but it's java class is not designed for
hierarchical data and when you do use it
it doesn't really look great it does
sound us readable it's not as easy to
use as that is it's not really designed
for heart to go beta
comedian he's ten percent yeah yeah yeah
I agree there are a lot of parallels and
like there's a lot of overlap I agree
absolutely oh so here's a little
question actually most people don't get
this I don't think anybody's ever got
this so in universal data definition
you're defining how a field is used in
one location but even with this you
still have to define it twice you have
to find even with universal data the
data definition you have to define the
field in two places can you see what two
places you have to define it it like you
have to define it in the maître see but
there's one other location that you
would still have to define it Wow every
plot of people got it yep its database
so right you have to define a first name
last name as in a tables
does my question yeah yeah so but this
this this is on the client side it's
almost more like hibernate than it is
like so this question is well I thought
that's what this this database column
was doing yeah this is on the client
side it's more like hibernate hibernate
isn't persistence hibernate is object
relational mapping it's not true
persistence it's a mapping technology
this is doing the same thing well I know
with hibernate it has the auto generate
feature but really it's a mapping
technology so does it do I degeneration
not at this point no but we've we have
an alpha feature that has included
persistence directly into hierarchy so
that you don't it's true persistence
it's you don't you don't do any type of
mapping between hierarchical data and
database a persistent servers include
directly into hierarchy itself
and think how what an advantage that is
persistence can be sometimes quite
painful to work with hibernate you have
to create mappings config files database
connection make sure all that's working
with this you create a native data
structure in hierarchy and you don't
even have to know if it's if it's higher
if it's going to be persistent in fact
we've done that before we don't know if
it's persistent but later on we decide
oh we want that news feed you know that
news feed we're changing it on a daily
basis instead of every every week like
we thought we'll make that persistent I
just create a admin interface into it so
that we can change it dynamically on the
fly it is it's that easy like you sharp
the persistent server make sure it's
running and anything you want to be
persistent all you have to do is on that
mate receipt turn on a setting that says
persistent and now that matrices
persistent oh it's a working alpha it's
another technology that yes like we're
saying it's there's so much going on but
hopefully the the beta will be out in
about a month or two and that's that's
the real power of hierarchy it's one
technology for multiple uses so one
technology is doing XML configuration
files spring-like functionality where
it's collecting settings together
object relational mapping which is
different from persistence now you you
know that's that's mapping because it is
still important to map to legacy
databases in our systems true
persistence and think about that so it
all like we're saying almost any
technology a lot of technologies can do
double duty and do and cover a lot of
situations but this technology it covers
all these situations and does each very
well we believe if you think about the
reason is because the key to all these
different technologies is hierarchical
data that's that was the missing link
like I think we thought that like link
was a great technology but it really
missed it that hierarchical data is is
the central key to everything I think
should be built around that knot around
query so the future of hierarchy
finished the beta 2 fixes finished
persistence very important like
Alexander was talking about IDE
integration is extremely important
ease-of-use syntax checking since text
suggestions a view language so it is
since just a minor feature bullet if you
want to create matrices that are our
views into other matrices like view
tables this is a very useful technology
and it could also define it so it's
either static or dynamic link hibernate
like functionality again also being
developed
we already talked about this matrices
are not static they're not XML there are
actually dynamic data the are actual
data structures so you can also assign
values to them so that you just don't
need to use them just like static XML
you could actually use them like a real
data structure and this is this is
probably the biggest issue that we face
user adoption if people don't use these
technology then it's pretty much
worthless it's the this is you it this
is the crux of everything so we're
trying to avoid creating code that's
buggy and poorly implemented we've we
actually followed the the Apple
methodology as opposed to Amazon and
Google which I greatly respect but we
thought that we would try to polish it
as much as we can I release it instead
of releasing a product very quickly and
just iterating so a lot of time has been
spent to polish the medical Pilar tough
to work with ease of use you know this
is a very intricate technology with lots
going on so we designed the language and
the medical Pilar to be very easy to use
these are very key principles that have
supporting tools IDE integration very
important oh and it's not effective if
nobody knows about hierarchy so that's a
very important aspect it's not open
source right now but we do plan to
release open source of the future this
was a really difficult decision because
you know it's been four years three
which we were completely unpaid so
there's been a lot of financial and and
just just a lot of time that we spent on
this so we actually work on a release it
open source but we realize that user
adoption is the most important issue so
we will but right now we're trying to
work with open source companies to see
if they'll buy our product so we can
release
you know pay off some debt hi and this
is this is only thirty percent of what
we had planned for the product for
instance we can't talk about everything
but we wanted to create an Excel like
tool so you can edit the matrices using
an IDE and if you think about that and I
know I don't know if everybody's used as
but opencms it's not very well
implemented but the idea was great is
that xml config files are the heart of
everything and you don't have to create
admin interfaces because you can edit
the xml using a excel like editor so i
think the same thing could happen with
matrices we're going to we're also
planning on creating new architectural
language elements so extending hierarchy
to support well support higher level
architectural constructs and then
integrating that into the ide and then
this is a this is just more of an
interesting one not a great like
technology that will change much but
you're placing jsps with a new tool that
translates that doesn't have to just
output HTML well GSP zone but isn't just
creating HTML but can generate anything
so you can use a JSP like language to
generate java or cobol or whatever so
that a because there are situations that
we found that if you do want to create
very optimized code you can generate
really streamline optimized java code
using technologies like this and what's
what's more high performance than code
that's specifically custom-designed
without any high brilliant layers and
out all these all these layers that are
working with it it's very high
performance
so here's our message contribute your
time please because we as you can see
there's so much work that needs to be
done it's really at a crucial stage if
we don't you don't need to know
compilers to work on us in fact
compilers is probably only ten percent
of the work that you need to do so we
just need good developers and I think
like I hope you you see that that the
people that have joined on this project
they understand that this technology is
at a point that it could really change
java you could really change programming
in general I think we think that it it
has a potential to have a greater impact
than link and JSON did on their
technologies and I we feel that they had
a great impact on their technologies so
thank you for your time Oh
