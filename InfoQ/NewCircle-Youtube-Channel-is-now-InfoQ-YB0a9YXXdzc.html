we've got some exciting news to share
with you today about this channel going
forward and today this channel will be
brought to you by in fakey after many
years of new circle service and
developers with ADD free educational
videos on a range of development topics
in folk you will be picking up the
mission to provide free educational and
innovative content from practitioners
from today your natus that this channel
will be named in fakey to tell you a bit
more about this news I have with me
Floyd co-founder and CEO forum thank you
and Max director of media marketing for
new circle Floyd max thanks very much
for time SIMEX
could you give us a quick background on
the new circle channel and the content
you've offered yeah so we started a
channel back in I started 20 2011 and at
the time here in San Francisco there was
all these great technical meetups going
on conferences you know just people here
named really cool things and we kind of
you know we would go to these events and
would see all this great material being
presented we wanted to get out there and
share the everyone else and so that's
why we started doing we started going
and filming these meetups and you know
start connecting with conferences and
getting that stuff out there and it
turned out people were really enjoying
it and from there just kind of
organically we started on you know as
new circles of training company and as a
training company we had access to a lot
of really smart developers and teachers
and we started putting them in front of
the camera and and you know creating
these sort of original tutorials that we
thought we would find really interesting
and and that's kind of how we got
started but you know it's always been
about it's always been about the content
first and and it's always been about you
know focusing on the on the technical
aspects and I think that's why really
excited to hand it off to in you to
kind of kind of carry the torch because
I think you guys have very similar
mission statement you know it's NARS was
always you know educating the world and
open-source development and I think you
guys are doing something you know very
similar you know you can't you got your
contest definitely saw it and I think
you are gonna are gonna get some great
stuff out there for people enjoy that's
great thanks max
and Floyd just wonder maybe if you could
just give a brief history of in fakie
just talking about you know who in
you supports and the type of content is
provided yeah so you started in
2005 and we wanted to do a developer
media company that was sort of by
developers for developers without all
the kind of marketing cruft and all the
the ways that other media companies were
just putting the advertisers first so
we're all technical here I have a
computer science background as well and
and kind of what Nixon fuck-you
different is that it's actually by
literally all the writers are full-time
developers who've learned your lucic
style news and do that in their spare
time and all the articles are also
written by practitioners and and with
the videos which is a good segue to to
here is that we've actually been having
a very similar mission to what a new
circle was doing with a YouTube channel
but we were doing that on info cuso4
since the beginning we've been filming
more than a dozen conferences a year and
putting all the videos online for free
on in focu not including our own q con
but as well as other events as well so
kind of like we would matches them with
a new circle this channel was sort of
like our strategy in parallel in a
difference and medium so that's why this
transition seems to make more sense and
Floyd that the sort of content that you
sort of mentioned I mean what what can
subscribers expect to see going forward
and and how is it really going to help
that this or software developers and
leaders yeah so we're continuing to post
most of the videos we filmed to info
queue but our plan at the moment is to
take a selection of the best ones the
ones that tend to get the biggest
traffic spikes on em you and post
those roughly two per week to the
YouTube channel going forward as well as
video versions of all of our podcasts
because we have a very popular couple
set of podcasts that just launched only
like six months ago and are already
getting over 10,000 plays a week so
we'll be putting the podcast versions on
YouTube as well because you know it's
YouTube as on the phone is actually a
good app to play almost anything and
we're gonna take it from there and see
how that works out and probably expand
and launch more things in the future but
that's how we're gonna start off with
the channel for now it's great and for
those that may not have heard about in
 you or Q con I mean where where
could people go and find out a bit more
about
yeah infocomm of we've been publishing
technical media for over 10 years using
articles and videos and QQ conferences
calm you can find the next QQ cons and
yeah so and I was just especially
grateful for the work you know Maxine
new circle is done on the channel I
think you can tell when people do things
from a sense of mission it's not just a
business channel so you know we take in
for Q the same way so this channel will
be treated the same way so hopefully all
the new circle subscribers find a good
new home with within you serving
them it's great thanks again for you tie
in flew to max and thanks for watching
subscribe to this channel if you haven't
already so you don't miss out on the new
educational videos that we share in very
thanks very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
