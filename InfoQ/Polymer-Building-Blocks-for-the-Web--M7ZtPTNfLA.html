exciting it's a game changer in the way
we developed for the web and hopefully
by the end of tonight you see a little
bit of what I'm going to show you and
Matt's going to demo some really cool
stuff you'll hopefully fall in love with
the stuff just as much as I have so a
little bit about myself so you know
who's yappin at you up here my name is
Eric bidelman and I'm a developer
programs engineer at Google which
basically means I come out I speak to
developers I talked to them about really
cool stuff on the web platform the new
hotness is web components so that's
really what I'm excited about these days
and that's what I'm kind of focusing on
there's totally a lot of stuff to learn
I think there's you know a number of new
API is coming to the browser's near you
so if you want to learn more about all
this stuff that I'm going to kind of
cover at a very high level check out
html5 rocks there's a lot of really good
detailed articles their tutorials you
know you can also feel free to ping me
at any time at a bottle as Twitter on my
google plus there's a blog don't go
there and never right there it's not
much happening but yeah there's gonna be
a lot of stuff sort of thrown at your
face in the next 20 25 minutes if you
want to know more about polymer and
follow us at polymers are is our twiddle
twitter handle so feel free to to hit
that up so what's the need for web
components how many people have even
heard of web components Oh awesome sweet
okay my job is is totally done here but
they're actually solving some really
really interesting problems when
developing for the web how many people
have been like a web developer more than
like 10 15 years all right so you guys
have learned like all the crop the web
is brought like all these crazy API is
over the years things have changed quite
a bit this is a problem right this is a
real problem once upon a time you kind
of have to understand where would you
come from the order saying where we're
going so once upon a time right this is
this is our web platform this is really
cool so it's been pieced together like
over the years like you know people have
some duct tape I a tape measure like
somebody's nailed in the the corners of
our platform and over time what happened
was oh my gosh we got html5 like this is
going to solve all the problems
of web development it's going to bring
us all these api is going to cure cancer
like you insert whatever and it's really
going to work and yes we got a we got a
lot of stuff right we got geolocation
and all these new capabilities so our
platform as web developers got much more
mature we could do much much more with
it and then over over time what happened
the last you know three years or
whatever we started adding more and more
and more awesome stuff so this is things
like WebGL and WebRTC and some really
really awesome capable api's that the
web platform needed in order to you know
compete and really do well but what what
about us like regular developers I this
is this feels like overkill like how
many people use the Web Audio API
everyday know how many people write
JavaScript everyday and HTML every day I
I do myself so what about us regular
developers right like what what
developer productivity tools are the
browser vendors building in for us not
just these slick api's that do really
really awesome stuff but but what are
like the low level primitives that we
can we can build our you know complex
applications on top of so this is where
the web components kind of journey
started started actually four years ago
this is a long time ago and so Dimitri
glass cup I I consider him like The
Godfather web components so he and a few
others that Google got together and
started brainstorming like what what
does the web platform need in order to
make developers more productive what are
we missing what are the one of the api's
and so he sent this email to to the
public web apps mailing list like four
years ago saying hey you know a few of
us have been thinking about some things
we should add that every you know modern
platform out there has things like
templating and data binding shadow Dom
right this is being able to encapsulate
in scope certain Dom to a very
particular area and this is like this is
what started it all and actually it's
really kind of cool to look back and see
this like not much has changed we now
have templating we now have shadowed
them this is what web components is
bringing to the table so that was where
the journey started so they were like
hey you know we have this awesome you
know html5 all these new capabilities
let's think about what we can do to
strip that back let's let's take it to
the bare minimum what api's can we
identify that are going to make the next
generation of framework the next
generation of web applications and so
this is where the web component sort of
specifications were born thinking
through these issues and what's really
cool about the all these api's is
they're really useful each and every one
by themself but together they really
form like a cohesive story as far as
building components for the web so
developers can you note we can do
whatever they want they can build the
next generation of ember angular or
insert whatever framework you want on
top of these primitives that's really
what this is all about is standardizing
the way we do stuff all right so web
components to me there are a set of
emerging standards that allow developers
to extend HTML and to tell the browser
essentially about new markups new tags
and also give it extra functionality so
whatever you want to do whatever you can
dream up you can tell the browser about
and essentially it's exactly like that
tag existed in the browser natively
that's what web components are and it's
really really important I can't
emphasize enough like everything you're
going to see today about polymer about x
tags whatever web component library is
out there it's all based on these
standards they're all w3c standards so
there's standards at the bottom of all
this cool magic stuff we've done in
polymer so what are those standards so
there's four main ones when we talk
about web components the first is
templates so I try to live code this so
this is a new tag this is a new tag we
get for free in the browser we can use
this and anything that goes inside of
this tag is essentially inert we can
scaffold out sections of dom and then
clone those and use those for later so
its proper templating finally in the
browser there's no kind of crazy string
hacks custom elements so being able to
actually tell the browser I want to
declare this this X dash tabs new tag or
this crazy scaffold tag you can do that
you can tell the browser about this new
element can give it an API then people
can use and call that API shadow down
this is really really cool so for the
first time ever we have the ability to
actually scope CSS to a component so any
styling you put in a web component and
you mark up you put in a web component
is all encapsulated and logically part
of that component so this is really
great right if you if you build a
component you don't want styles to leak
out you don't want your page Styles to
believe in and affect the way you know
your your hard-earned styling and your
markup has been presented and last one
is really cool it's it's very simple API
so
this is the ability to use the link tag
but instead of link rel stylesheet we
have link rel import and so I can give
this thing an HTML file and that HTML
file can be included on my page contains
JavaScript it contains markup it
Canadians CSS so it's a great way to
bundle you know if you're building
component with all these different
pieces bundle all that up and then
deliver that to end users so it's a
great way to share web components and
for others to then distribute web
components so all these together again
can be totally used by themselves you
can use the template tag by itself can
you shadow down by itself but really
when you package all this together which
is what which is what polymer is done
and we're totally like relying on the
stuff we really believe in it that's
when things get really magical browsers
support this is the biggest question we
always get when is this stuff going to
land in that one browser browser
supports actually pretty good this was a
totally different a year ago so this
stuff is moving very very fast and you
can see some up-and-comers like Firefox
is implementing a lot of these as we
speak there's open bugs for each of
these api's but through the magic of
polyfills right thanks javascript we can
actually polyfill all of these so
there's no excuse in 2014 not to try and
use web components all those available
via the polyfills the polymer team is
put together so that's the platform
that's the core api's when we talk about
web components I want to focus on custom
Elam's I think this is really sort of
the foundational piece of what we're
trying to do to understand is you
actually have to take another journey
back in time so this is today and will
you know take our time machine back to
nineteen eighty eight when the web or
Google at least Google look like this so
it's very primitive very simple and your
web app looked like this right this is
really cool this is like state of the
art at the time you know the browser
looked a little different and a web
application at the time was a form right
that's all we really had we had markup
you can input your name could even put
your last name there's this little cool
select tag that had this like magical
drop-down widget thing that's kind of
cool I just declare some stuff from my
page and I get that for free radio
buttons and the submit form that was a
web app that's all we had oh yeah so
Clippy Clippy or sorry select you select
e is clippings cousin he's gonna he's
gonna
the web page on the internet this is
exciting so back then right elements
were declarative and everything was an
element so we only had market we didn't
really have JavaScript or CSS we just
had markup and we have forms we had
selects select is a really good example
of sort of conceptualizing web
components it's super declarative right
I declare this little thing on my page
select I throw in some option tags and
somehow magically the browser knows to
render this magical component so this is
like the first example of a component
it's just native to the browser it's
part of the native UI and it's got you
know check marks for the things that are
selected it's got these hover states
when I went to interact with it and it's
got this drop-down and all I do is again
declare this on my page and I get all
this default UI for free that's pretty
cool it's really simple to use as a user
these elements are we're also
configurable at the time so if you take
select again right if you put a disabled
attribute on option or a selected
attribute on the option tag this
actually is meaningful this does
something so I'm not writing any
JavaScript to interact with this thing
the browser is just magically knowing to
you know disable those first couple
options and then that last one is to
selected by default so this is cool
because selectees saying hey we're
configuring this thing right this this
widget this component via attributes
just regular markup and not script super
into it if you know exactly what is
happening by reading this right and
attributes can also you know exist on
other elements if you if you move them
one level up and you and you actually
put them on select you give it a size 4
and you give it the multiple attribute
now we don't have that drop-down anymore
we actually have you know multi select
widget so based on the things I actually
configure this this widget is selected
with it's changing the way it renders
itself somehow magically totally
transparent to us but that's super cool
these things are also composable so what
does that mean well select right you can
throw in option tags that's one thing it
knows how to deal with but you can also
throw in the OP group element right so
if you want to you can actually group
different things together so this is
cool it doesn't only recognize selects
it actually does something different
based on the fact that we give it a
different element a different tag so you
can imagine these things being composed
over time and different elements
reacting based on the children elements
that are contained
side of them selectee super excited
about this one and select itself right
you can compose this into a larger
application as well you can put select
inside of form and you know some black
magic happens all of a sudden like when
you submit this form the size the size
parameter gets submitted with that form
so the browser is smart enough to know
somehow how to deal with that stat is
pretty sweet elements have api's as well
right not everything makes sense in
markup I'm certainly not saying that but
take select that again as an example
right what interesting things happen
when someone select something out of
that those options you get you get a
change event right so this thing fires
events it does something useful and it
also has things in JavaScript like a
selected index property or an options
array that you can get at and you can
tweak right if you need to and so
there's other capabilities here not
everything makes sense and markup so you
might need some extra power under the
hood so what happens this seems pretty
cool like this is really easy intuitive
to use as a web developer will this
happen this totally happened in a major
way this is if you open up the dev tools
this is gmail right one of I think one
of the the most sophisticated web apps
out there and you open it up you look at
the element inspector and you see a
bunch of divs that's awesome we call it
dip soup right div soup I don't know how
to read this you know I don't know how
to maintain this as a developer I have
no idea what this is what this means
even I know they've purposely obfuscated
at some of this but it's just it's not
semantics it doesn't actually describe
what the application is doing and that's
terrible this another side of the fence
to write in the JavaScript world we said
okay markups not going to like do the
things we needed to do it's not going to
keep up with the application of today so
let's just write you know crap ton of
JavaScript to to fill the need this is
an example of Google pluses photo
application so we just kept piling
piling on more and more JavaScript a
really really good example of this is if
you just look at at abs component right
this is like the quintessential sort of
component that every UI framework out
there has right at little tabs widget so
what happened over the years is that we
started with a bunch of markup right we
have divs we've given it maybe some some
fragment IDs to kind of signify what the
tab right and at the bottom we wrote a
little bit of JavaScript that says
okay somehow magically go fetch this
thing out of the Dom you know call this
tabs constructor and render yourself
somehow into like this tab strip widget
and so what's happened over the years if
is we progressively gotten away from
that so as as time went on right
everyone I don't care what framework you
are developed their own way to write a
tabs component so as a web developer
right like I have no idea how I have to
go learn each of these different api's
they're all different some are have more
markup than others some use more
JavaScript than others but this is
really daunting right and so the problem
with the web is that there's been no
standard way to actually create
components frameworks have to roll their
own solutions and so that is where web
components come in it's standardizing
this ability to be able to actually use
the same API is under the hood to create
your component system here's a really
primitive example of a web component
right instead of writing all that crazy
markup and JavaScript you as a user as a
developer you're dropping into X tabs
tag on your page you fill it with some X
tabs with you know whatever is supposed
to be plural those panels and that's how
it's like the future of your tabs
component and that's how easy it is
maybe more practical examples something
like Google Maps right this is a really
awesome complex JavaScript API but you
can imagine this in the world of web
components where it's all declarative
and i'm not writing actually any
JavaScript I'm just plopping this this
google maps tag on my page and voila
what you get is of course a map right
you're just a clear this on your page
and under the hood somehow it's
generating that map using the JavaScript
API so it just as in the case of select
right we can write a web we can create
the google map web component tell the
browser about it and it can be
configured using attributes just like
the Select right with disabled and
selected so in this case this google map
element knows about the latitude and
longitude attributes that you give it
and when you do that we declare them of
course it centers itself on those
latitude and longitude just as you would
expect it's got a zoom attribute that we
can use to configure it as well so you
know when I set zoom y equals 15 it does
that somehow under the hood using the
API calls but again as a user I'm just
this is what I declare my page and I get
this for free we talked about
composability right with select you can
drop in options and you can drop in op
group tags
with the google map tag you can drop in
google dash map marker so this is a
element that knows how to render a
google marker to the map the underlying
map it's in so that's significant right
because the fact that this tag is within
this this google map tag means that hey
you should be rendering this marker to
that location and you can totally read
this you know exactly what this
application is doing another thing I
want to point out is that you know we
actually have the capability now to
reuse other parts of the web platform so
if you look at this this marker tag you
have the title attribute right this is a
standard HTML attribute that you can put
on almost any HTML tag and we can use
that in this as well when we're creating
custom elements we're creating web
components and apologize if you guys
can't see in the live stream or back
there but I've rendered the google map
marker to use that title right on the
outside somebody declares this it makes
the underlying API call under the hood
for me but I don't I don't care how the
Google Maps API works I just use it like
this another thing it's doing is I set
the draggable the html5 drag-and-drop
API draggable to true which allows me to
drag this market knows how to update
itself and to you know allow it to have
to be draggable under the hood and we
can add a bunch of different you know
markers to this this one happens to be
off screen right at the the Giants
stayed in their way over there but we
can fix this right really easy we can
expose this as a declarative API to
users if i want i can add the ability
for users that specify shrink to markers
this is an attribute awesome way to
configure this and then anytime i add a
marker child to this map it just knows
to do the right thing right so it's a
totally declarative API surface for that
underlying API call in the Maps API so
that's a really powerful stuff right
this is sort of my vision of the future
of how to use a Google Maps API think
it's a really powerful one so this
enables a lot a lot of stuff when you
think declaratively and less imperative
lee the first is like you've seen right
you can declare things and everything
you saw is super descriptive you know
exactly what it's supposed to do based
on its configuration and attributes that
that you're seeing declared things are
composable so you can imagine you know
creating a component that does something
very very particular but then composing
that and using that and reusing that in
other context to get different
functionality
that's what you saw with the maps marker
element scoping is like the coolest like
like underdog feature I think when we
talk about all this stuff scoping is
really really awesome for the first time
ever we have the ability to scope CSS to
a component so again things don't bleed
out and your page Styles don't bleed in
this is really really awesome we've
never had that ability before unless
you're using something like an iframe
which is totally heavyweight and not
really the correct solution for
something like this the other piece of
this is the ability to define an API in
an element right you can call and users
can tap into that API so you're not
you're not building applications so much
in the global namespace anymore you're
kind of thinking about a very particular
problem creating a component for it and
then people can use that API that you've
you've created so this opens up new ways
to think about HTML like we've kind of
like you know push it under the rug
because it hasn't really done anything
for us for so long but but now we as
developers can actually you know tell to
do whatever we want we can define new
vocabulary for the browser it's really
important to think about sort of what
exists today and sort of what we can
build in the future so I want you to
think about this this is like a really
good example of some of the UI elements
right things if you declare in your page
like the input tag or the Select tag
progress elements a new thing in html5
very cool button you know the video
player has this really magical little
control widget that that we get for free
just by declaring a video tag these
things all render you I right as a user
you know of this web page I can see
these these are visual to me they
represent something but there's this
whole sort of other side to to mark up
into HTML that we don't really think
about but you use every day right you
use things like the title tag and the
link tag in the style tag these are
things that don't actually render
anything to the user to the browser but
they're important to us as developers
right we use these so for instance like
the script tag right whatever you put
inside of it it knows the browser knows
to do something with that and what it
does is the value its JavaScript and
runs out under the hood so we can do the
exact same thing right with custom
elements if you're building a web
component here's a gap example a
firebase element that the polymer team
is created we thought Farber's is really
cool so why not wrap it up in a web
component some of that functionality if
someone declares the
every base element on their page they
give it a location and you can tell it
to handle as JSON or vice versa and this
is really cool because I'm not writing
any code i'm just literally declaring it
to my page and then attaching events so
all your same trick supply in the world
of web development right add a vital in
sonora query selector it's all part of
this because ultimately what we're doing
is just telling the browser about a new
Dom element another example is
geolocation I can configure it with a
watch position a high accuracy attribute
and under the hood it's doing all those
crazy you know multiple levels of
callbacks that the geolocation API has
but as a user I'm just listening for
that geo response event and then you
know using its latitude and longitude so
an entirely new way in the description
you're a declarative surface area for
actually interacting with libraries and
api's and services what this actually
rains in is a whole new opportunity for
interoperability and what I mean by that
is you can imagine a case where you know
Mozilla it for instance has their their
ex tags library which is a web
components library that allows you to
polyfill custom elements you can imagine
using their ex flip box tag which is
just a tag that basically you put some
content in and when you click it it just
does a 360 or 180 you can imagine using
that with an element that's created
using polymer a polymer tabs element and
the fact that these are just Dom the
fact it's just markup and the browser
totally understands all that means that
these can interact very very well with
each other for the first time we have
that ability to throw a bunch of stuff
on a page and not have to worry about
things kind of exploding so that's
awesome I say interoperability on by
default and because it's all done
because every frame work out there
understands it now this also means we
have first-class devtools support which
is kind of cool too this is an example
of our polymer project org website and
in that we have this little tabs
component it's actually implemented
using polymer and so if I click you know
click around you get a source view and
you can click between the different the
different views of the source code but
what's neat about this is since it's all
markup since it's all DOM and you know
the devtools actually no really that
stuff really really well you can open up
the inspector all right and I can drill
down into it I can select nose out of
Dom I can poke around
you know I can actually bring up the
console and you know dynamically use its
API so I'm switching this tell this
element select attribute and you can see
it's updating the actual component
because it's on the page it's a first
class citizen in in a browser I've well
it's can I do so I can i can actually
style this right i can use the dev tools
inspector to actually style this because
it's again it's just mark up so we can
use CSS just like we normally would and
you can poke around you can discover its
API it's got a panels array that it
exposes it's got an updates panel
function that I can call so the fact
that we can actually like use the tools
that are built into the browser now I
think is actually really exciting
something else we get is extensibility
and I just want to briefly touch upon
this because I think it's actually
really hard in like other frameworks BML
to extend from something this is a
really complex problem so polymer
actually makes this even easier than
like the native vanilla JavaScript way
of doing this I'll take the google map
example that you saw before I actually
didn't create that map element but what
I did was I extended it to learn how to
render markers on the map so in polymer
what you do is you create a new tag call
it map with markers and it extends an
existing tag so extends the google map
tag and so then now what I can do when
I'm you know implement the JavaScript
under the hood is I can then use this
tag exactly as you expect in exactly as
you saw so it's cool because I didn't
you know I don't know anything about
rendering a map or anything but I do
know how to extend it and I was easily I
was very capable of doing that just
without know any details of what
somebody else do I can I can extend
their stuff now another thing you can do
is actually extend like the native stuff
in the browser as well if you're not
happy and I don't I don't know anybody
that is with the native controls like
select and button you can extend them
using a custom element so you can say ok
button you're going to be a super button
using this is attribute so you can
imagine you know adding an API to the
button or styling it differently and so
when somebody declares this on their
page they're going to get that like
supercharged super awesome but instead
of the you know the crappy one that we
have so this is the new universe that
we're creating with web components I
think it's a really really awesome and
exciting one it's super declarative
it's in taraba Liz extensible this is
actually a demo of what of using web
components John mcCutchan on the dart
team actually used the polymer dart port
and he's got a WebGL library and I know
nothing about WebGL I know nothing about
3d programming but he wrapped all of his
API calls in custom elements in HTML and
so you just declare this sort of 3d
scene in markup and of course I can go
in here and edit these live in the dev
tools and it just knows right to do the
right thing I'm not calling any WebGL
I'm just changing HTML to update the 3d
scene which is really really cool I
think that's really powerful piece again
I am NOT a 3 programmer I can also go up
right i can change one of these these
texture elements that he's created and
it just takes a source to an image if i
update that in the dev tools to point to
a new source of course the WebGL under
the hood knows what to do so Ron Swanson
wants you guys to go componentized the
web he thinks this is super awesome I
think it's super awesome I'm going to
throw it over to Matt to talk about
polymer in particular and so you some
really cool demos feel free to hit me up
on any of those channels and I think
we'll have time for for Q&amp;amp;A afterwards
too so thanks guys
alright so my name is Matt McNulty I'm
the lead manager for polymer which is
part of the chrome team at Google as I
work with Eric formerly I was part of
webos we wrote the NGO framework Ares
tool and worked on the touchpad a bunch
of stuff like that my Twitter handles
there if you want to hit me up if you
happen to be in two period really bad
period dramas in the UK and you're a
teenage girl you might think I'm a
different Matt McNulty but that's not me
so feel free to hit me up there and
drown them out so it is a nice ego
stroke though because they say they love
me all the time so I'm gonna do a quick
demo so this is a bit of a live coding
demo even though I'm going to use a tool
so if I make a typo or something like
that feel free to don't be shy be
interactive and shout it out so this is
a tool we wrote in polymer it's been
kind of slowly evolving over the last
year or so it happens to just be a
really good way of showing off web
components and components in general but
you know it's again it's not really like
the polymer thing that we're we're
pushing it's just a tool that we use to
show it off so Eric talked about the
google maps that component that we have
and i figured i would actually just show
how to build a little app using it using
polymer so we've got a this is like your
usual 4gl ide kind of thing so you got a
palette of components down the left hand
side a canvas in the middle and the
property inspector on the right that
lets you set things it's pretty simple
pretty straightforward again this is
probably like a couple weeks of effort
to build the tool and we really just use
it to show off the polymer and what's
really cool is you can drag stuff off
and because components can be kind of
arbitrarily complex I can get something
really cool like this whole app scaffold
just by dragging one thing off the
pallet and if I could look at the code
for this it actually drags out this
markup which kind of matches what you
saw in Eric's presentation just from
dragging that one thing out
alright so we're going to build a little
Maps app so I brought up that scaffold
and I'll drag out a few other things
drag out a search field because you know
it's google you got to have searched
it's required in every one of our demos
it's not actually true I come at the
text field and give you a little hint
tax and you know maps have satellite
views and they have road map views will
give a way to switch that around and if
I come up here the components folder
I've got a google map element this is
exactly the same google map element that
Erika's showing off I can tell it to
maximize in there and you'd save got a
google maps app I can change the title
around because i'm kind of a
perfectionist this is cool the map and
you can see the properties of the map
has is latitude and longitude a bunch of
other things and has this map type which
lets you switch it around so this you
know this maps component has a metadata
file that tells the designer what
options it has and that's how it's
getting this information but it also has
this little link icon next to it so
instead of selecting that value is a
developer you can use data binding to
bind it to something else so in this
case I'm going to take that menu that
we've got and bind it to the selected
value so now if i switch back and forth
it's actually hooked up so that's pretty
cool but again we have a corporate
mandate we have to demonstrate search so
here we drag out a search component this
is one of those non visual components
eric was talking about so didn't really
show up on the screen but it shows up
down here in this little tree view and
in this case I have to give it a pointer
to the map element on the page just so
it knows where to find it and that's
google map map and we can actually set
the search query to be bound to this
text field that i put up here that's a
search in it
you
and set to the value of property all
right and then if I come back to the map
when we actually search for something we
want the map to go to it so I'm going to
set the latitude and longitude of the
map to the search results so I go to the
search component as a result dot
latitude this is where you all have to
be looking out for typos and set the
longitude to the results longitude so
now if I come over here and type Paris
you actually see that's Paris and it's
all bound together and I can save it and
it's actually just created a polymer
element with all that stuff in it and I
can actually preview it we have a little
Google Maps app it's cool it's got if
you shrink it down i'm getting full
screen it would kind of screw things up
if I shrink it down it's actually
responsive so the menu flips to
something that's hidden on a phone size
screen and it's actually pretty cool but
since this dude this went off without a
hitch will try and expand things a
little bit i'm going to drag off a
youtube search video maximize it go up
to the parent arrange that a little bit
better and in this case you can you can
bind a query to this i'm filling lucky
property which makes this we have to be
really tricky about what you demo
because you have no idea what's going to
come up first on youtube but generally
you're going to get cats so it'll
probably be okay and i can bind it to
that same value so now if you type in
Paris it shows you a walking guide of
Paris so that's pretty cool you come
back to the code you realize any weight
this is actually just a you know about
what 20 lines of code or so of markup
and you see lots of data binding and
things like that that Eric was showing
you in there so that seems pretty cool
it seems like a very very little code
and actually no JavaScript at all just a
single a shell of a prototype to polymer
so how did I do that polymer that's why
you're all here what is polymer
it's a tool no it's not polymer is a
library utilizing web components for
building elements and applications all
right so Eric talked all about web
components this polymer is the first
library to really use these things now
but really what does that mean that was
a bunch of buzz words in a sentence so
polymer is a new kind of thing right so
actually I was here you know about an
hour early and someone I got to witness
someone asking what polymer was at the
back of the room and turnarounds I
didn't want to spoil it because I wanted
to hear what the other person said and
they actually did a pretty good job of
like no this isn't like things that have
come before right this is a different
different kind of thing this is the
future this is hoverboards this is what
we've been promised right and it's it's
kind of appropriate because it's it's
back to the future right like Alex or
Eric was talking about you know select
statements and building apps out of
components again it's really back to
that feature like you know what you
thought the HTML was going to be like
back then I'm the only thing out there
that's even remotely similar right now
as x tags right and we've actually work
with them pretty closely something's not
particularly well known it's pretty
pretty hidden on our websites is a
exercise uses the same polyfill library
underneath that we wrote to do their own
stuff so polymer users web components
Eric did a pretty good job of explaining
that and the big thing is polymer
doesn't paper over the platform right so
the polymer team is kind of the I want
to say you know if we put it nicely the
resident web developer team on Chrome
captive would be maybe another term in
certain days you know we're the guys the
browser vendors actually typically do
the people building the browser or
actually not the people using the
browser to develop on there's very few
web developers who also build browsers
and vice versa so we're kind of unusual
in that way so we were brought here to
Google and said you know we've got this
new thing called web components we want
to see if you guys can use it to build
kind of the next generation of these
things you see if you can build
something that doesn't paper over the
platform that uses these new baked in
technologies to make to make life
simpler for developers and really use
the native platform because like the you
know the hypothesis is the platform
doesn't really need this anymore so wait
isn't polymer frame work isn't it you
know just like angularjs or ember or
whatever all those things ha no so this
the framework is actually dumb so it's
returning back to using the platform
again I'm going to say this like seven
more times and the component model or
the garrick was talking about the
component model is custom elements in
this case so it's something that's
provided natively we don't actually have
to create our own in JavaScript or
anything else or on the server we have
custom elements on the page now and
that's our component model and then
scoping is provided by shadow Dom so
people see the name shadow DOM and they
hear encapsulation and they think that
this is like a really secure boundary
it's just something I want to point out
shadow Dom isn't secure you're not
running in a different JavaScript
context it actually is just providing
scoping so IDs are similar or scope to
the element CSS a scope to the element
this is the introduction of classes to
HTML basically but you know you can
still poke in there and penetrate that
boundary if you really have to so it's
not not something for secure so are you
hating on frameworks no we even wrote a
bunch so we were at any o people in a
team wrote dojo so we've been in this
for a really long time we came to Google
to try and prove that you know use what
we know to make it so no one ever else
to do it again and there's a ton of
great jsf jazz frameworks out there
right now you know honestly there's a
lot of Awesome developers with building
Jas frameworks who could probably be
building other things if the platform
was just sufficient so we believe it's
you know it's kind of time to change
that so polyfills so a little note about
polyfills so we have all these polyfill
so you can use web components today
right it makes eric slide look really
pretty it kind of shows everything off
and that's really what it is it's a
bridge to make it so that you can use
these things today in browsers that
don't otherwise support them using
javascript there were a ton of work
they're actually all we worked on for
about the first ten months up until just
before I Oh last year so because they
are a lot of work and because we work on
them for so long we first started
showing off polymer that was most of
what we had so a lot of people assume
that that that's what polymer was
polymer is actually not the polyfill the
polyfills are things that are supposed
to go away that aren't really specific
to polymer at all so even though we
built them they're not polymer and
polyfills the other important bit
everyone always asked me
what's the performance of blah blah blah
polyfill an ex browser and the thing is
if you could write a polyfill that was
really really performant there'd be no
need for the native feature so the real
goal of polyfills is compatibility now
it turns out you know that the
performance isn't that bad I'm polyfills
depending on the browser and situation
it's actually quite good but you know
again it's not really the focus the
focus is so that developers give you
guys can write once and run it across
all these browsers as the native
features are shipped all right so let's
talk about poner some more so polymer is
a sugaring layer use it to build
elements or apps you saw that he saw i
was using polymer elements to build an
app just previously so web components
are really really awesome why did we
have to build polymer so web components
like native primitives are primitive by
design right you want as developers we
want the browser vendors to supply us
with the lowest level most powerful
thing that they can but then we can take
and do it do the most expressive thing
we can out with it we don't want you
know browser vendors try and build
really high level API is the end up
being really restrictive or broken or
you know they don't they don't unlock
usage as much as they could um so using
all these things together on their own
you can you can you know use web
components today in chrome and you can
use them together on their own without
polymer but it's pretty hard there's a
lot of boilerplate are you know
relatively greater boilerplate and
there's a lot of tricks and gaps and
things now the polymers entire goal is
to make that way easier so polymer is
also opinionated like the lower level
parts of the stack are supposed to be
standards not have an opinion polymers
where we're expressing our opinion about
how this stuff should be used but it's
not going to be the only one these are
just conventions and this is our opinion
everyone else is going to have a
different one you know this is the web
component shipping is kind of a big
inflection point in web development and
things that came before and things I
came after are going to look really
really different and we're just kind of
one of the first ones out there but we
aren't going to be one of the only ones
out there so we talked about being
opinionated what's our opinion there's a
couple like key principles this is what
our philosophy is so the first one is
components all the way down so you know
separation of concerns is a key to
scalable applications so if a developer
can focus on a small
all piece of functionality that has one
function and in really really tight
scoping then that's and you build things
out of bigger and bigger elements so
reasonable components compose into
bigger ones as composing the bigger one
just composing the bigger ones that's a
way to build scalable applications and
scoping provided by shadow Dom kind of
enables this composition with jarek talk
to so everything is an element is kind
of something we talk about a lot so
custom elements are our component model
I mentioned that before and we use them
absolutely everywhere so we have UI
elements I should show you some of those
of API is your the firebase element Eric
showed you that even data like we figure
out a little while ago we started
pushing this idea even further you know
why I have your data in JSON which is
kind of the the greatest format if you
had it an element you can do data
binding can do all these cool things
with it that we hadn't really thought
about before so we're a little crazy in
that regard we're pushing it pretty hard
and finally the last philosophical piece
is just less code so don't repeat
yourself it's kind of our mantra no and
the goal is we don't want we want
developers only to write code that's
unique to their own application and data
bindings a big key to that you saw in
the application that I built there was
no JavaScript code being written it was
still a really functional application
all right so there's a bunch of stuff we
talked about is polymer the bottom layer
here is the native browser landscape in
reality you guys know this is a pretty
uneven landscape changes all the time
from browser to browser and from version
to version so in reality this is a
pretty rough thing so we build this
platform layer on top of it so this is
platform jas which i'll show you so this
is the set of polyfills again that
aren't polymer but it's smooth that over
and allow you to write to eat in
constant surface it's going to go away
over time so the goal is you know in a
few years this platform thing is the box
is gone completely it's all part of the
native thing below oops finally polymer
is a thin layer in the middle and that's
where we express our opinion and how do
you work with these things we talked
about that and then elements are the you
know masses of things that are built on
top of all these technologies so when we
talk about polymer polymer is a tool for
building elements there's really two
ways that breaks down and that's using
elements and creating elements so the
majority of people that are going to use
web components are going to go you know
aren't going to be sophisticated
developers and they're going to take you
know they're going to find a calendar
widget like the D HTML calendar widget
that is used in every single website
from the history of time they're going
to plop it on their page and they're not
really going to want to do a lot with it
but people in this room who are more
sophisticated what developers are going
to be obviously more interested in
creating their own so I'll cover the
first one really really quickly so we
have a bunch of UI elements Eric showed
you some of these we're using the core
dash nomenclature we started using
polymer dash for everything and then
also never one started making polymer
elements and they named all their things
polymer dash so we're trying to kind of
show that these things are just names
basis right we're saying these are you
know really highly functional things
that don't have a lot of opinion in them
that are just generally useful so we're
calling them core elements and then a
bunch of non visual elements fire bases
in there somewhere at the bottom yes so
a lot of things that rap API is and
we're really discovering you know people
on Chrome are realizing that the way of
making your API is a lot more user
friendly and developer friendly is by
wrapping them in element wrappers so
polymer actually already has well over
100 elements they'll be a lot more soon
we're kind of just turning to work on
this really heavily and there's just a
few steps you need to use to do it so
first one is to just get the code
somehow we tend to use Bower on the team
but it's not a requirement you can we
have zip files you can use to use github
we have a script that pulls down every
single long we have called pull all but
you know Bower install is pretty cool
we've got Bauer files for JSON files for
everything that pulled down the
dependencies on a big flat list that's
pretty cool then in your HTML file you
include platform jas this is what gives
you the magic and gives you the
polyfills then you import the element
that you want to use using link rel
import it's an HTML import and then you
just use it and that's really all you
have to do and all the sudden the thing
just works you don't have to install
polymer you have to pull that down it's
a dependency of the element so it pulls
it down for you so there's a few things
that we do in polymer to make creating
elements easier so this is a basic
polymer element this is creates an
element called my dash elements which we
use all over the place
and this is kind of the most basic thing
you're going to see right it's got a
template inside the template is the HTML
that gets stamped out when this elements
instantiated so in this case it's just
got some CSS and some HTML and this is
the result so I can inspect this in
devtools like Eric did and you can see
that it's a my dash element but if you
want to do more than that which of
course you do you're going to add a
prototype so just by using this polymer
function you're creating a prototype and
you can add some functionality and
interactivity to this element so in this
case when I click on this guy says howdy
folks and databinding is again a really
big piece of polymer so in this case
we've got the same same element but
we've added a property on the prototype
of owner and give it a name rod because
I stole these slides from him and then
in the in the actual HTML you can use
the double mustache syntax with a
property name and it'll stamp out Rob in
that case and if you do this in a
property it'll be two-way and things
like that it's pretty cool but what if
you want to expose it we have published
properties so in this case if you put it
in the attributes attribute then all of
a sudden the person who uses the owner
only uses the element can specify an
owner that overrides this default owner
Rob and says Alex building the faller so
there's a bunch of other features to
polymer it's all on our website and
various places and not going to bore you
to death with all of it but those are
kind of just the basic pieces so the
first question or you know eighty
percent of the questions we get tend to
be how do I use this with something
either some tool or some framework that
you're familiar with today and there's
kind of a pretty simple way to talk
about this Eric touched on it a little
bit as well so polymer elements are just
custom elements and I put just in quotes
because custom elements are honestly
pretty cool and this is what makes it
special and we like to think about it in
a thinking about the element boundary so
elements are scoped using shadow Dom so
there's this boundary border around the
entire element and so outside that
element if you're looking in it looks
just like a Dom element like Eric showed
you can use this in any other framework
today or any other page you know as long
as you have platforms yes and it's it's
using web components
you can just use this like you use a
select tag and it exposes properties
events and methods exactly as normal
inside the element boundary it's a
different world right that's where you
get all the polymer goodies that's where
you get data binding and none of that
stuff leaks out IDs don't leak out CSS
doesn't leak out scoping doesn't leak
out none of that so this lets us play
really really nicely with a lot of other
projects so kind of a takeaway from this
is this is a really really big new thing
it's kind of the beginning of a new era
or revolution so we're bootstrapping
this ecosystem it's really for everyone
to use right this is we part of the
chrome team we work on web standards
this is really for absolutely everyone
we've created one opinion with polymer
but we expect others to be out there and
what's what's really important is that
you guys all learn to use web components
and kind of learn the power that it's
providing we're building catalogue we're
building catalogs we're building
documentation standards you know there's
new ways to distribute your elements
tooling all that stuff as stuff we're
working on out in in public we've been
on on github fully public from day one
and we're kind of moving on all these
fronts at once we're just a really
little team so let me tell you where
we're going it's pretty simple so we're
in alpha right now we abused the fact
that we were in pre-alpha for a really
long time because these standards were
changing quite a bit we're going to be
in beta wants the native features ship
in one browser so it looks like that
browser is going to be chrome 36 which
is canary right now that's going to
branch into beta I think about two more
weeks so in about 12 weeks when that
reaches the public channel yeah six
weeks and seven weeks on the bridge of
the public channel that's when this
stuff will be finally native in one
browser will probably you know as long
as everything's stable flip the label to
beta at that point and finally how can
you guys help so go to polymer project
and read more you can write to us on
Twitter or you can write to me the actor
on Twitter you can read something bigger
go to stack overflow that's where we
like to push all the questions to so
everyone can see them and build
something right an element like we wrote
that firebase element for the firebase
guys here so you know writing on it you
got an API odds are you know something
you want to expose via custom element
and this is a green field right now if
you build something and share it
lot of people will see it you'll be kind
of one of the first people out there
yeah wrapping API and share with the
world and join our revolution and then
check back soon because we're going to
be at Google i/o it's about a short
short six or seven weeks away at this
point Sarah can I shake our heads will
be there so check us out at polymer
thanks yeah so um this actually is a
much more nuanced question answer than
that it a you know using the polyfills
it works everywhere different native
features are available in different
browsers so everything but HTML imports
an object I'll observe are in chrome 35
gram 36 as those last two things so and
then firefox supports custom elements
and are working on the other pieces
template active uh yeah so you know
we're using Bauer for everything right
now we and you know we're working on
working with that team to kind of change
it to be a little bit more component
friendly but i think that's that's the
goals for us right now so standardized
i'm bauer because it's just a you know
bit the whole point of this is it
doesn't really doesn't provide any new
toys so you can actually just work with
the existing stuff so the npm guys
paying us quite a bit about supporting
mpm as well but right now we're on Bauer
yeah there's been some enthusiastic
developers I put stuff on NPM the
polyfills in particular but we're kind
of investing in bar right now because we
think that is a really awesome solution
for a package manager which would like
matt said bring bring down dependencies
if you don't the war if you want install
core ajax a core firebase or something
just install that and use it which is
really nice sure that's a good question
says to summarize the question for the
stream and everything else the question
is you know google has angular google
has polymer what's the future of kind of
both of those together hmm yeah so I
mean I put angular i put in a category
of really really awesome javascript
frameworks that are out today polymer is
kind of a different thing and in the
future angular has announced that their
angular 20 is going to be heading more
towards a web components feature I think
we have to see how that's going to
evolve we
you talk with them but right now I think
you know by necessity because they're
very very popular they're kind of
focused on today and we're focused kind
of on the future let me let me answer
each question at a time or else we'll
forget so the first one is about
dependency management to a couple things
so we are using Bauer for to define
dependencies and then for when multiple
things were depend on the same same
import HTML imports d Duke based on URL
so if is exact URL so as long as you're
not putting the same dependency across
different CD ends or something like that
the browser will just take care of it
for you and we'll only importance okay
question 2 yes the question is can you
put images inside web components and yes
you put anything anything you want so
we've we've been working we're working
with canvas today I know by component it
all just works cooties you can package
up anything that the web platform RT has
whether it be an API where the beasts
and markup some CSS iframes canvas
object tech whatever you want like you
can package ID up in them people can use
that those yeah so the images are
contained within the shadow Dom of the
component so they're part of it I mean
you could still reference and every
image on a server if you wanted to write
doesn't have to be part of the local
package but yeah it's just it's it's in
the rendered Dom it's part of the local
piece but it's still just an image tag
yeah so we're totally open source so
that's sitting there in a repo called
designer and you can pull that down
using Bower and it will just work we're
working on trying to stand up a version
of it stay tuned literally within maybe
the next week or so yes the question is
either can components contain other
components and where does that stop so
yes absolutely everything I was creating
today was components inside of
components and where does it stop it's
kind of up to you right so it's wherever
it makes sense and generally you know
one rule of foam we use is whether
something could possibly be reused so if
it's reusable you kind of want it to be
a component it's not going to be
reasonable you want it to be out in the
in the light down kind of on the
on the index page we also somewhat
tangential we have a tool it's called
vulcanized it's basically our build tool
for web components and since tooling is
totally new for all this new stuff we
built something to know that does this
and basically what it does is it takes a
list of like if your component depends
on like three other components it takes
all that crushes it into a single file
so if you're worried about network
requests and that sort of thing that
that's our current recommendation for
like a build a build system for
components the question was what about a
lesson SAS and yeah so SAS in the
preprocessed language and stuff the way
I like to think of this is is all of
your web development best practices
don't change or and some of the tools
you use don't change so what Matt didn't
show you saw like an inline style tag
for styling an inline script tag that
called the polymer constructor you can
actually reference like a external JS
file you can reference an external you
know CSS file so if you want to you can
totally right you know your polymer code
in CoffeeScript you can totally right
your CSS and sass and then compile that
down and reference that in your element
yeah so what's the biggest barrier to
adoption so the biggest barrier to
adoption is browser compatibility so the
polyfills are our answer to that you
know again performance is not ideal in a
polyfill and it's kind of not the point
but really honestly web components are
everyone who's tried it this thought is
pretty awesome we've gotten very very
little blow back at all from people that
have seen it before so we're pretty
confident that we've gone to the right
thing yeah so how does how does
restyling work so it works just like any
other Donal in it so there are special
CSS selectors in order to pierce the
shadow Dom boundary so you can use that
to basically theme anything the CSS that
you want to do today yeah the question
is would you is that something as a
component author you'd expose like which
things to restyle yeah so you can do a
lot of things right you can expose
things as as properties right and
methods and do things that way so you
can expose an API that way and there's
also CSS variables once you're kind of
an emerging standard to handle some of
this stuff as well but yeah and then all
else fails obviously the you know the
CSS selectors can do whatever
want I pay it just like today so you
could use you can create custom
attributes that then you could put on
your element that people could then use
for styling purposes you can also use
what mats which we didn't really cover
atolls like you can still poke so shadow
numba doesn't really like it doesn't
block you from everything right as a
developer you can totally still hack you
can totally still poke around get at
stuff inside if you need to where you
can ultimately we always need to tweak
