with new circle I'm here today to talk
about context or the this keyword in
JavaScript it's a small piece of the
JavaScript language but it's really
important and it hangs people up
sometimes because it's a little bit
counterintuitive how this works in
JavaScript so let's take a look at where
this came from why we have it what sort
of problems can come up and how we can
fix them so I'm going to come over here
into my text editor I've got a little
HTML page set up it doesn't really have
much in it because there's not a whole
lot of UI here we're just gonna be
testing out some JavaScript code so I
have HTML text file in the text editor
and over here in the Firefox browser
I've got the file loaded up you can see
it just says hello context world and
it's not really going to have anything
else visual to look at but will be able
to come down here into the Firebug
console and test out our code and see
how it's behaving so where does the
whole this keyword come from well in
JavaScript we might have some object
we're working with like let's say eye
contact and our contact has a first name
and let's say his first name is Joe and
we add into the contact some sort of
function that we want to build to use
that data so we add in a feature called
print name which is gonna be defined as
a function and for now we'll just
console.log the output because we're not
trying to create fancy UI or logic here
we just want to see how this whole thing
is going to work so inside of the print
name function body will say console.log
and okay here's the first question what
goes inside of console dot log so the
first thing we might be tempted to do
especially if we're used to a language
like Java or C sharp is say first name
and the reason we might think about that
is that in those other languages we
think about defining classes and we
think that when we're defining a class
we have implicit access to all of the
members of that class so if I'm defining
a class method in Java I have access to
the class properties like first name but
javascript we have no classes and we're
not defining a class here just to
finding an object and javascript objects
are closer to hashmaps than they are to
classes so just like we wouldn't expect
one entry in a hash map to know anything
about another entry in a hash map in say
Java the print name function here
doesn't really know anything about the
first name member that we created in the
same object and we can check this by
coming over to Firefox loading up our
code and checking that contact has a
first name but if we if we try to do
contact dot print name it blows up and
we get a reference error because the
runtime doesn't know what first name
refers to so there's really no
connection between the first name
definition up here on line 12 and the
reference to a symbol called first name
down here on line 15 so we need to do
something a little bit different so the
next thing we might try to do is put in
contact dot first-name and we know that
if the object is contact we can get it
the first name member by saying contact
first-name so this should work and we
can come over here into Firefox and try
again
contact dot print name and it works we
have Joe being printed out on the
console so so far so good but there's a
little problem lurking in here so
supposing that we were to use a
different symbol to refer to this
contact say new contact and that was
referring to contact and then sometime
later in the program contact ends up
referring to something else maybe a new
object or null or something like that
and then we take new contact and he has
a first name and we take new contact now
we try to print his name and it blows up
this time we've got a type error and
says contact is no and contact is no the
problem is that the implementation of
print name refers explicitly to this
variable named contact so we've broken
encapsulation we've created a coupling
between the implementation here on line
15
and the variable name that we just
happened to use out here on line 11 and
as soon as we switched and used a
different variable name the whole thing
came apart which actually makes sense so
what we need is a solution now that we
understand sort of what's going on in
this situation so let's think about what
we'd like to have when the object is
called contact we'd like to be able to
get a hold of contact over here and then
go contact dot first name if the
variable were called alternate contact
then we'd like to be able to find
alternate contact dot first name and if
the variable were called something else
say foo we want to say foo dot first
name in the same way so it turns out
that that description that we just gave
whatever is before the dot when we're
accessing our print name function is the
sort of happy path or mainstream
definition for this in JavaScript so
that motivates having a keyword that
refers to whatever is before the dot
when we invoke the print name function
so if we say contact dot print name this
will be contact if we say new contact
print name this will be new contact so
we have this symbol that will serve that
role and we can check that it actually
works by coming over here saying contact
dot print name
and if we were to do the same trick we
did before where we assign contact to a
different variable and set contact to be
say no we can check that our alternate
variable behaves the exact same way as
contact so we don't have any coupling or
dependency between the implementation of
print name now and the name of their
variable that it's inside of so that's
the purpose of having a symbol called
this the problem comes from using this
which also exists in a lot of other
languages like C++ C sharp and Java in a
situation where it doesn't mean quite
the same thing and that causes a certain
amount of confusion this is likely due
to the desire at Netscape to use some
Java syntax when creating JavaScript
back in 1995 but we have this syntax so
we need to learn how to work with work
with the way it is so now that we
understand where this came from and what
some of the issues are in the next
section we'll take a look at the details
of the problems that can come up so many
developers first come across a problem
with this in the context of event
handlers and waiting for asynchronous
callbacks but we don't actually need an
event handler or any kind of
asynchronous callback to see what the
issue is it really doesn't have anything
to do with that and we can take a look
by pretending that we're working with a
partner and so let's suppose that I have
someone on my team named Bob and Bob's
going to create some code for me and I'm
going to call Bob's code so bob is going
to define a function called do
calculation and it's gonna do some
complicated work and then call me back
so maybe it's going to add two numbers X
and Y and it's going to take our
callback as a parameter and maybe it'll
console dot log X plus y and when it's
finished with that it's going to run the
callback
so now let's go over into Firefox and
see what happens when I try to use Bob's
code and tell it to call my contact out
print name as a callback so we come in
here I always say do calculation and
we'll give it say three and four and
then we're going to give it
contact dot print name and what happened
well it printed out seven so it did the
addition right but when it went to do
the call back instead of getting Joe's
name we got undefined so what's going on
here we said contact dot print name and
we said that this would be the thing
before the dot so shouldn't this be
contact and shouldn't print name work
well not exactly because we didn't call
the function contact out print name and
this in JavaScript gets a particular
value when a functions invoked or called
in this case we're just passing a
reference to the print name function or
a pointer and we're losing the context
information
we're losing the fact that it's called
contact print name if we come over here
to the source code we can see that the
function call happens down here at line
25 when we call the function we just say
callback and then we have this call
operator with the parentheses we don't
have a dot at all and if we don't have a
dot we're not going to get anything
before the dot getting bound to this so
something's falling apart here in the
next section we'll take a look at how
the JavaScript interpreter decides what
this should be based on how the
functions being called</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
