about nine ways to manipulate people
with design I feel compelled at the
beginning of this to point out not like
sinisterly manipulate people just nicely
manipulate people in like a good way in
a way that helps them do things and
stuff it's not entirely sinister it's
just a little bit sinister but yeah
we'll talk about nine ways to manipulate
people with design and at the end of
this hopefully you'll have some some new
tools in your tool chest for getting
what you want or what your users want or
your customers want so designing
products is about designing experiences
designing products is not pixels and
it's not wireframes and it's not just
sketches it's really designing an
experience that people are really gonna
stick with that they're gonna enjoy and
that they're gonna remember and that you
are gonna be happy that you gave them if
you consider designing products like
chairs chairs are very functional
there's some chairs up here on stage
which are kind of cool-looking and I
don't know how comfortable they are but
you're all sitting in in some cases very
nice chairs and in some cases less nice
chairs and in some cases those like
stools up in the back that look really
awkward but you think about like
designing chairs they're very
utilitarian it's very like you need to
have a surface on which your butt can
rest you need to have like a back in
most cases so that you can lean back and
not fall over
they're very utilitarian kinds of things
but if you really design a product right
if you really design something something
well all the best products create
lasting connections like chairs chairs
that have like really lasting
connections you know like these
particular chairs which are actually now
in the National Museum of American
history like these are chairs that not
only did the characters who sat in them
have an attachment to but the rest of
the country did as well and they're not
special chairs they're in some cases
kind of shabby looking pieces of crap
but really really well-designed products
and hey how's it going
oh cool this way I can pace more easily
because I like to pace but we developed
these really irrational to some extent
irrational attachments to products we
developed these kind of like in some
cases sort of obsessive attachments to
products right and you can design for
that you can design for connection you
can design for attachment you can design
for obsession in a way a perfect example
of that is people's phones when people
are checking their phones when you're
kind of looking around and people are
just fiddling with their phones
the overwhelming likelihood is that
they're on Facebook people check
facebook over fourteen times a day on
average
that's more than Twitter that's more
than email that's more than most
anything else that people do on their
smart phones is they check Facebook what
was that well okay yeah you could make
an argument for like Angry Birds or
something but but Facebook is like the
lasting one you know you get tired of
Angry Birds space and you well I did
anyways and you come back to everybody
comes back to Facebook so if you see
someone checking their phone it's
probably Facebook and Facebook was
really well-designed for connection is
really well-designed for emotional
attachment and they tug on your little
your little strings really really well
as you most of you probably know I know
there's some people who are really still
resistant to Facebook for a number of
different reasons and more power to you
but you're all alone at the end of the
day we are vain cheap and easily amused
people and I don't mean that in a bad
way it's out can't mean it in a little
bit of a bad way but not a terribly bad
way we are kind of vain we are kind of
like cheap and easily amused like we
latch on to things we latch on to
trivial things we latch on to kind of
silly things and we latch on to really
basic instincts not the naughty kind no
basic instinct nothing all right fine
but we do latch onto these like these
little silly things that kind of like
tug on us and get us in just the right
part of our head so that we just keep
coming back to something we keep coming
back to a product or we keep coming back
to something that was designed all of
the best products like this were
designed there are very few lasting
connections and lasting sort of services
or products or objects or or tools or
toys or whatever that really stick with
me
that weren't designed most everything is
designed so I say we're vain and cheap
and easily amused I mean there's some
obvious examples of things like us being
cheap and easily amused like TMZ but
it's not all you know to be totally
honest I've never actually seen TMZ it
just seemed like kind of a cheap shot
for like crap I assume that it's crap
but we are easily amused by some of
these things so let's talk about nine
ways in which you can easily amused
ain't cheap people right cool so nine
ways here we go first off familiarity
bias there is a reason wedding singers
sing the same songs over and over and
over and over again wedding singers are
expected to have a very particular kind
of repertoire and that's because people
are comfortable with things that they
know they're comfortable with things
that they are familiar with that are
just there they're sort of part of their
part of their core being they're just
things that you're really really used to
if somebody got up at you know if if
Adam Sandler got up at a wedding or
whatever and started singing like
something by tool you know no one's
gonna get up and dance a couple you know
a couple of you would I know you would
looking at you bearded guy so some
people would but you know they they do
sort of the same things and they have a
very particular kind of thing that
they're into this familiarity bias is is
really really prevalent we are very
comfortable with things that we know we
like what we know way that is like I
bleed II on the projector all right well
sorry the best new things use familiar
patterns when you're gonna build
something really really new not
everything about it needs to be new for
it to be something interesting for it to
be something memorable not everything
about it has to be brand new sometimes
that works really well there's instances
where new products come out and they do
just everything in a really crazy way
and sometimes that's really cool but
most of the time it's not you're really
used to two familiar patterns and the
best new things use those for example
the iPhone when the iPhone first came
out anybody know what's skeuomorphism is
people familiar with that word
skeuomorphism that's a lot of hands for
skeuomorphism that's cool when the
iPhone first came out it was an
incredibly skeuomorphic device and it
was still an incredibly skeuomorphic
device
until like two months ago a month ago
and there was a reason for that it
wasn't just because Steve Jobs and Scott
Forstall had some sort of hard-on for
like fake leather or whatever can I say
that is that a thing you can say
whatever they kind of did but it wasn't
just because of that it was because the
idea of a phone like this the idea of
like a smartphone that was all touch
that had no physical keyboard that was
all tactile that you had to pinch and
zoom whatever people weren't going to
understand how to use that if there had
been no affordances no pieces that
people were familiar with the calendar
looked like a calendar you know when you
like when you sent an email it was like
it was like paper coming down and you
were like writing on paper and it like
slid away it was things that you were
reasonably familiar with so that when
you actually went to use it it didn't
feel totally alien like the phone thing
felt like you were dialing like a you
know like a touch-tone kind of phone and
that was on purpose now we've moved well
beyond that we've gotten really used to
the idea of touch devices so everything
in iOS 7 changed and windows went
totally out to lunch and did their thing
an Android has always been sort of in
this vague pseudo design kind of miasma
which they're finally getting out of but
there was a good reason why it was so
skeuomorphic for so long maybe too long
but there was a good reason for it we're
really used to familiar things and
familiar moments create trust you know
if you use something and you recognize
some of it you recognize some of what's
going on you're gonna trust it a little
bit more even if it's something brand
new even if it's something you've never
used and this can come out in like kind
of interesting ways like you look at you
look at this Squarespace their website
this is about as skeuomorphic as it gets
for for a website because this is
literally just a photo of someone's desk
and this is like you're writing things
on your desk you're writing things in a
journal you have your cupcakes evidently
you have your laptop you have like a
space that's very familiar so when you
if you don't know what Squarespace is if
you've never been the Squarespace is
website and you get to this page you
kind of go oh okay create my own voice
like I do from my laptop sitting at my
desk with a notebook and a pen and my
glasses and things I can draw and stuff
that I'm really familiar with so it
creates trust it kind of it kind of
helps you get over the hump of I don't
know what this thing is and I don't I
don't really believe it and I don't want
to
use it it helps you get past that a
little bit and it makes it easy to get
to know you these are not at all even
centered I did not set this up right
well sorry you're gonna miss the left
edge of my slides it'll be okay
there's nothing important there if there
is I'll let you know so it makes it easy
to kind of get to know you like you know
things like this where it's like it's
Spotify when you're familiar with
something like this and there's a reason
they use like this big kind of
photography of everybody has their phone
and everybody plugs in their headphones
and everybody sits there and I don't
know that we all sit there and look
ruggedly handsome on the side of the
road and listen to music but we're all
used to listening to music on our phones
that kind of thing like that's very
familiar that's a moment that we
understand and I can look at this and I
can be like okay I could see myself in a
similar sort of situation just slightly
you know worse looking and I can
understand hey I won't be charged until
after my free trial ends and I can
cancel anytime that puts me at ease I
know I'm I'm kind of used to this sort
of thing I'm used to that kind of
language even I'm very familiar with the
kind of language like I won't be charged
for a 30-day free trial everyone
understands a 30-day free trial you
don't see a lot of like 27 day free
trials right that's not a thing that
just happens very much that's not just
because it's hard to put on a calendar
it's also because people just aren't
used to it you don't really you wouldn't
trust it 27 days why is it 27 days what
happens in the last three days why is it
27 what happens is that to trick me it's
probably to trick me it would be to
trick you actually that would be sort of
genius you'd be waiting 30 days and
you'd already be charged I'm gonna do
that anyways and design patterns that
are familiar can make new interfaces
feel familiar so things like this you
know over on the left-hand side you can
see an example of just sort of like a UI
kit that's still very has a lot of
really familiar affordances right it has
like you know things look like buttons
and you could clearly tap on them that
kind of stuff and you've probably seen
interfaces that use stuff a lot like
this you've probably seen them a whole
lot of times and on the right-hand side
you can see some UI kits that well the
one on the top certainly looks a little
bit more modern right it looks a little
bit newer it looks a little bit shinier
it's actually you're used to those kinds
of things you're familiar with how this
kind of stuff works because you got used
to the previous kind you got used to the
idea of a box with words and
is a button it doesn't matter if it
looks like a button it doesn't matter if
it's shiny like a button a box with
words in it is a button Windows Windows
8 there Metro interface actually suffers
from this because they threw it out the
window they said a box with words in it
could be a button or it could be a box
with words in it or it could be
something that you slide or swipe or
scroll or pinch or what have you they
kind of abandon some of that and it
wasn't familiar and it wasn't expected
so it doesn't always work but you're
used to how all these controls work
because you're used to the affordances
that we had for them before unfamiliar
patterns though can create confusion at
first a really good example of this
anybody remember when Twitter or Tweety
for iOS came out for the f1 came out I
actually remember back before Twitter
bought them and then just sat on it for
like a year and didn't do anything yeah
it had this really cool feature at the
time which was you could pull it down to
refresh like that was neat right
everybody who's like a big UI designer
like a big you know big into
interactions and stuff was like oh
that's clever and everyone else was like
why the hell when I pull this down is
there a little arrow that keeps popping
up and what is this doing like people
were legitimately really confused by it
it was really strange when it first came
out but it was unfamiliar at the time
but they kind of hammered on it and
people got gotten more used to it and
now it's like a built-in part of the
operating system it's a built-in part of
a lot of operating systems to do this
like pull-to-refresh that just became
the new status quo but it's hard work it
took like two years for that to become
like really commonplace something people
were gonna understand so this is not to
say always do things that are familiar
you can do new things but it's gonna be
an it's gonna be a fight you know to get
that to get that to work you can do it
really well and you can do it really
cleverly and this was really well done
and really clever
Lauren brick did a good job on coming up
with this particular interaction but it
still took years for this to become
normal so just you know expect that so
familiarity is a big thing if you if you
want to kind of tug on people in a
particular way do things that they're
familiar with they're gonna feel very
comfortable they're gonna trust you a
little bit more they're gonna give you
more of their money yeah more of their
money so you can actually you can rely
on that
so let's talk about relative value this
is another one there's another one
that's easy to use and works remarkably
well
comparing is easier than appraising for
almost everyone it's much easier for you
to figure out the value of something
when you compare it to something else in
a vacuum it's kind of hard you know if I
just you to be totally honest if I came
up to you and said I have a gallon of
milk and I will sell it to you for $4.00
I would have no idea whether that was a
good deal or not I don't know what no
costs I buy it at the grocery store and
it's part of my bill and I have no idea
what it costs if someone came out to me
and said here's a gallon of milk for
four dollars and here's again one with
milk for three dollars and they're
exactly the same milk I would buy the
three dollar milk because it's cheaper I
can compare things much more easily if I
looked at two gallons of milk and one
was you know had chunks in it and one
did not like I can understand that I can
understand the difference on its own I
may not I may not actually realize maybe
milk is supposed to have chunks I don't
know I pour it into cereal I don't
really notice what happens at the end I
actually do notice I'm not that
disgusting but comparing is much easier
than appraising it's why you see things
like this so much it's why very few
services have one price point not just
because not everybody fits one price
point like not everybody can I mean you
look at this it's like okay there's
eight dollars a month there's sixteen
dollars a month and there's twenty four
dollars a month in the grand scheme of
things this is not drastically different
this is like two lattes a month
difference between each of these plans
we're not talking like hundreds of
thousands of dollars but you see plans
like this very frequently because when
people want to figure out what they're
going to choose they feel more
comfortable about it they can compare it
to something else people who choose the
middle plan which is by far the one that
most commonly people pick they like to
be kind of middle-of-the-road unless
they have a really specific reason not
to because nobody wants to be paying as
much as they possibly can and nobody
wants to be cheap but if they pick this
middle plan here then they can look at
it and they can go okay it's sixteen
dollars a month well that's more than
the standard one but it's less than the
business one so I'm saving some money
it's totally arbitrary whether you're
saving any money or not I'm saving some
money and I understand that the one in
the middle has a bunch of unlimited
things and the one on the left is not
having limited things and the one on the
right has some more unlimited things but
nothing's that I need so cool I'm good
so they'll pick the one and they can
they can compare and it's much much
simpler that way options make us feel in
control they make us feel like we are
the masters of our own fate you know
we're not being steamrolled into one
particular thing if you have to sign up
for a service or you need a particular
service and there's only one option you
might feel like well this isn't exactly
what I wanted but I didn't really have
any choice and that kind of sucks so
you're not gonna feel good about it too
many options can create choice paralysis
they can paralyze people if they have
too many choices this is an okay example
this is like a you know flight
comparison kind of thing the funny thing
here is that are actually there aren't
that many options there's only really
five options on this page but it can
feel like a lot there's other examples
of things like this that are even worse
for how many choices you can possibly
make but I mean I've got all these
filters over on the left I don't know I
do I want non-stop or not do I want to
restrict my times do I care what cabin
it's like oh god and then there's
details and then there's a whole button
for fares and I'm just kind of like oh
just just tell me what I want like maybe
her actually used a Hipmunk Hipmunk for
flight stuff it looks pretty cool
Hipmunk tried to get around this they do
it okay they tried to get around this by
basically telling you we're gonna show
you a bunch of options but the first one
is gonna be the least painful so just
pick that one
they don't actually really follow
through on that and just say here's the
least painful one do this they just give
you all of them but they at least sort
it out right Travel stuff is is terrible
about this they like to give you every
option under the Sun whether you want it
or not there's a lot of different
services that just give you too many
choices it's important to give people a
choice it's important to give them some
options you want to be careful about how
many you give them it can be really
distressing for people similar and in
sort of the same vein as this this is a
fun things that are limited have more
value people feel like something is more
valuable when there's less of it it's
its scarcity people are really prone to
falling prey to scarcity so like shoes
that I would look fabulous in by the way
all these shoes there's a couple here
there's like three on the screen this is
from gilt
there's three on the screen and two of
them say there's just one there's just
one left there's only one pair of these
shoes left and
there's only three left I mean okay
there's still three left so I don't have
to like act now but the other two are
there's there's just one like if I
want those boy
Mallory slingback I don't even know what
that means if I want those I better do
it right now like that's that's very
valuable to me I mean they're you know
they're they're cheap like ones $89 one
$59 okay I get that
they're cheap and they're on sale but
there's only one so I have to do it
right now
funny thing is infomercials nailed this
like 20 years ago if you watch like late
night TV it's like act now this is an
incredible deal get all eight of these
juicing tools for only $20 but it's only
for the next hour it's not for the next
hour it's for that hour in every other
hour it doesn't make any difference so
they are manipulating you evilly they
are lying to you I don't recommend that
I feel compelled to say that but they
figured this out a long time ago
scarcity makes people value things more
so if you can position a real scarcity
not a fake scarcity but if you can
position like a real scarcity people
will respond to that pretty well a fake
scarcity there's some good examples of
faux scarcity that's not just
infomercials digital publishers
especially like game companies are
incredibly guilty of this or they were a
couple years ago they'd be like oh you
can buy the the digital super advanced
version of this game but there's only
500 of them so get it now it's like it's
digital there is an infinite number of
them obviously but people people bought
it and they bought and they they were
one of the 500 people who got this
special super unique set of bytes that
anybody could have had so it totally
works just don't use it that way so
relative value the ability to compare
things and the ability to compare the
scarcity of something this can work
really really well give people options
explain what their options are don't
give them too many options and if their
options include things like less of one
thing versus more of another thing that
actually can work for you and it
actually can work for your customers I
mean the funny thing about this is that
hold like a little just one label
obviously is going to make people feel
more interested or more
compelled to buy something right now but
it's also if they legitimately wanted
those shoes they really do have to do it
right now because there's only one and
someone else can buy them so you're not
necessarily you're not duping people
you're not misleading people you're
helping them make a decision all right
let's talk about bandwagons I hate them
is that is that okay to say I hate them
bandwagon is the only way I can possibly
explain that show
it can only be popular because it's
already popular with other people that's
like a self-reinforcing loop but I
assume that's what happened so bandwagon
we are easily swayed they're easily
swayed by the behaviors and opinions of
other people we may think that we are
you know a lone ship in a storm and we
are carving our own fate entirely on our
own every man is an island kind of thing
we're not we're very very easily swayed
by the opinions of other people that's
okay
other people can in aggregate usually be
trusted not always not it comes to like
voting elected officials or anything
like that we clearly can't trust that
but you can be easily swayed by the
opinions of other people it's why you
see things like this social proof keep
up with your friends see which other
Murr on Foursquare well Spencer Caleb
and 16 of my other friends are already
using Foursquare so obviously I should
be using Foursquare I like Spencer I
like Caleb I should be doing what
they're doing actually works it works
really really super well social proof is
like no joke
you see the little Facebook like buttons
on everything under the Sun these days
the little like button itself is
entirely self-serving for the for the
site itself when they show like which of
your friends already liked it that's
that's clearly meant for you that's so
that you'll understand the friends of
yours have already vouched for something
there is a really really there's a
strong strength in numbers things like
trending things that are trending this
is from fab when you see stuff that's
trending it's like okay so these are
things that's trending that's fine I may
or may not buy that but boy a hundred
and sixty-five people thought that TV
cabinet was pretty baller I could use a
TV cabinet 165 total strangers can't be
wrong right of course they can but
you'll fall for it anyway you'll do it
anyways and that's actually okay because
legitimately 165 total strangers is
actually a reasonable sample for
something like that it's actually a
reasonable sample of what might be
or what might be interesting so the
number of people who like a product the
number of people who also use a service
we're very very susceptible to the to
the bandwagon approach and bandwagon is
it works really well on us if you're
yeah if you're a student of things
philosophy or psychology I don't
remember which one maybe some of you are
I think bandwagon is technically
considered a logical fallacy like it's
not actually true but it works it's not
actually true but it works you'll see
things fab you know does more of the
stuff today's bestsellers what sold the
best today well whatever sold the best
is probably pretty good so I'm gonna
latch on to things that's sold really
well their assumption is the things
that's so well are gonna sell well to
other people so they want to put it in
front of you but it works for you too it
works for customers or users or
consumers or or whatever or what have
you clients because they understand the
today's bestsellers worked for them as
well and you know stuff like this like
like on Foursquare like you know find
the perfect places to go with friends
and you actually see in this case it's
not even some of its aggregate because
there's like 130 tips for one there's
eighty-seven tips for another there's 26
for another but there's also just
specific little quotes you know
Jacqueline says the place where
professional drinkers come to drink
which is cool and also a little dark
although I can attest that place is
actually really cool and you know
Richard says this is some great hiking
and a great workout which you know great
workout doesn't appeal to me that much
but the great hiking could be fun and
the trails are cool they're total
strangers I have no idea but Jacqueline
is I know you're Richard is I don't know
who Antonio is but it's interesting in
it and it speaks to the fact that
somebody else like this thing so I will
probably like it as well bandwagon is is
super super powerful but it can also
work against you and this one's a little
bit dangerous people overwhelmingly put
more importance on negative opinions
than they do positive opinions like
overwhelmingly negative impo info is
perceived as much more powerful than
positive info if any of you have ever
gone like apartment hunting online if
you look for apartments you'll probably
notice on Yelp like
most people on Yelp about apartments are
just there to bitch and complain about
stuff that's really really powerful and
really bad for those places because you
can see 20 30 40 good reviews of
something and then see one bad wouldn't
be like yeah I'm out you know somebody
didn't like it doesn't matter the 30 or
40 other people liked it somebody didn't
like it so
you know I'm not really feeling it you
know a yelp review I had the worst drink
of my life here I don't actually know
where this is from but it was really bad
for somebody this can tank somebody's
like Yelp profile one really bad review
like this like one long bad review can
just savage somebody's Yelp profile
which is why you'll frequently find
businesses that actually give a damn
will actually like reply to these bad
reviews and try to you know mitigate the
damage you don't see them replying to
all the positive reviews like hey thanks
scratch glad you had a great time
because they don't need to there's
nothing there's nothing that needs to be
mitigated or even in force reinforced
there because reinforcing it wouldn't do
anything it's already it's as good as
it's gonna get really but negative stuff
bad info can can just brutalize you you
have to be careful about bad Witt
bandwagon negative stuff comes across a
whole lot better than positive stuff
stuff alright Authority but you think
I'm too too young for that reference huh
yeah I actually am but I know who they
are
so Authority this one's this one's funny
not just because of chips Authority can
really easily trump our own beliefs
there was a Yale psychologist named
Milgram there's Stephen Milgram who said
and I will quote this here humans
possess an extreme willingness to go and
almost to go to almost any lengths on
the command of an authority even if
that's against their beliefs like they
will go to extraordinary lengths to do
what authority tells them to do even if
they think that it's wrong and he
demonstrated this with a really
entertaining little experiment I'm sure
it was not entertaining at the time
where a teacher quote-unquote was
instructed to administer electric shocks
to students for getting a wrong answer
so people were selected to be students
and answer questions and there was
someone who was supposed to be the
teacher and if the students got the
question wrong they were to be
electrically shocked they were to be
actually shocked and 65 percent of the
teachers obeyed this directive even
though they wanted to stop they didn't
want to keep you know frying these
people but they kept doing it anyways
yeah it's it's this this was in the in
the 60s back when you could you know
electrically shocked strangers that's
cool and it was okay I don't think II
can get away with it anymore but they
were like they were electrocuting fellow
human beings and they didn't want to but
they were told to do so by a Yale
psychologist so they did most of them
did 2/3 of them did people have an
overwhelming need to conform to some
sort of authority and it doesn't have to
be quite as malevolent as Emperor
Palpatine this usually takes the form of
things like testimonials testimonials
are the exact same principle hey I don't
know if I should use this particular
service but wait a minute
37signals uses it I know who 37signals
is I like them 37signals said nothing
holds a candle to campaign monitor okay
I can conform to that I can I can follow
along with that kind of authority
Airbnb says campaign monitor delivers
the rare I swear to god I'm not doing a
pitch for campaign monitor they're
pretty good but this is not what this is
Airbnb uses them and likes them camera
and mul uses them and likes them this is
the exact same principle of telling
someone to shock somebody else this is
I'm an authority by dint of being a
company that you recognize and you
respect and I'm saying you should use
this thing and this is why testimonials
come up so often they seem really cliche
or trite you know testimonials it's like
other everywhere it's especially if you
do a lot of wire framing for like a
marketing site sometimes you'll just be
like well I got some extra space here I
could put in some testimonials right
that'll work that'll fill some space
it totally does fill space but it also
legitimately works like people follow
these things they understand what this
what this Authority represents and they
they want to kind of conform to that
it's the same sort of thing as this and
this is kind of a confluence of like a
bandwagon approach and also just
Authority is like you know the most
helpful customer reviews 4000 people
almost all of 4000 people found the
following review helpful that confers
authority onto that review that can be
that could be nobody that could be a 13
year old in the basement who wrote that
review but 4,000 people found it helpful
so they become unaffordable
so it works really really super well but
you need to be strategic about your
placement when you're using something
like this don't just slap these things
all over the place don't just fall back
on Authority whenever you possibly can
be strategic about it put it where
there's barriers you know when you
actually want to sign up for something
when you're signing up for a service
this is a really signing up for anything
is like a really delicate moment you
probably know this if you if you're like
a product designer you have something
that people need to sign up for signing
up conversion is a really delicate
moment because you're asking for usually
fairly personal stuff from somebody else
and you need to provide some sort of
clear benefit to warrant them giving you
that information so when you want to
create an account and you want my email
address in my first name my last name
and you want me to punch in my password
and my password if you're anything like
me it's probably the same password you
use for everything so I need to kind of
trust you is this is a good time to
position yourself as an authority and
position the things that actually make
this make this valuable so in this
particular example you see over in the
sidebar that we reiterate benefits
that's not actually really that
authoritative it's coming from you you
may or may not be an authority in
situations like this you'll very
frequently find this is where
testimonials live is okay I have to sign
up for this do I really want to sign up
for this well Cameron mole says I should
sign up for this so yeah I guess I'll
probably sign up for this he can't be
that wrong right so that's typically
where you'd find this kind of thing all
right this one's a little mean sorry
faith in aesthetics this one seems
really I don't know trite or it seems
kind of just seems cheap okay raise your
hand if you if you're considered like a
designer your designer and there are a
lot of designers okay how do you feel if
somebody says oh you're designer so you
like you make things pretty right here
yeah I could somebody I heard somebody
go oh god and then do this props right
you've heard that before and it's so
frustrating you're just like no I don't
make things pretty I make them usable
and I make them awesome and you okay and
he says beautiful not pretty sorry and
he makes me beautiful the funny thing is
that actually you're
ability to make things pretty and yeah
I'm sure a lot of you have the ability
to make things pretty actually is
valuable it's not just window dressing
people actually have a lot of faith in
things that look good they have more
faith in things that look good than they
do things that look bad there are very
few examples of products that were
overwhelmingly successful despite the
fact that they were just ugly as sin
Craigslist being the obvious exception
to the rule there's very few that
actually managed to get away from that
we first judged sites by their
appearance when you pull up a when you
pull up a site or you pull up a product
you don't dig right into the content you
don't start reading the testimonials you
don't go straight for those things you
look at it and go this looks good or you
look at it go this looks like ass I'm
out right that's just kind of how it
works we judge things by their
appearance at first there was a study
done where people were shown health
websites and they said would you trust
this website of the people who said no I
don't trust it 83% of their negative
comments came from aesthetics of the
site they came from the way it looked
they came from bad visuals they came
from navigation that was hard to read
they came from things that if you're a
designer you would maybe consider like
well that's that's sort of like a
trivial thing like yeah okay it's not a
great image I had to go to I stock and
find something cut me some slack we've
all done that but people actually judge
this stuff really really quickly and not
just like would I use it or not just
would I give it money but like do I
trust it at all and if it didn't look
good then in most cases they did not
trust it and that's why because it
didn't look that good attractive things
just appear to be more valuable
I know a there's actually food in the
back and this would work a little better
if you were all really super hungry but
like I know Burger King is not
everybody's cup of tea including mine
but like that's a pretty good-looking
burger right like that's pretty solid
like it's obviously a staged photo but
that's a pretty solid looking burger
that is not like that is not a solid
looking I mean if you're really hungry
maybe earlier when I was looking at
these I was really hungry I was like
actually I would eat that
but generally speaking your this this
looks a lot better and there's a reason
they don't use real product photography
when they show you burgers there's a
reason they don't use real product
photography when they show you cereal
they're pouring like glue into a bowl
full of cereal that has strawberries
covered in lipstick on the edge or
something you know there's a reason they
do that it looks better it makes it seem
more valuable it makes it seem more like
you want to eat it we attach more value
to things that actually look good and
aesthetics actually affect usability
this one can be a hard pill to swallow
especially if you're kind of in the camp
of like well you should design for the
usability in the interactions and then
you should layer on something that looks
good because that's just the cool thing
to do right
well the aesthetics actually affects the
usability of stuff when people okay this
is an instance where the left side of
the slide actually has some things that
you'd maybe want to read so I'll just
read it for you instead oh you can read
it over there cool hey that one works
everybody look over there when people
were asked to complete tasks on a phone
it was different kinds of phones there
there there's like an iPhone and a
blackberry there's different kinds of
phones but when they were asked to
complete tasks the devices that were
actually more visually appealing the
interface was more visually appealing
the visual appeal of it actually had a
motivating effect on the people who were
taking it and actually motivated them to
complete the tasks faster they actually
solved things more quickly and it's it's
a difficult like apples to oranges kind
of comparison to compare like an iOS
device to a blackberry because
blackberries suck sorry guys but it's
still like the actual aesthetics had a
real effect on the usability of
something it wasn't just well this one
looks nicer so I would probably use it
anyways it was you actually did things
more quickly you did them more
successfully because it actually looked
good and you wanted to use it the desire
for someone to actually use something
and want to use something because it
looks good and feels good to them is a
pretty powerful factor when it comes to
their ability to actually complete the
task so you really can't undercut the
value of the aesthetics of something you
can totally get bent out of shape when
someone tells you you're designer you
just make pretty pixels I get bent out
of shape when someone says that to me
that's totally okay but don't discount
the fact that you do make pretty pixels
they actually help things work better
they
people want to use them for them to be
pretty pixels so it's okay it's not all
bad
achievement overcoming challenges makes
us feel good right completing something
like overcoming something that makes us
feel good competition is great
competition is great for most people we
have a biological drive to succeed in
some cases we have a biological drive to
succeed in the face of other people we
want to beat them we like to win
competitions great but we like to win
anybody using a key plus we do Nike Plus
few people Nike Plus actually does a few
things that are really smart and one of
them is it'll actually take you and all
your friends and it'll show you like how
far each of you have run in the last
things like month or week or it breaks
it down by different things it kind of
creates this little like ad-hoc
competition and actually I tried using
Nike Plus a few weeks ago I say tried
because I just I can't run but I tried
using it and I pulled it up and it was
like this my buddy of mine Lewis was
like three miles ahead of me and I
really had this twin for a minute where
I was like well I could go I could
go sweat through three miles and be
beating Lewis that would be that would
be cool that would make me feel good it
actually it works like you want to be
competitive you want to win it stuff I
didn't go do three miles he's beating me
still he did like a half marathon last
week it's just not fair
anyways we like challenges but really we
like challenges that are sort of
challenging we don't like really
difficult challenges some people were
like really difficult challenges some
people like to really have something put
out in front of them but you don't want
that from every product you use you
don't want some sort of insurmountable
goal for everything you try to use it
shouldn't feel like climbing Everest to
you know use LinkedIn or something like
that it should feel a little easier than
that so we like challenges that are sort
of challenging like audible they have
you know different levels or whatever
where it's like app newbie I think you
get that for listening to like an hour
of anything which is pretty trivial
that's like well two-thirds of a drive
up here from the South Bay in traffic
it's not even all that much it feels
like forever but it's not that much and
you can achieve this like really quickly
and like app novice is obviously further
up and
prose further up but we like challenges
that are like sort of challenging
they're not they're not crazy hard and
we appreciate rewards a lot more when we
don't expect them so the audible example
was actually not a great example because
you expected they tell you exactly what
it is it's like you know one hour a
hundred hours 500 hours a thousand hours
it's like I know what's coming I know
what's gonna happen there so you can
work toward that but it's not really
exciting so a lot more exciting when you
get rewards that are sort of unexpected
and it's actually science unexpected
rewards cause greater dopamine levels in
your body when you get an award that you
weren't expecting when you're rewarded
with something and you didn't really see
it coming you actually have like a
biological reaction to that and it feels
good you're like ah yay I did something
and it was cool and you weren't
expecting it things that you expect
aren't aren't as awesome
dopamine's not really just about
pleasure it's about the anticipation of
pleasure so it's that's a weird sentence
to say anyways
dopamine's cool everybody likes to have
it you don't maybe realize when you do
but it's it makes you feel pretty good
and you have more of that when you
aren't expecting the reward so like
badges like this became very very
popular these are from tree house I
believe badges like this became very
popular because it's very easy to make a
lot of them and you can't know what
they're all for cuz you're not gonna go
read through the list of 500 badges and
see what they're all for which means
that when they pop up you're not really
expecting them you didn't really know
where they were coming from so they just
sort of pop up and you feel good you're
like oh cool I got a badge and it means
nothing it's a hexagon with a glyph
inside it and you don't get anything for
it you don't get paid for it you don't
get no one's gonna high-five you or
anything you're not gonna get laid
because you got it but it feels good to
get it and it's just this like arbitrary
kind of achievement and it's fun we also
like showing off rewards our lords are
cool but being rewarded you know
entirely in isolation is not quite as
cool you want other people to see your
awards you know it's it's it's more fun
that way and that's why a lot of cases
when you actually do win something
a lot of sites realize that that's a
really opportune time for you to tell
for you to go share that with other
people so if you win an award you'll
frequently see like hey you won the
award why not tweet about it and it's
not just because they want you to
increase the virality of their blah blah
blah that you will be doing that they
realized and it's it's true for a lot of
people that you want to share that kind
of stuff out more than you do other
things people like to kind of show off
so let's talk about the Zeigarnik effect
I bet like this movie I like this movie
I really like this movie the Zeigarnik
effect actually has nothing to do with
Joseph gordon-levitt walking around this
little this little hallway which was
awesome by the way
what the Zygon effect is is it's about
suspense when we become engaged in a
story we have to see how it ends you
know we're not the first time I saw that
movie I really liked that movie the
first time I saw that movie you know if
the projector had died like 2/3 of the
way through I would have been furious
like I would have been very upset I
really wanted to know how that ended
when we are exposed to some sort of
story were exposed to some sort of path
we really like to know how that ends we
generally like to finish what we start
most people don't like leaving
unfinished business they don't like
leaving unfinished paths or unfinished
stories the key is you have to actually
get someone to start something so the
the canonical example of this that's
just like but it's everyone cites this
example and with good reason it worked
really really well is LinkedIn LinkedIn
hit on this years ago
has anybody completed their LinkedIn
profile like a hundred percent and he
has you have couple hands I'm like 15
percent away and it drives me crazy
drives me crazy well I think I think
what I need is like recommendations from
people or something like that but I'm
such a Wallflower I don't want to ask
alright hey there you go go recommend
move your stuff and complete my LinkedIn
profile that would make me super happy
but LinkedIn like LinkedIn nailed this
with the with the Zeigarnik fact they
like really understood that people
wanted to complete something but they
also realize that to get them to
complete something they have to get you
to start something and that's why you
get things like this hey get started
it's free and it takes less than two
minutes like how easy can we possibly
make this let's lower the bar so
hello that anyone can get started on
this path because once they get started
they will try to finish it they may not
get all the way there I've been sitting
at 85% for a couple of years but I just
don't like asking people for things it's
awkward for me but a lot of people get
really really into that and they really
want to complete that profile they want
to get that little bar the rest of the
way it can be very very vexing to not be
able to actually do that something you
need to bear in mind when you're when
you want to use this kind of tactic when
you want to compel people to finish
something is that varying the length of
steps keeps us motivated if it's all the
same kind of thing if you're just sort
of slogging through something it doesn't
feel as good it's not it's not as easy
to get into it doesn't feel as it's kind
of it's the same effect as unexpected
rewards is that your something might
take a little bit longer maybe the next
one is shorter and you're like oh cool
okay I'm done with that work so it feels
pretty good even creating like the
illusion of progress is useful again
LinkedIn is still doing this kind of
stuff really really well where they just
sort of like throw these tiny little
steps in front of you well where else
have you worked I was blah at blah and
they show you over here you know you got
you got five steps to go you know one
two three four five and then you'll see
your improved profile it's pretty smart
you don't know exactly how long those
steps are gonna be and that's okay
but you know that there's a light at the
end of the tunnel there's a clear
benefit at the end of it there's a story
that you can finish there's like I can
finish this one two three four five I
can do that I can do five steps if there
were 50 steps here it's not gonna work
as well there's a point at which people
no longer want to finish the story it's
it's kind of what happens if you sit
down and you try to watch well I know at
least one person in the audience who
would do this but when you try to watch
all of the Lord of the Rings in a row
it's like 12 hours long so you know she
gets back there some people will really
power through that and then some people
you go well it's 12 hours and they go
yeah I'm out you know or they make it
halfway and they're like I'm so sick of
elves I'm done like I just don't want to
do it anymore so there's a threshold at
which knowing knowing the number of
steps you have to complete to finish a
story is a little too much but something
like this works really really super well
and if all else fails sometimes a guilt
trip works best so if you want to take
somebody on a trip
the regular kind of trips are working
try guilt trip like like these guys do
like Nike does hey you know you had a
goal for September 13th it was to get
3,000 you know fuel points and you
missed it
you got to here you didn't get to here
you should feel bad yeah you didn't you
didn't do as well as you should have you
should feel bad
it actually works super well they're not
dicks about it which is probably helpful
I mean if somebody just popped up made
fun of you for it it's not gonna be as
successful but just saying hey you
missed your goal you'll hit it next time
you just feel like oh god now I have to
hit it next time like Nike believes in
me they think I'm gonna hit it next time
I guess I better do that so it works you
know like a little bit of a guilt trip
with with your users is okay don't make
them feel terrible about themselves but
a little bit of a guilt trip is okay
that can be really really effective
so the Zeigarnik effect is just it's a
it's a fancy word named after a guy but
it basically just means people want to
finish what they start if you start a
goal you want to hit that goal if you
start up a path you want to get to the
end of the path if you start a story you
want to get to the end of the story you
can use that when you want people to
complete something you want them to do
something is set it up as a path they
need to reach the end of it works really
really well so let's talk about
self-expression that's it that's a shot
self-expression
we are unique special snowflakes right
I'm a unique special snowflake everybody
else here is a unique special snowflake
yes got some hands yeah high self-esteem
we are unique special people and we want
to show other people how unique and
special we are some of the ways we do
that are things that we create or that
we own and we perceive the things that
we own or that we create as more
valuable than other things something
that I just go to the store and buy I
may be attached to like I may be
reasonably attached to it because I own
it like it's it's my thing like this is
my phone I didn't create this obviously
but I bought it and it's my phone and
I'm very fond of it and it's going away
in a couple of weeks but don't tell it
that
but it's very I'm very very fond of it
but I didn't make it like things that I
made like there's I have these like
crappy bowls at home that I like painted
back when it was cool to go paint
pottery they're terrible and I would
never eat out of them or anything but I
still have them I haven't thrown them
away they are valuable to me because I
made them they're junk but I made them
things that we actually make we perceive
as being significantly more valuable
than the things that somebody else has
or that we didn't create or that we just
sort of picked up or we bought or were
given to a second well actually giving
to us is not the same because that has
an emotional attachment that is a real
picture of me by the way I didn't get
the mug I maybe should the things that
we create are more valuable to us so
find ways to make an experience feel
personalized find ways to make an
experience feel like something that they
own there's actually there's sort of an
ongoing debate about when you create a
user interface do you say my stuff or
your stuff you ever seen that this is
actually the funny thing is actually
just really not quite a right answer for
that but you can you can sort of imagine
like is it my profile when I pull
something up or is it your profile is
the site talking to me in both cases
though it's clearly my thing whether the
site says that it's your profile it's
still my profile if it's it's still my
picture it's still my avatar it's still
my whatever my page my this my that they
may say my or your but it's always mine
and that's because people want you to
feel like you own something they want
you to feel like it belongs to you
because you value that a lot more some
like car manufacturers get this like
silent has always been really good about
like having this like incredible
configuration kind of stuff like you can
do all kinds of just ridiculous to
these little these little lunch boxes
that's because they understand that it
may not I actually I swear they I don't
actually know much about Saiyans I don't
know they're good cars or not but they
could be terrible cars but if you did
like every little facet of it you picked
out exactly the seats you wanted and the
color you wanted and what kind of stereo
you wanted and like where the you know
where this was and that was that's going
to be more valuable to you than
something you just drove and saw on the
lot and drove off with it's gonna be
more valuable to you because it's it's
yours you you created it to some extent
you didn't really create it you didn't
make a car but you kind of created it
and that be
comes more valuable to you so that
really really works you do need to keep
personalization options small just like
with anything else too much of a good
thing is too much for people to handle
you need to keep it you need to keep it
reasonably minimal a really good example
of personalization that's never too
overwhelming it can be a little
overwhelming but never too overwhelming
is Netflix Netflix does a pretty good
job of this they put a few options in
front of you at a time this is about as
many as they'll put in front of you at
once which is like eight different eight
different things that I can go in and
rate and even that's like a little
border in a little too much but it's not
bad but a lot of times if you pull up
Netflix they'll just show you one thing
and say did you see this and if you did
how much did you like it that's easy and
it personalizes the experience to me so
that every time I go to Netflix I know
that it is at least a reasonably
tailored to me or whoever else was using
my account which is sometimes the case
which is why I have things on there like
the Lorax
or Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Road rally I
swear I don't know why Netflix is
recommending that to me the rest of its
well questionable the Avengers is great
I like that
but personalization is really really
powerful and Netflix has always been
really good about affording the ability
to personalize stuff because it becomes
your experience it's your product I
would never go to Netflix and like try
to use a signed out experience because I
wouldn't trust that it's putting the
stuff I like in front of me or that it's
going to show me the right stuff I want
my experience I want my Netflix I don't
want somebody else's so keep in mind
personalization you can totally go
overboard and personalization is not a
silver bullet either you can't just let
people customize like the color of the
header and expect them to just drool all
over your product it's not it's not
going to work quite like that
there's certainly services that did that
they're like hey you can change the
color of all of the links on our website
to whatever you want and expect people
to just be like yeah I'm never gonna
leave they will they don't care about
that kind of thing you need to give them
the right personalization and you need
to give them just the right amount of it
but it is really powerful to have your
own experience all right surprise and
delight this is this is kind of a big
one and it's it's
it's not trivial it seems small but it
can be a really really big thing which
is that we remember key moments in our
experiences we remember the highs and
the lows we don't remember really the
stuff in between things that are just
okay they just kind of fade they just go
away but we remember the really high
moments and we remember the really low
moments so what you can do to actually
work from that is create highs create
really fun
delightful surprising little moments
that people are going to remember are
gonna make them want to use whatever it
is you're offering flicker however you
feel about the recent redesign and other
sort of shenanigans that they're doing
always had kind of this fun little thing
where every time you logged in it would
say hello to you in a different language
and it would say hey now you know how to
say hello to people in Finnish which you
don't hear because I don't have any idea
how to pronounce that I went to Finland
not that long ago their language is
crazy I don't even know where to begin
there's like umlauts and accents on
everything but most of the time it's
something you can pronounce and it's
like hey that's fun like if I think of
Flickr I think of okay it's a photo site
but I also think every time you go there
they say hello you in a different
language and it's trivial and it's not
that hard to hook up engineering-wise
and it's just kind of a little thing but
it's a high that people remember and
they kind of liked it for that
so whatever flickers other flaws might
be you'll always kind of remember it for
that and liked it for that things like
this like clever copy you know you're
gonna have a testimonial hey we didn't
even make this up this is like a real
thing people remember like fun kind of
engaging copy things that are just you
know you read it and it feels like a
human being you're like it just makes
you feel good and you remember that they
have this kind of fun tone and this good
copy and that will gloss over all manner
of flaws in their in your in their eyes
you can get away with a lot by having
some some nice moments like this or you
know things like this like woot when you
open up your cart and it's empty your
cart is empty oh you're just pushing
around an empty cart fill that thing up
like some sort of little monkey telling
you what to do you remember these kinds
of little moments and they're very easy
to do and they're very very small but it
works really well
Easter eggs if you go to the vug website
and punch in the Konami code Raptors and
hats will scream across the bottom of
the screen
over and over and over again and I feel
really good about that because herb
actually made the plugin that does that
it's called rap to rise but it's it's
it's so out of character for Vogue but
they got like they have like an article
on next whatever TechCrunch or something
because of this it was like did you know
if you go to Vogue family of websites
and punch in the Konami code Raptors
scream across the screen like it's just
a fun little moment it's it's not
anything that anyone's ever gonna hardly
anyone's ever gonna see but it keeps
things fun for a few people it's a
delightful it's a surprising little
moment that they like in addition to
creating highs you also need to validate
lows not everything's going to be great
not everything's gonna be rosy for all
of your users so you need to validate
when there's like a low moment like hey
email this to your friends if there's an
error message you didn't enter any email
addresses we're smart but we're not
psychic like you can be a little cheeky
about things you can have a little fun
with some of this stuff people are very
used to seeing error messages you try to
submit a form and if you see a red box
at the top you just go oh damn it I
didn't punch in something right and now
everything's probably wiped out and I
have to punch in my credit card again
and it's probably telling me my password
doesn't have the right number of special
characters and who mounts and accents
and what-have-you it's frustrating but
if you can make it a little bit more fun
you can you can cushion the blow it's a
surprising delightful little moment that
people appreciate four or four pages are
great for this people are going to break
your website your product whatever
they're gonna have problems they're
gonna hit pages that don't exist anymore
you know do something fun with it like
there's there's thousands of examples of
good 404 pages but hey you found me
unfortunately that means you also found
a 404 page which means what you're
looking for is no longer here but I
won't be thinking like oh crap I broke
the site I'll be thinking that's funny
ish it's not hilarious but it's funny so
you can cushion the blow you can kind of
like make the lows a little easier to
deal with surprising people delighting
people whether it's a high or a low it's
gonna work really well for you because
the highs and the lows are what people
actually remember they don't remember
everything in between everything in
between is just getting stuff done the
highs and the lows are what really makes
something for you so that was a lot of
different things you can do to people
that was a lot of knobs yeah you can
like move these things around and kind
of
kind of manipulate people and tweak them
a little bit knowing which ones to
actually use is really really valuable
and the way to actually learn that is to
is to play with them there's a lot of
different things you can do to
manipulate people essentially into doing
what you want them to do or really even
better manipulate them into doing what
they want to do I really did mean it
when I say you shouldn't manipulate
people in any kind of sinister way I
feel slightly bad to say that you should
manipulate this is not to say that I
wouldn't do it just that maybe you
shouldn't but you are actually when you
manipulate people in the right way when
you actually have them kind of go down a
path that you want them to go down if
you really believe in the thing that
you're building if you believe in your
product if you believe in your service
you're not doing them a disservice
you're not duping them you're just
helping them do the thing that's going
to be the best for them anyways so
that's okay like you you should be able
to manipulate people a little bit so
just to recap as one does familiar
eighty bias you know show them something
they already understand that really
really helps relative value give them
things to compare comparison is much
easier for people than just
independently evaluating something it's
easier to compare one thing to another
bandwagon you know tell them that
they're missing out tell them what
they're missing out on tell them who all
says they're missing out on it like make
them understand that it's not just you
saying this it's excuse me it's lots of
people Authority say that it's worth
their while have Authority position
Authority use Authority to your benefit
so that people feel like they're making
a good decision because it's validated
by other good decisions make it
attractive faith in aesthetics make it
attractive don't get too caught up in
people calling you a pretty pixel push
or anything like that but do make things
look good because it actually has
meaningful value to make things look
good and make it fun you know have have
some sort of achievement make it a fun
game help them get closure
Tigra neck effect is about getting
closure help them finish the story help
them complete their path let them feel
unique like her help them help them feel
like the the special you know unique
snowflake that they are and they will
appreciate it and finally just entertain
them you know they will love the highs
and the lows of whatever
you do entertain them with something
that that's sticks entertain them with
something that they're going to remember
so nine ways nine ways to manipulate
people we use them a lot at survived
used them a lot I know lots of other
people use them there's thousands of
examples of using these exact kind of
these exact kind of methods they really
really do work they will help you quite
a bit so thank you very much I
appreciate you guys all coming out here
