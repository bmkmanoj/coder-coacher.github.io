another demo of the problem we just saw
and we'll look at a common workaround
and we'll look at the pros and cons of
that before moving on to a better
solution so to recreate that problem in
a way that's easy to see we can add
another method into our contact object
and we'll call this one print later so
we have print name which prints right
now and we want to create a function
print later which is gonna wait a second
or two and then do the printing so we'll
create a function and we'll use the
built-in global set timeout and set
timeout is going to take a function and
it's going to take a timeout how long we
want the browser to wait before it fires
off the event that runs our function so
we punch in the function we want which
is contact dot print name and we'll put
in a delay of maybe 1,500 milliseconds
and we'll come over to Firefox and we'll
see our contact print name works and if
we run contact dot print later that one
fails and it fails the exact same way we
saw before so what are some fixes for
this well a very common one that you may
be tempted to write or you may see in
other people's code looks like this
before we actually use the function we
grab the current value of this and store
it in a different variable typically
called that so we have var that equals
this now that we've captured that this
value that we want we can use it by
writing a new function inside of here
and the new function will call that dot
print name and let's just check that
this works
so now it prints out Joe and so we've
got our functionality back but this
isn't really an optimal solution there
are a couple of problems here first we
have this VAR that equals this it
doesn't just sound silly it is a little
bit silly it's been used so widely in
JavaScript that it's actually a pretty
known and accepted idiom at this point
and if you're just doing a simple
callback like we have here it's not the
end of the world but specific problems
include if we've got more than one
callback which is not uncommon at all in
JavaScript and we want to capture all of
the relevant of this contexts because of
the scope rules we would need a
different variable for each one so
instead of saying var that equals this
and being done with it
we'd have to say var that equals this
for the first callback and for the next
one would have to say var the first that
equals that var that equals this and for
the third callback we'd have to say var
the original that equals the first that
then var the next that equals and so on
it gets a little bit crazy
it'd be really hard to read and pretty
hard to express what your codes actually
doing the other problem we have is that
we are losing the opportunity for code
reuse right we already have a perfectly
useful function here contact out print
name that does everything we want but
instead of using that we've written
another function in line down here at
line 20 through 22 now in this case the
new function isn't that different from
the original one but it obscures what's
going on because we have to use that
that symbol which is really a workaround
we're leveraging a JavaScript scope rule
and the closure rule in order to get
around the problem with this in the next
section we're going to look at an easier
and better solution to the same problem
I'm going to add on to the example we've
been working on
I'll leave print later the way it is and
I'll add another version called print
later better so print later better is
going to be a function and we'll come
back to our set timeout and we're gonna
look at something we can do here so set
timeout it's going to take a function
and it's going to take a timeout so I'll
put the 1500 milliseconds in here now
the feature we want to use here is a
method on function instances called bind
the the bind feature was originally
implemented in third-party libraries to
solve this and some related problems and
it turns out to be really popular and
really handy it made its way into the
ACMA script spec in version 5 in 2009 so
any atmos crypt 5 compliant browser will
support this bind feature on any
function instance even better it's
possible to polyfill this bind feature
into old browsers so what we're gonna
see here can actually be used in
browsers that predate Ekman script 5 if
you need to do that and what we're going
to do is we're going to find the
function we want which is this dot print
name and we're gonna call bind on the
print name function itself
what bind does is it takes optionally of
this parameter and optionally other
parameters and it returns a new version
of the function that binds or retains
the this value that you provided if you
provided one and the other arguments for
this video what we're interested in
doing is preserving this value so we're
just going to put the current value of
this the one we want into as a parameter
into bind so this dot print name dot
bind and we passed this it looks a
little bit strange but it's actually
what we want and we can test this out
and after a second and a half it prints
out Jo so now we have the functionality
we want we're not using any scope or
closure workarounds we don't have any
var that and we're able to reuse exactly
the function that we already defined
that we knew we wanted to use so we're
able to have code reuse instead of
altering and copying the code so it
looks a little bit unusual but it's
actually a very common pattern that when
we create a function perhaps inline as
an event handler we might call dot bind
this at the end of defining that
function because we want to create a
version of the function that retains a
specific known value of this and be able
to pass it to some other piece of code
to use so the other code can invoke the
function without knowing anything about
the dots or the context or anything else
and get the right result in the next
section we'll take a look at a neck
mosquito that makes this even easier
than it is right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
