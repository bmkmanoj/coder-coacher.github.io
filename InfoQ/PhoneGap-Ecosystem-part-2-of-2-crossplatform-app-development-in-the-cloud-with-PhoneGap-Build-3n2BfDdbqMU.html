Jessie touched on a little bit about it
and throughout his talk he talked about
how phonegap we let you do whatever you
want what a framework you want so this
our idea for met bill is giving you the
freedom from SD case Who am I I'm shaz
run from Toby that's my Twitter handle
I'm frequently on DF phonegap Google
Groups helping everyone usually I'm i do
iOS here's whatever server looks like no
so basically the what we have is you
just give us your HTML CSS and
JavaScript and our outcome comes apps we
currently support five platforms all the
popular flap platforms like iOS Android
Blackberry symbian and webos and coming
soon or Windows Phone 7 me go and
Samsung matter we also have an API it's
a rewrite API it does almost everything
that phone got billed us you can write
apps for it some some IDs there's one
windows ID that's already using book
phonegap bill I API you can also true
true phonegap bill if you have a git
repo that's public or private we can
pull your code automatically I'm going
to do a demo of a phonegap bill so
phonegap bill exists on Bill funcom if
you forget the URL just go to phonegap
com and this should be a link on the
homepage and for most of you
part of a phonegap bill just use this
form on the front page and we should get
you a beta code pretty quick so i'll
just quickly sign in here
right now previously I've already built
to two apps but right now i'm going to
quickly show you how to set up your own
app just click on a new app button Oh
name it super app tree following the
team so this this might not work but
i'll test it out you can pull from git
github and we'll see if it works oh is
it oh thanks okay yeah it's there for so
i'll try again but I've already set up
I'll show you the that WWE folder you
can see it that's my app it contains
index.html a rudder old jquery and on
rather all jquery mobile and forgot yes
so I've already packaged this up so
another way for phonegap bill to get
your coat is you zip up everything in
your www folder and just upload your
archive I got it right here
click on create might take a moment and
if you see the bottom row you'll see
Android webos symbian and blackberry are
queued but iOS as a problem because iOS
needs your signing key I won't go into
signing keys obviously but I've already
I'll show you how it works if I go into
my app and i'll edit so at the bottom
bottom right there you'll see you can
select keys or add keys for android iOS
o blackberry I've already added my my
cert in there so I'm just going to
select it and add a package optionally
add a version and click on save and if I
go back to my apps it might take a half
a minute or so but you will see it
update automatically so as you can see
iOS and Android are already built and
black bear is built so web lessons
ambien are still building but from all
these links you can download the
packages directly to your system or if
you click on the app itself you'll
you'll get QR codes so you can scan it
for your phone and download it over the
air we haven't perfected the
over-the-air over a for iOS yet but for
the other systems should work so if you
notice on the top right there's a button
called debug that's what I'm going to be
talking about next how to debug your
your phone gap
so the technology we are using is called
wiener or winery this destitute two
camps of pronunciation it's it was
contributed by an IBM employee Peter
Mueller I'm gonna show you quickly there
it this is his website Weiner stands for
web inspector remote and if any of you
have used WebKit inspector eater on
safari or chrome you'll feel at home so
this project was a independent project
that's now under year phonegap umbrella
so if you go to github.com / phonegap
you'll find this project since i can't
show you on a device I'll have to show
you on the emulator at the simulator so
but technically if I do debug and I've
already put the app on my device I can
debug it straight from the browser so
right now i'll quickly jump to xcode
where i have the same project loaded
one thing here I'll show you what I mean
by us if you go to debug phonegap com
you will see how to use this remote
debugging I'll zoom in a little bit step
one is you have to enter your own good
and then inject that script tag inside
your code right now oh I'll quickly
generate a good and copy it to the
clipboard
that's a good I just generated so I'll
just add it right here and the web
service automatically generated me for
me a script tag so i'll copy that and in
my project this is the same project that
i upload it to phonegap built i'll add
it that script tag right here in the
head this was an old one I'll delete
that okay I'm going to run it in the
iPhone simulator give it a moment all
right now I can go back to the browser
so make it smaller and in step 3 you'll
see the link to debug this app you're
someone could have this device way
across the world you can debug it in the
browser from anywhere so you can see
right now it's connected to my simulator
from ebay com if you use WebKit
inspector this should be pretty familiar
to you here you can see all the elements
on that web page that was just loaded
and if you hover over an element you'll
see it reflected in their simulator
so right now there's a problem with this
this app i click on check for bugs it
doesn't work so if i go back to my code
I'll see check for bugs is actually it
should it should chew and alert yeah no
more bugs but it doesn't work so i'm
looking at the dakota and it should be
bound to an element with the ID bug
button so i look for it so in here you
can see it's called bah bah button so I
it might be a really complex app I don't
want to rebuild and deploy right so I
just want to debug it quickly so I'll
find your simulator in the elements tab
I'll try to find the input element this
is a jquery mobile page so it should if
you know jquery mobile you'll know it's
in the content data role so there it is
the input button so i can just
double-click and just change the
attribute to bookman so i'll try
clicking on it again still at work so
it's seems pretty obvious because the
that line was only call when the
document was ready now it's not it
wasn't bound to bug button so we have to
bind it again so all I do is I'll copy
these three lines I'll go back to the
debugger I'll click on a console tab you
can you can check out the L verified it
works I'll send an alert
a little paypal
there you go
so now I've copied those tree lines just
now and I can just paste it and now that
input element is bound did a quick
handle so now when i click on it gay no
more no more bugs this console is pretty
pretty powerful for example if i go to i
go to the phonegap com docs up funcom
and say i want to look at a geolocation
code I see this example I just want to
run it I'd want to rebuild my up this
copy here copy I can't find it
taste it
that coat was just just ran remotely
cat
so there's other tabs here that if
you've used WebKit inspector I encourage
you to play with the racket inspector if
you don't know how it works but you can
inspect your local storage session
storage cookies almost everything that
is in the Dom accessible through to DOM
that concludes my debugging demo thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
