be talking about building ember add-ons
with ember CLI so here we go so I work
at a company called add apart which
makes software for an investment
management so we care a lot about we
have kind of a huge app with lots of
visualizations lots of data and so back
in 2012 we picked ember to work with to
make that and one funny thing about
using ember since 2012 is that there's
been a lot of upgrades since then and so
I've been using ever actually I think
before 1.0 and so I've had a lot of
keeping up to date and so part of my
talk is going to focus on not just using
the new cool stuff but also how do you
transition to it from an alphabet used
to use something else and so with that
in mind there's kind of going to be two
parts to this talk the first one is an
intro to ember add-ons and Embree CLI
and then the second part I'll talk about
converting a library that was written
using a different format into the new
add-on format so let's go ahead and
start with part 1 just internet number
and add-ons so before I get too far I
think it's worth saying that ember atom
could be a lot of different things so I
think number data is available as an
add-on there's a bunch of testing tools
you unit build tools if you want your
coffee script or less to compile all of
that can be available as ember add-ons
so an add-on is just kind of anything
that you can drop in Syria it's easy to
install and it's kind of got a defined
format it still works but with that in
mind I can be talking about library
libraries being used as add-ons so
components things that you can just drop
in and use like a select component or a
date picker so I'll just kind of focus
on that specific area and so let's start
by talking about components and why
they're useful so obviously there's a
lot of us begin by using the same code
in multiple places so it helps you
enforce being modular picking a point of
view up and saying this can be used
throughout the app it can be used in
different apps and that helps too
because that way you can share with the
rest of the ember community they can
give you code and
everybody out so kind of isolating parts
of your app into specific behaviors that
you can turn into components is great
and just to kind of go over that in more
detail as it relates to a depart here's
here's a little bit of illustration
Madhukar so this is one of our main our
main pages that you might go into if
you're going to do some analysis so in
the middle here there's like a table
that has some detailed information you
don't have to worry too much about what
this is but just to say there's a table
with these other information there's
charts that give you a better overview
of what you're looking at in this case
it's financial data and on the left
there's a context chooser that lets you
pick kind of what context everything is
in and so we can look at that and say
okay here are two table components what
they have in common is they're both a
huge number of items in this case maybe
10,000 items and we want to make to make
sure we can display that well and it
turns out that the same code we write
for the table can also be used for the
context chooser so that's great and so
we isolated this into its own components
and we even were able to open sources so
now it exists as a library code and
we're table and that handles large
amounts of data and it's great to have
that isolated so other people can
contribute to it and there's other
places in our app we can look at too so
for example the estate starts on the
right those should be their own
components so we have a charts library
as well and then if we go back to around
the app there's just a bunch of little
things that could be isolated into
components and so there's things like
date pickers and select components
dropdowns settings and search and not
all of these are made into an
open-source to come library component
but it's good to just kind of be aware
that all these things should be put into
their own pieces of code and so there's
another library we have pull ember
widgets
anyway so this is how it should look if
you want to start out using a component
you should go to your app and you should
say hey I need that at my stable thing
that the other company had let me just
install it using Bower so that was a
great package manager for
and it seems you need so alkyl type bell
or install save and we're table and
that'll be great but in fact it doesn't
actually often work like that usually
what happens this you you install using
Bower and it doesn't work and you're not
really sure why you look in the console
it's not found in the console I wonder
why I've got to include it in whatever
build process I had so okay it's gonna
include that oh it's fixed include order
because I put it before amber by mistake
I still doesn't look quite right
oh I know what I'm missing the CSS
wasn't included because there's a
separate CSS process now it looks like
it's showing up but the functionality is
broken so let's go through the list of
dependencies and include all of those
some of them which probably aren't
documented in my build process following
the same steps for which I have stay on
CSS ah great excellent this is this is
good easy to use so there's there's
problems with with kind of the ad-hoc
way of doing things which is the problem
that add-ons try to solve and there's
other problems too so global name
spacing is a problem one thing that
we've been doing for a long time is we
define this table component there's
ember table and a table component and
that's great unless anybody else has
something that they want to define as
ember dot table in which case you're
going to have problems so ember CLI
which like it to animate helps a lot
with that dependency is kind of what I
alluded to your table needs some things
those all should kind of come with ember
table and not just be included in
documentation compiling from things like
coffee spirits less sass and then
discovery just to find out hey I need an
add-on how can i how can I find one and
so with that let's talk a little bit
about ember CLI so CLI stands for
command-line interface and it's kind of
the future remember in 2.0 I think we'll
be moving to actually using ember CLI
for the moment it's kind of a separate
library tool but it helps you a lot to
develop under applications and so things
you can do with CLI are things like and
burn ooh and then your app name and then
that'll generate the whole scaffolding
for you ember server to install and
watch your files are excited not install
but serve your files so you can get them
in the
and were installed to bring in a lot of
things such as add-ons and so maybe I'll
just kind of try to show you quickly oh
this looks like so hmm
- well with my wake just a minute so we
can run ember new and it generates a
bunch of stuff which is great
so it generates something like this
there's a directory structure with an F
Fuller and lots of other forms like
tests which is really nice app is
populated with a bunch of great stuff
like components and controllers so it's
pretty easy to just run this and now you
have a place to put all your code it'll
all run you serve it up so that this
kind of all ready to go and running we
can make add-ons this way so ember can
also didn't rate those they come with a
little bit of a different structure so
it's helpful to have a tool that just
does it via a single command and that
one looks a little bit more like this
there's an add-on folder and an app
folder and everything else ready to go
so I think I'll get into what does
actually mean it just to say so here's
the app file structure generated by
Andrus CLI and so some things that you
see here there's an app folder which is
all of your main application code that's
actually pretty much all I want to talk
about for apps but for a bomb it's a
little bit different so there's two
polar is called app and add on and one
thing to take note of is app is not the
same as it was in the app folder aside
in the in the application so now at the
man on our blows both places that you
can put library code for your apps and
the only difference is if you put code
in the app on the folder it'll all be
part of the add-on namespace if you put
code in the app folder then when
somebody installs your library all of
that code will be merged with the
application namespace which basically
means that the user won't have to do
include statements to get at your code
whereas if you put it in the atom folder
they will have to include from your
component library specifically so that's
those are both places that you put
library code the blueprint spoiler is a
place that you put code that will help
your add-on install so when somebody
wants to use your library they're gonna
want to install it and that should be
like
a single command and then your add-on
should do a bunch of work to set up
everything it needs to do and so you can
put code that does that in blueprints as
a tests folder which helpfully comes
with a place to put your dummy
application so there's a test dummy app
directory that also comes when you run
that command and that's a great place to
put your demo application so in our old
structure we made an app folder to do
that now it goes within the tests folder
which makes a little bit more sense
because that's kind of related to
testing out your app and making sure it
works so let's go through the problems
we had before and just kind of see how
ember add-ons address them so first
problem was global namespacing before we
defined everything globally so that the
host app could access it and that way
define it in one of these two folders
and add-on and depending on where we put
it it'll either be in its own atom
namespace our part of the host apps on
in space so the name spacing problem is
is a lot better this way so add
unsightly do something like explore the
components and then on the outside
that's using our library we can just
import from the component slash
components this is great so so that's
the name spacing Chuck dependencies
let's say we're in our add-on we can
specify in our dot JSON what
dependencies we have there's some
library and in index that is which is
kind of the entry point for you now we
have this included book that says hey
host at them I also need some library to
be installed and the reason we have to
do this is that ember add-ons are
installed by NPM and they're not really
aware of Bower and so to tell it to tell
your hosts out that it needs to have
something installed via Bower so it's
available you have this this hook that
lets it work
so dependencies are good compilation the
old way we had to do this or a couple
ways to do this was to have a dist
folder where you put generated files
like generated
script and CSS anyway the host app can
kind of take care of it on its own so it
can build itself they can minify and if
you want a lesser sass you just kind of
have to include a dependency that says
hey I'm built in less success and then
the host app can take care of compiling
that all down for you compilation is a
lot better and then discovery in our
package touching some of the library app
we just have to include a keyword ember
add-on and then they'll be indexed and
available via the site nba.com
so it's much easier to search and find
hey what well forget about Adams well I
have been compatible with my new number
app so this takes care of pretty much
all of our concerns so we've arrived in
the promised land
hooray and we can install via just one
line ember install add-on which is a new
command that does NPM install and
generate so this is great so let me move
on I guess to part two which is what if
I have a library already and I want to
convert it to be a number add-on to get
all these great benefits and so I think
one thing that we should learn is
embrace done a great job of upgrading
all of what they've been doing so amber
a 2.0 request for comments had a lot of
details about what you should do to
upgrade how we're being careful about in
gradings
upgrading and since we've been using
ever since before one point so this is a
really big deal because the fact that
they've done so well means that we've
been able to keep using newer versions
of ember and surprisingly the number
core team have done this without taking
multiple injections of a hundred million
dollars which is pretty impressive
during the upgrades embers have value
valued reliability consistency so that's
really nice too
and basically having a nice upgrade path
so that from one point so we can get to
two points out without having to try and
see what breaks and then fix it
as it breaks so what lessons can be
learned from this have a transition plan
I think is the first one just have
anyone at all
avoiding rewrites so that people don't
have to relearn how to use your app or
library and deprecating things before
you remove them for a couple versions so
that's all really useful I think the
only one we're not going to follow for
our library is deprecated then remove
because we're not at one point of it but
it's still a useful thing to learn so
let's go so I'm gonna get a little bit
more in depth about um this particular
library that we're going to try to
migrate over to Ember
so this is under table pretty high
contrast here but you can still see so
the idea of ember table is that it's a
it's a table it's a pretty heavy-duty
table it can handle a huge comer I don't
like 100 thousands and it only red
there's the ones that are on the screen
so that's nice and it has a you know a
bunch of column features anyway it's a
table has a lot of features so we're
gonna try to migrate this so the current
way that we did this is we made up we
said okay this is this kind of a map we
want to make a demo app still make an
app folder where all of the demo
application code will go library code
itself will go in the source folder and
then we'll have a compilation process
that results in jsm CSS files being put
in the dist folder and so this is a lot
of the same challenges that we saw
earlier so for example there's global
namespace thing that we did there's a
huge install process and then we had to
go through all this trouble of compiling
distribution files which is a big hassle
so give you a bit of an idea how
difficult it is to install add-ons like
this currently our library is currently
this is kind of what we recommended that
people would do as a simple way to get
going at the library so one line here is
including ember table 3 lines are
including
ember itself one line is M / tables CSS
and then the other five are all
dependencies of ember table which you
kind of had to know that you had to put
in as well and also in the correct order
so this is just kind of a lot to figure
out even if we tell you in the
documentation to do it so that's that's
kind of the old four
what we had to do so let's look at a
transition plan first lesson wheel and
so that we broke this down into three
steps phase 1 we're gonna try to
basically get under a table working as
an add-on
well not doing any work ourselves or as
little work as possible so we're gonna
try to import everything is about our
dependency and just expose it as an
add-on using the new add-on structure in
phase 2 we're gonna migrate the demo
application and then only in basically
we're going to migrate the actual
library to the new structure so this one
the basic idea let's start up a new data
ember atom will generate everything for
us
and the first thing we're gonna go do is
in that ad on the new madam I made we're
gonna go to power dot JSON and say we
have a dependency on ember table and so
it's honestly we've kept the old every
table arounds it's it's still you can
still install it the about or like you
used to be able to and here we've just
told our add-on that we need other table
so we'll do that okay next thing we do
is we go and make a blueprint so
blueprints are what we use once it's
installed into a host app so here we use
an after install book and add power
package to project and so what this is
this is telling the host app is as soon
as you install this ember table add-on
run this code and it will install ember
table at the Bower package and so your
host steps our power folder and so this
is great because now our add-on can
depend on the old Android table being
there so next thing we can do is within
our add-on we can make use of all of
these power dependencies that we have
using the included hook so here we're
working with index touch is which is the
add-on entry point and we use the
included book to say make sure you
import all of these dependencies that I
now know are there because I installed
them doing my blueprint so in this case
we need empty scrolled jQuery UI and the
actual Ember table code its own so that
Adam kind of does all the work of
bringing everything in and now we do one
final trick which
is we import everything from the
Global's and export it in the right
place so the add-on structure has a
structure like add-on / components
/ / table Dutch I guess and so if you
try to use the add-on you can do an
import and we're table from there and it
knows because of the file name when the
directory that that's how the add-on
structure is defined and it expects your
code to be there but instead of actually
putting code there we just imported the
global code which we had available the
our old memory table and then exported
it so we haven't actually written any
new code but we have reorganized it into
the new add-on format so after phase one
we've come pretty far you can install it
as an add-on and then you can even work
with it and pretend it's an add-on and
you're almost there but we haven't
really done anything too impressive
because the Global's are still polluting
the namespace they still exist you
brought in the old memory table as a
power and nothing has actually been
imported so that brings us to phase 2
let's start putting something over what
idea is before we actually port the
library code maybe we'll want support
over the demo app and the tests and see
if it works
so in our all setup there wasn't really
a way to make a demo app so we made a
folder called app but in the new setup
there is a demo app available in the
dummy in the tests dummy folder so we
migrate everything from the left side
app folder to the right side and then we
migrate the tests as well from the old
tests folder to the new desks floor and
this is great because we've we've given
ourselves a way to test the new the new
version once we start migrating extra
library code because of it but then we
have to look at and we have any tests to
test against and so we only have to
report the remaining actual library code
and so that's in basement so we used to
have this in the source folder now it
goes in the add-on folder it's better to
put things in the add-on fuller than the
out floor because that makes sure that
everything is in your apps
your add-ons namespace which kind of
helps it not be global that way somebody
who's using your own can use explicit
imports and then import things as
different names or whatever else they
want to do so we move the source over to
the add-on folder optionally let's say
that you actually do want it to kind of
be global and usable you can just do
this little trick which is in your
add-ons app folder remember it now pull
it out on folders are both places you
can put add-on library code we can do
kind of the same important export trick
so we import the table component from
the add-on floor and then we export it
now it's been exported in the out fuller
so you can use it without importing in
your whole step and then the final thing
you might want to do is migrate it is at
a global spill for backwards
compatibility and so maybe this is a
file that's outside of the embryo atom
whatever add-ons tons about but it does
a bunch of imports and then just assess
all the Global's back to what they were
so this is maybe one final step through
that and then after this done published
MDM and it should be possible to install
via and very install that on thank you
so thanks and thanks to my other part
team I mentioned I had our team we're
hiring so what a smell of you just
didn't working on some of this stuff and
there's information for this Lex
