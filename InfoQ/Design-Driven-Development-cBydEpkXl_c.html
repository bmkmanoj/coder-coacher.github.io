yep
so give yourself some hands nice looking
audience here alright so I'm very biased
I'm a designer by training I am I have
however overseeing hundreds of thousands
of lines of code being shipped one way
or another so I'm gonna talk to you
about design driven development kind of
a little term that I came up with you
know borrow of what have you to talk
about my process of thinking about
applications so first of all who is this
guy hold the mic in front of you today
I'll give you a quick background very
early on I had the opportunity as a
preteen as total to intern a paragraph
many of you don't know what that is some
of you who that have been around for a
little while do it's the company that
was responsible for the handwriting
recognition on the Apple Newton back in
the day a lot of the company is what
today is Evernote so I'm sure you note
that one by 15 that was the youngest
employee Kinkos as a designer obviously
no formal education at that point of
design but some some talent I guess and
by 16 I co-founded my first company so
after that very young age I ran a user
experience team edicom enterprise comm
old spin surrogate this was 12 years ago
or so back before user experience was
really a concept but managing complexity
talk about a complicated enterprise
products that's where you have to
actually think about different problems
and structured things that usable waste
after that I ran and sold a pretty
company got a degree in computer and
video imaging in that order
and start a design firm with offices in
San Francisco moved quickly or rather
open the second office in LA and had the
development in Eastern Europe and we
grew at a pretty quick clip a few years
ago I found it keen which is an
e-commerce platform to enable the print
industry to go online which is a big
trend I'll talk about that in a second
and through this whole time I advise
startups
on strategy products strategy and design
these things are interrelated obviously
and from my perspective they come first
so real quick the obligatory infomercial
ok went too fast let's go back
so what keen is is a large-scale
cloud-based ecommerce platform for
printer companies very large industry
640 billion that's about 18 times bigger
than the video game industry and it's
quickly going online of as far as
originating orders and dealing with
their customers and a lot of these print
companies are becoming marketing
services providers so they are the ones
that own relationships with small
businesses and and they're the ones that
are starting to provide online marketing
services as well to their to their
clients so what we've built over the
course of the last four years at launch
is a cloud-based application that allows
print companies to come in build
multiple storefronts very complicated
products and be able to run their entire
shopping about including integrations
with companies like camp a press which
are launching soon and Vimeo and others
where they can actually become
affiliates of resell products right
within their account and basically run
into our business on the platform so
again to give you a little perspective
you know the industry's about one and a
half times the size of the auto industry
is about 18% online at the moment in
next five years over 50% the orders will
come online so that's kind of what we're
chasing and we have a lot of domain
expertise there so we actually started
as a rails application quickly realize
there are some issues with scaling to to
our extent that we went to scholar and a
really painful rewrite so if you're
interested in that I can connect you
with our head architect they can tell
you all about that so how many of you
have any experience with Scala or any
interest in Scala yeah well I'll
definitely want to talk to you after
upwards so it's a real quick I'll talk
to you about four things today so
principles of good design so rather than
give you a taste of design I want to
give you some tastes to be able to know
and be able to articulate what is
design design disciplines and being able
to distinguish what different areas of
design are and what you actually need
may need for your application at any
given point what I describe is my design
driven development process and working
with designers or hiring designers some
some ideas there so some topics that a
lot of engineering found in engineering
led startups I feel I get questions from
a lot so we'll start with principles of
good design and I'm going to borrow from
the best dieter dieter Rams
was a very famous industrial designer
still it's still around you know Apple
has taken a lot of special design cues
from them he's established a lot of the
principles that are being utilized today
and he has impeccable taste he ran for a
very long time here n designed for Braun
and a lot of the products from the 60s
at beyond so he in the early eighties he
saw a design kind of getting away from
people and going into the woods and he
wanted to come up with ten principles of
good design that could be used as a
measuring stick for what is good design
and to be able to articulate measure
things against so his words are better
than mine so I will use his words so
good design is innovative the
possibilities for innovation are not by
any means exhaustive technological
development is always offering new
opportunities for innovative design but
innovative design always develops in
tandem with innovative technology and
can never be an end in itself so good
design always takes advantage of the
most current technology good design
makes a product useful a product is is
bought to be used it has to satisfy
certain criteria not only functional but
also psychological and aesthetic good
design emphasizes the usefulness of a
product will disregarding anything that
could possibly be tracked from it good
design is aesthetic the aesthetic
quality of a product is integral to its
usefulness because products we use every
day affect our personal personal enter
will be but only well executed
can be beautiful the design makes the
product understandable it clarifies the
product structure better still it can
make a product talk or at best it is
self explanatory good design is
unobtrusive products fulfilling a
purpose are like tools they are either
decorative objects nor works of art
their design should therefore be both
neutral and restraint to leave room for
the users self-expression good design is
honest it does not make a product or an
innovative powerful or valuable that it
really is it does not attempt to
manipulate the consumer with promises
that cannot be kept good design is
long-lasting it avoids being fashionable
and therefore never appears antiquated
unlike fashionable design at last many
years even at today's throwaway society
and these are words from 30 years ago
good design is thorough down to the last
detail nothing must be arbitrary or left
to chance
care and accuracy the design process
shall respect towards the consumer good
design is environmentally friendly
design makes an important contribution
to the preservation of the environment
it conserves resources and minimizes
physical and visual pollutions
throughout the lifecycle of the product
and good design is a little is as little
design as possible less but better
because it concentrates on the essential
aspects and the products are not
burdened with non-essentials I have to
cure purity and back to simplicity so
now you can see a lot of especially
physical objects you can judge within
this criteria and then you can now
articulate why did it make you feel good
about the problem so take a quick glance
there will be a quiz at the end and
prizes
all right so I'm gonna give you a few
good quotes about design so designs
design is intelligence made visible good
design is obvious great design is
transparent design is not just what it
looks like design is how it works our
friend Steve Jobs and my personal
favorite on this slide at least the
difference between a designer and
developer when it comes to design skills
is a difference between shooting a
bullet and throwing all right now a
little video and I want to get your
opinion on this okay attention
sounds cool right yeah no totally
because this is what an engineer would
build right this is the Rube Goldberg
machine now what a designer will build
is this right so there's a difference
right so you're building for human
consumption and you have to always keep
that in mind that you know what the
sausage factory is but your user doesn't
know and doesn't care they only care
about the problem so in that case you
want to flip this page it's kind of
comical right but but I wanted to show
this extreme example that yeah you can
you can build something really
complicated over build it but obviously
that's not for everybody so why that why
say that so your application right is
actually we have data around them we
have some logic and we have an interface
right well how a user sees it is they
see an interface and jef raskin who kind
of invented the Apple Macintosh the
Macintosh project said that as far as a
user is concerned the interface is the
product right because they see an
interface and then they see magic
somewhere inside it right so 95 percent
of the world does not understand how
programming works it does not care
probably more wasn't that so keep that
in mind when you are designing for human
consumption there is a there's a term
that I like to use that a lot of
applications that don't take it the
wrong way but it's designed by engineers
for engineers and you see a lot of
products that are very first
use because everything is is really
built-in though it's built in a very
very straightforward manner words it was
very data-driven very pragmatic but it
doesn't doesn't it's not designed around
you states that says designed around you
know features lined up in a nice grid
and that's not how people actually use
applications so let's talk about the
need for consistency real quick so when
somebody says something looks
professional what they really mean that
it looks clean and consistent in design
right this is a very important factor
because consistency sent us a quality
message of quality and builds trust
right so let's look at a couple of
examples so you know mint calm Jason
authority very very thought out there
designer these days it talks about this
a lot and basically they had a challenge
the challenge was they want to go to
consumers with a new brand and say trust
us with all of your banking logins right
good luck right so how do you get people
to trust you with all the banking logins
you really have to make a solid first
impression and ask me an impression of
trust and all of that is about how you
organize information cleanliness
consistency and an attention to detail
because if there's anything out of place
you lose a lot of trust now if you look
at you know let's say so for all right
cell is a bunch of dirt wax and oil
right in the form of this medics and
it's an average of sixty to eighty
percent markup over wholesale right so
they're they're creating a perception of
value so and you think that's bad right
here's some other industries clothing
has an average markup of one hundred to
three hundred fifty thousand three
hundred fifty percent furniture two to
four hundred percent shoes one hundred
to five hundred percent markup
eyeglasses eight hundred to a thousand
percent markup and prescription medicine
two hundred two fifty six hundred
percent markup over wholesale so to be
able to create that perception of
you it's all about design and messaging
and branding so very very important
factor much more important than let's
say whatever particular technology you
choose to build your application so and
design is not art right designers and
artists are complete different people so
here's a great quote that I like part of
my friendship art is like masturbation
it is selfish and introverted and done
for you and you alone design is like sex
there's someone else involved their
needs are just as important as your own
and if everything is done right both
parties are happy at the end so when
you're designing your urine a problem
solving discipline you have to have a
problem statement and you have to think
of it as a solution to a problem this is
not art this is not about
self-expression because it's unlikely
that your artistic your aesthetic is
going to appeal to somebody else's
problem unless you're in the art world
so let's talk about design disciplines
let's see so first and foremost you know
just like when you guys go to meetups
and everybody comes up to you and says I
need a technical co-founder I can't tell
you how many times I've heard things
like we need a designer or everything is
ready except we need to create accept
user experience right or you know things
I got sold let's talk about the specific
different disciplines designed so you
can articulate better what kind of
designer you eat because just like
there's a big difference between a
front-end developer or back-end
developer and a DBA a QA person cetera
there are probably even more shades in
the design world of design side of
things so a graphic designer is probably
the oldest discipline in this in the
design world and think of a you know
shortcut obviously frediting right if
you're working on web apps mobile apps
and I'm - most of you here are you know
you still need branding right you need
to create a brand that's consistent the
color scheme the identity the logo etc
so you would go to a graphic designer
for brandy
for illustration for any kind of
typography any kind of packaging that's
a that's a person there the user
experience is the core of application
development of any kind of software etc
and this was a design this is kind of a
hybrid discipline it's a person with
graphic design skills an aesthetic feel
and it's a also a technical person it's
a person that has psychology background
they can understand the users needs and
keep designed for a tent and basically I
just said it sense intent right you have
to understand what is the problem
who's the users what are they trying to
get done and how do we build it so UI or
visual designers then translate user
experience so the output from the user
experience process for example would be
a wireframe or a prototype with all the
flows with all the interaction already
worked out all you have to do is at spin
polish and extra you know back-end for
it to function as an application so it
always has to start with that do you
want a visual person will put the polish
on so it's a combination of you know
it's strong visual aesthetic also a
person that understands the design
principles of the given medium there's a
whole world of difference in designing
for web application a mobile web
application an iOS application an
Android application they all have their
own design principles and the person
designed the user interface has to be
expert in that given medium that you're
going for very very important and
ultimately they have to surface
functionality so they have to kind of
show off the application front-end
developer is the bridge between the
design world and the developable and it
also has to be a person that has design
aesthetic and an eye but can also speak
the right technical language and be able
to implement the user interface and hand
it off or logic implementation or
connect dots you know either which way
it goes and then of course don't forget
about your marketing people these are
the people that will come up with a copy
that goes into the application they will
come up with a sales strategy and copy
is much more well not much more
important but it's very very
side application how you talk to your
customers how you talk to your users and
what kind of tone you use and
consistency in language don't overlook
that and they're the voice of the
customer this is the person that should
be going out there touching with the
customer getting feedback and taking it
back to the rest of the team obviously
they can get much more complex as you
build out support that you build out
formal marketing and all this and that
but this is the bridge okay so design
driven development process
the reason they talk save that way is
again I'm biased I'm a designer but it's
design goes first so I think I've given
you a good preface but step one is a
problem definition unless you're working
on the core technology where the problem
is I want to make a fast faster database
or a new communication method or
something like that if you're designing
for a consumer or you're designing an
enterprise application you're designing
for a set of problems that somebody has
you don't try to give them vitamins
you're trying to deal with painkillers
so you have to define your problem and
say here's the exact problem here's what
I want to solve next step is to actually
sketch so I spend a lot of time in this
step to actually sit down a piece of
paper first sketch out different speed
and say okay you know user one we want
to do this in this at that so let's see
what was it what's the flow through the
application for us to actually achieve
this particular goal and iterating
through that you know five six versions
in then you'll go to high high high
level sketches which basically wireframe
or HTML prototypes you can use
applications like axure or rise to
actually create mock-ups and this is
where you can make a lot of decisions
before you write a single line of code
and you can actually feel how the
application will work so when you
actually hit the ground running there's
none of those pivoting Schmidty
rewriting code with all of this if you
have a problem that you've you've
defined and you have a prototype that
feels good and solving that problem
you're in that much ahead of the game so
next is that the user interface design
right this is where you come up with
your branding this is where you think
okay we want to use blue because 80% of
American corporate identity is blue
because it's a trusted color or we want
to use red because we want to be bold or
we want to use green because we want to
feel fresh you know there's a lot of
second graphics and all these things
come into play all the design principle
ISM and all the design theory where you
would start putting it into the
application and coloring that creating
that's that's setting for them then of
course you can actually you can start
doing this in parallel but this is a
good hand up point if you're doing
things in serial this is a good hand off
point to actually know okay this example
we need to build or at least the first
version of it now we can actually
structure the architecture behind it and
then a front-end development of course
to actually take those wireframes in the
user interface and cut up the screen so
the views and then the application
development itself and then actually
show it to users and they tell you you
suck and you start over
hopefully not and then you get that
customer feedback right so then you take
the customer feedback and then you rinse
and repeat alright so this is what I
call the design driven development
process you give it a different name but
this is how I like to think about it
from my perspective all right so when
somebody comes to me and says we just
have we already have everything done
except we need to we need just need the
user experience I mean it's okay we're
gonna throw everything away we're gonna
start over now a word on focus groups no
successful product has ever come out of
a focus group ever right every single
product that you can think of that
stands the test of time frank lloyd by
its buildings from a miller furniture
you know what have you
Apple products like these are physical
products and a lot of interfaces and a
lot of design principles that are
pioneered they are a qualitative
improvement sar not data-driven right
there-there you don't go to a doctor -
I'm sorry if you have a you know a
medical probably go to a doctor you
don't ask 10 of your friends what they
think right so if we need to do is
define a problem that designers
their job this is a designer's job is to
say is to solve the problem and the way
you evaluate designer is not based on
what kind of drop shadows or what have
you that thing isn't designs but how
they solve the problem and that's what
when you're interviewing designers think
about that right so a good segue so what
designers need right just like you know
developers good developers are a
commodity right now
right and all the companies are fighting
for them trying to give them everything
they need whether it's a fun environment
or what-have-you
I'll give you a couple of four things
that make designers feel good and as you
know anybody good at what they do they
don't really care about the exact amount
of money they care about the environment
they're in they care about interesting
problems to solve right designers like
interesting problems to solve they want
to create an open line environment right
because you can't be too data-driven and
you can't be too process driven if
you're going to innovate so design
process is it's very important to have
an open mind that and be able to manage
creativity it's a little bit different
and ultimately you want a strong voice
in a company or product direction
all right especially technology product
it's all about the product and designers
need to have a seat at the table
after all they want a little bit of
power right first you get the power then
you get the money so how would you like
your design so this is the typical value
circle good thing you can see it here so
you can pick two right so if you want
your second development there's a lot of
care of those you want something fast
and cheap for example of the ugly rushed
and careless you want something fast and
great sorry it doesn't exist all right
same thing free fast cheap and free
doesn't exist or free and great doesn't
exist fast and free exists it's called
trash cheap and great is never on time
so keep that in mind okay and then
ultimately you know design is core
right here is your starter you certainly
want to know what business you're in
right you have a person that's at least
doing the operations if nothing else
You certainly have engineering
especially in this context you have to
build something but ultimately the
design is that third like the school and
you really can't outsource it so just
like a software company you can't be a
couple of business guys or product guys
and the outsource everything offshore
all right they can't you can't outsource
your core product same thing design is
part of your core product all right so I
will close with that thank you
and I'll take your questions
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
