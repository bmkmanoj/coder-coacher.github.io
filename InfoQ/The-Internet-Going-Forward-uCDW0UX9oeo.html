show pence sorry I know that was
probably a little bit awkward for a lot
of us the stage manager thought I hadn't
started my presentation yet go we can
present can kind of run hear me ok now
though perfect well um anyway I kinda
wanted to make the point there that you
know we've all deeply integrated
technology into our consciousness
whether we want to realize it or not but
let me introduce myself again for real
my name is Emily Rose I go by neck seal
of on Twitter and I'm a software
engineer and a company called particle
i/o formerly known as far kya of anyone
heard of us yes least a couple so two of
you that know about my company like
totally gonna just talk the rest of you
but before we get into it here's five
fun facts for free about me my preferred
pronouns floral way I'm an artist
masquerading as a developer and I'm an
IOT and ubiquitous computing enthusiast
does anyone know what that means again
one of those two of us perfect all right
I'm not completely alone I'm also one of
the nicest people that you will ever
meet and i was born in portland oregon
which probably explains a lot so i'm
here to talk to you about something very
important anyone guess what that is
shout it out what do you what do you
think I might be here to watch eva the
future that is very true anything more
specific cybernetics the internet of
thing all of these things are very
perceptive perceptive guesses but I mean
I guess when it comes down to it what
I'm here to talk to you about is the
Internet itself well actually the
internet going forward the internet
going forward and by the way someone
named this talk for me I don't even know
who it was so I decided to take some
liberties and also skip through a couple
slides so yeah I'm not really sure if
if this is going to go over well but i
would love real-time feedback from from
all of you so if something comes across
your mind is feel free to shout it out I
won't be offended there will be a
microphone going around so if you have
something you want to say or a question
you want to ask there will be a
gentleman named Mike with a mic
available to bring one to you so that's
kind of cool but anyway so i guess like
before i get too deep into this talk
even though i'm more already almost five
minutes in what i want you to get out of
this talk is kind of i want you to think
of it as a sort of a cheerleading effort
in the form of a bizarre non-technical
talk about the hypothetical future of
the internet is that sound cool so we
are at forward Jas and I guess the first
question I want to ask is what is going
forward what is going forward on the
internet before we can talk about it we
need to make sure we all agree on what
that really means so does anyone want to
throw any ideas I'm sure a lot of ideas
going around already what's something
that you feel is a big part of moving
internet forward anyone have any
suggestions is it like hmm web hooks Oh
web component that's I mean that's that
sounds interesting i don't know much
about it i dunno but when i talk to
people about this i hear people say a
lot of things like you know the whole
mores laughing like you know faster
processors and more ram or faster
networks or maybe higher resolution
displays are going to help us or virtual
reality headsets i don't know how show
of hands who thinks that virtuality is
going to be one of the next big things
okay cool let's get to know maybe like
doesn't of yourself interesting okay did
you have a question I want to talk to
you later all right so is it
virtualization is it containerization is
it scaling horizontally or new framework
sardaar we are we moving the internet
forward by improving our resiliency or
optimizing for developer productivity so
we can iterate quickly or something like
that how many of us are using docker in
production is that moving internet
forward maybe or I don't know what else
do we use like terraform
chef for our core OS anyone use any of
that stuff okay so some of us are moving
the internet forward maybe from from
like an interface perspective like maybe
we're moving the internet forward by
like 13 button mice and illuminated
programmable mechanical developer
keyboards which are terrible by the way
don't ever buy 10 but yeah I mean I
guess that's a question to like are we
are we innovating by the way that we
interact with our devices on the web are
we you know are we pushing forward by
inventing novel input methods that are
either you know ever increasing or
diminishing and complexity yes that's
question I ask myself a lot but um you
know are we are we looking at a future
where maybe the whole eyeball fingertip
feedback loop is the thing of the past
and and you noee geez have taken over or
f MRIs or you know whatever the new
brain interface thing is know a lot
about that either but no all of those
things are wrong I'm sorry it's nothing
personal really but all of that stuff is
very exciting but I think I think
they're all missing the mark for my
perspective anyway and this is a talk
about moving the internet itself forward
and I think that it's way more
meaningful than that so allow me to
gather my breath while I discussed some
in my opinion breathtaking facts in
quotes facts in quotes because their
internet facts and we all know how
reliable those are so in 2013 it was
estimated that 51-percent of internet
traffic was non-human does anyone know
what that means non human traffic shout
at me pretty much yeah like the SEO
industry has like an acronym for that's
called nht non-human traffic and it can
be you know like a google crawler or it
could be some you know exploits script
know some somebody's got like metasploit
runnin and thinks their lead or
something i give me scrapers it could be
you know a sensor array like a sensory
it could be contributing to that
non-human data that's outputting
meaningful data in it maybe so
we don't know and in 2014 that number
jumped up by a solid ten percent so on
one year an additional ten percent of
the total traffic of the internet was
attributed to non-human so if we do just
a real quick you know super scientific
linear extrapolation we get a graph that
looks like this extremely scientific you
can tell because this access is not
labeled but it shows us very clearly
that by the year twenty eighteen
non-human traffic has grown to the point
where it accounts for a hundred and one
percent of the total internet traffic
which seems pretty remarkable to me but
that's just considering linear growth
right like what about the exponential
growth that we all know to expect what
would that grass look like can anyone
imagine what that graph would look like
no that's okay because I drew it
actually it looks like this and it turns
out that it's just it's super impressive
I mean look at that nine thousand
percent up for the top this is this is
this isn't real data I'm not a diet a
data scientist I'm not that good with
Python but I can make pretty graphs in
keynote which is almost the same I think
but so basically what I got out of that
as our chart showed us right as our
chart shows us by 2020 an estimated over
nine thousand percent of the total
internet traffic will be non-human in
Oregon so I mean that's mind-blowing to
me I don't know about the rest of you
but honestly the real figures are way
more impressive than bogus trips right
like there's not really enough publicly
reliable information out there that I
can you know use to like build an actual
graph that we have any any meaningful
trend at all but in all seriousness 50
billion devices are going to be online
by 2020 how many people show of hands
how many people believe me 50 billion at
least well would you believe Cisco
consists goes the company that said that
they're the ones that are estimating
that 50
billion devices will be online by 2020
so we know the data is flowing and we
know that it's going to tin you it's
going to continue to flow in exponential
graph right because keynote lets me make
graphs with I can put any data I want
and learn it clearly shows you know a
trend but where is the data coming from
I guess maybe that's you know the next
next subject that we should just really
talk about like where is this influx of
data going to come from any any ideas is
Mike around in it anywhere dang boy
anyone have like a question they want to
throw here like I'm sorry an answer like
where where is all this new data going
to come from i think it's i think it's
an inch in question no i think it's an
interested this gentleman over here
would like to posit a response that's
what he's here for I mean his name's
Mike like it'll come from a new cluster
of machines that are bound to watching
us and perceiving us and trying to make
intelligent decisions about us it'll
come from an artificial intelligence
that tries to interface with our own
intelligence her things exactly i mean
that's that's exactly what I envisioned
when I am you know maybe staying up a
little bit too late sleep deprived and
thinking the future but I mean in all
reality like that data is literally
coming from everywhere places as
creative as what you mentioned and and
also places as mundane as like you know
the corner store down the street and
it's literally more of everywhere every
single day every single day more sensors
are collecting more data in more
locations and existing systems are
adding additional sensors and it's just
sensors all the way down literally but
what does the data represent what kind
of data are we going to start emitting
on the internet and data we're going to
start collecting and again I know this
is probably getting tired right now but
show of hands anyone have any input on
what you think the nature of the data
will be
quiet quiet audience maybe you can guess
what i'm going to say literally
everything literally like credit card
activity transit usage temperature
readings seismological events gas
emissions sorry about that by the way
owes me uh water and air quality data
the toasted pneus of your toast and data
like on literally anything and
everything from your daily activities
your health your whereabouts to you know
the overall status of the world at large
and again literally more of everything
every single day because like I said
every single day more novel sensors are
collecting new kinds of data new
measurements a data point that we've
never had before and entirely new types
of data producing systems are being
invented and brought online figuratively
speaking of course not like every day
not every day but it's you get the point
like hyperbole is one of my superpowers
so please accept that let's move on so
we've covered you know a lot about what
going forward is not we've talked a
little bit you know about what going
forward might be but let's get more
concrete what what is going forward
dramatic pops and I'm time trying out
this dramatic posting so afterwards come
and see me let me know what you thought
about it I really like the fan here to
this is adding to the drama of the
dramatic pause what oh I know ah so good
all right give me just something you
should not have said that this is oh
sorry okay we'll bring it back in all
right so anyway going forward is say
this with me now okay going forward is
it come on embracing the fact that we
are evolving the very concept of what it
means to be human so this brings me to a
quote
Homo sapiens have outgrown their it's
gotta make way for the homeless superior
and I think that's a very apt quote
because humanity has the opportunity to
level up and gain new superpowers like
maybe not in like the comic book hero
sense but we have a very real
opportunity to improve our everyday
quality of life or safety you know like
our longevity the distribution of
information and other resources to the
responsible and intelligent use of
meaningful data and also a quick note
about non-human data I believe very
strongly a bit non-human is a misnomer
in this using in this context because we
are our data I know it doesn't say it on
the side that in their kind of dramatic
pause here because i'd like to try to
maybe blow your mind a little bit with
the next slide so please if you will
imagine with me for a moment can we
bring the house lights down just a
little bit this is very important to the
ambience of this exercise perfect now
this space here lovely white screen is
filled with the content that you've
generated on every social media property
that you've ever encountered does that
look like enough space for you to kind
of imagine everything that you've ever
done on the internet right everything
you've ever posted to Facebook every
tweet every snarky reddit comment every
hilarious image macro or you know every
selfie and blog post all your source
code really take a minute and just kind
of lay it all out there and think about
it and what it means to you and kind of
how it signifies what you've been
through as you've developed not only
software but as a human being and I
guess the conclusion that I'm trying to
help you make is that you are your data
like literally you are your data the
content that you create is you and when
you die your personhood continues to
exist in the form of your data and
people will post on your Facebook page
and if you're lucky it will become
memorialized
like even today machine learning allows
us to recreate it as you know some I
reasonable facsimile of your personality
just by analyzing existing content so
what does this tell us about what it
might mean to be alive in 2020 when
there are 50 billion devices on the
internet so this is where I guess it
starts to get maybe a little too deep
for some and you know if you need to
leave the room that's that's totally
okay but the internet is now also a
conduit for the expansion of human
consciousness itself the shape of our
consciousness is changing and we are
more than we used to be we are quite
literally enhancing our own senses we're
giving ourselves entirely new senses
like you know for example I know it
probably doesn't feel that way but like
push notifications when motion is
detected in your home surveillance
camera or GPS enabled applications that
augment your memory based on information
that's relevant to your current location
I mean that's with your forms of new
senses really so you know we're creating
new depths of awareness we're
quantifying our existence on entirely
new levels we have our fitbit's we have
our last.fm accounts we check in on
foursquare or I guess it's swarm now i
don't know maybe some can explain that
to me later but we use ride sharing
applications that provide us with
detailed route reports for every ride
our amazon purchases well recorded and
many of us habitually habitually leave
reviews for products and services that
we particularly enjoy or dislike so this
is all just a very long-winded way of
saying we are now uniquely empowered to
understand and interact with the world
and people all over the globe are taking
ideas that are personally meaningful to
them and they're sharing them on the
internet and sometimes or even turning
them into actual products will become
available to thousands of people so
there's people living in small urban
spaces that are now growing their own
food and expensively and auto magically
which is a fun word to use and like you
know pet owners are getting flexibility
and freedom it was
sorry remote pet feeders and you know
farms can manage their resources more
efficiently and people who can't speak
are gaining a voice and please ask me
about that story later if you're
interested I don't really I couldn't
really fit it into this talk but it's
something that but I witnessed and have
been touched by so anyway I mean you can
make things that provide you with real
value in your own life right now today
the future is DIY the tools exists and
it's not that hard so yeah there's
there's hundreds of resources on the
internet to get started and just like I
guess a quick show of hands in terms of
like community resources how many of you
have heard of hackster taxi Rio it's a
great great community-based tutorial
site how about instructables okay very
popular one the company i work for
particle also has a pretty active
community forums that's a shameless plug
for you there and there's you know
there's there's also like countless
inexpensive options for actually you
know building something this is where i
started talking about things like
arduino has anyone heard of an army not
very good lots of us most of us and
things like raspberry PI's and electric
imps anyone heard of electric in very
cool how about a spark or yay another
shameless plug but anyway we've got like
you know little bits and and like i said
raspberry pies and new boards being you
know made on Kickstarter or made just in
someone's basement every day so anyone I
guess you know what I'm trying to say is
that you can create something useful
with a cheap board over the course of a
weekend and there are hundreds of
manufacturers of you know pretty
standardized components that are you
know like sensors and actuators that are
shockingly an expensive really often and
integrate with your projects really
easily there's a lot of libraries on you
know for common sensors and whatnot but
anyway you can augment your existence
with technology that is as unique as you
and I forget exactly what I was trying
to say with a slide of event like
you now at this point in time can solve
your own problems in a way that's
accessible and convenient for you
personally like you don't need to wait
for some company to come along and
manufacture a product that happens to be
geared towards you like if you have the
time and inclination you can make
yourself something that has a meaningful
impact in your life great so how are we
going forward what are we going to do
with all this technology that I'm
talking about all right so obviously we
have a lot of our disposal but how do we
go about utilizing it what are you know
what are we going to do what's that I
mean I think that that is something
that's definitely you know a vital part
of our continued existence but I think
it's a little out of scope for this
particular tall so when I think about
how we're going to move forward within
the context of the internet stay with me
on this I'd like some more audience
participation look this one if you can
tear yourselves away from your screens
so with me now we move the internet
forward we move the internet forward by
pushing it away pushing it away to the
periphery of our vision so we can focus
on being human and this is where i would
like to invoke the second quote of my
presentation by someone who I
particularly admire named amber case and
she said in a TED talk the most
successful technology gets out of the
way and helps us live our lives and she
says a lot of really interesting thought
provoking stuff so you should also
follow her on Twitter if you're
interested she's a she's a cyborg
anthropologist she's not the only one
and she actually specializes in
understanding you know just the way that
we interact through technology and what
effects it has on our society and our
culture and you know in my opinion it's
an extremely interesting field of study
so I know what you're probably thinking
at this point is that you know like I am
up here trying to pitch you some you
know utopia of ambient computing and you
would be exactly right
that's exactly what I'm trying to do
right now but things are different now
than they were five years ago hardware
is inexpensive the internet is
ubiquitous most places and software
belongs in the cloud and when it comes
to this new kind of generation of
thinking about the internet and how
we're going to interact with it we're
still seeing exactly how all of this is
going to play out so you know I think it
makes it particularly exciting for
people who have a passion for for
building and for data and that sort of
thing but the phase of where things are
at right now tells us that the
implementations that we're able to
create are more valuable than standards
and I think as software developers it's
really easy for us to kind of complicate
the process of iterating on something
that's hardware-based by taking a lot of
our kind of rigid software approaches
and trying to apply them a little too
early in the life cycle of you know a
development of a product or a project so
this is just chalk this up to a little
bit of a tidbit for interested parties
and if you're thinking about getting
involved in this stuff but I'm kind of
kind of going off on a tangent a little
bit because I kinda want to bring it
back to my initial point of this entire
talk which is that you're already a
cyborg the only choice you have now is
how well you're going to take advantage
of your unprecedented access to
information and technology so I say get
started right now you should start right
this second and the truth is that nobody
has a clue like if that's something
that's keeping you from getting started
I will tell you right now nobody has a
clue what's going on this is one of the
things that makes it so exciting to me
because it's very important at this
stage that smart people that really care
and are passionate about what they're
doing get involved and figure out how to
do things right and there are a lot of
very important questions left to answer
so on that note I would like to open up
the podium to questions or if someone
would like to add to my talk the
internet is extremely collaborative and
if you feel so inclined I will
and you the microphone questions at all
anyone you're so inquisitive of an
audience I know I've really kind of
taken you for a ride here do you have a
question you have a question where's
Mike hi Mike someone has a question I
guess my white my mic is Wireless too
good i could just cut down here Oh
feedback can you hear me yes I can um
I'm right here hi hi so do you see the
information that's being collected as
being mostly about people or about
things I'm just curious well I think I
mean part of what I kind of wanted to to
illustrate and maybe you know like kind
of through the lines say is that like
that the delineation between a person
and a thing is is something that I think
will continuously be blurred as time
goes on so a lot of our you know the
things that we know of in the world that
have any relevant information to share
on the internet they don't really exist
in a vacuum so they represent someone or
many someone's so I think I don't know
if I'm answering your question like
properly but i guess i would say it's
like it's a bit of a bit of both like
there is definitely a lot of data that
represents data about a thing but when
it comes down to it that thing is only
happening because a person needs it too
so my name is Vince you brought up a
good point called meaningful data so I'm
thinking about you can collect data
that's fine but what do you think of the
future of empathy of empathy yeah
because you said all this internet is
about being human rights what after
slide right yeah so my understanding of
being human is how can be more
compassionate towards each other bring
values out of each other really enhance
the experience of being collaborative
library absolutely and what is the fun
of having an Internet and collaborate
but what is a meaning to enhance
somebody's experience like you and me or
this group of audience yeah what do you
think of future of empathy I think I
think so that's it it's a tremendously
insightful question and something that I
know I'm probably not prepared to give
you a full answer right now on the spot
but you know things that come to mind is
just
the fact that we have an unprecedented
number of opportunities available to us
in terms of how we can communicate with
people I mean when it comes down to it
we're just talking about like you know
bits going across a wire but we have you
know all sorts of new kind of community
type efforts coming along so I guess the
first thing I think of is like slack for
example I recently built a slack group
and the thing that I've been finding
that's particularly interesting is like
under the hood slack is this is like a
set of api's and is really powerful is a
tool to kind of build like kind of a
community-based that is tailored around
the needs you know for your particular
group so like the group that i created
is called peer global it's a the hope is
to make it a global group of people who
identify as queer in some way that's
significant to them and give them a
space to kind of you know communicate
and support each other and you know I
found that to be something like
something that's been extremely
meaningful to me in even a very short
amount of time so I know that's kind of
a disjoint and answer but that's how the
first thing that I could think of and
I'd love to chat with you more about it
anyone else have any questions at all
I'm like way under time so like don't
feel like they're going to push the talk
duration or anything anyone up there you
have a question you want to shout it out
and I'll repeat it so how do I feel
about my online identity like in the
context of like living independent of me
I think that it's it's it's fascinating
I'm it's one of the things that I'm most
excited about the concept that I I could
cease to be aware of my existence and
there's this possibility that the rest
of the world could be completely unaware
of my demise and I feel that like if I
have my choice of methods of the
mortality that probably wouldn't be my
first choice I'd love to be aware of the
fact that I continue to exist but
something that does excite me is if
we're not able to get to that point
before I do reach the natural end of my
life I would love to know that kind of
the sum of what what content i had left
on the internet is still kind of out
there being extrapolated and turned into
new new content that is essentially you
know the essence of who I am or who I
was you there uh right behind you Mike
and let that get pointing to himself yes
yeah just a related to what you were
saying earlier uh do you think that your
online identity is like I like accurate
representation of yourself or do you
feel like there's like sort of
differences similarities I mean
generally among all people yeah I was
gonna say like it as a general question
or one specifically to me both okay well
I mean I think it's pretty obvious that
you know on a general sense we all have
at least somewhat compartmentalized
ideas of who we are and so a lot of us
are familiar with the concept of like
public private and personal self and so
I think those like layers of exterior
apply to most people in the context of
the internet on a general sense i think
it's it's very fair to say that like who
someone represents themselves as on the
internet may not be the truest depiction
of who they are in the physical world
but i personally feel that that's part
of the freedom and empowerment that
comes from you know better understanding
and utilizing the internet as an aspect
of our identity because it does allow us
to explore pieces of who we are without
you know some of the same you know
ramifications that exists in the
physical world and then to myself
personally i can say that absolutely
like my internet persona or identity is
completely different from from Who I am
in person I mean I'm completely
different person from Hawaiian mom's on
stage you so very much the case did that
answer your question yeah do you I'd
love if you would like to elaborate I'm
happy to like would you say like a part
of this is like anonymity you know like
being like on 4chan or something like
you can just like flame away and like in
real life you can't really do that so
part of what you're saying I think that
that's definitely a part of it I mean
people who have a desire to disrupt the
lives of others are definitely going to
find ways to do that but that minimize
their personal risk but I don't think
that that's the bulk of you know what
the Internet has to offer I think that
if you look at the kind of I hate to use
the word but if you if you look to the
zeitgeist of the internet by and large
people are using that anonymity as a way
to empower themselves so I personally
look at that as kind of a double-edged
sword that at least right now as enough
benefit to to outweigh the you know kind
of the negatives that you end up taking
place there is a question over there
thank you Mike with your trusty Mike so
my question to you is how you define
poor how do i define poor poor like as
in my in the term of like poverty
anything what mr. definition of what is
first thing comes to your mind when you
say when somebody ask you poor when
someone says that they're poor yeah I
guess the first thing that comes to my
mind is that they're perhaps lacking in
something that is a value to them so in
the context of our quiet capitalist
society first thing that would come to
mind is is money but on a more
philosophical sense i guess i would
start thinking about being poor in
spirit because it's very easy to be
monetarily broke but still at least
somewhat happy with the fact that you're
alive and experiencing existence is that
at all an answer to your question you
know but why question is why everybody
thinks that poor has to be completely
related of to financial yeah I said I
only have six hundred followers right so
that means I'm poor than Britney Spears
with a shield million followers so what
is the definition of really poor why
everybody thinks for is just financially
right how we're going to change because
as I feel this meaningful data which
we're collecting if we can collectively
make the change to a superior of like
you say super hero or the superhuman
yeah somebody has
do that because I think that's like that
that's only way people will be
authentically sharing right there online
persona with your offline yeah yeah and
I think I think at the very end there
you brought up you know really good
point to that end is that I think we can
break free from a lot of that by finding
ways to decouple the data or the content
that we're producing from our ego so i
hope i hope that helped said but i'd
love to chat with you more about this in
the hallway track as it were you had a
question yeah i was curious about the
paradigm of moving the internet forward
in a way so that you're pushing it away
and it gets out of your way in contrast
with the what appears to be the
exponential increase of hyper tracking
yeah and the anxiety of tracking not
just I mean there's the whole layer of
who's tracking and who's seeing it when
I've been outside of that just managing
multiple Twitter accounts and this
tracker and that one and that one and
during a span of 16 hours of waking life
a day how does it how do we get from
exponential tracking to getting out of
the way of our lives because yeah I see
a bit of a contradiction there yeah
absolutely i think i didn't think that
is a really hard question to answer i
don't think anyone has one silver bullet
just yet but the first thing comes to
mind again is amber case and the work
that she is doing around calm technology
and that's something that I find
particularly appealing and I feel that
it's pretty pretty parallel to what I
envision and it just kind of comes down
to finding ways to determine the level
of urgency of data in a way that is more
appropriate to how you live your life as
a human being rather than as like an
entity that exists on the internet so i
can go into all sorts of attention we
are getting a little bit tight on time
at this point but for me I think of
things like you know just ambient
alerting and and I wish I could think of
a project name that I thought was
particularly interesting but it's a it's
a process of taking event streams of
information and encoding them into
like subtle variations in the tempo of a
background song that's playing or a
slight shift in the hue of lighting
around you to indicate a certain thing
and I think if there's a lot to be
explored there i hope i hope that's
anywhere near your hitting kind of what
you're talking about well i think we
might have time for one more question hi
i'm shelling from emil thank you for a
presentation he's very inspiring thank
you I'm actually I thought question
because you mentioned we have we may
have a lot of human data more and more
in the future and then I was wondering
is that means the privacy will be a big
problem is that means internet a surgery
or network security will be a blocker to
the Internet at going forward knees yeah
thank you yeah I think that's a great
question i didn't even try to touch on
privacy in this talk because it is it is
such a huge topic that like i could give
two or three talks just on how we
approach privacy going forward but from
my perspective the thing that i am
trying my best to position you know the
industry to kind of accept is the idea
of kind of like bring your own data so
kind of like this concept of federating
access or distribution of data so to
give an example I've are you familiar
with like Amazon Web Services and how
you can you know like kind of timeshare
some boxes in amazon's cloud when
privacy becomes a concern i can imagine
at least a very similar model but with
the exception that the hardware running
holding my data is actually owned by me
and I can't really tell you how that
would actually manifest in terms of the
logistics of it but I think that bring
your own data is a particularly powerful
concept that has a lot of potential to
alleviate some of the privacy concerns
but essentially you know on a very high
level allow you to be the one in control
of you know what nodes have access to
what type of data that you have stored
about your personhood so I don't know
where any of the stage managers or
eyes are so I don't know exactly how
much time I have it looks like I'm one
minute over so I'd like to just end this
with you know a pitiful plea to follow
me on twitter I'll link my slides I'd
love to chat with anyone who found
anything that I have to say interesting
and that's all I have to say so thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
