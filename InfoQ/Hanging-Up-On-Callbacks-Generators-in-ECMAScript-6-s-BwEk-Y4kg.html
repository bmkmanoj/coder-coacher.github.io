you want to follow along I've got some
slides github slash laser slash slides I
had some totally lame github name and I
was told by someone that if you email
like contact at github com
they'll totally like respond and do
stuff so I emailed them and asked him if
I could have laser because whomever was
sitting on it wasn't doing anything with
it they totally gave it to me so reach
for your dreams you might be able to get
laser to or something like that if you
can't be bothered to sit here and watch
me go through all these slides I've got
some working demos of the generator
stuff up at es6 - gentoku app comm you
can use these examples with the current
version of Chrome as long as you enable
the experimental es6 features Firefox as
of Firefox 27 has promises
implementation that works with excuse me
not promises been sitting in too many
other people's talks today generators
implementation that will work with all
but one of the examples I have here
there's some discrepancy between how I
think they deal with the yield keyword
but it should more or less work and you
can sort of get a feel for some trivial
examples of using generators so I'm
going to Vella per at carbon 5 there's
some other carbon 5 people around here
yeah I'm based out of the LA office I'm
from a little hillbilly town outside of
Seattle whenever I come to San Francisco
I always love to like take digs on LA to
try to like you know engender support so
I just want to let you guys know that I
say hella hella often anyways okay so
what am I gonna actually talk about
essentially the value proposition that I
think generators provide amongst others
but the main one for me is it enables
you to take code that looks like this
which is kind of sloppy lame JavaScript
but there it's doing a bunch of things
that we do often try-catch used to trap
errors that arise from performing some
synchronous operations
using a closure and a centralized error
handler to consolidate error handling
across let's say event loop tix as a
result of some like asynchronous
operation gone awry or whatever anyways
we do this stuff all the time
flow control by nesting continuations
inside of continuations bla bla bla bla
bla you can take that code and you can
condense it down to something that looks
like this we're doing basically the same
thing we're gonna perform a synchronous
operation some lib get data if some
exception were to like you know arise
from that let's say some Lib was
undefined we called get data on there
we're gonna hit our catch block
similarly if we get an error passed to
our callback to get or a post which is
let's just assume is like an alias for
some memo HTTP get request to slash foo
or a post to slash bar if we get an
error there it is gonna hit our same try
catch and generators enable you to write
code that looks like this so you're
gonna be able to move from a
continuation passing style where you're
like asking the computer to do something
at the same time telling it what you
want to do next to direct style which is
asking the computer you know to do
something getting a value back maybe
putting in a variable or whatever and
just moving sequentially through your
program without actually losing any of
the excellent aspects of the single
thread event loop okay so that was kind
of like hand wavy but really what I'm
gonna talk about I'm gonna try to
demonstrate that I think that
programming around asynchronous
callbacks is hard especially for people
coming from programming languages that
the idioms involved like direct style
programming so I work with people that
have Java backgrounds have ruby
backgrounds Python and over the last
five years have seen people transition
into doing more JavaScript development
especially on the client and it's proven
difficult for many people to move into
that that continuation continuation
passing style paradigm as I mentioned
before equi script 6 you get generators
so you can do some interesting things
syntactically to alleviate some of the
pain of learning how to write code
around asynchronous callbacks okay so in
demonstrating how loss
generators arm and it sort of enumerate
some gripes that I have about
programming with asynchronous callbacks
the first one being as I mentioned that
I think it's a non-trivial amount of
effort for someone coming into the
language programming with this
asynchronous callbacks to follow the
what's going on so we're all JavaScript
experts so we know that this is code is
total but like I committed this
sin early on right like you write your
program in many other languages from top
to bottom here we have message variable
that's accessible to the closure this
anonymous excuse me this anonymous
function expression here so when I get a
response back from making an HP request
to you profile I'm gonna in cube my
callback my callback is gonna fire I'm
going to add profile name to whatever it
already existed message and then I'm
gonna log it out no that's not true
the VAR message hello and console log
message happened in the same tick of the
event loop future ticket event loop is
what I'm going to do the assignment to
message which is available through the
closure so I'm actually gonna log hello
and then nothing else after that which
is you know kind of a bummer as I said
you guys all know how to do JavaScript
so this is not like an error that you
make anymore but he tried to teach your
mom how to write JavaScript she may have
some questions for you the other thing I
want to talk about is handling
exceptions across different ticks of the
event loop so as we know try catch only
works if the code inside the try excuse
me if the error is raised from code that
executes synchronously inside that those
try braces so for instance if like some
lib get data if some exception is raised
there I'll be able to catch it here and
my catch block and if I want to
consolidate the way that I handle errors
across these different ticks the event
loop both asynchronous and synchronous
I'm gonna need to do something clever
like create an error handler function
which is going to be made available to
the asynchronous stuff through closure
so let's say I get an error back from
either one of my synchronous calls to
get or post which like I said is just an
alias for like HTTP GET with an
asynchronous
a synchronously fired function
expression afterwards I get an error
back I'm gonna via a closure send that
error to my centralized exception
handler that's a lot of noise and I will
demonstrate the it doesn't have to be
this bad the last thing is that it's my
position that flow control especially if
you're mixing parallel and things that
you want to do in series is harder than
it needs to be when working with
asynchronous callbacks this is just the
vanilla JavaScript example but what
we're doing here is we're doing an HTTP
request for token and an HTP request to
get a key we're doing those two things
concurrently when they're both done then
we're going to execute our login
function which is going to take those
two values it's gonna combine them into
an array and we're gonna send all that
stuff via HTTP
once we get a response back from that
then we're gonna redirect the user using
some off key or something like that it's
a lot of code and the continuation or
the callback that we're giving to our to
get functions in order to achieve this
in order to achieve this notion of like
blocking further operations until both
of these asynchronous things have
completed I had to do some lame stuff to
check to make sure that when one
asynchronous operation completed the
other one was completed so on and so
forth this gets a little bit better if
you use promises but it's still a lot of
noise right we can use your favorite
promise library of the week to do two
HTP requests one for token one for key
and then when both of those two promises
have resolved with value we will execute
our anonymous function expression here
to do an HTTP POST to off using that
data and then when that thing is done
then we can do our redirect that's
better
I mean it's better than that sloppy
stuff but it's not it's not as good as
we can do async there's a lot of code
here how many of you've used async many
of you right yeah I use it all the time
where they think we're doing the same
thing we're doing again to token and get
key we get the results back we do a post
and then we do a window redirect
we can cut some of the lines out of this
by using bind to do some partial
applications so that we just pass a
reference to the original function with
some argument sparsely applied but it is
still a whole bunch of code and to the
uninitiated and the uninitiated you have
to look at all this stuff like parallel
waterfall whatever it's it's a bummer
okay so generators generators are being
SPECT out in the es6 specification or
being described in the es6 specification
I'm not going to read you that but
they're essentially they are functions
with multiple entry points so the
functions even working within JavaScript
up to this point you enter in at the top
and you exit out at the bottom these
ones you enter into the top you can stop
freeze the generator function somewhere
in the function body and then resume it
later on at the point in which you
suspended you may be thinking yourself
like ACMA scripts good Eckman script six
that's awesome but like I have a job
that caused me to like you know write
code for old web browsers or whatever
and I totally get that you can begin to
play with these things and you can
actually make this stuff work with es5
compliant browsers if you're willing to
introduce a transporation step this
google trace sewer or Twista or i don't
know how to say that but the Google T
word project enables you to write some
code that takes advantage of some of
these es6 features and try and pile it
into es five and since like
precompilation steps in javascript
Landor like all you know like the normal
thing we do it's not you know if you
transpile to yes five you can use this
stuff today in Firefox 27 Chrome Canary
or even the chrome that the regular
consumer Chrome as long as you're
willing to flip on that es6 experimental
flag you can use the stuff in node 11
and more recent as long as you use the
Harmony flag that may not actually be
true you may not need the Harmony flag
anymore but as of zero-one-one you can
play around this stuff okay
basics this is like the hello world of
JavaScript generator functions and I'm
gonna go through a couple like pretty
lame examples just to make sure that you
understand how we're bouncing back and
forth between a generator function and
the code that calls the generator
function so it may be super simple
you may already know how to do this but
just bear with me speaking of quick show
of hands any of you used fibers in node
land yeah all right okay so you already
know everything I'm about to talk about
you can leave just kidding okay so a
couple new things that we're seeing here
in this generator function on the left
hand side of the screen there's a little
asterisk next to the word function which
denotes a generator function which is
different type of function than you're
used to
you're also going to notice a yield
keyword exactly what those things do
will become self-evident in a moment
here but the asterisk things remember
asterisk means generator function yield
keyword is the point in which a
generator function is going to be able
to suspend and be resumed if a yield
keyword exists in the body of a function
body that is not a generator function
you're gonna get an error from your
browser so at least they help you out
there you can't accidentally shoot
yourself in the foot as bad as you might
think with for instance with like node
fibers okay so generator function
definition on the left hand side and the
code that's going to interact with a
generator function on the right hand
side you can imagine these two things
are like on top of each other but you
know that's not how they orient
projector screens so bear with me okay
first thing we're gonna do we're gonna
call our generator function so what
that's gonna do is it's going to give me
back an object that is a generator
object we haven't actually started
evaluating the code in the generator
function yet that generator object I'm
gonna store it in this seq variable the
generator function as I mentioned we
haven't started going into that code yet
until I call the next method on that
generator object that's gonna start
executing the code from top to bottom so
I'm gonna do my variable declaration a B
and C I'm gonna do some assignment zero
one zero I'm gonna hit this while I'm
gonna enter into this wild block until I
find the yield keyword what's hit a
yield keyword in a generator what the
computer is going to do is it's going to
evaluate down the expression as far as
it can on the right-hand side in this
case it's just a and then it's going to
suspend the generator function
the point right after like the yield and
its expression and it's gonna freeze
it's just gonna stop what its gonna do
is it's going to make available as the
value property of the thing that is
returned from calling next the value
that was yielded from the generator
function so sort of doing the mental
substitution and you can tell cuz it
drew a little line through it so you do
some substitution here the first thing
that we yield is the value 0 we go down
to the next line and when we call next
we resume the generator function
immediately after that yield keyword and
it's expression so then we go down we do
some more assignment we hit our while
loop again we hit our yield again and
then now we yield the new value of the
expression on the right-hand side of
yield which is going to be one generator
function is suspended again waiting for
somebody to call next on it so you can
sort of do like the mental exercise of
figuring out where we're gonna go here
we're generating an infinite sequence of
numbers lazily which is the sequence of
Fibonacci numbers okay so I was talking
about multiple entry points we saw in
the prior example how the caller of the
generator the generator function is
receiving values yielded to it you can
also go the other direction so before I
go any farther
pop quiz let's assume that log is an
alias to consult log what do you think
we're gonna see in the console if we run
that code you can just shout it out if
you feel empowered and I'm not going any
further until somebody guesses a mmhmm
you're close yes all right well you were
you were partially correct 42 you are
not correct it's okay though we'll learn
we'll learn the answer together okay so
first thing we're gonna do we're gonna
call our generator function which is
gonna give us back a generator object we
haven't started evaluating any of the
code here we've got in G we've got a
reference to this generator object we
call next on it which as you all know
causes the
code inside the function body to start
being evaluated from wherever we left
off in this case we never entered it so
it's gonna be the top we're gonna do our
variable declaration so we've declared
result and then we're just gonna follow
the order of operations in the language
we're gonna hit this math dot pal and
the way the JavaScript is going to work
is it's going to reduce down nested
expressions as far as they can first
thing that's going to happen is we're
going to hit our yield keyword and we're
gonna yield the string a back to our
caller which is going to again be made
available by D referencing the value
property of the this return thing that
we get back from our generator yielding
and then the pound generator suspends so
the first thing we're gonna log out to
the console is a so that was good good
now we're gonna resume the generator
function but in this time instead of
calling the next method and passing
nothing we're gonna pass 10 when this is
key if you want to build something that
allows you to really communicate back
and forth between generator functions
and their callers so 10 here is going to
be substituted in immediately where I
resumed the generator function so 10 you
can imagine is insert here after where
we used to have this yield a then we
evaluate the rest of this expression
we're gonna hit a yield keyword we're
gonna evaluate the expression on the
right hand side all the way down as far
as we can and then we're gonna suspend
the generator function again so the next
thing we've got logged out to the
console is B when you can corn you can
kind of see where we're going here
the last time we iterate with the
generator function we're gonna call the
next method we're gonna pass to which
you can see substitutes in to for where
yield B was and then we're gonna
evaluate math pal we're gonna store the
result in the result variable and then
we're gonna return it so finally you get
100 so you can sort of see how you're
bouncing back and forth between the code
that's calling the generator and the
generator function body both sending
values and receiving them from the
generator function what's up
if you call G dot next again you're
gonna get an error the generator object
has some properties that you can
interrogate to figure out like if it is
in a state that you can resume or like
start it up again
I believe the property is finished but
the fact that I said believe means I'm
probably full of but the
specification actually does talk about
that okay so Fibonacci sequences are all
great and yielding you know math and all
that stuff it's cool but like we want to
actually build some real stuff for this
I promised that we would alleviate the
pain of programming around asynchronous
callbacks and so we're gonna we're gonna
do that okay
so I was whining about the path of
execution through a program that is
constructed around asynchronous
callbacks this is what we can do if we
use generators there's some differences
here the implementation of our get
function has not changed it's still
issuing an HTTP request it will still
cause the browser to issue an xhr to
this slash profile and it still expects
you to pass a callback what we're doing
is we're gonna build together stepping
through these slides a little baby
framework that manages this whole
bouncing back and forth between our
generator function which we want to sort
of look and feel like like look and feel
like it were to be using some direct
style programming with the library that
manages it all so you're seeing the sync
function here this is something that we
actually implement the sync function
takes a generator function as its only
argument so in this case it's going to
be an anonymous function expression
which is just your function with a
little star there it's going to
immediately call the generator function
which is going to initialize it and
start it running
excuse me it's going to initialize it
and it's going to pass it a reference to
our resume function this is all a little
weird but this resume function via a
closure has a reference to the generator
object itself and what this allows us to
do is pass this resume function to all
of our asynchronous operations as the
callback to execute and what
means is when the asynchronous operation
completes our generator function will
resume with the value that we are past
if that makes any sense
well we'll step through it a little bit
but it's this is bouncing back and forth
thing that we're talking about
once again I mentioned this iterable
next this is how you send a value back
to the generator that is suspended so
you can imagine if this resume function
this past is the callback to execute to
my asynchronous operation that does like
an HTTP request to foo when the foo
callback gets executed which is going to
be this resume if I get a value back
like whatever the HP response was I'm
going to resume my generator function
body passing in foo okay so the other
thing that you can do is manage event
handling skews me manage error handling
across different event loop ticks so in
spite of the fact that like some of the
errors may be made available as the the
error argument to your synchronous
callbacks you can consolidate all that
stuff and handle it the same place as
your as your synchronous error handling
code which would be in a cache block so
this is what this is like the State of
the Union today your catch block
references this on error function and
your asynchronous callbacks reference
this on error function it's kind of lame
you can shrink it all down into
something that looks like this so once
again if some lib get data synchronous
operation causes something to blow up we
can catch it in that block now if the
asynchronous callback gets passed an
error as a result of our HP post to foo
or our post to bar we're going to be
able to trap that in our catch block
just as if it were a synchronous
operation and we can do that with a
slight modification to our framework
code which is this sync function that
we're building okay so this resume
function I was mentioning this is a
thing that we passed our asynchronous
operation to use as its callback what
we're gonna do is assuming that our
asynchronous operations callback is
using this node style error first and
then return value thing which not all of
your asynchronous callbacks are going to
be in this form but for the sake of this
demo just suspend judgment of my my code
samples
if we have an error we're gonna be able
to resume the generator function not
with next but with Ray's and what that's
going to do is it's going to resume
execution of the code in the generator
function body immediately raising
whatever we pass to this raise method
which is going to allow us to use the
catch block that we were using just for
the synchronous operations so we don't
have to do anything clever with error
checking and plumbing via this closure a
reference to our centralized error
handler thing we rely on the framework
to Reath row that thing for us
essentially and the last thing is flow
control so mixing the doing two things
at one time with doing one thing and
then one thing that one thing is kind of
pain-in-the-butt the vanilla JavaScript
example shows my super strawman version
of this promises and so on and so forth
clean it up a little bit but it's still
not as good as it can be with generators
there's a slight modification to this
code that is worth mentioning once upon
a time and all the other examples our
asynchronous operations were being
passed a reference to this resume
function right now what's happening is
the resume function in order to achieve
this this ability to do two things at
one time is actually a reference to a
function that the generator function
body needs to call which is going to
return a function that your asynchronous
operation is going to use as its
callback the details of which I'll
explain in a second but just do that do
that make a note of that because now
when we get into the modification we
need to make to this resume function
it'll make a little bit of sense so
before that resume function immediately
when your asynchronous callback was done
and the callback that it was past fired
would resume your generator function
with the value that it was passed but
what if we want to do like five things
at a time we don't want to resume our
generator function until all five of
those things have completed if we want
to get something that looks like what
we're seeing here where we do a HP
requested token and opposed to ki the
way that this works is every time you
call resume we increment a counter and
the framework keeps track
how many counters there are outstanding
when you decrement the counter by virtue
of your asynchronous operation
completing will check to see if no
counters are left outstanding when we've
got everything back then we resume your
generator function which allows you to
do things like resume the generator
function faulting in an array which will
contain both of these two values so I'll
walk you through exactly how that works
first thing we're gonna do our sinc
function is going to initialize our
generator function that's going to call
next on it which is going to start the
evaluation from top to bottom we're
gonna hit our yield keyword and we're
gonna start reducing down the expression
on the right hand side so this array
that I'm using here is a trick to force
the stuff inside of it to evaluate
before before we actually suspend the
generator function there are a ton of
libraries that do this stuff for you
this is just these demos for you to
understand like how they sort of work in
a superficial level so so bear with me
in reducing this expression down we're
gonna hit this array and we're gonna
evaluate the left thing first the left
thing is also an expression that needs
to be reduced so this is going to be our
call to our get function get is actually
being passed a reference to this resume
for the execution of this resume
function so we're gonna call resume
which is going to give us back a
function which we then pass to get get
like many other asynchronous operations
like J queries get or whatever return
undefined they don't have a return value
because they expect you to pass them a
callback we haven't we haven't suspended
the generator function yet because we
need to evaluate the expression in the
second item of the array so we do the
same thing res we call it which is going
to increment a counter in our framework
and return us a function that we're
gonna pass as our callback and then
we're going to do our post so the
generator function has still not
suspended but now we've got to a
synchronous operations that are like out
there waiting for their data to come
back then we suspend the generator
function and we only resume what both of
those two operations have completed and
what the framework is going to do is
it's going to substitute back into our
generator function an array that
contains both Ida
that aargh there are the results of our
two asynchronous operations so you can
get this sort of feel of doing two
things at one time or doing five things
at one time and then moving down to do
the next thing you could be super
expressive with very few lines of code
you leave all that stuff up to the
framework to do for you and keep that
out of your user land code we're doing
the same thing here we've already
completed these 2-way synchronous
operations up above now we're going to
do the same thing where we reduce our
resume call to a function that we pass
our posts we suspend the generator
function when we get some data back we
can substitute that in here it gets
assigned to off and then we redirect to
a different location so anyway so the
whole point of this was to demonstrate
the generators allow you to do some
direct style programming in a world in
which like we've gotten pretty
accustomed to programming and
continuation passing style which is like
asking the computer do something and
then giving it a continuation or a call
back to to execute when the asynchronous
operation completes you can already use
this stuff in Chrome Canary node 0 1 1
and Firefox and also es5 compliant
browsers as long as you're willing to do
the translation step it is my position
that their adoption the adoption of this
stuff is going to change the shape of
the code that we're writing it is my
hope that the complex the additional
complexity and including this framework
to do this stuff or including a
framework to do this stuff is going to
be worth the the excuse me the the
learning curve benefit that you're going
to get when you try to teach people how
to program in this environment
hopefully it'll it'll flatten that out a
little bit so I encourage you to go
experiment there are tons of blog posts
online about this
Toby Howe is a guy has been writing
about generators and co-routines and
javascript since 2009 or 2010 since way
back when Tim Caswell and Annie Wingo on
the VA team all have really interesting
things to say about this stuff
especially Andy Wingo talks about the
implementation so I encourage you to go
check it out follow me on Twitter I'm
laze Erica scuzz laser was taken kind of
bummer and go check out the code
examples and play around with stuff
check it out that's it
all right what do you got the question
was like when are we gonna be able to
use this stuff in the browser I mean
like I was saying before if you're fine
with the translation step then you can
start using it now if you are asking
like when will the es6 specification be
finalized I'm not not totally sure I
know that like it's not going to be too
much longer the real question is like
when are all browsers that people use
going to support this stuff that could
be awhile from now so I think the more
common use case will probably be on the
server side where the runtime is like
you know controlled but I think it's
gonna happen pretty soon I know that the
Express guy TJ is already working with
generators right now so there are some
people thinking about this stuff and the
combination of generators and promises
is like a new sort of thing that I think
Bluebird is taken on and the co library
and stuff like that so people are
already starting to work with it
especially on the node side yeah the
question was are there any performance
implications it will depend on the
runtime exactly like what the
performance implications are Andy
Wingo talks about that a little bit in a
blog post that he wrote within the last
like couple years and he said the same
thing that like I hear all the time
which is little hand wavy which is like
if you're using this stuff too if you
were writing an i/o intensive
application then you know it's not gonna
be the bottleneck but there was a
comparison that he made and the results
were like almost negligible
once you're like from the perspective
the CPU time was it was negligible but I
like again he's speaking specifically
about v8 and I don't know what it's
gonna look like for you know Mozilla's
stuff or we're Safari or whatever but I
think it'll be negligible I think the
real cost will be involving a framework
that does the stuff that we just sort of
like did with our sync function relying
on something like that and just hoping
that like they don't screw it up for you
it's gonna be the bigger hit I think yes
sorry I I usually am pretty good about
mentioning that there are a variety of
frameworks that do the sorts of things
that I was demonstrating with that sing
function only like in a you know 400
line version of it that's robust and not
my 10 line version of it that sucks
Co Co is one of them Gen run Jenny I
believe Bluebird now has a version of
this that works with asynchronous
functions that return promises which is
a really interesting thing one thing
that I glazed over in these slides was
that the signature for the asynchronous
callback that all of these things are
using adheres to error first and then
return value well that that isn't always
the case and there's no specification
that says that you have to do it that
way right
promises are interesting because they
provide a unified interface for dealing
with a synchronicity so you can write a
framework that can rely on that
consistency as long as these
asynchronous operations that returning
promises then you can build a framework
that knows exactly how to interact with
you know that kind of code so yeah
Bluebird is one that does that and also
tasks jeaious which is an older Mozilla
project I'll put some links in the
presentation in case you want to like
poke through some of the frameworks it's
pretty interesting to learn how the
stuff works by like trying to
reverse-engineer the framework code also
in my opinion yeah totally cool thank
