your lunch coma a ice cream come a
session I'm excited to be here thanks
for everyone joining us hope you're
having a great forward this is a super
big honor I've been part of the previous
two forwards and I feel like I'm a total
forward junkie at this point so I'm
excited my name is Kyle Simpson get if I
on twitter and github and all those
other places that matter I want to talk
before I really get into much about this
talk need to understand a little
something about my perspective on our
industry and where we're at and i'm
adding this at the beginning of each of
my talks because i think we have a
responsibility as members of this
community to be more aware of the things
that are holding some people in our
community back so i do not have
solutions to the bigger problems that
our community faces the discrimination
that occurs the unfairness that is
inherent to the way we do things I don't
have solutions to that but I can at
least start talking about it so I'm just
simply going to declare some things that
for me personally I consider them to be
items of privilege that I had these are
not to project on anyone else but I hope
that it is encouraging and challenging
you to you to take stock in your own
life of the things that got you to where
you're at I have a daughter and I don't
want her to grow up in a community that
she has to work an awful lot harder to
get to the same point that my son will
have to work to get to that point so
these are the sorts of things I think we
need to address so just very quickly
i'll point out that i'm a male and that
is definitely an advantage in a lot of
areas of our industry and that's not
fair I'm white I'm educated I went to
college and a lot of people didn't have
the privilege of going to college I have
I'm heterosexual and thankfully this is
becoming less and less of a privilege
but certainly getting to the point that
i'm at i didn't have to have people
second guessing a lot of the things that
i did I am American I consider that to
be a privilege especially since I speak
in a lot of places in the world and I
grow up in a country that values freedom
and not a lot of places are the same way
and also being employed I have been
self-employed for the last several years
so I've had
some freedom that others might not have
had I haven't had to always necessarily
be chasing after things that someone
else said was important although that
self-employed thing has just recently
changed which I'll mention a moment I
have written a series of books on
JavaScript called you don't know Jas and
if you're interested in learning more
about JavaScript I would encourage you
to check them out the entire six book
1100 page series is available to read
for free on github at you don't know Jas
com they're also available from purchase
from book sellers they've been published
through Riley so check those out if
you're interested and I mentioned just a
moment ago that some employment has
changed so as of about three weeks ago I
took a position as head of curriculum at
maker square which is a developer
engineering school it's part of the hack
reactor network of schools if you're
more familiar with hack reactor so I'm
head of curriculum I'll be managing the
curriculum and the education at our
three campuses Austin San Francisco and
Los Angeles as well as we're probably
going to expand to other places so if
you or someone you know is interested in
getting in and really digging in and
learning thoroughly and deeply the
entirety of JavaScript and applying that
to full stack development we'd love to
have you so please come up and and ask
me if you have any questions about maker
square so let's jump into our talk today
today's talk is essentially a tale of
two origami cranes the blue and the
orange one as you see here I'm going to
take two different perspectives on
brokenness and I'm going to represent
them with these two cranes so two
different ways that I consider the web
to currently be broken and my goal is
not just to complain but hopefully to
cast some sort of vision for ways that
we might be able to fix it and this is
not a tech talk this is hopefully a talk
that challenges and perhaps inspires
some of you in the audience to go out
and make the web better so we'll start
first I have my vision of how i am at
origami i don't know if any of you have
ever tried origami before but when i was
a kid when I was a teenager I used to
try my hand at that from time to time
and i have my vision in my head that
that the origami is this perfect
idealized every straight edge exactly
perfect that is my idealized vision of
my ability to
do origami but in reality my origami is
a lot more like this in fact I think
that actually relates to the web we have
these idealized visions of the sorts of
things that we create but in practice
yeah we really nail it don't we in
practice I can make about the same
origami as maybe my four-year-old could
make maybe he's a little better than
this but but I would make an
observationally there is definitely a
skill set that I have not taken the time
to master the skill of origami there's
definitely that part of it to be
considered I don't know why this is
showing so one moment
you
there's definitely something to be said
for lacking and skill set but I think
there's also something to be said for
lacking in proper materials and if you
start out with bad materials the end
result is often not as ideal as we would
hope that it may be hard to see but i
love the my favorite part of this image
is that old like 1980s school watch
because nowadays you would you would be
so uncool if you are caught wearing a
watch like that but if you start out
with bad materials this paper is already
wrinkled and folded and it's got a dog
here on the corner if you start out with
bad materials the end result is going to
be bad so I will make some observations
about the materials that we are working
with the web as it as it currently
stands today I like to call this the
selfie unicorn and what I love about
this picture there are so many things
there are so many bad decisions that
went into this woman's life to get her
to the moment where this picture was
taken there are so many bad decisions I
can't even go over all of them but I
would suggest that the web that we
currently work with the thing that we
play with on a daily basis as makers of
the web is broken by decision broken by
bad decisions for example we have this
notion of backwards compatibility with
this idea that we cannot ever add
something to the web and then remove it
from the web because once it's been
added once somebody will begin to rely
upon it and once they're relying upon it
we can no longer break the web this is a
romantic but entirely impractical notion
in my opinion this idea that the web is
evergreen and constantly changing and
yet we never remove any of the bad stuff
from the web means that the web will
fall over on itself at some point and in
many cases I think the web is already
starting to do that we're starting to
see people shouting about the problems
of the web and people writing blog posts
like hey can we just slow down a bit
because maybe the web is changing and
progressing and getting a little too
complex a little too quickly so I
understand why we want to keep as much
of the web around as possible but we
have to balance that I think against
this notion of technical debt and I know
that
term that not everybody agrees on
exactly the definition but this this
notion of technical debt that we have
accrued over a period of time through a
series of both good and bad decisions
decisions that were forced our hand
because of vendors making certain
choices and market pressures and things
like that entire parts of our industry
stopped for years at a time and that
forced sets of decisions that even today
in 2015 we're still dealing with so
while I get the idea behind backwards
compatibility I am not convinced that
that is actually healthy for the future
of the web there are lots and lots of
these technical hacks that we are still
dealing with for example some of you may
recognize hacks like this I actually
took this code directly from one of my
own code bases so I'm making fun of my
own code at this point but using these
sorts of crazy weird hacks in JavaScript
to figure out what browser we might be
in so that we could work around some
craziness that was presented to us and
this was actually at a time I remember a
time in this industry where it was
considered state-of-the-art to be able
to come up with these ideas like
somebody writes a new blog post and all
this amazing new hack that I just came
up with it can now target IE 7.3 but not
7.2 or whatever craziness these things
are not healthy for the future of the
web but they're still hanging around
because we have this notion that once
something has been built it can never be
touched again it can never be fixed
again there's no responsibility taken to
go back and fix the web that we built
and by the way it's not unique to the
JavaScript realm there are certainly
other examples for example there is
examples in CSS of the same sorts of
things we have these all across the
entire web platform trying to target
different parts and work around these
crazy browser quirks and I will suggest
that no matter even though today in 2015
we are totally centered on this the
standards compliance idea an all
browsers are on board and that includes
by the way Microsoft who's leading the
way in standards compliance with these
es6 now with Microsoft edge but even
though that is true we're not going to
be free of the continuing future that
there will be things that people want to
hack around there will be things where a
feature is implemented but there's a
quirk or there's just
short coming in the specification and
one browsers interpretation is different
from another so these things are not
purely in our past they are current for
us and they will be part of our future
unless we stop laying down bricks that
we refuse to pull back up and we thought
maybe we fix things with conditional
style sheets and really that just
created a whole nother set of technical
debt this is actually one of my favorite
examples because this was around in
libraries so common this idea of trying
to trying to emulate the onload event or
the document ready event in browsers and
in an IE that was particularly difficult
so we did this crazy workaround hack
where we were checking for the scroll
event on a lot on a regular 10
millisecond pole or some ridiculous
thing like that and this code still
exists in libraries that are still
deployed on millions and millions of
browsers today it's ridiculous we also
as christian Heilmann mentioned we also
decided that instead of blaming the
technology we'd start blaming the users
so we started blaming users for using
old sites and I think this is one of the
worst offenders of that turning the
attention towards our users and saying
we'll just and now this was a joke but
they said we'll just charge in you an
extra tax if you decide to bias product
from our site using an old internet
explorer 7 browser so we we took all the
problems that we knew we were having and
put all that pain back on the user and
said you must be a bad person because
for some reason you've been living in a
coma and haven't upgraded your browser
these are all very unhealthy ways of
looking at the web and they're part of
our past but I don't want them to
continue to be part of our future again
as has already been pointed out and more
than one talk today the old days of best
viewed and Internet Explorer are not
gone from us they just have a different
browser name now best viewed in chrome
is the way that we experiment with all
this new stuff and you think well that's
great because it's just an experiment
except people start using the
experimental stuff and then they force
it's a tail wagging the dog situation
they force other browsers to do that and
there's many stories of that this is
old-school Netscape and I just bring
this up to to point out I'll give you a
quick anecdote I worked at a company
many many years ago probably a decade
ago working on a major
website a website for a major airline in
a region a region of the country that I
lived and we were building the home page
and we were given three weeks to build
out this amazing home page that the
designers had come up with and it was
the three weeks immediately before
Christmas and the second the end of the
second week so two-thirds of the way
through the project they came to us and
said oh by the way we have to support
Netscape 4.7 and we about like fell out
of our chairs like what are you talking
about support there's no possible way
this Yui calendar widget that's brand
new thing there's no possible way that's
going to work in some old browser like
netscape 47 but they came back to us and
said well we have statistics that say
over 200,000 visits a month come from
netscape 4.7 so that represents a lot of
revenue to us and we've got to do it now
they had no other proof of those
statistics other than the fact that
maybe something like Google Analytics
set it and I've always wondered and
always thought Eve ever even ever since
then actually probably most of those
user agents were from BOTS I don't
actually think there were 200,000 people
a month purchasing tickets from Netscape
47 but we we let statistics lie to us
and tell us that we should be doing
things that actually are entirely
unhealthy for the future of the web so
don't necessarily believe those
statistics when you're marketing or your
sales department says we have to do XYZ
because the statistics say so you might
want to dig deeper into that and you
might want to push back and say that
might not be healthy for our future all
of this is to say the web that we
currently work with is broken it is
broken by one decision and after another
decision after another decision by a
thousand million tiny decisions that
were all probably in good faith most of
them were in good faith but taken
together they have left our web in a
very broken situation and unfortunately
it seems like we're determined to keep
it that way so this tweet literally just
today and I love what how he says it it
backwards compatibility is like
compulsive hoarding you just can't throw
away the old things and that's true we
have this attachment to the old ways of
doing things in this resistance this
inertia to giving up the old ways of
doing things and we blame them on our
bosses and on our clients and on client
budgets and we say there's
no possible way that my client would
ever let me do that but you've never
even tried you just assume that that is
true we don't fight those hard battles
because sometimes we're kind of attached
to the old way of doing things and I
would just ask you the question do we
have to do we have to continue to
maintain that romantic but impractical
notion of backwards compatibility I
wrote this tweet a while back and I said
you know we've got this bug in in
JavaScript it's been there since the
very beginning and people say if we've
fixed that then it would break lots and
lots of sites in the web and that's
probably scientifically true but my
perspective is let's break it for sites
to break and then fix those things to
bring them forward now of course I got
an awful lot of hate on Twitter after
posting this because everyone jumped out
of the woodwork and told me why this is
completely impractical and against the
DNA of the web and how dare I it's it's
almost heresy to suggest that we might
want to break something so that we could
move it forward and one of the big
arguments that's made against this is
browser game theory so let me indulge a
slight definition of browser game theory
if you're not aware of this all of the
browsers that you work with every single
day that you use regardless of what
whether they're attached to an open
source project or to a proprietary
vendor or company regardless of what you
may think their business models are
every single one of them is driven by
this same notion that they need as many
eyeballs as possible on their browser so
that they can continue to affect their
vision for where browsers and the web
should go and they are extremely averse
to making any changes that may lose
users they do not want to lose those
eyeballs losing that that market share
loses their ability and so it's summed
up in this tweet from Brian torrelson
where he says what implementation would
volunteer to break web compatibility and
therefore lose lots of users now this is
a great question it's a great deep
question and it is one of the questions
that paralyzes us from moving forward
because we assume that browsers would
have to move individually and one
browser would have to agree to lose a
bunch of the browser game just to move
things forward but you notice there's an
asst
sumption there that browsers have to
operate independently in fact that's not
necessarily true browsers don't have to
operate independently and I pushed back
and said well in this further in this
conversation I said well what if all
browsers were to fix something at the
same time what would that do and of
course a lot of people again continue to
hate on this but I suggested this idea
of breaking the web forward in a
coordinated effort i called it to break
the web forward day and in fact i
launched break the web forward com is
this notion of creating an international
day much like y2k was some point in the
future where browsers agreed to fix all
or most of the problems of the web and
flip those fixes all on on one day now
that would break virtually all of the
web if that's all we did because the
reason we pick a day in the future is so
that we have time as a community to
rally behind and fix it just like we did
with y2k people can volunteer to go and
fix old sites and there are there are
ways for us to put in stopgaps and have
older browser engines hang around for
the old sites that that literally nobody
has access to source co2 but I think we
could continue to move the web forward
if we gave up on this idea that web the
web browsers have to act independently
if they coordinate it together now I
know this idea sounds crazy and
completely improbable but maybe it's not
so crazy because actually one example of
this already happening later this fall
the browsers are going to flip on a fix
on an arbitrary day I think some day in
October and it's a relatively minor fix
they're fixing something to do with
control characters but they are going to
all flip on this fix at the same time on
that one special day in October and any
browser I mean any sites that this
affects are all going to be broken
equally across all the browsers which
means that we have mooted or mitigated
that browser game theory argument
against moving the web forward they made
one tiny breakage they did it
intentionally and they coordinated
together I think this is a beautiful
picture for maybe not just one break the
web for a day but many break the web
forward days and I've suggested to some
folks at Microsoft and other browser
vendors that we could use this site to
coordinate the messaging
about moving the web forward in little
bits and pieces fixing stuff and then
telling people well in advance we're
going to fix it so you have an
opportunity to break the web forward as
well so if the web has been broken by
decision the web has also been broken in
another way and I use a slightly
different picture here of the crane on
purpose this is a line drawing of an
origami piece it is simpler and yet it
still gets the job done it still
communicates the same thing which is
that I'm talking about the blue origami
crane so if the web has been broken by
decision the web is also been broken by
design and this fits even more squarely
on our shoulders than broken by decision
I want to tell you a little story about
five years ago one of the first
conference as I talked that was over in
Warsaw Poland and I did not at the time
have any kind of international phone
plan where I could just use data
anywhere in the world in fact I still
don't have that why don't we have that
in 2015 but anyway I didn't have that
back then and so I thought I was on the
conference Wi-Fi and I loaded up the CNN
com home page one time thought I was on
the conference Wi-Fi I later found out
that that page wait a little bit over 1
megabyte and that cost me twenty three
US dollars for that one page load
because I was actually on the worst data
roaming with no setup that was a painful
lesson and I tell you that has been
burned into me that lesson has been
burned into me and I've looked at the
web differently ever since I've been
questioning ever since is that really
the web we should be building that are
is essentially taking an entire huge
chunk of the population I don't mean
just like ten percent but more like
eighty to ninety percent of the world
and telling them sorry you just can't
afford to be on the web that we've built
and you might not believe me but there's
a site that was launched recently by Tim
Catholic a fantastic site it's called
what is my site costs it loads your site
and then it makes some estimates based
upon current knowledge of data usage
plan costs in different parts of the
world to figure out how much does it
cost a low that single page of your site
and if you haven't checked your your
site out in that I would encourage you
to do so now I loaded up the CNN
homepage and it said something like
sixty two cents or something like that
to load it in the worst case of course
these are best case scenarios that it's
making estimates on and many people are
in much worse cases and that's the cost
of course there's time because often
times when we're out in if you're if you
do any sort of traveling I travel all
the time and I see this pain point first
hand all the time it's not just about
the cost we are pushing more than two
megabytes on average to every single
website and even if we didn't care about
how much that cost it's still taking
phenomenal amounts of time to load which
is crazy we are actually taking entire
parts of the population of this world
and saying you can't use our website
because you don't have three hours to
wait for the home page to download which
is ludicrous this is my thought process
on how we're actually building the web
these are giant huge barges but there
they actually needed an even bigger boat
to bring the giant huge boats around and
I'm sure somebody's going to make an
even bigger boat for those big boats
this is what I think we're doing with
the web we just continue to throw
everything that we can imagine every
kind of custom font and every web WebGL
and all these things we want to create
this amazing web which i think is
awesome but we're completely ignoring
what that's doing to most of the world
Eric mayor he had this tweet a while
back and I thought this was great he
said how to reclaim the web force
everyone to develop on hotel Wi-Fi and
if you've ever been on crappy hotel
Wi-Fi you know how painful that would be
seems totally impractical obviously we
can't send everybody to a hotel it turns
out you can actually do this right
inside of your browser and the developer
tools I bet most of you have never tried
this before but you absolutely should
develop with throttling turned on in
your browser and then question whether
or not you really should push that font
out to the website I saw this firsthand
just a few weeks ago I was in the rural
UK teaching a javascript workshop and I
was on the train back to London
somewhere in the middle of nowhere rule
in the UK
and I went on to the website where i
bought my train ticket from i am on
their train on their Wi-Fi and trying to
load up their train site so that i could
look at the schedule and i just want to
zoom in here it took three point six
minutes for that site to download on
their Wi-Fi and look Dom content loaded
was almost an entire minute and the
onload event was two point two minutes
that's absolute insanity but that is the
web that we are building for the
majority of the world that is their
experience with the web and by the way
it's not just cost it's not just time
it's also power let me tell you another
story about a decade or so maybe less
little less than a decade ago I had an
opportunity to spend about three weeks
in rural Africa traveling around in two
different villages in Botswana and I saw
this problem firsthand i saw i went to a
village where about 5,000 people lived
and there was one telephone pole in the
center of the village and you can't see
because this isn't the actual image of
it but there were hundreds of cell phone
chargers hanging off of this telephone
pole with cell phones dangling because
that is the only electricity in the
entire village and they don't just leave
them there for an hour or two they leave
them there for days on end because the
power that's coming to this village is
at such a low frequency or whatever it's
called that it takes several days to
charge up their phone we are making the
assumptions that people have unlimited
bandwidth and unlimited money and
unlimited power to experience the web
but that is in fact not at all the case
not even remotely close to reality so I
would say the web that we've built is
totally sucked it's completely broken
now there's lots of notions that we've
come up with to try to address different
parts of these problems and I don't I'm
not hating on these things progressive
enhancement is fantastic responsive
design is a newer way of thinking about
things but I would suggest that these
ideas stopped well short of where we
should have gone because responsive
design for example is primarily about
responding to a screen size
and it completely ignores all of those
other factors like network speed and the
cost of your data plan and how much
battery power you have in your device
imagine this scenario you are standing
at a bus stop in a foreign country you
have a full data charge you have a
really nice cheap international data
plan and you want to pull up the bus
schedule you pull up your favorite site
or app and you're totally okay that it
shows you a nice 3g webgl animation of
the bus coming up to your stop and you
just feel great about the web but
imagine that exact same scenario where
you do not have an international data
plan whatsoever and it costs ridiculous
amounts of money and you your battery
power is down at three percent and it's
really slow even where you're at and you
still need the bus schedule that is much
more reality than a hypothetical
scenario we didn't go far enough with
these solutions I think we need to
actually provide an awful lot more
choice to users into devices this is the
Gmail interface it's loading up Gmail
but I want to zoom in here how many of
you have ever seen the load basic HTML
link I don't know if anybody's ever
tried it before but this is what it
looks like if you've never seen it it's
a basic version of the Gmail application
I don't know because I don't know
anybody on the Gmail team I don't know
how much time they spend implementing
this or maintaining it but it must
actually mean something useful to google
to continue to provide this option it's
not like it was there for a few weeks
and then went away it's been there for
years and years and years and in fact
I've seen people that have told I've had
people tell me directly they use this
exclusively it loads much quicker
especially when they're on slow and
expensive bandwidth and I've heard
people say the same thing about facebook
facebook had a version of their
application their mobile web application
which was extremely stripped down and in
fact users have become so used to that
interface that when a change was made by
the mobile the mobile phone vendor made
a change to start showing them the more
high fidelity version of the site and
the users complain and said bring back
my simple fast facebook there are some
assumptions that we've been making that
users want everything that we can
possibly
screen to squeeze down the pipe and I
think that's entirely wrong this little
pop-up even it monitored my bandwidth
while I was on this slow connection it
monitored in and said hey it looks like
there's kind of a problem would you like
to switch to a better experience and
this delighted me as a user because the
application i was using simply gave a
damn about how i was experiencing things
they weren't as concerned about
impressing me with all their fancy
JavaScript and fancy CSS they were
concerned about me having a good
experience this is a quote that as close
to a life code as I have perfection is
achieved not when there's nothing left
to add but when there's nothing left to
take away it's not the first time this
has ever been quoted at a web conference
it's pretty common but I would suggest
you that perhaps instead of adding more
to the web we should be taking stuff
away from the web I know that might
sound a little challenging to you that
might sound a little offensive to those
of you that take your craft seriously
and trust me I do as well so I suggested
this site I launched another campaign
called unsuck the web the unsub web
manifesto to declare a set of principles
by which I think we can responsibly rain
back in this notion that we are just
going to push everything every new
fangled design that we can come up with
we're going to push it all to every
single user unconditionally the
condition is the important part I'm not
suggesting I'm going to take away all of
your fun toys I'm suggesting maybe not
all of those toys need to be served to
every single user on every single load
there needs to be more conditions to
this and you can follow along if you're
at all interested in the untucked web
manifesto I'm not going to read them to
you but if you go back to the slides
after the talk there's the text of this
it simply declares very level-headed
that there is a user involved in the
experience and that user just as
Christian Heilmann said earlier that
user is the most important constituent
your sensibilities as a developer and
your designer sensibilities are way down
the list of importance the users
experience their perception and their
choice are way more important
so actually ironically this is the
vision of the future web that I have
where a user gets to choose that this is
what they want to experience from
Wikipedia if that makes the most sense
to them why should they not have that
choice now some of you developers you
geeks are going to say oh well I know I
can go into my developer tools and
disable CSS and turn off JavaScript and
whatever which is complete and utter
nonsense to a normal user they would
have no idea what that means I'm not
interested in what you developers think
about the experience of the web nearly
as much as I'm interested in the common
user and not just the common user in San
Francisco which has just amazing amounts
of connectivity and access to the
highest powered devices that you can
even imagine I'm talking about the user
choice for someone in a much different
part of the world so let me be a little
bit more specific here's a mobile device
and I'm not only talking about mobile
but definitely about mobile here's a
idea this is the chrome web browser on
an Android device but here's my
suggestion if for those of you that
might say well it seems like it would be
impossible to give the users this kind
of choice especially in mobile there's
just not enough space here's my vision
for it there's a simple slider that
overlays on the address bar and on one
side they get to choose they want a
basic experience and on the other side
they want everything and maybe the user
gets to slide it and say I care more
about the content or I care less about
the experience and they get to choose on
a per site basis on a per page load
basis and it just remembers their
settings as they continue to serve this
is not that complicated and this is an
experience that would I think actually
start to delight users not necessarily
the privileged users in this room but
the users in the other parts of the
world so maybe there's three settings or
maybe just two but maybe there's three
settings like low medium and high or
fast please I'm patient or more features
maybe it's not an entire spectrum like
that maybe there's presets now our
responsibility I mean the browser's
responsibility excuse me the browser's
responsibility is if a website doesn't
spawn to that preference the browser has
to veto if a user says I want the basic
experience don't load any images over
50k don't load any custom fonts and the
server sends them anyway the browser has
to step in and say uh not doing it I'm
going to respect the user now you may
think that this is an even crazier idea
but this is also starting to happen and
I'm extremely encouraged by it there's a
thing called client hints which when
originally invented were all about
screen size things like it was a
symmetry for responsive design but
client hints are being extended to more
capabilities and more interesting pieces
of data about the user's device in their
experience not everything it's not like
we're going to send a header for every
single feature but there are definitely
important signals that could be sent to
the server the one in particular I'm
talking about that they are talking
about implementing or their prototyping
right now is called resource quality and
in particular resource quality low now
to my understanding they haven't defined
how a browser would decide to send that
header but they are deciding that they
should send this header in some
conditions and a server ought to see
that request header and respond
appropriately that's actually the
hardest part of this job is already
being done I don't have to convince them
to do a new header we just have to
convince the browser's to expose that in
a sensible way to users and we're going
to have to convince web developers that
is you in this room what's our part
we're going to have to convince you to
stop thinking that the user wants one
hundred percent of what's possible on
their device we assume if they have
WebGL capable devices they want WebGL
but in fact many times they don't want
that and we need to give them the choice
we need to give them the option of
vetoing and saying that's all well and
good but at this moment I only have
three percent battery life and I'd
really just like the bus schedule please
that should be their option to do this
we're going to have to build the web in
layers and we're going to have to
rebuild and this is a joke because I
don't actually mean the Netscape layer
thing but we're going to have to build
the web in more layers we're going to
have to decide when a user asks for low
fidelity that means
the chat widget that we normally send we
just don't even send that and a user
should be okay with that and they will
be okay with that they'll be much more
delighted that they got some sort of
sensible web experience then that they
got three minutes and a blank white page
and then they got a 23 dollar bill in
the mail so unsuck the web this is
radical but when you don't load it when
you send the resource quality low you
get just the text now I know you're
saying well my site could never do that
my site is this fancy image editor and
there's no possible way absolutely there
is you have an image editor is your
company's application you can load only
the basic brushes and only the basic
features and then ask the user would you
like the more advanced interface that is
possible to build you've just never
decided that that was important actually
your boss has never decided that that
was important because they don't think
that those people are your audience how
closed off can we be that we think our
audience is just people at tech
conferences with fast internets and
powerful devices now I know there are
many objections and I do not have time
to cover all of these but I'd be happy
to discuss them people always come up
and tell me all the reasons why I'm
entirely wrong and none of this could
ever happen I know there are many
objections like the client budget whoo
the client will never pay for this if
you spin it that when you build this
kind of web that I'm suggesting that the
clients customers will be much more
happy with that experience than any of
their other competitors then they'll
give you the budget to do this or at
least they'll think about it you lose a
hundred percent of the battles you never
fight and only ninety-nine percent of
the ones you do fight oh it's too much
work it's too hard actually it's not as
hard as you might think it does take
concerted effort it doesn't come for
free if it did we would have done it a
long time ago it's going to take some
concerted effort but you're gonna have
to push back and say okay designer I
know you've designed this amazing
interface but what is a stripped-down
equivalent what would that look like and
how can I build this in layer so that I
can give that option to my users
so what I'm suggesting is this to close
build the minimal web experience that a
user needs and build the best web
experience that your team can dream up
build both of them and figure out how to
weave the two together and most
importantly let the user decide because
we are going to have to break from the
web of the past and in fact break from
the web of the current since it's true
that the web of the better future is
waiting thanks very much for listening
appreciate it
