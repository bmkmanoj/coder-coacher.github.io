you an introduction on angularjs how
many people will use angularjs so this
is probably going to be boring because
it's a very intro to angular so
hopefully maybe you learn a little
tidbit something new or something like
that
my name is Joshua Woodward I'm a
engineer here at eBay I also organize
Google developer group does everybody
know what a GDG is okay so I organized
one in Fresno about four years ago I
started one and then I got the job here
at eBay and now I live up here and
organize on like a global level more
helping out with all the other
organizers and stuff like that
so angularjs is a JavaScript framework
created at Google on like an Adsense
team or double-click one of those two
teams internally it was created by misko
does everybody know who misko is so you
guys all pretty much know what angular
is then right so this is gonna probably
be a little bit boring for you then
maybe let's see here okay
this is the logo everybody knows what
the logo looks like okay so I think
their motto is like a super heroic
JavaScript framework and they probably
got the idea for the logo off of like
something like Superman or something
like a shield or something right I like
to think differently sometimes I'm not
that good at Photoshop but if I could
create the logo it would be like this
and I would come up with a totally new
slogan that it's like a badass mother
effing framework and that would be my
inspiration so if you've ever used
angular you know that it's like better
than anything else out there
okay so angularjs really doesn't do
anything new it just combines a bunch of
great ideas into like one framework
templating has been around for a long
time
angular makes the templates on the
client-side which is real nice so if
you're familiar with server-side
templating like Django or something like
that then you'll you'll you know what
I'm talking about let's see here it also
uses a model view control pattern so you
have models and you have views and you
have controllers so some people like to
argue that it's like a model view
viewmodel model view view whatever I say
that it's a model view controller
because there's the word controller
right there okay so another concept is
de teba
data binding again not a new concept but
they bring it into JavaScript pretty
nicely you can see here in this
controller I have a model called user
with a property called name that's blank
I also have a function tied to a
directive which I'll get I'll describe
better later that basically acts kind of
similar to the on click function in
JavaScript except that it's not in the
global scope right so that's why it's
okay to put on your directly on your
element and so all this does is call
this function which then does an alert
right so what's the cool part is the
data binding part so you have another
directive called ng model which then
binds this input box to your model does
that make sense where user dot name
comes from right
so if I type in this input box without
any other JavaScript this is actually
all the code that's running on this
slide without any extra JavaScript it
changed that variable which gets alerted
here so that's one concept of data
binding the other one is also updating
your view as you type so the two-way
data-binding instantly updating your
view it's the same concept except I
don't have a function this time I'm
actually binding to the view so here's
my model and same thing as I type the
you will get updated though so if you
ever tried to do something like that in
jQuery you'd have to do a lot of
watching and on event listening and
update this element and stuff and so
angular does that all for you in the in
the framework
went too far here okay so another
concept now is a three-way databinding I
don't have a slide for it but if is
anybody familiar with firebase firebase
okay so firebase is like a persistent
data store like a no sequel data store
and with like two or three lines of code
in your angular and including their
library you can have now three-way data
binding which basically you update your
model which updates your view which also
updates your database like all instantly
right let me see I actually have let's
see okay so using firebase and some
canvas and stuff like that let me also
pull up a different browser so that you
can see that they're in two different
windows here
okay so basically all this is an html5
canvas I cut up an image and move the
pieces around and I have and it's
already in angular and basically all I
have is like X Y coordinates of every
little puzzle piece so when you move
them if we move them just as one view my
angular model is getting updated with X
Y XY XY z-- right but you throw in
firebase on top of that and update your
database which then turns around and
automatically sends a signal to all the
other subscribers and they get the new
XY coordinate too so it's pretty cool
except there we go
so if anybody else went to this URL you
can move these puzzle pieces around and
they'd be in real time and basically all
it's doing is sending XY coordinates
back and forth messaging yep laughs see
that wasn't me
no ants there is a bug that if two
people try to move at the same time I
got to fix that but yeah so that's a
concept of three-way data binding
another concept that they bring is
dependency injection so to help out with
scopes and stuff like that you can you
can create your own services they have a
lot of built in services scope is one of
them HTTP is another one and you just
inject those into your function your
controller function and you have
complete access to all these pre-built
services and you can build your own
services as well okay so a little bit
more about directives one of the
built-in directives is ng-repeat
basically all it does is take your HTML
element
duplicate it so in this instance
ng-repeat
is taking this list item and repeating
it for every item it creates a new local
scope variable called item for every
element in that array so item at this
point is 0 at this point is 1 at this
point is 2 so it makes it real easy to
iterate over lists and copy Dom elements
over and over you have to watch out so
we use or I use angular here at eBay and
I work on a tools team where we monitor
the systems and stuff so sometimes we'll
have like 200 thousand records and
you'll bog down your your browser if you
if you're trying to repeat over two
hundred thousand records so you gotta
learn some techniques so that's the
quick introduction this is a an older
slide but use the the CD in for the
library if you're if you're including
angular in your project and it's not
like a like a major thing that you have
to have the library locally so like ebay
comm would host their own version
obviously but if you're if you're doing
this it's hosted on Google so I'm pretty
sure it's gonna be there available I
don't know they don't go down too often
you win free cash because the browser
caches caches it so it'll pull it from
cash pretty insta instantly if somebody
goes to abc.com and they have angular
library and you and now your site is XYZ
comm they don't really have to download
the library anymore it's in their cache
so that's a benefit of using a CDN ok so
when you first build an angular app you
tell angular where your app is going to
live
angular makes it very easy
to make to just add angular in one
little piece of your website you don't
have to make your whole site angular and
like get rid of all your jQuery and if
for some reason I don't know why you're
using backbone or Ember
you don't have to do that either and you
can do it anywhere in the page so you
can either make your whole HTML document
angular ready or you can make just a
small part the app and ng app is another
built-in directive that you would that's
built into angular and it basically
tells hey angular this is where I'm at
yes that's a good question I honestly
yeah I don't know if so when angular
first loads it looks for that I don't
know if it continues to watch the Dom
for that that's a good question yeah
there is a like angular bootstrap call
to bootstrap the app and that's
basically what this directive does so I
mentioned this earlier people like to
call it other things but as you can see
there's a controller a model and a view
that's just repetitive I like to make
the point that it's Model View
controller okay so here's another
example of ng-repeat with better data
instead of zero one two so let's say you
have a model of fruit in a basket right
so you have an array called basket and
it has all your fruit in it and you want
to repeat over it it's it it makes it
real easy this is literally all the code
that's going on on this page - the
inclusion of the libraries and stuff but
all I did was create a controller and
repeat over
for every fruit in the basket out put
the fruit it makes it super easy to go
over a list of a list of users or or
subscribers or items in a shopping cart
or anything like that and you just have
this one template and it and it repeats
very easily I'm gonna skip this slide
it's been a while since I give this talk
and I don't remember what that sides
about so here we go another built-in
directive is in G bind so in angular
they use the double curly braces kind of
like handlebars to bind your model to
the view these curly braces are
customizable so you can use whatever you
want and actually in this presentation
I'm using curly brace bracket curly
brace so that it doesn't render those
curly braces but yeah you can change the
curly braces however you want that in G
those curved double curly braces are
virtually the same as the ng bind
directive it's recommended that you use
ng bind on a on like your first load
page because if if for some reason it's
slow your users will see the double
curly braces with your variable and this
will this will basically give them a
blank element then when angular
bootstraps it will bind that model to
that element so on all your subsequent
pages because angular is already loaded
use the double curly braces but if you
use ng bind on like your first initial
load you'll prevent that like flash of
if anybody's experience that the double
curly braces so usually on an index on
the like the main page or the index try
and do all ng binds and then you'll get
rid of that another built-in directive I
guess of angular is form so it's not in
G form you just use
your standard form tag and angular will
automatically bind to it and do extra
stuff for you on it and watch it and do
stuff like that
but another cool thing is it also binds
to all these other input types so a lot
of stuff you have to use you know that
it's angular because it's like
ng-controller ng-repeat or something
like that when it comes to forms it
angular is doing a lot of stuff on the
forms way and you don't have to add
those additional directives on it it
automatically handles forms for you so
on an input type checkbox' if you add a
model to it which is I have checked this
out and I've defaulted it to false it
basically turns this model into a
bullying and true/false so as as you
change this you get the angular angular
action of data binding and updating your
view and your model gets updated and
angular really does that on on the input
type checkbox' stuff so here's another
example of input box with some
additional functionality so there's a
lot of similarity to the two Java
scripts like on Mouse enter on change on
click and they're renamed to directives
like ng click ng change and stuff like
that so in this example I have a tip tip
object with a bill bill amount so like
say this is like a tip calculator right
I guess I could have done a to-do app or
something as well but what happens here
is as this input box changes it performs
this calc tick function
sets the tip amount to the bill amount
times 20% because I usually tip 20% I
don't know about you guys
so then what it does is use it binds tip
amount about right here and then it'll
take the bill and add the tip amount and
bind it right here what this pipe does
is a filter which are built-in filters
into angular so I can just say filter
currency and it will automatically
format the number for me in currency so
if I enter a bill amount of 24 67 you
can see as I'm type as it changes the
function gets called every time the math
happens the UI gets updated and all that
even the number formatting happens
automatically so it's pretty pretty
slick I mean this is literally all this
is all the code that's happening and it
and it makes it nice and fancy so one
way that you can enhance the user
experience for that slide is another
directive called ng show so ng show
takes a truthy value it could be a blue
lien it could be an expression that
equates to true or false it could be a
string that's either hasn't been defined
yet that's null or that has a string in
it so currently tip amount is undefined
so it comes back that's kind of false
see right so therefore it doesn't show
that span across the bottom anymore as
soon as I type in a tip amount tip
amount becomes a truth evaluate it bill
times 20 times 0.2 is so then it starts
to show it right
I put in a negative number you might
break it let's see
nope it works I'm a 1 number what's a
string but that's really a number so is
there a similar so up there you go
you found you found it but like on that
note let's see I like I like the fact
that type of thing see now okay
so type of not a number is number that
doesn't make any sense
right I have a funny video for that my
one of my friends gave a talk at fluent
conf and there's a has everybody seen
Shrek so he did type 1a no number and
then he played the Pinocchio well I
can't say that it is but it isn't but it
it's pretty funny okay so that provides
a better the ng-show
makes it really easy to show and hide
elements and it provides a better user
experience because previously we had you
know that template there with blank
numbers those were blank now it's 0 so
it just provides a better user
experience of not seeing it until
actually something's there right so in G
show and then there's the opposite in G
hide so you hide it and when the value
is true
I'm sorry like adding a delay I'm not
sure if you use if you use an iPad
there's delay of 300 milliseconds right
if you're using an iPad there's a 300
millisecond delay I think okay so
another directive is ng class so Angie
class is like a favorite of mine you can
basically pass in an object with class
names so I have that CC CSS up at the
top and I have a class of bold that
Classen of might italic and I forgot
underlined in here in the example code
for some reason but those are my class
names and I'm passing a blue line next
to it right as you can see in the
control our default of them all the
false and then I applied them to these
check boxes so I conflicted checkbox and
set this sample text to bold and angular
does all that for you it watches the is
bold variable and when you when that
becomes true it puts the bulb class on
the sample text it's really slick so
bold italic and underline isn't very
sexy but you can do stuff with like
background colors and like a full class
that has all kinds of other stuff so you
like click a button in it and you can
make a whole day of transition to the
other side or flip a switch or all kinds
of other stuff but as soon as this
becomes true
it adds the class instantly right
and we can take a look at that the
screen is not very friendly so let's see
where's the sample text that's that's
not where it's at come on
all right it's not being very friendly
here I've done this before
trust me where's the slide that I'm on
here we go
for some reason it didn't want it I had
to hunt it I have to hunt it down oops
on the next slide okay here we go so you
can see classes empty right now and as
soon as I check bold class gets the bold
it gets the italic it gets the
underlined so the ng class directive
binds our watches those boolean options
and applies the class to it so that's
that makes it very easy to add like an
air class to an input box if like an
error happens or or stuff like that I'm
sorry yeah yeah yeah so that's all the
slides I have I'm sorry
yeah the one of the whole commented out
block yeah I'm sorry
github just has like all the projects
that I've worked on like there's a magic
card game and some other like weird
stuff yes so these slides are actually
on I don't know if you can see that you
know you can't see that I'll write it
right here actually so it makes so it's
up there in G guide.com slash angular J
yes
it's all lowercase what it doesn't
matter I tried to write all lowercase it
was hard for me I usually write in all
uppercase so there's that the the the
canvas puzzle thing is on how to html5
calm slash puzzle if you want to check
take a look at that code - it's the
Google i/o slides from 2012 or 2013 yeah
so that's these are the Google i/o ones
I worked on a project called GDG X like
we play on the Google X right we don't
build self-driving cars or anything we
just build slide decks but we rebranded
it and that's we called it I think
project glider so if you go to
github.com /gd GX these slides are up
there as well and then this is all html5
so you can just go to that view source
and you have all the code and then you
could like go to this last slide and
replace it with all your information and
give the same talk if you want so
angular 1.3 supports ie8 2.0 will drop
support for IE 8 Google Apps is drop
support for a lot of people are dropping
support for IE 8 what so I only built
for Chrome and like I don't test it any
other browser I don't really care but
but that these are like little projects
or whatever it's not like like I'm sure
so I'm lucky I work internally and I can
say hey use Chrome or whatever I can't
do that on like ebay.com or something
right yeah yeah
so so one of my recommendations one on
one owner of my recommission
recommendations and something that I've
saw I've seen is you you put up a huge
modal that says this site could be so
much better if you were using a better
browser or something like that like
provide a fun experience to make them
switch or something like that like this
so yeah
so there was an html5 game site and
basically they replace the game with a
static image saying you could be playing
right now but your browser doesn't work
or something like that so you don't have
to totally like let them out or whatever
but say hey it could be so much better
you just don't know yeah so it just
depends on your situation so like if
you're working for Bank of America and
you don't have that option then I'm
sorry you don't get to play with angular
but so who in here is like a web
developer so you all know about like the
complications with a cross browser
compatibility right so as far as I know
angular 1.3 and under and and the whole
1x series will support ie8 still so and
when you switch to 2.0 it's gonna be
such a drastic change you're probably
gonna have to rewrite a lot of stuff
anyways so you can stay in one point the
one point three series and still have IE
support 2.0 is gonna have tons of new
features that old browsers don't support
so that's why they dropped the support
and said instead of us setup us holding
back because of this let's let's
basically throw up the thing like hey
you know you could be using angular 2.0
but you care about your users so use 1.3
so it's kind of one of those things like
if you want to build so like if you want
to build fun stuff then on your on the
side then you get to use the fun stuff
right but if you're trapped then
obviously you can't
I haven't used PhoneGap enough to know
there's a framework out there called
ionic that is built with angular in mind
and it it I don't know if we use this
PhoneGap but I know it uses Cordova and
it builds you can build it into the
packaged hybrid app yeah so ionic and
they're supposed to release a new one
with the new material design oh there's
that any other collisions yeah I think
they no longer support that yeah yeah so
Chrome Frame was basically using
Chrome's rendering engine and v8 inside
of ie 8 RIE
7-6 I think even maybe 5.5 it exists but
I don't they stopped
support on it I guess yeah yeah so I
don't know I haven't read a lot of the
stuff on 2.0 I just know so I have a
friend Erin frost he's a gde
like a Google developer expert on
angular and I know he made a post and
had some discussion with Brad green
about the 2.0 and it is like a major
shift from what I read it's like you
basically have to rewrite to go to 2.0
but it's but it's it's yeah there's all
these other features and I'm not sure if
it's worth it it depends on how large
your codebase is right if it's if it's
open web camp comm or it's only like
five pages or whatever it's not that
hard to rewrite but if it's yeah if you
have a huge stack then yeah
I'm not sure on that number but I know
you see angular being used a lot more
places and if everybody used the CDN
then they would have a cache like Costco
comm is using anyway now what did they
what did I see the other day there's a
bunch of websites using angular now so
like Costco's Photo Center when you when
you upload photos to Costco and all your
images are laid out
that's an NG repeat of all your photos
like I looked at the source why it was
loading so slow and I've discovered that
it was like angularjs so that's cool
yeah not for angular for Costco's
developers it it like they have a they
have a custom they made a custom like
photo load directive that so it iterates
over that and then it like fetches the
photos very slow yeah so you can have
unlimited controllers in your app yes
yeah yeah so
oh it's Aaron's birthday too let's see
where was it I think I don't have the
actual I don't have the other code so so
first you create a module right app dot
module the name of your the name of your
module and then you can just so
somewhere in the code
I set var app equals angular dot module
probably angularjs talk or something
right so now app is a reference to my
module so app dot controller this I can
do another app controller that so these
are actually yeah so they're just they
just happen to be
named my controller and actually in the
code it it's probably so that's probably
a lie
probably in the in the script all my all
my controllers and named something
different for each slide so I have the
two-way data-binding slide in the
dependency injection slide and the
model-view-controller slide so I just so
there's the the creation of the module
with no dependencies and I reference
talk as it so and then I just do add
another controller to the talk module
add another controller to the talk
module stuff like that
yeah so this this doesn't use like
routing or views or anything like that
so the straight HTML just has let's see
it just tells use use this controller
for this slide right and you could and
so basically so this slide that had ng
app angular lives here right you do the
same thing with ng controller this
controller manages this scope and you
can have nested controllers as well so
you could have controller a controller
be inside of controller a and then
inside controller B you can go scope
parent to get to the parent scope as
well so you do stuff like that yeah so
it's just JavaScript right so you could
use it for anything that you would build
in JavaScript I've only used it for
sites I'm not like a game developer per
se like that puzzle was like the extent
of my game development that's just the
chrome dev tools saying that this this
style is on the element but it's not
being applied right now so it got it got
wiped out by this one because of the
important so it's saying opacity doesn't
work here because it's just part of the
chrome dev tools the most major pain
point is documentation but everybody
says that like it's hard to know unless
you get into the source code and read
the source code and know what ng-repeat
is doing in G repeats an easy one to
figure out right for in whatever but
some of the other ones it's like how the
hell do I build a custom directive like
there
not really a good source on that and
stuff that's probably the biggest pain
point but it's just trial and error and
then best practices also so it's a
pretty new framework it's been like two
years now and there's a couple books out
there but there's not a lot of best
practices like this is how you should do
it I guess you can get that from
angular's examples right I think they
get they don't even support the
angular-seed project so don't look at
that one like there's the original one
but like the yo man if you're familiar
with yo man there's an angular generator
and that that's pretty good so like
that's what I use now to to like kick
start an app really quickly so like it
makes it super easy so like I can just
start an app right now like from nothing
like let me go to a folder see open web
cam oops
okay so if you've is anybody familiar
with yo man okay so if you use yo man
and you download the yo angular
generator you can just type in yo
angular and spell it right and it
prompts you with some questions do you
want to include bootstrap sure do you
want to or do you want to use the sass
you want to use bootstrap do you want
the SAS version of bootstrap it goes up
to NPM downloads all the dependencies so
yo man is a suite of yo Bower and grunt
it uses Bower for your dependency
management and it uses grunt to run all
the tasks and you could yeah you could
say that you could say that well I mean
this just makes it super fast right so
all the tedious tasks of scaffolding out
your app and like going doctype HTML
HTML head body doing all that stuff yeah
it aired for some reason sometimes
that's a false err so we'll see it it
scaffold out the app so it created all
those directories and folders for me so
now we can go into webstorm
create a new project from existing files
go out and find that folder and import
it I think that's what I want
yep so just by typing in yo angular it
scaffold out my entire app for me I have
views and controllers and an index page
I have an app j/s that has built in
route routing already I have a main
controller all that just by typing yo
hanging in there and then I can type
grunt
serve
ah sometimes it doesn't work for some
reason
let's try there we go
so I run npm install to get all the
dependencies but basically it built this
app and kicked up a node.js server and
this is the page that it built as you're
like starting point the nice thing is is
that you can it has a feature called
live reload so we can go into my views
my main view and see that see here as
you change stuff this make this makes it
real easy to be a developer actually you
can change this to hello world and save
it and then it Auto refreshes your UI so
there's a node process watching all your
files as they change it tells the
browser refresh so it's pretty cool
I forgot how we got down this path lord
yo okay so this is a this is an easy
this is an example of some best
practices on how to like kind of
architecture or like structure your app
right so you have scripts folder with
controllers you have a views folder with
all your views in the index file you are
sorry fjs you have a route provider so
the route provider basically watches the
URL right and it tells it when it's at
the root use view means HTML as my
template and use main control as my
controller you can add a new one in
super easy
and change what it is so now when I go
to slash open web camp use that view use
that controller obviously they don't
exist
let's just play around real quick so
there's a view let's copy this and
create a new controller
and that's all we need there and then we
have to also make sure that that gets
put into our index folder here okay
so now if we route to open web camp you
get that
so it took it used that view and that
controller to do your interface
basically and that's how you can segment
your app I don't know I won't show you
too much code but you can see this is a
project at at eBay and you can see we
have lots of controllers separated and
lots of views separated so it makes it
real easy to manage the size of your app
because now if I want to change one view
it's all in one HTML file I don't have
to search through 20 thousand lines of
code
everything's segmented any other
questions so I don't know about that
story specifically but I know angularjs
is like no conflicts with other
libraries so if they were trying to do
something within the world of Twitter
bootstrap then they would have had to
include jQuery and and stuff like that
there is an angular UI project that
basically gets rid of all the bootstrap
jQuery dependencies and does the
bootstrap stuff in angular so there's a
library for that that you can do it's
angular UI but it works friendly with
other JavaScript frameworks there's
there's no conflicts that I know of so
angular itself doesn't have bootstrap in
it right bootstrap if you're talking
about the styling right that's it's
that's the CSS framework
so you would have to include the angular
UI project it doesn't have like
bootstraps accordion or anything like
that natively built-in you'd have to go
get the angular UI source and inject it
into your project as a dependency so
default getting angular it has nothing
with bootstrap in it right you have to
take it on a case-by-case basis I'd have
to see what your project looks like to
determine you probably don't need the
bootstrap JavaScript if you're including
your UI because that replaces all that
functionality and you would just have to
use the new angular UI directives
instead of trying to do jobs job jQuery
functions on elements and so like for
example the accordion or tooltip right
so there's a tooltip with a jQuery thing
if you just add tooltip as an attribute
in your code and you have the angular UI
angular handles all that you don't need
any other JavaScript functionality stuff
like that so I mean you just have to
hack at it I guess and play around and
figure out what's what works and what
doesn't work but the angular UI project
is very good at taking all of the
bootstrap JavaScript functionality and
making it easy to use in angular any
other dozen set it alright thank you
