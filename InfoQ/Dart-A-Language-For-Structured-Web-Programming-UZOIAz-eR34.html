developer advocate with google chrome
advocates work with partners of all
different sizes helping them get up
online productively easily happily on
our products services and api's recently
that is all about html5 also the Chrome
Web Store Chromebooks Chrome OS chrome
frame for your legacy browser users out
there and 2012 looks really cool because
we recently just announced in technology
preview our new structured web
programming language dart and that's
what I'm here to talk to you about today
and because I asked about who here is a
Java developer because that's a little
bit about my background and why this
project appeals to me so much see was my
first language but I quickly found Java
numerous reasons I think it's a little
bit easier to approach thanks to garbage
collection it it was kind of built for
the for the Internet era so I had things
like URLs you can fetch network
resources and now this crazy thing
called applets and so anyway I got into
java programming and so to me you know
structured programming was kind of my
first exposure and I was used to a lot
of these constructs like classes and
interfaces and really functional
development environments allowed me to
refactor rename variables all this great
stuff and I mean you read a lot about
these techniques about books and so
that's really cool and then I was really
lucky to get hired here at Google under
the chrome team and I had really story
so my back earning a server-side
programming and in structured
programming all this great stuff and
they hire me for the chrome team is said
oh that's really cool I don't really
know JavaScript that that well and so I
sent an email of this person that my now
manager direct me to me she's like I'll
just talk to this guy he'll you know
he'll help you feel better about in so
I sending this email along guys don't
think I'm gonna do good at this job at
all i don't i'm not a javascript ninja
i'm always dealing with like Ruby your
job and all the stuffs like don't worry
you'll be fine it turns out that this
guy was my boss's boss the head of all
developer relations I'm telling the guy
just got hired for I don't think I'm
gonna do very well so I was kind of
funny about he was cool so I was kind of
thrust into this web programming world
and turns out that was as exciting or
more exciting than the kind of
programming I used to do and I really
really liked it but I always felt that
that was kind of meat you know me
personally missing the kind of
structured programming environment that
I always felt kind of comfortable in and
I wasn't directly able to bring over a
lot of the kind of mental models over to
web programming and and certainly that's
on me I should have learned more about
kind of the native intrinsic
javascript-based and CSS base stuff and
I think I did okay they're still still
employed but anyways when they brought
up this project dart which one's mine I
was a very intrigued I said oh this
looks speaks right to mean so that's why
I asked about Java developers because I
think dart is a way to bring a whole new
class and developers to the web and have
them feel comfortable and familiar and
build a functional high fidelity high
performance high feature web apps for
what is arguably the most ubiquitous
platform out there and so that's what
Dartz all about let me just take these
off here okay so dart let's get into it
it's a structured web programming
language I like to think of it as
batteries included so it's not just one
particular effort it's a collection of
efforts that is really aimed at making
the application developers life a lot
more pleasurable on the web so we're
taking a look at a new language new
tools tools first classes from this
effort new libraries a new virtual
machine so lots of different elements of
all play together under the start
project dart itself is open source when
we announced it in I think early October
it was a technology preview right right
out of the gate we said we have some
good ideas we're going to put them out
there but we're not done we're not done
by any means and we wanted to get out
kind of the direction we're heading but
with enough lead time that you and the
community can help impact that direction
of dart because it is open source and it
is looking to be a major player on the
open web platform and so getting that
early feedback getting the early
exposure from communities and users is
really important to us so we launched as
open source and technology preview and
it's out on google code today let's talk
it's kind of high-level whys and what's
of darts with a couple things on the
agenda so they talked about the
motivation I talked a little bit about
my particular motivation what you know
interested me and what got me excited
we'll look at some features the language
that we think are interesting or unique
in this setting will talk about its
concurrency structure called isolates
we'll look at what we're doing with the
Dom because in the end of the day it is
a web programming language how do we
interact with that browser look at a
couple code samples we have a couple
demos so current web right it's done an
amazing job to become the most
ubiquitous platform out there especially
for information delivery and there's a
lot of good reasons for this there's a
lot of good parts to the web clearly
it's easy to get small to medium-sized
apps up on the web I mean we're just
tremendous amount of interesting and
unique and variable apps out there for
and it's really easy to get started to
write you can create just a few files no
compilation step just any web server
host up just a couple of files and boom
you up now have a web app of course is
platform independent right there was a
web browser on nearly everything set-top
boxes game consoles every computer
laptop desktop notebook server even
Netflix right well port web kits instead
of building custom apps so I mean
ubiquity of that web platform ubiquity
of HTTP and HTML on the DA met cetera
that's a good thing that's that's
something that that really excites that
keeps us going keeps chrome going
incremental development i think is
really key let's say you have a 10 gig
app and you want to patch one file you
just upload that single file so the idea
that you can do this kind in
uploads incremental in conjunction with
caching at the HCP level really does
make deployment and distribution much
more efficient than if say you had to
ship a two gig zip file which compose
your app every time you want to make a
tiny little patch the platform itself
improving very very very fast this is
something that we as Deverell really
struggle with because every time we turn
around there's new API we have to go
support things like Web Audio API
filesystem API WebGL typed arrays in
Java Script do acma five constructs and
JavaScript I mean you name it that just
there's a complete resurgence in the web
platform especially for apps and we see
this continue accelerating accelerate
and that that's great the stat that I
like to track personally is something
kind of near and dear to my heart is and
it speaks to the just ubiquity now the
modern web is that when I last looked
it's greater than fifty percent of all
desktop laptop and notebook browsers out
there can play Angry Birds and okay
that's fun but it actually says that
greater than fifty percent of web users
today on desktop laptop and notebook can
access a modern web app I mean this is
an app that needs WebGL or canvas this
is an app that needs hardware
acceleration this is an app that needs
fast JavaScript and this is a really
good sign for us application developer
course now that means it's not just like
the edges of our users have have this
grace capability greater than fifty
percent of how many hundreds and
hundreds and millions of users is a lot
and that itself is a platform to be
reckoned with so when we think about
developing apps for the web we like to
target modern web browsers as a platform
in of itself a capable fully functional
fast platform but we as Google probably
know this just as well or is better than
anyone else and that also developing
large applications complex applications
applications spans multiple team members
across possibly multiple locations and
time zones this could be easier we've
taken a couple stabs at it there's the
quit project J's compiler closure I'm
sure there's others out there
that are all efforts to make programming
your modern feature-rich large complex
web app easier to manage and each one of
these definitely got us supped at this
point we have some really great success
stories Angry Birds itself is written
and quit but you know it's not baked
into the actual open web platform itself
it's it it's it's at multiple levels of
abstraction away from running code in
the browser so you know we feel that
it's hard to find a program structure in
these really large apps we find that the
lack of static types are at least the
lack of type annotations makes it harder
for tools to analyze what's going on and
that means it's harder for you to work
with the project we think that tool
support could be a lot better especially
me coming from building java apps and
i'm sure a lot of net programs out there
are very thankful for a selection of
options here in the ide level at the
profile level at the compiler level it's
just the tool tooling is a lot more easy
eight or easier to access with more
functionality these other kind of
structured programming languages and
believe it or not even with the
improvement in javascript performance in
caching performance in network
performance with protocols like speedy
we feel that startup could be faster and
this is something chrome takes very near
and dear to heart speed simplicity
security speeds often the first thing we
always say in what are the three tenets
of chrome so we've done a lot but we
think that there's things we can do
better that we can approach within
unique angles here with an effort like
dart to make start up even faster and
the web's been around for a long time
you can't delete stuff from the web this
is you know what would it be like if we
could take a fresh approach well we like
it we can take a new perspective on what
it means to have a structured
programming environment for the web and
it that might be an opportunity to kind
of cut out some of the things that
didn't actually know some of those dark
alleys that are the dead ends of the web
platform and going to give us a fresh
start so this is what motivated us to
take a look at well let's give this a
shot now we build large feature-rich
apps look at gene
look at Google Docs I mean there's some
really great posts out there about what
it took to build Google+ and there's a
whole lot of Ajax going on there so what
if we actually restarted a new effort in
this case dart we think it fills a
vacuum we think it's a new option a new
approach to building the structure web
app and that because it's the open web
platform that's capital oh that means we
should have a shot at proving its
validity we should have a shot at bring
it to the open web platform because it
is open is a grassroots effort to make
these things bubble up to to try out
what works to put it in front of the
community like you guys early on and
test it out we think it's going to be
good so I the intro was something about
like those are words replace JavaScript
okay so we actually think it's not it's
not aimed at replacing JavaScript which
is this subtle but really important
point dart is aimed at the web app
developer and right now app developers
are excited about mobile platforms and
there's some really good reasons for
that but the fact is that the web isn't
sexy for app developers ensure it's
great for pages great for information
delivery and it's doing a bang-up job
there but we feel that to push the web
forward what need to do is become more
relevant for app developers so we feel
that the arts not a replacement for
anything it's a new option for building
structured high performance high
fidelity feature ribs apps but on the
web so in in essence what we're trying
to do is say hey app developer who might
have looked at iOS or Android why don't
you look at the web okay so what is dart
dart is succinctly a simple unsurprising
object-oriented class-based single
inheritance with interfaces okay so you
guys can jaan right now and walk out of
the room because oh we've seen this all
before but what's kind of cool about
dart is that it also pulls in some
unique features which is really targeted
to what is essentially a mass mass
adoption language and so here you see
part of what the thought process behind
dark which is yes it's very familiar we
have classes we have interfaces it's
single inheritance stuff we've seen
before but we also have and we'll talk
these things optional typing for
instance we have the concept of isolates
for concurrency real lexical scoping
these are unique elements to the web
platform so we think that we can bring
both the kind of structured app
developer today through its familiar
syntax and true story I was sent some
code yesterday and it just started
editing it and i honestly i swear i did
not know his dart code it was so
familiar I'm like I'll may just start
adding some method says oh is this a
dart file so familiarity that we have to
think we nailed this when I was very
surprised okay so here's the part that
people love to love and love to debate
about to me is the most interesting part
I'm still wrapping my head around it and
it's arguably the most unique feature of
dart which is again targeted to a mass
adoption language we've seen this before
but has anyone gotten optional typing
launched in a mass adoption language and
darts given this a shot so optional
typing means just what it sounds that
the type information that you are adding
to your classes interfaces and functions
actually it's optional does not have to
be there why are we doing this but we
feel that we can decouple the type
checking system from the actual language
allowing maybe new efforts to look at
what are some new ways of type checking
it also allows us to appeal to the mass
mass mass JavaScript developers out
there who have never seen a type in
their life and probably don't want to
come anywhere near a type but because of
the optional typing as you build larger
programs as you build out your
interfaces your classes start to really
architect your system these types now
start to crop in and this is good for
things like tooling this is good for
things like documentation this is good
for things like creating a modular
system so darts optional types we feel
are kind of an emergence well the types
themselves will emerge as code grows as
teams gets larger and we don't want
those types to get in your way so we
think that the optional typing is
actually really key both for adoption
but also really just reducing some of
the friction you might experience in the
more mainstream structured programming
languages where type system is mandatory
so a good quote here is that that
optional typing from dart is basically
innocent until proven guilty so we're
going to let you write that code and it
might actually run even though the types
that you specified are when you look at
face value said that makes no sense but
actually the code the code will still
run and that's important for Dart so we
talked a lot about this but the optional
static typing you can really think of
them as annotations or documentation so
it does not affect the semantics of the
running code but it does help you a ton
with your tools and does help you a ton
with interfacing with larger teams and
building those larger apps so if you can
just think of as annotations maybe even
assertions if you will if you run in
checked mode but when you're running
program is running he's just he's just
looking at what you actually wrote in
fact it does this method resolve to this
object like if that works you're good
even though you might have said a string
as a person that will run in dart and so
some people say like what doesn't allow
you to write just horrible code in which
case I would say you're allowed to write
horrible code anyway regardless as an
optional type system or not so you still
have to write your unit test you still
have to kind of validate your code
running but we want to remove just
another bit of friction as from writing
from your experience writing these
programs in Dart so you can get started
really quickly maybe write just
functions don't eat any classes slowly
grow your structure slowly or your team
members slowly at types boom now you
have a type system that your tools and
check mode of dart can now help you run
so we mentioned that ok so the types can
also be things like assertions well this
is this is a good way to see it so you
have a type T a variable X and a value 0
it's kind of like saying assert either X
is now lawl or X is T so when you write
these types that's essentially kind of
what you're saying I had this assertion
I want my tools or my check mode program
to check these things for me kind of
like you wrote an assertion but of
course types are a little bit easier to
say that than assertions everywhere ok
so moving on to the kind of unique
features of dart isolates you might have
seen a slide back there was dittus dart
is single threaded oh my god everyone
has 27 cores what am I going to do so
the neat thing is I slits are a way for
us to get safe concurrence
programs so remember though remember
when I talk about these things we have
kind of two constraints here driving a
lot of these design decisions the first
one would be has to be familiar right
we're really appealing to the mass
audience so when we look at the code
samples yet hopefully we'll show you
what that means but our other constraint
is in the end of the day dark code has
to compile the JavaScript that's
extremely important to be relevant at
all on the open web platform and so
JavaScript runs in a single thread on
that main page excuse me so we can add
any kind of multi-threading constructs
in the dark won't compile but we can add
something like isolates which allow you
to write isolated code and communicate
between that code using the concept of
mailboxes or passing matches messages
back and forth anyone familiar with
Erlang airlink should be familiar with
that concept of actors you're posting
messages into the mailbox they pop it
off in the other end those different
actors or isolates can run in multiple
threads so isolettes let us get
concurrency the other really neat thing
about isolates is that as we kind of
grow out this ecosystem and I'm sure as
many of us have we've taken JavaScript
snippets from a crazy different amount
of api's and created mashups on our page
but guess what each one of those
JavaScript guys now is polluting the
namespace and communicating as if you
wrote every one of those lines wouldn't
it be neat if you can include JavaScript
code into your web page but run it in an
isolated more safe manner that's also
the theory behind eye slits as well so
you should be able to have a page with
lots of really great mashup capabilities
but running and isolated functions via
these I so now you get concurrency when
you get safety as well so isolettes will
run in the browser and in the server in
the browser if you're compiling to
JavaScript you can run we're called
lightweight or heavyweight isolates the
heavyweight isolates would translate
themselves into web workers if you're
not familiar html5 has the concept of
web worker which allows you to run a
snippet of JavaScript JavaScript code in
a separate thread conceivably running on
a different process or thread from the
OS allowing to get more performance and
more safety in that you're passing just
opaque messages back in
fourth and so a dart isolate can
manifest itself as a web worker if you
compile the JavaScript as well and we
mentioned on the server here too because
as we'll see soon i think the code
nothing about the language design of
dart intrinsically says i can't run on
the server so we completely see the
world where you're going to write dart
code and had that same code run on the
server via something like no dart and on
the client via either you know compiled
into javascript so same code running on
both ends here both server and client to
me is also really big win as well and we
see eye slits being a way to get
concurrency on the server side okay so
we talked a little about these ok moving
on other really cool exciting features
about dart bring something unique to the
table here as we all know as web
developers that kind of the base way to
interact with the web pages via
something called the Dom the document
object model now the Dom was cool
because it had a lot of functionality
but it was built in a language agnostic
manner so you look at that API and you
say this doesn't really feel familiar in
any language I've worked on and they did
that on purpose to get really good
interoperability but for environments
like JavaScript which has its own unique
paradigms and patterns they built jquery
to make working with the Dom a heck of a
lot easier and working with the Dom be a
jQuery feels very natural so of course
when we took a fresh look at programming
the web with dart we said well what can
we do here to make this feel natural to
the dart developer and kind of make you
feel like you're writing dart code and
not Dom code and so we built a new
library we called the HTML library that
it's all into our code feels very
natural to dart it allows you to
interact with your web page in a very
dark friendly way and we'll see some
samples on this a too but this kind of
speaks to this is our opportunity to
introduce new ideas to the platform
introduce new ways of thinking and me
possibly not being held back by the
corrupt of the past 15 years okay so
I've written some dart code how do i
execute what are the different models
look like so certainly had your dart
sews dart source there's a couple
different things that can happen you can
run it directly on a dart virtual
machine and the dart VM is part of this
open source batteries and
do project we had today you can play
with it we also have a couple different
tools we have built out a really great
lightweight editor called the dart
editor that you can run code inside and
author code as well we've also built a
to JavaScript compiler the most recent
compiler is called frog because their
dart frogs not there and that's designed
to give you very optimal very succinct
terse but human readable JavaScript code
so it's one way to get your dart code to
run in the browser the other thing that
we've been working on and is part of the
plan and support this concept of
snapshots so snapshots allow you to and
it speaks back to that speed snapshots
allows you to take essentially a running
dart program snapshot that heap
serialize it send it over the wire
Andrea Stan she ate it over on the other
side so this offers tremendous value to
the developer who doesn't want to
reparse all that dart code who wants
this snapshot not just like what you
parse and put into memory but also the
state of that running program you can
also think of a model here where you
might have a web page that first hits a
page with a bunch of dart code and
compiles at all takes a snapshot puts
the snapshot in its cache then the next
time you reload he pulls the snapshot of
the dart code from cash instead of reap
arcing all the dark coats and also can
help you with that startup even if
you're not just transmitting it from
server to client now it's very early
days and so I wanted to pull up this
slide to be very transparent with you we
are technology preview and we're very
open we really love your feedback now
this shows that we have a little ways to
go for instance the Mandelbrot sample
demo running in straight-up dart on the
dart VM is 5 point something times
slower now than the equivalent on VA we
know that showing you this because we're
totally transparent here but we track
these metrics really closely and so
speed is a feature to us and we will be
working i get dart VM performance up
just like we did with v8 which when it
launched just blew everyone out of the
water and to this day continues to
improve in speed but the neat thing here
is that as we've mentioned we have a
frog compiler that turns dark code into
JavaScript code which
gets you that ubiquity for your dart
apps that that code is actually pretty
good and will continue make that better
so for instance here we're running about
parallel here with the VA code of
JavaScript from the dark who compiled
the JavaScript here so one point 101
percent so two different ways to work on
it we're very transparent working really
hard on it speed is a feature so we
talked about the snap science come up a
couple times this that's really cool so
you can think of something like 54,000
line which is not even that big dart
program sending that whole unsnaps
unsnap shotted version over the wire
you're going to get something like 640
millisecond startup snapshot it send the
snapshot of version of the wire 10x
faster startup this is really important
anything we can do to make the web
faster and we have many different angles
here from working on the protocols to
working on the the snapshotting here to
working on the rendering engine etc all
to make the web faster this is an
important element so have we been
building dart in a vacuum have we just
been like language purist sitting there
thinking about when we make the morals
best language no we've been writing
actual real sample apps from the
beginning so we can prove out these
theories and they've done a really good
job helping us figure out what are the
edge cases how can we improve and one of
our favorite ones is the newsreader here
it's a lot of lines of dart code it's
actually fully functional html5 let's go
ahead and pull it up here okay so if you
were mistaken it's actually almost might
be a native app so this also just speaks
to like power of css3 and the way you
can build modern apps with dark but as
you can see really fast there's a
server-side component this was all dart
code compiled to JavaScript and you
might have remembered this like right
when dark came out that oh but if you
write a HelloWorld dard you get 7
million lines of JavaScript well let me
just show you something so here's the
actual file and we gonna scroll down a
little bit
okay those are embedded images okay so
here's the JavaScript that's compiled
from dart code so nice to minified so
we're going to scroll down a little bit
there we go you to do boom so that's
actually not as much as it looked like
and if you saw the other one it was
really huge so we have an optimized mode
for the JavaScript compiler one and two
we have a new compiler called frog which
shrinks us even further in fact let me
show so this is a real life app remember
this was somewhat 13,000 sorry 1,300
lines of of actual UI code the app
itself is 3,000 line so that shrank too
much much less than in JavaScript so
we're working hard to solve that problem
so the dart editor again batteries
included is the way we're approaching
the start project so the darnetta is a
very lightweight editor lying to get up
and running with the dart project from
from right one download and it go but
it's again the philosophy behind the
dart project we want to make web app
developers lives easy more productive
and part of that is the editors part of
that is the libraries part of that is
the language part of that is a
performant virtual machine all these
things are important for us to address
and the editor is you'll see it it's
very cool so I know I've hit on this a
couple times so I'm really reiterate
dart is not done we did this early as
technology preview to get your feedback
to understand how you want to build web
apps what's been holding you back what
do you need from a new structured modern
web programming environment please let
us know we have it's all open source we
have public issue trackers we have
public mailing lists and we're
considering a whole slew new features
like reflection how is that going to
look I think there's a current proposal
in the works now based on mirrors enum
should we add that maybe pattern
matching here's a good one of you from
Erlang you'll remember that you're going
to get messages off of your actors and
you want to have a nice way to to apply
a pattern to the incoming messages so
you can route the incoming message
appropriately should that be built into
the language how should we integrate
with other browsers so that you know not
done it all please let us know what you
need to build your modern high fidelity
that and uh you know public so you can
find everything here dartlang.org is the
main website we have tutorials we have
getting started guys we have guides for
the editor the language pack itself and
the nice thing about getting in kinda on
the ground floor now is the language
pack is only around 80 pages which
sounds like a lot but then you go look
at other languages you like I'm never
going to be this so it's actually
approachable so not only is the language
familiar but I think you can actually
kind of work yourself through this spec
and some of its definitely above my head
but it's nice to be able to understand
the evolutions nice to be able to see
within an afternoon what is dark so I
encourage you to really just check out
the website and become part of this
project dart de google com is where you
going to find all the code all the
libraries the virtual machine the
compiler the sample apps it's all right
there so I know that this alot Siddharth
is a technology preview we're soliciting
input right now every day we've got a
lot of good feedback and we'd like to
hear more dart is a structured web
programming language for the modern web
and we're really building it just to
make it easier for people to build
modern high performance high fidelity
apps that target the browser and if we
can do that and I'll feel like we've
we've done a good job so please try it
and give us some feedback so we talked a
lot about dark but what does it look
like and why does this not big time okay
so this is the most no I mean there
might be more minimal ways but this is
the most minimal thing that I could
think of and what I like about this
example here is that some of the early
feedback was this looks too much like
Java or something with curly braces and
you can actually write code in dart that
doesn't look like your curly brace to
based language you may or may not want
to do that but when it's neat here is
again dart is repealing to a class of
web developers and a class of structure
developers so should be able to write
complete program is based on functions
you should be able to write complete
programs without a class you should be
able to write succinct things like this
so here's your main method that prints
by the way if you haven't seen the dart
board this is built in to the website
you can try it out you can write your
own dart code actually executing their
browser you don't have to download
anything to try dark
this is actually running on App Engine
and if we can get a response hey cool
hello so it's actually sent back to App
Engine Kabbalah to JavaScript sent that
JavaScript back over and now we're
running in the browser so try out Dart
hello okay so a little bit more complex
now so you saw the minimalist well what
does a class look like I mean that's new
to dart or that's new to the open web
platform right so here's an example of
just a simple point shows off a couple
things right so we have the class syntax
here very familiar I also like this
constructor here's a little bit of sugar
if i can highlight this so if you've
been coming from java for instance
you've probably done a lot of this dex
equals x and this dot y equals why
shouldn't there be an easier way to say
that here's darts sugar for that if you
save this that X and this not why it
will take two incoming method parameters
X and Y and then assign them to the
point instances x and y in one line
that's pretty cool you also see here the
optional types we c VAR here and sorry I
gotta take this off see better here we
go so I could have used the type here I
didn't have to use a type again
appealing to to kind of different
classes developers allowing you to scale
up your code as you go here's our main
method we create two points and we print
I also like this because we had the
string interpolation as well just
another nice little thing that we added
to the language so if we run this
distance okay great so let's go ahead
and do something crazy here and well
let's be really wacky let's add string
here so that off the top your head says
that doesn't really work let's run it
anyway hey so the program ran this is
what we mean by one of the things we
mean by optional typing that the types
don't affect the semantics of the
running code yes this was incorrect and
yes I should be flogged and had to make
our unit test for this but it's
important to point out that this is
actually works but if you say no I need
those checks turns out dart can run in
two different modes and you can run in
checked mode and if we turn on check
mode
will happen boom we get our check mode
time failure here where it tells us that
sorry you can't sign that point to a
string this is really great so again we
we can't be too up front with our usage
of types we're going to lose a huge
swath of users so if we can build in a
way to can scale up to your types and
build in a way for you to choose which
kind of mode you want to run in
production or checked we think we can
bring a lot of people to this platform
okay let's look at one other example
here this is one of my favorite features
okay so it turns out that in dart
classes have their own interfaces and
here's an example of this so we have a
class duck you have some method say
quack you Prince quack then as we all
are good developers we have unit tests
and through unit tests we also create
mocks because sometimes we like in this
case we have complex business logic to
three subsystems and we don't want to
actually integrate that our unit tests
we create a mock duck now in maybe or
traditional structure languages you
would have had to create an i duck but
luckily in dart that interface is given
to you for free so I have mock duck
implements duck this is awesome the fact
that you won't have to litter your code
with I duck everywhere to me is just
great and just is reducing more friction
for the application developer and then
here I can oops sorry you can't see this
there you go I can pass in both the mock
duck and a duck and the both going to
work so neat little feature of Dart so
again when dart first came out the hello
world example compiled to a lot of
JavaScript code there's def there's some
technical reasons for that we knew that
was less than optimal for the everyday
JavaScript developer and so we started
to work on another option here's what
that option looks like it's that frog
compiler and thanks to my bike Bob here
he put up this really cool example here
of here's the dart code okay we have a
simple class and you know this is even
the most succinct way to write this but
just shows you like I'm gonna create a
class it's gonna have a static method
i'm gonna call it from maine ok let's
turn that in javascript and run that on
modern browsers well it turns out that
here's the JavaScript code hopefully you
guys can see this let me just increase
this a little bit here's the JavaScript
code than frog will spit out the
is a fairly human readable it's very
terse has these nice Commons and so that
using the Frog compiler today which
isn't which is an open source and in our
source repo you could take your dart
code about the JavaScript be actually to
understand that JavaScript then you can
run this through your own minna fire and
get even smaller so I think we've
answered those initial concerns so we're
feeling pretty good but again none of
this is done so we have a we have more
to do cool well thanks everyone for your
time this has been awesome darling org
