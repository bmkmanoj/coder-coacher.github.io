ready all right this type pox going to
be pretty tight in terms of time so I'm
just going to kind of jump into it now
yeah sometimes which i think eric
mentioned me earlier i work on spire and
night during the day at work for boots
and analytics so the main / sup I'm just
gonna work yes the main thing here is
that you know you're sitting there
you're implementing some numeric
algorithm and you want to use floating
point because it's fast more importantly
floating-point generally is good enough
most of the time sure whenever you guys
are doing use double and things usually
work the problem is what happens when it
doesn't and you get errors you really
have three options you can continue
using double like you were doing before
you live with the errors this is
probably the most common case and
everybody's generally happy with that if
you can't live with the ears and you
probably try to switch over to a higher
precision type like rational or big int
or something like that it's a fine
option but the problem is it's a lot
slower than just using primitive doubles
but this talk is all about the third
option which is to use a floating-point
filter the idea behind floating-point
filter is pretty straightforward
basically you use a floating point
approximation to your when you can so
you use double as long as you can and
when you can't use double you don't use
higher precision types make sites right
of course the the devil is in the
details so basically the main idea
behind point point filters is that we
can solve our problem using like a
number type like double as usual but
while we're doing that we also maintain
an error bound on this number on the
approximation so we know how bad it is
and what we do is that I may we come to
some point where we actually need to
return a solution we can then check to
see if the error band is with it is
acceptable and if it's not we can then
fall back and reevaluate with higher
than exact type there is a catch here
which is that it is not good for
answering questions like this so you
want to minimize the error you like
what's the terminal metric so you want
to minimize that it's not going to help
you what it is good for
so yeah the problem is like you know it
does not try to actually change your
code to to reduce the heirs what it's
doing is just maintaining air bounce you
still those errors are still there and
we're floating point numbers work well
is when you're trying to do something
that has do you want to answer exactly
and since because you know floating
point numbers like a double there's
always always a little bit wrong because
they're just an approximation they're
never going to answer any question
exactly a better question to ask of
floating-point filters is what is the
sign of the determine of my matrix so
you want to know is zero so you know can
I actually solve this matrix or not or
if you wanna know if it's positive or
negative we'll see an example that later
the key here is that it's good when you
need to make a decision so you have a
predicate you want to solve you need to
know some property of the number is it 0
what's the sign of this number and so
our floating point filter it really is
pretty simple just a wrapper you can see
here we parameterize it on the type or
using you generally want to parameterize
on an exact type cuz that's this whole
point in life so exact types are big in
rational spare husband algebraic and
there's also no unreal and it provides a
set of standard operators that it can
but it knows how to compute the error
bounds for so these are things like
you'd expect bike addition
multiplication division but also things
like square roots and then roots and as
long as you stick with that but when the
promise is that has these predicates
limit though the two main ones are
seinem and compare and what it says is
that it will try to use the floating
point approximation for those so you can
and if it can it'll be fast the actual
number type there's really not a lot of
magic so you have our floating point
approximation here pretty
straightforward these two little members
here maintain our error bounds I really
don't wanna get into that if you want to
learn more I can go read this paper
that's for the feed limitations based
off of it's pretty readable and then we
have funk here that represents our exact
number type so rather than actually
evaluating the exact number type we just
serve it in a thong to be evaluated
later so obviously the real magic
happens in the plantation which is just
a ton of macros and these macros are
very important for a good reason which
is that
we want to be relatively we want to be
close to the speed of doubles and we
can't do that if we have a whole bunch
of allocations for every single
operation so what floating-point filter
does is it for a given expression it'll
try to fuse all the operators together
to get rid of intermediate allocations
and it'll take all those all the error
bound maintenance calculations the
floating-point approximations and
everything else in lines them and all
that funk you saw that evaluates the
exact number type it just gets turned
into a deaf and what it's important is
that def stirs get turned private
methods so we're never actually
allocating a thunk instead we're just
eventually calling some private method
and so an example here is we have a
pretty simple expression X plus y we're
getting the sign and this will turn it
into this horrid mess it's kind of hard
to follow but basically here we're in
lining our X variable here we're in
lining our Y variable and then down here
we're basically doing the actual
audition and then finally we're doing
the seinem test here but the one thing
it's kind of hard to see in this is that
the only time we'll ever actually
allocate anything from that expression
is it this very final little else here
where we finally compute the sign I'm
and this is in the case where the
floating point approximation has failed
and we need to fall back the exact case
but there's no allocations preceding
that so I wanted to motivate the use of
this by giving some examples I have two
examples to show I'm hoping I'll get
through both of them if not tough luck
but basically the first one is 2d
orientation it's pretty straightforward
we have three points these points have
some order this case would on P Q R and
we want to know if this is turn left or
turned right in this case we turned
right you know here we've kind of
switched the order of it and now we're
turning left there's also the degenerate
case where we haven't turned at all and
we really want to know about that too so
this is a case where once again we're
asking a question that can be answered
exactly by floating point arithmetic
most of the time so we're going to
encode this test as just a type class
i'll call it turn you can see here it
just takes our method just takes three
points each line here is a point with
the coordinates and returns assign them
of the sign of the
of the I should mention here the the
base doesn't matter anyway so the first
implementation here is just going to try
to do what I think most people would do
and I would certainly do first which is
just try to use double so we just
implement using straight double
arithmetic and it's great it works most
of the time so key here is really this
line at the bottom here all we're doing
is regenerate a bunch of tests we have a
line we generate three points on that
line and then we just kind of perturb
each point just a little bit and as we
move along the right of the access these
points are getting perturbed less and
less and less and so you get closer and
closer to actually being on a straight
line and you can see after so this is
basically the number of bits down in the
double where we're perturbing it so as
we get further and further we're getting
smaller and smaller and closer to the
line and eventually hit a point where
doubles stop working and we get errors
so if we want to implement this using
just exactly romantic no floating-point
filters you may probably just do this we
would wrap the doubles in some exact
type like algebraic we compute the sign
and of course the problem is this is
very slow I mean it's a lot slower it's
really hard to beat by a floating-point
arithmetic or just like you know pure
doubles primitive types so we can try
again and we use flowing pipeful to this
time it looks it is very similar to the
other ones the only thing is we're
wrapping each each coordinate in a
floating point filter first this
wrapping isn't actually allocating
anything they're all it's just returning
a value class here I which is very
important or to remember and then we
just could just write an expression like
we would have anyways with the doubles
and the nice thing is we get good
performance it's no longer 10,000 times
slower it's about forty percent of the
speed of devil which I think for most
people if they'd be happy with if it
means that you will never be wrong
obviously can see once we start getting
into the exceptional cases where the
points are very very close to a line the
speed drops off that's okay those are
like our one percent of cases are less
so that example is sort of we had
doubles and we wanted to basically make
our we had some double sum test that
uses doubles
and we wanted to make it exact and so we
use that in this other case we have an
exact type and we want to make it faster
we have an exact now the relay uses
exact type so we want to make it a
little faster using floating-point
filters so I'm glad Eric introduced
polynomials earlier but basically you
know we have our polygon here the red
line is our x-axis and what we want to
do is we want we have some interval
spread provides a nice interval type to
do this shoot um so they're interval
here and what we're told is that this
interval will contain exactly one root
and what's nice is that so that's the
root here it's where it crosses the
x-axis well it's nice is that we know
that on each side of our interval the
polynomial have an opposite signs on the
right side it's positive or negative on
the left side it's positive and so
what's what and the reason why I bring
this up anyways is because I've been
implementing polynomial rope finding
real roots anyways that inspire and
basically as I was implementing this I
was trying to make it fast obviously
it's aspire itself we've implemented
this album called quadratic interval
refinement for real roots again this is
a pretty easy when to read in the
algorithm itself is pretty
straightforward so we have we're given
an interval in a polynomial that has
some that we're told that interval has
one root in it and we have this little
parameter n so in here n is 8 so we take
our interval we split it up into eight
intervals we then find take the sequence
secant from the left and the right of
interval and we find out where it
intersects we take that intersection
point against the real line we find the
closest line to that once we have that
then we ignore all the other lines
except for the two on either side of it
and then what we do is by testing the
sign here we can isolate exactly which
interval may contain a root in this case
we basically drop down and we find we've
reduced our interval we will find it and
hence interval refinement the key for e
so I was going to
so the key part of the quadratic
internal refinement is that it then
doubles the parameter N and what this is
doing is it's really saying that just
assumes that we are converging
quadratically so each time it doubles
the number intervals so that we double
the number of bits that we've calculated
once again it repeats is usually find
the secant fine intersection point was
basically the route now the problem with
this is that requires two polynomial
evaluations and these are not scientists
these are we actually have to evaluate
it and more importantly get to evaluate
with really high precision I can't get
around that otherwise it won't actually
converge quadratically which is the
whole point but the problem with a lot
of these algorithms is that the only
they only converge fast under certain
assumptions and cool air is no different
and that assumption is generally that
you have to be your interval has to be
pretty small to start with and close to
the root and if it's not our test can
actually fail and so in this case I've
changed the polynomial a bit and we kind
of repeat as before we find it and if
you look here you notice that neither of
our two roots are none of our tools that
we're checking actually contain the root
so the test fails what's nice about q ir
is it falls back to by section by
section is pretty straightforward we
have our interval we split it in two we
know that the route will be on one half
of the other and more importantly all we
have to do to figure out which half is
we just check the sign in this case the
sign is negative so we know that there's
no route between the middle and the
right side because they're both negative
so we can just drop that half and we're
done and we can repeat this process and
it keeps on reducing or find the
interval the nice thing and the part
that's important for this talk is that
by section only require sign tests
however we converge is very slowly but
you know as soon as I see a required
scientist that means that i can use FB
filter and hopefully speed up the base
case where things have failed or when we
first are starting and we don't have a
small enough interval yet so basically
all we want to do is we want to get
speed up the test for actually computing
the sign of the polynomial
at a given point so we have a polynomial
we have a point X and we want to compute
just the sign of that we don't want to
compute the value or evaluate about the
pond I'm we got that point so obviously
i'm not going to go over this too much
but here's the implementation ladies FP
filter pretty straightforward if you
spend some time with it and just to kind
of step back and show us as necessary is
that if we actually try to use double to
do this it's pretty terrible so each of
these lines represent random polynomials
of varying degrees as with the degree
moves up the accuracy of our sign test
drops dramatically by the time we get
there not even that bad like that's 13 I
mean bits that were going down it's
basically below fifty percent which is
pretty amazing that it can be wrong more
often minutes right but it is and then
this is not speed up from exact
scientists this is yeah so the
difference here is we we have a test
that we were originally computing
exactly as opposed to using double we
try to use floating-point folders speed
it up so in this case here what i'm
showing is that we've taken our exact
site with our floating point filter case
all right the guess those are read on
this screen so the right cases are when
we are testis is flowing point filters
and the blue / gray ones are the tests
that use double when the lines turned
gray that means that they've basically
given up on in terms of like accuracy so
you can see that at least for the start
we get some nice speed up its close to
the speed of doubles and once you once
you get past the point where doubles are
no longer useful it immediately drops
down to the speed of just using the
exact sign test yeah it was in summary
the floating-point filter type it
basically works like any other number
type except it tries to be fast and so
the nice thing is like within an
expression it'll take all of your things
that'll in line it they'll use just pure
floating-point arithmetic every all the
exact ones get turned into private
methods in your class and they
eventually only get called at the end
and it gets pretty close to the
performance of double for cases like our
turn test I know is if it if you want to
look at the code
talk you can go to that address has also
all the data in the benchmarks and the
tests i use to calculate the accuracy
and everything else that's basically it
flowing point filter lives inspire so if
you want to use fully open field you can
go use fire it's great that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
