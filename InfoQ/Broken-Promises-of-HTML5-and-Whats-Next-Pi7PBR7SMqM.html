my job is to be the html5 evangelist
when I started the job about two years
ago I said that I want to make Mozilla
the Switzerland of html5 where all the
other companies are bashing their heads
in and trying to be the best in it we
can be the ones that actually don't have
to compete much because we are
not-for-profit so we don't have
stakeholders that tell us to be the
number one html5 and drive forward HTML
six or something like that so this talk
is about broken promises of html5 and
it's quite interesting to just see what
James has been doing because it we mesh
incredibly well and we didn't actually
talk to each other about this but it's
it seems to me that everybody is who's
been very close to html5 has T's to the
same problems right now or has the same
confusion right now I'm going a lot out
of my comfort zone at the moment so I've
been a web developer for 16 years and
I'm not speaking much at web development
conference at the moment but I'm going
to like business analysts I'm going to
enterprise events and these kind of
things and talk there about html5 and I
get a lot of feedback that hurts me and
that's good because I want to move I
want us to move forward we get far too
excited about using our technology just
for ourselves so this is what is talk is
slightly about but let's start with
something different I'm a big big movie
fan I'm the kind of guy that watches a
movie several times with the directors
audio track and has IMDB open and
actually writes down goofs and like
things and that refer to other movies
and alien to me is a movie that is just
incredible because it is justice movie
that in 1979 may not manage to get this
like really claustrophobic feeling of
like oh my god I'm in space and I'm
gonna die really quickly and it also
took away this dislike space travel
being disliked to infinity and beyond
and bring family values on the American
Way to space and actually showed that
space
travel in the future would just be a
normal job and will be just factory
workers up there that get bad food and
really just it's tedious and it was the
first time a science-fiction movie did
this so when I heard that Prometheus is
gonna come out I was like oh dear Lord
because pre pre quotes except for a Star
Trek are just awful from the very
beginning normally they have forgotten
what the movie is about and then I saw
that the rumors coming and I saw Ridley
Scott is gonna direct it again I'm like
yes it's not gonna be Cameron so it's
not gonna be like really annoying like
Pocahontas Meets The Smurfs or something
like that and I saw the actors and it
has like English actors in there guys
from my neighborhood because I live in
London and I'm like yeah it's gonna be
good and then prometheus came out and it
was this awful awful awfully bad film it
was just a CGI explosion and the story
had so many holes you can dry pasta with
it it's just unbelievably bad because
it's like it's a beautiful film the
cinematography is wonderful to see GI is
wonderful but the story is just terrible
it's like so many subplots that don't
make any sense the actress the main
actress is actually forced to do like
forced exposition like oh I can't give
life what does that make me oh you might
get pregnant with an alien right and
then some claw machine gets it out of
you or something and you get hurt and
you can't stand up anymore but you can
run and jump on spacecraft and these
kind of things and you got the Android
guy who basically touches everything
he's told not to touch seems he runs
honeycomb or something it's just really
weird that this guy's this has his evil
subplot and he's like he's an Android is
there to actually repair state things
and stuff it's not thinking about
himself and my favorite was the guy that
had these drones you know the ones that
they stole from from Incredibles that
actually mapped the whole thing and he's
got GPS and they're always in contact
with the spaceship and then they lose
their way how and it was just a massive
disappointment and I gave it the most
brutal treatment I could give a movie
which is actually canceling my pre-order
for the DVD blue set and not downloading
it buy a bit torrent
so I just said this is dead to me this
didn't work out and it's such a shame
because I was so happy about it I was so
I wanted to see it and James just talked
about this and the same happens what
does it have to do with anything the
same happens right now with html5 we are
the hype cycle has been in tech
publishing and in publishing in general
a thing that has been done for years and
we have to speak of inflated
expectations something new comes out
like a flying cars jetpacks these kind
of things and then we have to throw a
disillusionment a slope of enlightenment
and a plateau of productivity and we're
right now going from that peak down
really really quickly not us we're
really excited about it but the tech
press and the analysts out there the
business analysts everybody is right now
out to see html5 fail and it annoys the
hell out of me
but it's just interesting to see that
how quickly that happened and I think
it's us to blame us the browser makers
ask the software makers that actually
gave people the false impression what
html5 is about so I get all these
business reports that our press team
sense to me and says like oh can we do
something about this that like it's not
ready for primetime yes it will replace
apps and it will be the beer future it
talks about the hypertext future
hypertext whatever that means but it's
just business analysts that want to sell
things to other people and it's it sells
to be bad html5 when it came out was an
absolutely necessary evolution we at w3c
set XHTML is done Exchange TM l2 will be
this really cool modular thing that is
based on XML because everybody loves
namespaces obviously and the old stuff
will not show anymore if you're if your
HTML page has a single error in it will
not display and a lot of people said
that's not right we can't do this we
cannot undo the web the web is there and
it's all over the place it's been it's
in rural Africa on a 3G connection it's
here on a 4G connection it's it's
everywhere and it empowers people
worldwide we cannot make the web break
just because we want to do new things so
html5 said a few things that were
incredibly good one of them was not
breaking the web it has to be backwards
compatible
all the cool new input airfields go back
to a text field if they're not supported
that's good because we have to do it on
the server side anyways consistent
parsing of markup was another big thing
for the first time all the browsers that
set our html5 compatible have to use the
same parser we know what browsers do
with HTML we don't hope that some
browser does something different than
the other and they all did like when I
started I was like Netscape 3 and
Internet Explorer 4 and you your basic
skill was knowing how all of those suck
not really how all of those do the
things right so with HTML 5 we had the
consistent parsing across all browsers
multimedia access out of a sudden the
video was not as black box in the middle
that you don't know what's going on that
was some random copied and pasted embed
an object over 10,000 SIDS and these
kind of things in there we knew what it
was it was just an element in the page
we can rotate it we can interact with it
we can overlay things over a video which
we couldn't do before but instead of
just using some iframes and things like
that so ie did it and we had richer
forms we had color pickers we had
numbered fields we had date Pickers we
had all the things that applications
needed that HTML never had so these
ideas were great for html5 this is why
we did it and then we started not
evolution it but we started a mutation
we started putting things in that are
shiny that are beautiful they're like
okay let's do cool shiny stuff to get
people excited about html5 and it's not
the awesome mutation it's not like the
x-men but it's like this this like weird
mutation that you did you look at you
like do I go to hell for laughing at
this sort of what the hell is going on
there what what is this so one of these
things is my favorite in the in the
specs is the what I call the do I look
fat in distress API because when you ask
a browser if it can play a certain video
type there's he can play type a method
and that method has three return values
either an empty string or probably or
maybe
so this is either trolling on a very
very good level or it's just why is this
thing in there this is wasting my time I
don't want to call you API I don't want
to say like does this work maybe that's
not an API that's I could go to people
and talk to them instead of just doing a
call it's like especially something
there's a test
API not giving your data back that makes
sense it's just painful and html5 is the
new flash cuz we all knew Apple killed
flash and we couldn't use it anymore and
we treated it the same way and that was
the painful thing instead of using HTML
the way we intended it let's make a
swept that's not broken let's make a web
that is really good and pass new things
and does new things we actually started
doing shiny stuff so shiny demos is the
thing that actually makes old html5 -
everybody out there
I mean opera the only ones that I really
like obvious enough their demo site is
called shiny demos comm which is
actually pretty sweet and we do these
kind of things we show really cool stuff
I mean let's let's do that quickly so we
talked yesterday about web RTC is the
cool new stuff that's coming out so
there's a little tool that's called web
cam Swiper and it looks like this in
terms of code we got the interaction cam
that's the wrong one web cam Swiper this
is all it is and it's basically a jQuery
plug-in that you can put into the page
and if you want to see what it does it
does this so I can actually now take a
take my camera I have this little book
thing in here and it resized my browser
so let's do this and then I can use my
hand to go back and forward in the book
this is cool because for example for a
cooking app like if I have my fingers
full of blood because I'm bad at cooking
or if I have my fingers full of dirt
because I'm good at cooking I don't want
to touch my computer and I don't want to
touch my my tablet all the time so this
is really really amazing when you show
people that and that's just a few lines
of JavaScript and that's pretty sweet
I'm 440 Mozilla Festival I built this
little thing called the interaction cam
that one will be together with a
makeymakey and i can talk about this for
hours but it's not the part of this one
here so this one now it's just I press
space and as as evernote totally messed
up Skitch I thought I'd do something to
take pictures with so I just have this
picture thing here right now and when I
press space it takes a picture I can say
okay I like this one actually I don't
so let's try another one so yeah hello
and upload this to the web and it's
uploading it to image URL and I can
actually check the link and upload it to
image URL all in JavaScript no server
included all in the browser itself
because image URL uses course for
uploading as well and we got the wiggity
oh my god look angry and we got the
interaction cam using web RTC so if you
look at that source code you actually
have the interaction cam here here's my
API key that you shouldn't use I get
some stuff from the Dom I get my get
media where I test for all the different
browsers which one is support it I get
the video stream I put it into an image
I take a picture by copying it into a
canvas I can put all kinds of cool stuff
on there now as well I can upload it
then using course 2d to image URL
because that they actually have to say
API and that's all the code that was
necessary the rest is event handlers and
this is pretty sweet that we can do
these things nowadays and you get people
excited with that another one is to
leave cam the web cam that one a lot of
people show that one so you can say use
my camera please allow access yes please
and this one uses WebGL to actually give
you lots and lots of filters so I can
see myself here and then I can left
mirror right mirror top mirror so you
can play with that for hours and I
normally do and this like about 50 60
different things going on there there's
one called LSD which is quite
interesting but even simpler things like
the other day my my girlfriend is doing
a training course for people with
JavaScript so we thought instead of
teaching JavaScript a normal way we just
write little games so we wrote this
little game in like 40 lines of
JavaScript that are simple to explain to
people and all of that uses CSS
animations
and transitions and all the things that
really work simply nowadays now all of
this is really really interesting in
terms for us to see it sounds exciting
but it isn't because if you talk to
flash people that have been doing flash
they've been using camera interactions
seven years ago and they look at just
like now like oh wait you can access a
camera awesome and you only have to
write it like seven different times for
different browsers because the
implementations are different from one
to another amazing so what we actually
do is we do the same things we did with
flash that we actually did wrong with
flash we do an html5 now to get
ourselves excited and not the market out
there because people just want to
implement that because you showed that
to a market analyst and he's like well
I've got this Windows 7 machine here and
with Windows 8 every sinter Explorer 8
is my browser what do I do with that you
look at the video on YouTube and see how
it looks like in other browsers but
that's about it so we have to think
about more about not doing the same
mistakes we've done with flash of just
randomly innovating and finding out
things to excite ourselves with rather
than like doing things that make sense
we fail to impress with this and this
was interesting at the at the Adobe
event in London where somebody showed a
lot of html5 demos on every single one
of them failed much like Peter lubbers
yesterday here like every single time
were like oh I reload this again and
like Oh which made it's almost there
like don't worry about it it will work
it's awesome by the way and hope it
works out and we laugh about this you
like AHA demo stuff on screen doesn't
work but actually it bothers people that
there is a lack of robustness and I
agree it's like if we show things that
break on stage that's not appetizing
that's just scary and we just like yeah
well outside the world on people care
and it's just a very very interesting
saying how people who he's for example
is a flash developer he's been doing
that for years and he's like I can't
sell this I can't use their technology
if I can't trust it and it's not
impressive that way and my favorite is
the at the other event that she showed
that okay go music video that Google
released back then that showed that two
dozen
of technologies pop-up windows that
actually can be arranged and that it
never worked on my Chromebook which was
very interesting and never worked on
Firefox because the videos were sent as
application/octet-stream rather than
videos on the server so a lot of these
little paper cuts that kill us when
these things don't work you shouldn't
show things that don't work so instead I
think we should be thinking about what
we can add but what we can't take away
not like Oh 3d animation with video cube
on each side and you can spin it with
your hand and these kind of things like
that's great but that's in the movies
that is Iron Man you're not Iron Man
sorry same with like the interaction of
things my favorite is a Minority Report
when it's like let's do this all day
long
your arms will fall off although it's
it's actually some cruise so it's on
this side but it's okay I think it's
about we start thinking about what can't
we take away what is a good app and that
it doesn't matter if it's a web app or a
native app what should they do the app
we got here on the website like oh look
at the agenda if you're offline the
things the ring breaks and it loads the
agenda every single time I open my phone
that's not an app that's a website I
might as well just go to the website and
read it so web distribution to me a URL
is a very very important thing for an
app an app should be available with the
URL because then I can access it
worldwide independent of of my ability
independent of my hardware a very small
footprint the first load should be
incredibly sort of small then it can
load more data store it offline and the
next time I open it I got all my data
there but the websites that I see in
html5 that came to be apps that actually
are is like massive scrolling parallax
things if your website is 15 Mac it's
not html5 it's stupid
it might be beautiful but flash will
kill you because flash can load this
stuff really in a streaming manner that
html5 cannot yet so don't repeat these
kind of mistakes an app tation to
environment no I don't want to have a
Retina display to look at your website I
just want to see what it does on my
computer a good website looks different
on every different computer according to
what that computer can do if you want
your website or your web product to look
the same on every device release JPEGs
that's the only way you have otherwise
there will always be differences between
the ones off line storage incredibly
important broken at the moment sadly
enough but it's actually the thing that
will kill us if we don't have it because
you will be offline all the time I
travel all the time I'm on planes I'm on
airports I'm in Silicon Valley where the
Google Wi-Fi doesn't do anything except
for just showing up on my phone and
these things will happen it should be
the best mean to achieve a goal we built
far too many things right now to put
effect in like oh yeah everybody wants
to have something like I don't know like
some effects on a camera might be a good
idea because some company might buy you
for billions of dollars but that has
been done and it's not the effect it's
like what do people want to do with this
that's important atomic updates a web
app can upload can get a new level as a
JSON object in 3 K and not like oh you
want to download these 23 Meg's of Angry
Birds because we put new ad banner ads
in right no I don't so atomic updates
are incredibly important and Android has
that now but it's not quite there yet
the web or it already has it the web
always had it and we should we should do
this in every app and simple maintenance
and localization HTML can be really
easily edited and localized as well with
strings coming from somewhere else a
bundled app that is one big thing not so
easy so this is an image that goes
around a lot and it was another
presentation how to tell HTML from html5
tried in Internet Explorer
did it work no it's html5
I find it sad I find it really sad
because not that HTML that Internet
Explorer doesn't do good things they're
doing at the moment but if html5 really
means that you need to use one single
browser we're doing it wrong we cannot
complain that flash needs a plug-in to
be downloaded when we ask people to have
a certain browser to be downloaded
that's the same mistake it should do
something in Internet Explorer it
shouldn't do Internet Explorer old
Internet explorer it shouldn't do the
same thing it should do something that
makes sense if that's a real reloading
page with a forum that actually gives
you the data every single time fine they
work since 1996 I've been saying that
the deal of we give Internet Explorer 6
is bordering on eco philia at times and
we should not do this we should not pass
the Internet Explorer with new
technology if you make a CSS 3d
animation with with with like rotation
and stuff and then use jQuery to make
the same thing work in ie6 you're doing
it wrong this computer is old this
browser is old it's supposed to be in a
pensioner it's supposed to be a sitting
on the beach and feeding pigeons not try
to run marathons like you do with the
CSS 3d animation and there is no one
browser stopped stop pretending that
this would be the case or we only
support WebKit cuz WebKit is Safari
Chrome and this and that nap node
they're all a different WebKit and
they're all a different set up web can
they have all other things on top there
is no one browser to rule them all
people will not download one browser and
be the one in the future that's like I
mean it's unless you go and send
everybody a laptop ok do that please but
it's not gonna happen we have far too
much Hardware far too much browsers out
there that are in use that will not be
upgraded and connectivity will always be
an issue there will always be something
that clogs the pipes that we cannot
connect things to and it doesn't matter
how fast your connector is when your
neighbor starts downloading the last 20
episodes of whatever TV show that just
doing then all of a sudden your
connection is not as fast and
connectivity is never reliable like at
least in desktop world we knew there was
reliable connectivity was slow but it
was reliable with a phone you're like
okay now I'm outside of range I'm in
range again I'm outside of range the
spinner is the most important thing that
I see on my mobile phone and I'm
saddened and in 2012 that's still the
case
so connectivity is really an issue
especially when you when people get me
all about like Oh retina download a 3
megabyte picture because it's beautiful
on this desktop and the newest iPad and
our 3G infrastructure our mobile masts
are not made to send that much data
around so stop thinking that this future
will come it will not the infrastructure
is physical and it's hard to actually
upgrade you live in America everything
is copper cable at least I've got fiber
optics for five years now my
girlfriend's plays in Sweden has 100
megabit line for free with the house and
it's just that kind of stuff is pretty
cool but here you go to Arkansas
someplace in the sticks and you will see
how good your retina displays are now of
course we don't live we then like okay
whatever desktop it's all about mobile
nowadays like nobody uses desktops
anymore like every month there's a new
picture like oh yeah everybody's on
mobile phones now yeah I can see that
especially on trains and stuff I see
that a lot the problem with mobile is
that it's worse for us as developers
because mobile is all about hardware the
hardware providers of mobile the chipset
providers TDD phone providers are the
ones that call the shots well we got
chrome on Android now awesome but it's
not mandatory every hardware provider
can still say oh we only want to use the
stock option Android Browser which is
the new Internet Explorer six cause it's
awful and it needs to be replaced so I
was jokingly saying we need Chrome Frame
for Android but they didn't do that yet
but we have the hardware problem and for
for hardware providers for certain
hardware providers there's just no
incentive to actually support the web
why would I support the web when most of
my money is made by selling apps that
are in my own infrastructure and in my
native environment where I can even ask
developers for $100 to actually build
apps for me why would I make the webview
as good as the Nate
if you just because I don't want to make
money anymore that's not gonna happen
anytime soon so to me didi the mobile OS
is the clamp that actually brings the
browser engine down to a stop we can
optimize our JavaScript our CSS
rendering any way we want to if it's in
a webview and we don't have control over
the performance we have a problem and
that's the big issue about mobile web a
quick story again we're trying too hard
I think it's rather pointless to ask you
if any of a few knows what that is
because none of us has we have been born
back then that is a submarine cable from
1913 they were built from 1913 to 1927
in England and the idea of those boats
was that they could be submarines that
are fast enough to go with with normal
ships so they could be part of the
Armada and then dive down go sink other
things come back rejoice and everything
is fine
the problem is that a submarine as water
under water is a lot harder to get
through than over water are actually
slower much slower than normal ships so
to make these things as fast as the
other ships and there's like comparisons
with like 13 miles per hour 27 much like
we do with frames per second right now
they had to have a massive engine in
there and they had to be huge to
actually host his engines cause back
then it was all like steam stuff there
was no we didn't find atomic stuff yet
so these ships were 105 metres long and
they the debts that they could go to was
60 metres you see the problem with this
if you go down like in a 10 degree angle
you just the back would still be out of
the water by the time it's going to the
place where it would break apart so the
other problem was that at that time the
navigation systems weren't good enough
they basically while they were diving
they were blind more or less so none of
these ships ever made it more than a few
miles out of England because they
crashed into the ground as soon as they
started sinking which is quite ironic
because they shouldn't sink completely
they just try to submerge rather than
sink they crashed into each other they
were 350 million
I've seen a 50,000 pound a piece and all
of them were breaking apart and a lot of
people got killed because they tried to
make these ships the way surface ship
was and being a submarine at the same
time and I think what we learned from
that we can learn from that is like a
web app can never be like a native app
we comparing to things that are not
comparable we're playing in a playing
field where we are blocked we don't have
control over the hardware we don't have
control over the performance so instead
of thinking about making native and web
apps that look like native apps and
almost are like native apps
let's make web apps that are better than
native apps and do the things that
native apps can't do let's not try to
simulate other apps because we just are
happy to do that let's do something
better and this is what the K bode was
its biggest mistake it didn't try to be
a faster submarine and tried to be a
normal ship that can sink and sadly
enough it sank far too well so how do we
get from that TRO of disillusionment
back to the Enlightenment how what do we
do about this well first of all I think
we need a packaged format that's just an
aside but like an HTML app that is lots
and lots of files somewhere that get
loaded and maybe get loaded into app
cache or not is not the right format we
need a package format that can be
actually sent from market to market and
reused everywhere you see with HTML
slides I have to upload them to my
server I have to upload like thousands
of files before I can see my HTML slides
again on the web it would be good to
have one packaged format to do that we
need to free the hardware we need to
free ourselves from the shackles of
hardware providers that tell us like you
need to go know it native to access that
accelerometer camera access note native
not for you this is our we mobile app
comm where mozilla is tracking its
status of our web api is the web api is
basically our drivers and api's that
access the hardware so you've got WebGL
on phones you can do location the
battery API the bed vibration API which
got used to be called vibrator API but a
too many stupid jokes about this
settings fullscreen API multi-touch all
the things that a green are they're all
the things that are red are still being
fixed so help us fixing them it's all
open source it's all on git it's all on
github yeah
that's there's Bugzilla out there so all
this data in this page comes from
bugzilla directly so the thing would go
green if we fixed it so we're on the
case to make hardware accessible through
JavaScript because it is absolutely
necessary you can't make a mobile app
without accessing half of the hardware
that's not a mobile app that's just a
website in an hour in a mobile we call
this Firefox OS actually the system is
called booting echo the the OS itself is
called Firefox OS and what we're doing
with this we're going to markets that
cannot afford a smart phone like an
iPhone or an Android or upper level I'm
Android and together with a few partners
we build phones that are really
affordable for that market so people can
be on the web with their phones and not
send text messages around and Brazil is
the first market where we do that and
the cool thing about Firefox OS is is
that the whole OS everything except for
the hardware drivers of course and the
Linux core that talks to the hardware is
html5 JavaScript and CSS the operating
system itself is written in these
technologies just nothing else you can
you need to learn you can build these
things yourself and we've got an
emulator now in the browser called R to
be 2 R 2 D to be 2g yeah because
developers have a fun kind of thing and
I can open this b2g desktop here and you
can see the operating system in in
action so this is what the operating
system looks like right for now it's
just an approximation you can do
whatever you want with it these are the
apps these are all the settings I can
make phone calls with it I can send text
messages with it something I could never
do with JavaScript beforehand all of
this is now possible in JavaScript so I
can now do like these calls and kind of
things and when I look at the code
everything including actually their
sounds
is done in JavaScript so let me find
that one hang on there we go so this is
the main document of the of the
operating system it's like lots of lots
of scripts some bit of HTML some CSS
everything is done in HTML the sounds
you just heard are defined in JavaScript
so you can change that yourself as well
so for the first time you could build
the interface of your operating system
in web technologies as well off your
mobile phone we're not planning to do
that yet but me as I've been
accessibility fan for a long time a
phone with three buttons like call home
order pizza call a doctor is possible
now just by writing an HTML page not by
flashing your own phone getting your own
Android builds and or asking Apple to do
it which is not gonna happen so what if
what I found amazing about this is that
half a year ago this was an empty
repository on github and now we have
actually the emulator we have the
opportunity for you to turn right html5
apps for that cause the next thing that
isn't this r2d2 beat ug thing Jesus
Christ is you can install a page as an
app so for example you could go to
Wikipedia here install the page as an
app and then it runs as an app on the
phone and this is what we're doing to
free the hardware this is what we're
doing to make html5 a real operating
system for the mobile phones and this is
what a prototype of the phone looks like
right now so I'm not bullshitting you
with an emulator these things exist and
we're working on getting some of them
out for developers but come by our
office here or the one in Mountain View
and have a look at those and you can
play with those phones they work I can
do telephone calls with them I can send
text messages with them I can play games
on them to a degree but they work and I
think it's very important that we think
about out of the box that way rather
than just thinking how do we force
things into the systems that are out
there the next big thing is a knowledge
merger that has to happen that's Kristy
from Adobe and I was doing a talk at the
Adobe Roadshow
adobea trust releasing a lot of tools
that allow flash developers to build
html5 and that is incredibly important
those guys know stuff they've been
playing writing games in browsers
through flash for the last 10 years a
lot of the cool demos that we've seen is
like reverse-engineered of what some
flash guy had done six years ago we have
that knowledge we just have developers
that don't want to touch html5 yet and I
think the important thing is said that
Dobie does a lot of job a good job
telling them about it
conversion is another way in this is
banana bread it looks like crap because
I downloaded on the indie hotel Wireless
yesterday night that's the video it's
it's high quality in reality this is a
3d game that is running in the browser
so this is running inside Firefox right
now this hasn't been written in html5 it
has been written in C++ it's a C++ game
that people just converted with
something called M scripting to to html5
and JavaScript so instead of asking a
lot of developers that for 20 years have
been doing good money writing C++ games
so that yeah you got to learn this HTML
thing which is not quite ready yet but
that sucks to be you you want to make
money with us you've got a bid you got
to do that so instead of having to learn
a new technology they can use what they
do right now and just convert it to
html5 and JavaScript because the
technology is there and the browser
engines are fast enough so that's a very
important step I think and it's
something that Google does as well with
its Native Client which is a bit of a
different story because it only works
again on Chrome but this one works in
all html5 browsers right now just
converting from C++ and I think it's
very important that we don't interrupt
people's work but we just convert them
into html5 Believers adobe has this
toolset coming out like there's this
edge reflow which is really cool could
just like a responsive design few thing
that you can't just crack from power
from Photoshop into it and make your
cutoff points and make a layout that is
responsive and yes no we not gonna
change every designer out there to start
writing
htmls start designing in HTML they want
to use their Photoshop and they can use
their Photoshop what we should do is
support Adobe in creating tools that
actually spit out things that are not
random HTML but good HTML and that's
what I want to do although I'm not done
in Santa Cruz the next few days but I
will be back and they're PhoneGap of
course edge inspect all these really
cool things and I think if any company
can do that its Adobe because as much as
we hate flash as much as we hate
Photoshop they sold millions and people
use it every single day there's no way
we can actually start saying oh we write
better tools than Adobe and Eric will be
as successful no they already have their
subscription plans and these kind of
things going on so how do we get
ourselves how can we do something I
think we have to shift our approach so
the comfort zone is is the magic happens
outside of our comfort zone and we have
to change a bit ourselves so one thing
as developers I always want to do is
start something new and write it myself
because I don't understand other
people's code like every check on forgot
about 20 new libraries coming out
because last year the libraries weren't
good enough and that's not helping
anybody create j/s is the tool sets that
allows you to actually do easeljs which
is canvas painting twinjets for
animation sound J's to make sound work
in html5 preload tres to preload stuff
and Zoe which allows you to build sprite
sheets from imagery to be reused from
flash games for example this is open
source this is free on github you can
download that now and use it
Microsoft has built their their Atari
arcade with that and you can see it
works and Microsoft I have to say it's
the only company right now that makes
shiny demos that work across all the
browsers a lot of other shiny demos say
like this is a so-and-so experiment only
works in that browser that's not the web
but Microsoft are doing a good job that
way and the the Atari arcade was really
beautiful
so create j/s if you want to build the
game look at it use it don't reinvent it
because you're not as good as those guys
because he's oh he's a flash dude and he
learned it for 15 years and he did some
really really good work there
stop abstracting
and this is a bit controversial people
are getting incredibly excited about
sass and less and jQuery and that's good
because how it makes us more much more
effective
it makes us so effective that we
shouldn't do any work anymore we should
be on the beach because we released 20
things in one week but no we wrote
another jQuery plug-in instead so I'm
it's really hard to hire a JavaScript
developer I guess all of you can attest
to that the people who are hiring
because after people that come in say
like they know JavaScript and they only
know jQuery because for them it's the
same thing it's not it's an abstraction
layer it's a different syntax you do if
you don't even know what the thing does
then you're not a developer you're just
an application person that builds
something in hopes everything works and
we do the same with less and less and
sass
yes CSS doesn't have to stuff we want to
but we need to make CSS working group we
need to force them to do it and to make
it a standard rather than like make our
own a meta syntax that is interesting
and unless we're bored and we don't do
it anymore so I don't want to have a
product in five years time where I have
to look at it and find like six
different pre-processors that are not in
use anymore and I don't know how to get
around them with a standard I could
still say okay I know I understand this
I can do this so I get excited about
abstracting problems away but we're
lying to ourselves if we keep
abstracting away from the main problem
that CSS itself is not good enough yet
and yes it is a long process to get
things through the w3c but if you want
to have a job in the future that gives
you code that is predictable that's the
only way of doing it I think I've always
done that and I think we should do it as
well is think of escalators if you build
a anything on the web
think of an escalator an escalator is an
awesome thing this is in London at angel
station it's like 90 meters up an
escalator cannot break and a broken-down
escalator is a set of stairs you can
still walk up it's not as convenient but
you're not blocked out a broken down
lift it's a little small room that's
very uncomfortable and doesn't make any
sense
that's why every place would lift also
had to buy boot staircases
to make sure that in case there's a fire
and stuff then you do that I always use
lifts staircases in hotels here and it
cracks me up because you always end up
in the kitchen or some laundry or
something because nobody expects a
staircase to come out at the lounge
because it's like everybody takes the
lift right so progressive enhanced
product products work the same way
something that works is there for
everybody it gets more convenient more
beautiful more engaging for technology
that supports it not for everybody just
almost experience and an experience that
like sorry sucks to be you you have to
upgrade your browser no I can't
I'm on a connection that doesn't allow
me I'm in a company that doesn't allow
me to install another piece of software
so build your software your web apps
your websites as escalators instead of
building them as lifts that actually
have rocket packs on the side and are
beautiful it works they've been working
for a long long time and it's cool to
see them and people use them daily
some people use them stupidly they stand
at the end and look around but that's
just tourists so think about that when
you do it and we should make it that
simple we always get very excited about
our products and like are lots of little
tools and lots of little things and you
got to do this step and that step like
this the future of web development just
install nodejs ruby-red East and install
your browser that way set it up that way
you already lost the guy you already
lost the person that wants to do that so
we should be dead simple
you probably heard this morning yeoman
is a good idea it's packaging the whole
thing up to make it much easier to just
say install this for me okay I don't
want to know where it comes from not
sure if I trust it yet and I'm not sure
how much more how much products we will
have in the future they have far too
many things in that we don't need but
it's great that Ari and Google actually
have put these things together another
product is called harp and they're
actually sponsored by web forward which
is our incubator for web open
entrepreneurship and this one uses
Dropbox to actually publish things on
the web and this is pretty cool you know
instead of having to create my manifest
file by hand and submit it to different
places
it's
actually I just put it in a Dropbox and
the rest is generated for me I just have
to concentrate on writing the JavaScript
or CSS and the HTML it's one guy from
Joyent and one guy from PhoneGap that
are doing it at the moment so there's
lots of good stuff coming that way and
Dropbox in general is a really cool
publication tool if you really don't
just want to have something on the web
put a folder inside your public folder
and you got a URL you can even connect
the domain to that if you wanted to same
with github pages don't set up your own
server and never update them again
because we just got enough zombies for
for BOTS that's out there already the
browser has turned from something to
just consume the web into something to
create the web with I mean the developer
tools in every browser out there are
incredible by now there are debugging
tools in most cases but there are also
creation tools I mean you might not know
that but Firefox for example has this
scratch pad and a scratch pair is
actually a little HD a little JavaScript
editor that I can write massively long
Java scripts and test them against a
live site right now and then save them
as a JavaScript file on my hard drive so
it's not just a console back and try one
command at a time I can actually build a
JavaScript in there and when I highlight
the different lines it only executes
those lines at the time you have of
course T and the debugging tools you
have a scratch pad you have a web
console now where the whole browser can
be keyboard controlled which is pretty
cool for somebody like me who would
actually doesn't like mice and stuff
like that and of course we got silly
things as well like like the 3d view
like when you go for example you go to
Facebook supply that out and I say ok
inspect the element that could be
embarrassing we've got a 3d view of the
page and that one shows you the depths
of the Dom and that sometimes a good
idea to test out is my is my website too
complex or not and that just started
that just started as a little little
game thing that we had and it was a
google Summer of Code project and then
we realized actually just makes sense
and it actually is an interesting way to
show people look what you're putting on
the wire every time you actually
load your page so that was not good
because now I'm gonna go back to that
wonderful that's clean ed yeah okay
let's do it up at the side there fair
enough
hooray
stop that sorry about that okay what did
I say about demos earlier let's see that
my demos working all browsers sorted
good developer tools in all the
browser's of course it doesn't work in
for in Chrome what we're almost there
okay good so browser consumption and
creation
these tools are input and output and I
think it's very important to get people
excited about this we have this web
maker project where we talk to
journalists and we talk to people who
don't know about the web to build their
first websites and we do all of that in
the browser rather than like oh download
this editor and do some other stuff it
actually is already out there
collaboration on the web is a very
important thing I talked about Dropbox
cloud9 IDE which is a full IDE in the
browser in the cloud connecting with
github so you actually could you have
your code online jsbin for for testing
things out jess field as well code panda
pleb tinker io
all of these things are incredible in
the past I had to go to a mailing list
and I had to say oh this is broken
look at my bra look at my server what's
going on there and nowadays are just at
a de jsbin and people collaborate and
edit the thing for me and fix the thing
for me and I get my answer in ten
minutes rather than in an hour and
people complaining that my server is
slow collaboration over the web is a
very very important thing in in Mozilla
we all do everything over etherpad
so our team is my team is like five
people in five time zones so it's
actually not really that easy to
actually meet but we just fill in our
agenda and etherpad beforehand send send
that to each other as a URL and edit it
life during the meetings as well and our
meetings are like this long and not that
long where somebody has to be pointed
out to take notes and things like that
it's a matter of rethinking tooling if
you haven't if you have got an hour of
time look at this talk by Brett Victor
called inventing on principle he
actually built these tools that shows
you how to build a game and you see the
jump here and he's actually tweaking the
jump to say what is the condition to
actually meet that end of level thing by
changing the sprite on the left hand
side and the code changes on the right
hand side so instead of tweaking the
code and having to type in numbers all
the time you make the output the input
because this whole principle is like to
to connect creation and consumption as
close to each other as possible
rather than like having an extra time an
extra step in between where you have to
save loaded in the browser look at it
find what's going on and that way you
can build things while you're playing
them and that's a very very new idea but
a very very good idea and that is
already happening and again I have to
pimp Adobe here because Adobe brackets
is not only the first time that Adobe
does open-source and does it really
really well but it's actually an editor
that eats its own dog food and does
really interesting things so when I look
at this one and this is actually DD
presentation that I have here right now
that I have open so the broken promise
of html5 this one here it doesn't look
much but it has some really cool
features it actually for example I can
connect it to a browser to see the thing
life so when I do changes it changes in
the browser life without having to go to
a browser and do a reload and see the
changes but what I really really like
and maybe make a bit bigger to see that
is when I have anything here on the page
like something with a class called slide
in other editors I now go to my CSS and
try to find the slide class and see
which applies where and what's going on
in dev tools I can actually go into the
browser right click it and I see all
this start the styles that have been
applied so what Adobe did is put the put
the editor inside so I can now press
command + e here and that gives me the
CSS apply it inside the other document
so I have got the HTML document still
open but I have T CSS files that apply
to this element open in a small in
inside editor so I can actually now go
through all of the slaw all of the
elements all of the pay the CSS files
and all the lines in the CSS files that
apply to that so I don't have to jump
between documents anymore I just edit
everything in one editor and that's
something that I haven't seen any other
other editor do and that's a really
really cool little thing that they
thought of so this immediacy of output
and input is already happening and it's
happening in an open source text editor
by Adobe and who would have thought that
a good year ago another thing that is
absolutely necessary is prototyping
extended next to HTM
now html5 is great but what we did with
the forms for example sucks like they're
not quite there yet the color picker
doesn't work the date picker is weird in
like Safari and some other browsers
don't do it at all so what we have is a
new proposal called web components web
components allows you to build richer
controls inside the browser based on the
browser itself it's a bit hard to
understand but if you think for example
you put a video element in the page out
of a sudden you've got all these
controls where do they come from what
are they doing they're actually part of
the browser and they're called a shadow
Dom so you can actually edit these in
Chrome Canary and also in the native
Firefox I think and you can see the HTML
that the browser generated under the
hood to have these elements so what web
components do is actually open this up
to end users so you can actually build
web developers you can actually build
your own components natively in the
browser that way and the web components
proposed is only working on Chrome which
is annoying that's why we did X tag and
X tag is actually on Mozilla it's a
JavaScript library that you put in into
the page and it makes the web components
that's great
it makes the web components available
for all the browsers for for IE 9
onwards and that way we can actually
build things like this from markup like
that so instead of having to have
another JavaScript another jQuery
plug-in and jQuery UI plug-in to make
these kind of things we have to natively
in the browser and their performance is
much much better the same way we have a
web game stop and mortar which are just
github repositories to build your first
html5 games that does all the things
that you don't need to know about it's a
very very important step towards a web
that's much much richer because browsers
and the html5 specifications have not
delivered on forms that we want to have
so the time is now and the place is here
is a beautiful book called the last
thing by Sean tan and it has this thing
in there called today's the tomorrow you
expected yesterday we're always like
over to tomorrow a future is awesome the
future is now do it today or don't do it
we can't wait anymore it's like you
cannot lose if you do it
somebody tells you you fix it together
it's totally fine but we have to start
not thinking about the future we have to
start doing it right now and a very
important thing is I think catching them
young we do a lot of stuff with teaching
children about the web and about the
open web and there's lots of cool stuff
going on Mozilla symbol it's this little
tool that allows you to actually build
your first web pages and it's what you
see is what you get editor so you can
say I pick a project make your own
animal make the project that's together
with the London Zoo actually and when
you make the project you're in an editor
and there's an HTML page on the side
that explains to you what to do so how
can I build my my own animal it has
comments in there explaining to you what
to do and it shows the changes
immediately on the other side so if I do
for example the small thing here if I
delete this that it shows the code
life died right now or it doesn't yeah
there we go animals if I if I make an
HTML error it actually highlights the
page in red and explains to me in plain
English what the error is
so that way we teach people by fixing
things and tinkering with other things
rather than like starting from scratch
Udacity does the same with videos code
Kadim e is a great
what-you-see-is-what-you-get way of
learning code change at U is a umbrella
organization to make changes in
education and Khan Academy of course has
changed a lot when it comes in to
education and I really think that
children need to be taught how to think
of what to think and that's what we did
for far too long right now
so that's all I have so thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
