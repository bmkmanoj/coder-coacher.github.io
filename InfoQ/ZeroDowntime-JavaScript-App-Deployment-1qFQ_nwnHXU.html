Valentine JavaScript app deployment but
mainly in the context of rails and ember
yeah so it's in the context of ember and
rails but you know there's no reason
that this can't be used with any other
frameworks really so I it's my name
twitter handle i work at a place called
neo where a design and engineering
consulting company we do Production apps
and prototype absa number so talk to me
about that if you want so this was
originally inspired by Luke Malia works
at yap so I saw his talk at railsconf I
really love the idea but I wanted to so
he used you know rake and stuff like
that which I didn't really want to do
and I wanted to use native tooling for
ember you know things like Amber COI so
you know what I'm going to be talking
about today the idea is similar the only
difference is approach implementation
and I try to sort of experiment and push
its boundaries a little bit so yeah so
why do you care about deploying
JavaScript apps in an easier way so
first of all deploying your back-end
sucks takes real long time you know your
user is going to experience service
interruptions while your app is booting
up you know it just sucks so try to
minimize that if you can and also if
you're doing a lot of amber you know you
know like especially the application
that i was working on you know a few
months ago it was super front of heavy
so most of the changes were making we're
actually just saying JavaScript but
every time we made a change we have to
redeploy the entire app and that just
became a really really annoying
after a while and ember CLI started
becoming super awesome and I wanted to
use that and along with many other set
of tools like groans Bauer and broccoli
and you know if you use other frameworks
you know any kind of yeoman generated
apps as well and also the other thing I
wanted to do was really being able to
develop my front end independent of my
back end you know like I think a lot of
applications nowadays have just having
tart ember app living under the assets
folder you know it's a lot more
convoluted and difficult to manage so
this is the entire idea centers around
having index HTML as the application
container so when a user hits your
server all your server needs to know how
to do is serve that index 2.html and
then you let amber handle routing and
fetching data and all that kind of stuff
and the backend you can develop it
strictly as an API server and then you
know there comes a dedenne Offit's of
being able to develop you know iOS app
on top of it or whatever so that's
always good so this is what the
index.html looks like it's what ember
CLI spits out as you can see it's pretty
clean very manageable and inside of it
it contains all of its related assets
and you can see here that you know
inside of the cloud front CDN URL we
have the deploy key uniquely baked in
and just FYI i'm using a timestamp for
that right now but it could be anything
really so this is the overall
architecture of it you know the
developer can push both to the front end
and the back end when you push through
the back end it goes straight to the
rail server when you push to the front
end you do two things one is you deploy
your index.html to Redis and the other
one is you deploy all your assets to
your s3 server and then you can very
easily draw cloud front in front of that
to make it serve super fast and then
they come together at the browser so
each deploy is going to have a unique
deploy key like I said before and that
can be optionally synced up with a back
end and what that means is basically if
you have a very volatile back end right
so if your API is changing all the time
what you can do is you can actually
hardwired you can hardwire deploy a key
inside if some kind of a yeah mol file
if you want you know really anywhere you
want can even be a constant your app and
then every time you want to you're ready
for advancing to the next stage you can
just change that key where you can just
say latest so that's always going to
serve the latest version the app all the
time which is kind of nice and the other
thing that's kind of cool here is you
can very easily preview your app so as
you can see here I have a query string
here deploy equals canary so what that
means is you always deploy your front
first and you can have your product
owner or product manager take a look at
the app by just going to that URL the
entire app is going to be loaded up
that's going to be the latest version
your user won't know about it and once
the product owner gives you to go ahead
you can then basically have a single
commit that changes that yamo file which
is going to help you serve the latest
version of the app so sorry if you don't
use rails here but you know this is
rails basically all the all the routes
is going to application controller
anywhere you hit and all it needs to
know how to do is deploy indexed HTML
which we can look at a little bit later
so that's coming from that front end
module up on line two and inside of the
front end module we have an index.html
method as you can see the logic is
pretty simple it just figures out what
our key is for Redis don't worry about
namespace right now we'll come back to
it but you know in the else clause you
have the deploy key colon index.html and
then you
rattus will get that for you so
essentially if no key is given when the
user hits the server it's going to read
it from the llamo file if you give it a
specific deployed key it can go to that
and if you give it canary it's going to
give you the latest so that's really all
there is to it so in terms of on the
front end I'm using ember CLI plus grunt
for this big shout out to ember COI
super nice so this is how i deploy
grunts dash prod where Dash P and this
one command do does a few things here so
it first grabs a generates a deploy key
again using the current timestamp right
now and then it builds the project and
then it so basically broccoli takes care
of prepending my CD and URL and stuff
like that and then I'm going to insert a
deploy deploy key into the CDN URL
upload s3 and then I upload index 2.html
to read it and that's what that sorry
this is coffee script if you don't use
that just in case but yeah so the on top
if target is prod those are the ignore
shell done that just spits out some
texts but you know it's really the first
four task there so what this allows us
to do if we push its boundaries a little
bit is allows us to have a multi app
architecture and what that means is
basically having multiple index 2.html
containers that talks to the same back
end so easy example here might be you
know if you're the team that works on
New York Times you can have an ember app
that serves the content for reading and
then you're also going to have
basically like an admin or a CMS app
that is completely separate from your
main app they all talk to the same API
but they don't know each other's
existence at all so yeah so I'm going to
do some diagramming here i have a
JavaScript app and an API server so this
is what that original architecture looks
like the browser hits the index route
the server talks to Redis grabs the app
gives it back to the browser and then if
we have another appt we just nested
under a different name space so as you
can see here on the bottom right the key
becomes admin colon deploy key index
shtml when when the user requests /
admin where this this could also be a
sub-domain really whatever you want so
if you go back to that front end module
you know basically we can optionally
give it a name space and then it just
inserts that namespace is a key to grab
that different index HTML so you know if
you use rails you will know that there
is a thing called rails engine which is
basically a mini app you can plug into
your main application and then what that
allows us to do is encapsulate security
logic serialization routing and
migrations it's really really nice and
then the app can actually live as a gen
off in a completely different github
repo so if we're talking about admin for
example that's really important because
you want to encapsulate all your
security logic inside of a different
place so yeah so this is basically what
that looks like the browser hits the app
it goes to the admins engine and then
the admin engine knows how to grab the
JavaScript application so going back to
that you know we have our regular app
and then we plug that engine into our
main app the engine has access to all of
our main
to the main application to his models
and helper methods and things like that
so he plugs it in very nicely and what's
more interesting here is that we can
have different teams working on
different part of the application right
so it could just be a separation between
ember and your API server or it could be
a separation in terms of an entire
service on the bottom there so you can
have a team that works on it basically
the admin app for arming application and
now I have to just understand what the
main API server does and what is
endpoints are and then you can it can
very easily encapsulate that so yeah so
I'm just going to do a quick demo here
to show you guys what deployment looks
like hopefully I don't mess it up so I
have an appt deploy to Heroku here it's
a it's a new startup called blogger it
just serves awesome blog posts and some
really awesome content and let's see I
wanted to make some changes to the Ember
app so this is ember CLI I'm just going
to change some CSS I don't want to do
anything crazy here and then if I deploy
this
so yeah that's all it takes to deploy
the app so now let's say I go to my
product manager I'm like well we have
this new design I want to see you can
test it with some users you know talk to
the business people and see how they
think so all we have to do is this now
we have the newest version the app and
then anywhere we go that app stays
because it's just amber and once the
product manager gives us the go-ahead we
can go inside so we hit here we have
deployed key we can go in here make a
single commit
and then we can push the Heroku
oh by the way so if you refresh this it
goes to the old version because we don't
have that query string so we deploy this
now if we refresh we have the newest
version the app so it's all hardwired
front and then packet so the other thing
was the admin app so this is the blogger
admin so this is a completely separate
number app as you can see so I'm going
to change something here title 32
zendesk is awesome save and then that
shows up arming up because there is
telling the same API yeah I think that's
it so next so what else this allows us
to do is you know we have the entire
index HTML string before we serve it out
to the user we inject whatever we want
into the app right so you know this
allows us to do stuff like a bee testing
and feature toggling which aisle which
I'll show you you know kind of what i
mean by that so this is one example of a
be testing this is high rise they have
some a/b tests going on right so
marketing page a vs marketing page be
you also have page a versus paige a plus
some more stuff and then you also have
page a with different background images
so yeah how would we do that with what i
was presenting just now so you know same
same diagram here the API server has the
opportunity to inject there is variables
into the app before it serves it out to
the browser and so that's what that line
is so I have a module here called HTML
handler and I call insert flags I can
insert whatever I want in it not going
to show you the app I mean I'm not going
to show you the code but you can look at
it on the repo which I'll show you later
so what comes out is basically this on
the top of the
tag we have a window dot end and then I
have various you know flags in there you
can do other things as well like Colonel
user ID analytics params really anything
so with the back end is responsible for
is the injection and randomization of
data and then the front end decides what
to do with that data so inside of Ember
I have a service called feature manager
and what that's responsible is that it
translates data into semantic
information the application can
understand so you know like i was
showing before I have a or b right but
what does that mean to my app so what
that means is a is I'm catering this to
marketers right B is I'm catering this
to educators and based on those logic I
inject this into my controller so i
actually have will have access to that
in my template in my controller and then
I can do whatever I want with that so in
the example of page a versus paige a
with something more inserted right it's
just a simple if clause in our templates
and then other than that you you know
you have other stuff like future otago's
like show pony or national pony and
things like that so the logic around the
a/b test can live either in the
controller right so here I have page
header so if it is marketer then I'm
going to say this blog is for marketers
otherwise this blog is for educators in
my template I can just refer to that
directly or I can have this in my
template where I say you know if show
pony i'm going to show pony otherwise
not going to show that and then you know
with analytics you can independently
track each variation very easily
using things like Mixpanel we're heap
and then you can show some business
results hopefully so i'm going to show
you what what i mean by that as well so
i actually have a be testing in here
right now so I don't have any super
complicated logic I just have a random
like it's either A or B randomly so
right now in this case I'm I'm guessing
that if it's a marketer they like the
fact that there is a Wikipedia
definition of what marketing is and then
I'm saying hey marketers and I have a
chat plugin here say if they want to
chat but if I go refresh again I didn't
make any changes to my code now as an
educator as you can see I don't have
definition of education on there and I
don't have a chat app so you know you
can really do anything you want here
it's pretty simple and then now let's
say we wanted to toggle on show pony I
don't have any logic here but you know
there's a lot of gems that help you do
that but we just say true
and of course you can build a UI on top
of this if you want
come on
this is why back and sucks so slow
now if we refresh
the pony shows up so yeah so that's been
toggled cool that's it so I have a
sample app here on this github repo if
you want to check it out so yeah thank
you guys there's my contact info if you
want to ask questions and again this is
pretty customizable for the most part
grunts is really customizable and
there's no reason that you can't use
this for really any kind of frameworks
yeah cool thank you yeah good question
it's nice to serve it out of the same
background because you're then you don't
have to deal with course oh but are you
you're talking about reading it from
cloud front we can yeah it's up to you
you can read it from anywhere just a
strain
yeah so from my understanding again like
I'm not super familiar with grunt but
it's good for running sort of like
random tasks right broccoli I think is
good for dealing with assets compilation
and stuff like that so I i do use
broccoli inside of ember CLI but I I'd
love to explore if I can do it all in
broccoli I would again and the other
thing is that there are a lot of plugins
for grants built in already so I
wouldn't have to write anything from
scratch which is super nice
yes i'm actually using the rails api gem
but yeah yeah so I yeah I do use that
but you know you can you can serve out
your API whatever way you want I do like
the serializer in the sense that I can
have a different serializer for my admin
engine and basically for my admin app
you know I can I can vary granularly
control what data is passed back and
forth and what's allowed in terms of
like editing updating and deleting
things like that all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
