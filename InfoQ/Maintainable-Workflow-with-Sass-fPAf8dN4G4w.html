I care a lot about which is about
process is by Nate fortin's as a
fractured process makes for a fractured
user experience I feel that even if
you're not a user experience designer
maybe your developer or a copywriter or
even a project manager we're all working
towards a user experience and your
process is fractured then it's likely
your UX is going to be fractured as well
so I think the old way a lot of people
used to think about the web was to
create pages and that's definitely an
outdated way to think about things it's
all about creating systems there's
another quote by Paul Sappho that says
it used to be that designers made an
object and walked away today the
emphasis must shift to designing the
entire life cycle I think this is pretty
important it's not just about the visual
final product it's you know all the all
the steps along the way as well it's
kind why I'm really into sass and some
of the things I'm about to talk about
today so who is using CSS preprocessors
right now almost all of you that's cool
okay who's not just a few of you okay so
I'm just gonna briefly tell you about
why they're awesome and why you should
be using them the whole idea behind them
is you have a language that you write
and it gets compiled to CSS the whole
reason that these exists is to help you
do dry development and the idea behind
dry developments you don't repeat
yourself standard standard CSS you tend
to have a lot of like repetition and so
CSS pre-processing helps you avoid that
it also helps enable smarter patterns
and proportions
especially with a lot of the operators
and things that sass gives you which
I'll go into a little bit later and it
also makes things easier to maintain
that's really important to me I I want
not only my CSS to be maintainable but I
want my UX be maintainable so I feel
that sass kind of helps enable that a
little easier so the 3 molar like common
I guess a CSS preprocessors sass lesson
stylist the one I'm most familiar with
and the one I use is sass so that's what
I'm gonna be focusing on a lot of the
the concepts and ideas translate over to
less and stylist with a couple
exceptions here they're which I'll point
out but for the most part if you're
using less or if you're using stylus you
know the ideas are the same so this is
the sass website it's not so pretty but
it's got a lot of information on there
for you but it's kind of hard to digest
and so I'll kind of walk you through
some of the basics there's also a
library called compass that you can
optionally use on top of sass which
gives you a lot of extra good stuff so
if you're already using sass but you're
not using compass I highly recommend you
use compass so I am curious of those
that are using sass he was using the
original syntax the whitespace indented
syntax just a few of you and he's using
as CSS syntax which is the newer one
okay some of you that might be thinking
about using cents might be wondering
which one is the right one for you so if
you like your code to look like CSS but
you just want to add on like the extra
features then you definitely want to be
writing as CSS this is when I personally
prefer in my personal projects any CSS
file will validate as an S CSS file it's
basically like an extension of CSS
however and here's what that kind of
looks like you got your curly
races got your semicolons but you get
extra stuff like mix-ins and things
which I'll go a little more into later
however if you prefer writing very terse
minimal code and you don't want to write
curly braces you don't want to write
semicolons and you like the Python style
like indented syntax and sass is the
syntax for you and this is actually what
we use at work so I kind of live in both
lands and so this is that same mixin but
a lot smaller and instead of writing out
mixin you get these character shortcuts
the equal sign and the plus most of my
slides are going to be an SCS or scss
unless I'm showing stuff from work in
which case they'll be an SS so hopefully
that doesn't confuse anyone this is just
something I like to throw in because I
see it a lot on Twitter its sass with
the lowercase a SS it's not all caps so
just in case you want to feel really
smart about talking about sass now you
know there's a lot of common
misconceptions about CSS preprocessors
and sass and I just want to kind of show
how those are wrong some people think
like oh I don't want to use the command
line but you don't have to I'm from a
design background I'm trying to avoid
the command line I don't cause but I do
have to use it occasionally but for sass
like just to get it up and running I use
a an app to do it and so it's not
necessary but it is there in case you do
like the command line some people feel
like they don't want to learn Ruby you
don't have to learn Ruby it does use
Ruby right now they are working on you
know a new version that is I think it's
in C and it's gonna let it be translated
to Python and all these other different
languages right now it is a ruby thing
but you don't have to know Ruby to use
it so this is one of the popular apps in
case you want to use an app it's called
live reload the
works with CoffeeScript it works with
less it works with all sorts of
different stuff it also makes sure if
you're coding every time you save your
browser will automatically reload so you
don't have to kind of pop back and forth
and refresh refresh refresh it's pretty
cool another one which is more popular
with with design people because it's
really pretty
is code kit and it does pretty much the
same thing it has some other extra stuff
like it'll actually compress images and
it just kind of is a nicer way to
visualize it
there's also compass app which I think
Farouk uses he was in here a second ago
it's kind of like the official compass
app it just works with sass it doesn't
work with less and everything else so
there's definitely that one if you want
to use the official thing and there's
also Scout which I used to use before I
started using live reload this one was
pretty awesome when I was kind of
getting started out because you know
again I don't really work well with the
command line so it's nice to kind of
just launch this up you tell it where
your files are and it just does all the
watching and everything for you there's
actually a log tab which gives you
pretty much the same output that you
would see in terminal of like any errors
and things so I still get that stuff too
so and there's because it's an air app
it's not just for the Mac there's also
some of these so some of these responses
I actually got from when I did a survey
about sass and CSS preprocessors so
these are actually real things people
said and one of the things that I
thought was kind of funny is like well I
want my CSS that's on my website to be
really formatted pretty and indented and
with lots of pretty comments and ASCII
characters and everything and the thing
is you should be compressing your CSS
anyway so that's kind of not really a
valid argument so I just kind of tell
people that's a silly ru to have there's
also the idea of like having to learn a
whole new thing
that's not necessarily the case if you
are using scss or less it's the same
exact syntax you're just adding on new
things but it's not like an entire new
thing and then for the SAS syntax and
stylists yeah it's a little different
but it's not really that much different
it's pretty easy to learn so this one I
thought was funny it was though the
person I hire might not know it so don't
hire that person by the way I feel is
like if you have like a skill set that
you require your people to have why
would you hire someone that doesn't have
that skill set I feel like this is an
important skill to have especially
because you know a lot of the features
and CSS pre-processing are being put and
put into CSS so I I just think it's a
silly way to think about it this one I
thought was really funny it's like what
was it importing files and CSS bad and I
think it's just kind of a funny thing
like yeah if you're doing it in
straight-up CSS you are pulling in
multiple files and those are each calls
to the server but with sass it's
actually all getting compiled into one
final CSS file so no it's not so yeah
just to show like with normal CSS you
have the main CSS file and then the to
your importing that's three files but
with sass this is all just one file so
sass benefits so this was actually one
of the first things I started just
trying out when I first got into fast
and it was just like nesting I I don't
like writing things over and over again
and so if you look on the right like if
you type an unordered list for the class
of items and you have an anchor and then
you're styling different types of that
anchor you tend to write that selector
out over and over and over again the
nesting is really awesome because you
just write it once there's also the idea
of a parent selector which is the
ampersand and the great thing about that
is it just tacks on to whatever is the
most immediate parent and you can also
nest the
parent selector inside of things so in
this case if you're using like html5
boilerplate you know how it does those
like ie classes that you can use the
style things to override you can keep
everything together by just writing I II
- six ampersand and what's what it spits
out is everything inside that ia six
this is also helpful if you're using
moderniser you know it's got all those
like classes it generates it can use the
style things you can keep everything
together which is really nice you can
also nest media queries so that can be
pretty helpful if you're owning maybe
you're just overriding one thing rather
than tacking it all at the end or having
this whole separate file maybe it makes
more sense to keep it all together
so it's cool that you get to nest that
and it'll reverse it for you in the
output once I guess less known thing
that you can do is you can nest
properties so if you're writing a style
for your borders and then maybe you're
changing the color of the top and
turning off the left border you don't
have to write border over and over again
you can just write border once and then
whatever comes after the - can just be
nested inside so that's not like a super
useful thing but it can be helpful at
times so variables are what really
really made me embrace fast at first I
was reluctant to use it was one of those
designers is like oh I can write my CSS
I don't need a CSS preprocessor and then
I started using variables and I realized
I was really really wrong about that
it's really awesome that I can just have
one spot where my colors and maybe my
type is like set at certain sizes and I
want to use consistent sizing everywhere
variables give you that and then mix-ins
and extend are things I I kind of took
on after that the thing I really love
about mix-ins is you can pass things
through them
like arguments to them so maybe you have
I could consistent padding for your
boxes and so you just make this mixin so
you make it really easy to get the
proper spacing but then for a certain
box you want to override that this might
not be an really good example of that
but if you imagine like more more
detailed mix ins that you might be
writing maybe you want to take on all
the same things but like one or two
things are different you can pass that
through with the parentheses and
override it so that's particularly
helpful if you're using it for like
border radiuses or box shadows and
things like that so the problem with mix
ins however is that block of code gets
printed over and over again that's
actually one of the big problems I have
with less and why I prefer sass is every
time you call upon a mixin that's being
printed in your CSS again so the idea of
extend was born from that problem
so what sass does is lets you extend on
a selector so in this case like maybe
you have a div called message and it's
like this nice fancy message styling and
then maybe you have another one that's
called error and it looks almost like
message but maybe the background color
is different or maybe has a different
icon in the older way we would probably
do that is we might write in our HTML
message space error so we have two
classes so the idea of extent is the fun
way to not have to use two classes you
can just use the one and so you can have
alert extend upon message and what that
will do is instead of printing those
Styles again it'll tack it on with a
comma so it shares those styles the
other thing to keep in mind is like
every time you call upon message and
it's gonna tack it on to there so if you
have a dot message dot alert
now you're gonna have a dot error alert
but this is really helpful in keeping
your CSS a lot cleaner however the the
problem with that is like sometimes
people are making these placeholder
classes just to be extended upon so like
maybe you have a class of clearfix you
don't actually ever use clearfix in your
HTML but you have it in your sass so
that you can extend upon it every time
you need it but now with that class of
clear fixes being out put in your CSS so
the idea of placeholder selectors just
recently came out in the new sass
version and these are really really
awesome so instead of a class these are
like silent classes and so instead of a
dot you would use a percentage sign so
this is really awesome for grid systems
maybe you're using the popular 960 grid
system and right now your CSS would
output thread one good two good three
good for or maybe you're not using all
of those if you make them into silent
classes they're only going to be
extended upon they're never going to
show up in your output and all the
placeholder selectors you might have
widths for that aren't being used those
won't ever get output either because
they're not being used yet so this is
like a huge huge win for for sass if
you're not using sass you should be
using sass this one I really like
especially for design I like to design
in the browser
I hardly pull up Photoshop these days
anymore and just do everything in CSS
because CSS has become really powerful
these days and one of the things I used
to get frustrated with is maybe I need a
darker version of a blue that I'm using
or maybe I need to just kind of saturate
it a little more I'd always have to load
up Photoshop just to do that thing but
with sass I can let it do that for me so
it's kind of awesome and this is just a
small list of what is available there's
a huge amount of things you can do to
your colors I'm just mixing them
adjusting them spinning like saturating
them there's so much you can do there
was this cool tool that just came out
recently that's pretty rad if you're
just designing the browser and don't
want to pull up Photoshop called sass me
and it lets you visualize
is that so you put in your input color
and kind of tell it like I want it to be
10% darker or I want to saturate it more
and it'll show you what that color is
going to be so pretty helpful that's I
don't know if you can see the URL but
you know I'll tell you where the slides
are later so this is a simple one but
but worth mentioning the commenting
options if you write a multi-line
comment that's gonna get output in your
CSS unless of course you're compressing
it and then if you what sass gives you
is the idea of that's really hard to see
I'm sorry guys
like I said the slide I will tell you
where you can get the slides later so
you can look at this I'm sorry yeah if I
was live coding I would do it right now
but I'm sorry about that
but fast gives you our single line
comments and these are always hidden
from your output so it's kind of nice if
you're developing and you don't want
certain comments to appear in your
output even in dev mode you can just use
a single line comment one thing I forgot
to put here is there is a way like maybe
you're compressing your CSS but you want
your comments to be in the output
regardless like maybe it's a copyright
statement you can actually override the
the comment compression by using a
multi-line comment and after the
asterisks at a exclamation mark and
that'll force that comment to output in
your CSS so if you care about copyright
statements and stuff there you go
so operations are pretty rad because I
typically do this a lot with like
generating grid systems or generating
font sizes
I'd like to have a base font size and
rather than doing the math to figure out
like a rhythm for the other font sizing
I want I can use SAS to figure that out
for me this is particularly helpful if
you're using REM sizing instead of
relative sizing you can kind of write
like this mixin that does like the
operations for you and say you only
write maybe it's a base of 16 pixels but
you don't want to write 1.6 for M like
you can have it do the operations for
you so functions are awesome there gosh
yeah sorry about the darkness anyway
functions are really awesome because you
can do a lot of really powerful stuff
for example let's say you have a bunch
of images that are prefixed with the
same name in the file name and you don't
want to write out like what all those
images are you can use at each and then
write those out so in this case I wrote
one for red and for blue and then you
write the rule for it and where those
would get passed through so in your
output it writes all that out for you
and you don't have to write that over
and over and over again
there's also conditionals so you know
your standard if else or if else and
else so if you're writing really complex
functions this is really handy because
you can you know conditionally style
things differently based on what context
you're in let's what's you fast yo the
other cool thing I really like about
sass is it's hard to mess up because it
gives you a pretty verbose seg error
and tells you what line it comes from
and this is really handy I also wanted
to mention that if you're using the
development mode of compilation you'll
actually get really detailed line
numbers in which file things come from
so a lot of people get concerned about
like well if these are all getting
compiled into one final CSS how do i D
bug that just turn on development mode
and it'll tell you exactly like where
that rule came from which line number
which file and I think there's actually
some tools that can put it like if
you're using Firebug I think there's one
called fire sass that will actually put
it in your debugger so so I think um
style guides are really awesome who's
working on a style guide with the app
that they're working on just a few of
you so style guides and CSS
preprocessors combined I think are
really really super rad and really help
your workflow a long time ago I wrote an
article about style guides for
interfaces called writing an interface
style guide back then I was kind of
thinking of it more in terms of just
like branding and writing styles and
some development standards and things
but they weren't they still weren't
truly like living style guides and the
whole point of having documentation is
that it needs to be current and useful
if it's not current and useful then
there's it just shouldn't even exist
it's it's silly it's got to be current
useful so when I first started working
at Engine Yard a while back I documented
my what my process was of a learning
fast for the first time but be also
trying to refactor everything and
document everything so if you're curious
about what that process was like for me
feel free to read the article on it
since then my process has changed a lot
but it's kind of fun to go back and read
but some of the things I point out
that like I find is for people that
maybe are just getting started out with
this is to start small because if you
try to take on too much then you get
overwhelmed and I don't know how many
times I've worked with companies where
we start like this giant refactor and it
never really gets done because we just
try to do it all in one one go and we
end up now having like old stuff and new
stuff and it never really works out so I
decided to just iterate slowly on this
refactor and so I started with the
variables and then the mix-ins and then
I started getting into the more advanced
stuff I should note that it's a good
idea to sketch out like the architecture
that you want to do for sass I know
people do it for other things but I
think it's good to do it for sass too
because then you I mean it's easy to
just jump right in and then realize you
maybe didn't go the right path that you
should have taken so I highly recommend
that and it's super important to stay
organized really really important it's
easy to think like I'll just throw this
here for now and I'll get back to it
later no you won't stay organized and I
want to really really stress how
important it is to have clarity and
you're naming things a lot of people
like to be really brief and like to
abbreviate things but clarity is
incredibly important and so when I was
doing this refactor at engine yard we
decided that we would have verbose
naming like instead of abbreviating
things we would just write it out
because then everybody knows what it is
everyone you know can whether you're
designer developer whoever you are could
see and know what it is just a side note
I think file organization is also
important as part of the workflow it's
not really a SAS thing it's just a
general workflow thing I like to keep
vendor stuff separate from my stuff I
also like to keep my layout images that
are being brought in through CSS
separate from my content images that are
like you know embedded in the page so
that's I think that's a helpful thing to
mention but again stay organized
one of the things I learned when I first
started writing SAS is that nesting can
really get you in trouble it's really
cool but it also can mess you up
and so my general rule is try not to
nest more than three a deep if your
nesting more than three deep you're
probably doing something wrong I think a
lot of people that try out SAS like they
love that it's like this whole indented
thing and they can read where everything
is and so they kind of write it like the
document model but when you do that it's
creating all those really long selectors
and not only is your CSS actually going
to end up larger than it should be it's
also too specific and things aren't as
modular and reusable as they should be
and so like not only do you want your
code to be where you aren't repeating
yourselves but you want your UI elements
to be reusable and not have to create
them over and over again so keep things
as less specific as possible it makes
sure CSS more useable more maintainable
and cleaner so this was an early version
of the style guide I was working on when
I was at engineered and started kind of
documenting like what all the different
UI elements were and I found out that
this was way better than documenting on
like a wiki or documenting on a PDF file
I actually put the style guide on the
app itself as a page inside the app and
so all the UI elements are rendering
from the exact same code that you're
documenting and so if it's broken here
then you know it's broken in your app
and so it's kind of awesome to do this
because it becomes like a sandbox in a
way where you can start building little
UI elements and see them working in the
code they should be working in while
you're documenting but it also acts as a
form of QA in a way where you can make
sure that all your elements are looking
right the other awesome thing keep in
mind the whole like keep it current and
useful keeping like if you're changing
colors every now and then updating your
color palette is can be really annoying
but if you're using variables for your
colors
and your color power is being generated
from those variables you never have to
update this if you change your link
color your documentation is already
updated like that's really cool
there's a bit a lot of tools that have
come out since that when I was doing
that which I wish I would have had back
then there are actually generators so
this one I like is called style doc Oh
and basically it's it runs on nodejs and
all it does is it looks at your CSS and
it can look at sass and less as well and
it creates the documentation for you
just based on markdown comments there's
a few other ones out there but I felt
like this was the most automated one and
so this is an example of it with Twitter
bootstrap it basically sees the Twitter
bootstrap styles it outputs them on the
right and then on the left it actually
will show you it uses the the comments
to create like what the different
headings are and then it shows you like
the UI element in place so if you don't
want to go through the trouble of making
all of that for like all those pages of
the style guide I definitely recommend
trying out style deco again that's like
my favorite one out of all the ones that
are out there so recently I was working
on the redesign of our website at DU and
I thought it might be fun to just kind
of show you some stuff I did it I don't
know yet if this was the best way to do
it but it at least like to talk about it
because then I can get feedback from
other people and maybe it will also
inspire people to I don't know so the
big thing we wanted to do was have a
foundation of code that worked for a
marketing site but also works for our
web app but they each could kind of have
their own feel or their own brand and so
and we also wanted it to be responsive
so I just wanted to mention like iframes
I know that's like a bad word now
iframes but it's actually pretty helpful
if you're just trying to get a general
sense of how your page is looking in
different sizes it's not an accurate
sense for mobile devices but at least
gives you an idea so that was pretty
helpful like you know I again I guess I
liked his design in the browser so it
was really helpful to do that against
these different wireframes
so the way I set it up is I'm just gonna
have to talk you through it because the
code is really hard to see I start out
with my vendor framework so this is like
compass and there are some additional
compass imports we use there's some
other tools out there like Susy which
are like grid frameworks on top of
compass so this is where I would put
that if I were using that these are like
other people's code that we're using and
then I start with my reset and I don't
like those crazy resets that print out
like this huge list of selectors and one
huge go because it makes debugging a
pain in the butt but it also stomps on
too much so it doesn't really
necessarily need to be stomping on so
personally I just used two things I use
Paul Irish his recommendation to use
border box on all elements it makes your
styling a lot easier it's actually a
better board box model to work with and
he's got it some talk and his article
about it about you know he tests it like
about any speed problems and there
wasn't really any speed problems with it
so I use it if Parsa sees it I'm gonna
use it so I'm using the compass mix in
here so typically with box-sizing you'd
have to write this out for all the
different vendor prefixes so if you use
compass you can actually just include
that mix in for it and it'll write out
all the different vendor prefixes for
you so another reason why you should use
compass it makes it easier and then I
just used the normalized which you can
find an html5 boilerplate you can find
it in boots
like basically everybody's moving
towards this particular reset because it
doesn't do too much it just does what
you need it to do
so I recommend normalize then I start
with dependencies and these are your
variables your mix-ins basically
creating a library of settings and tools
that you can use throughout your CSS but
if you were to compile these on their
own there they won't actually emit any
CSS if they only do so once you use them
that way
it just becomes like this global tool
set that we can use throughout all our
different applications
oh and that would be things like your
your color settings and types of
settings and things like that next I
bring in Foundation and the way I like
to look at it is like in micro formats
they have that acronym posh which means
plain old semantic HTML this is
basically what I'm focusing on at this
point is just styling the content not
thinking about any components or classes
or IDs or anything extra just
straight-up content the cool thing about
this is if you're doing responsive
design it's like you're kind of
designing something for very small
devices right at the get-go and then you
know you can add on from there
so yeah just paragraphs headings basic
stuff so I I have these like this file
that's like a grid file like all the
different sizing I need but again at
this point I'm using placeholder
selectors so it's pretty it's not going
to spit out like a bunch of stuff that I
don't need
I also for helpers I bring in things
like the clear fix you know all the
different like just tools that you might
be using throughout your styling another
really cool thing
that sass 3.2 that like the new sass
introduced is so before you couldn't
pass variables into media queries and
now you can so this is awesome because
you can set up your different
breakpoints like maybe you have one for
iPhone one for tablet one for you know
whatever your different sizes are you
can set those up at the beginning and
then create a mixin where you can pass
those breakpoints through it and then
create a conditional and this there's
this awesome thing that the new sass
came out with cold app content and
basically it's a it's sort of like a
backwards mixin in a way where it's like
you can pass content into that mixin
so in this case if I were to write code
for iPhone it would get passed into that
media queries basically like the content
idea and like rails if you're you know
if you've used rails so the way I I kind
of played around with this one one thing
to note with extend and sass is you have
to extend within the same identical
media query so if you are trying to
extend into a mobile media query it
won't work properly and they did that on
purpose because they it could be
confusing like for sass to know like
where to put these rules and it might
break specificity and and the way it
loads or Cascades so they they
purposefully made it to where you can
only extend into the same identical
media query so for this I created you
know I used a mixin where I could target
iPhone or target tablet or whatever and
then when I made my placeholder
selectors I made them a little bit more
specific so like I I don't like to write
the grid over and over and over again if
I don't need to so if you if you you
know or just sake
styling something on the small device
and on a larger device doesn't need to
be rewritten again then why rewrite it
again and so I like to keep my
placeholder selector specific to the
media queries that they need to go in so
that I can just cascade upwards I'm
really into the start small and add on
larger it's like the whole 320 and up
concept rather than writing for large
displays and over writing for small
because that way smaller devices just
get what they need so this is a common
thing you'll see and like bootstrap or a
lot of other frameworks are out there
but I now start thinking about my
components so these are things like you
know my buttons you know certain forms
read little reusable things that can be
dropped anywhere in the site and it'll
just work there's one I wanted to kind
of tell you about that I think is really
cool call we made what called pop stripe
so on the top of our website we have
this rainbow stripe and this crazy
awesome function creates that rainbow
stripe so basically what I wanted to do
is use CSS gradients to create the
stripe across the top instead of an
image because you know we get fickle we
change the colors sometimes and decide
like we don't like that green anymore so
we might change it and it's just a pain
in the butt to change that image over
and over again for each time so if we
use a gradient basically put the starts
and stops of each color right next to
each other it basically creates a stripe
so I created this mixin for it but it
was very verbose and that it was tied to
eight colors it had to be eight colors
and it was always horizontal and there
was a lot of repetition and just like
setting up like okay now do this color
now they this color
so basically I dropped it into a just on
github and tweeted like hey does anybody
know how this can be better and I got
this awesome response from
Eric a Meyer not the Meyer web Eric
Meyer but the Eric Meyer that did Susie
the framework he gave me this and I just
wanted to share it with you you'll have
to look at the slides later to get it
but basically he made it to where you
can have as many colors as you want it
doesn't matter you can have whichever
direction you want it and it's just like
a lot cleaner and all you have to do to
use it is just include this little mixin
and you know pop in your your colors so
I just thought that was really awesome
and and really my opinion a really
fantastic example of why assess is like
really powerful and awesome because that
would have been a lot like what this
generates is a string of CSS gradients
and you know how annoying it is right
CSS gradients with all the different
prefixes WebKit has two different ones
it's just really hard to do and this
basically will do that for all of those
colors and so what that created was this
little pop stripe and it's flexible so
if you resize the browser the stripes
change size and all just like with that
little that code like it's super
flexible and like anyone can use a
stripes have stripes on your site now
with any colors they want so pretty
awesome I just wanted to share that so
after that I like to do my themes so I
realized after a certain time that font
colors typically are gonna be paired
with background colors and rather than
writing those over and over again I
create these themes that I can use so if
I need a light theme or dark theme at
work we have one called Orangina which
is like this really orange ii poppy one
and it's nice to have those as reusable
themes that you can use throughout your
CSS so I recommend doing that and then I
think about my regions which are like my
header sidebar footer
these are like location based things
they're not like
componentize things so I keep those
separate bringing my print styles I just
use the html5 boilerplate print styles
because I just think they've already
done a lot of good working in there and
then this is just one of those shows
like an interesting thing we're trying
out so I have this section called tools
which is where I'm gonna be putting like
CSS that I specifically use for
developing and debugging so an example
of that is like I have one called show
grid which is basically it creates a CSS
gradient mixin of a grid that overlays
on top of your website so you can line
things up as you're working and it was
just kind of annoying that I had to like
keep commenting it out and then
culminating it back in and then coming
here back out like as I needed it so one
of the helpers I didn't know you could
do this if you change the extension the
dot ER be it'll still work as a sass
file but now you can use Ruby in it and
so then he just like set it up to like
only beyond when we're in development
mode and so now I don't have to switch
it on and off so if you're using Ruby
maybe that's something you might want to
consider as I mentioned before CSS
preprocessors are making CSS better a
lot of the things that are in CSS
pre-processing are already being
discussed in CSS so things like
variables nesting all that stuff is
going to be like real CSS that you can
use so you might as well start using it
right like get ahead of the game so what
else I just wanted to drop a few
resources that I like and that I find
really handy there's this book called
scalable and modular architecture for
CSS and I was really excited when I read
it because I like it was almost
identical to the way I do things so I
feel really confident recommending it
it's this ebook by Jonathan snook and he
gets into the detail just like even like
how to organize your selectors how to
organize your your declarations like all
that stuff so highly recommend reading
it and the cool thing is like it's kind
of like
I don't know if he stopped but I feel
like it's been like this living book
like he's always updating it so you
always and he'll if if you have access
to the book like he will let you know
every time there's an update there's
also a small like responsive I don't
know if you'd call it a framework it's
more like a boiler plate called 320 and
up spy Andy Clark it started out as sort
of like a companion piece to html5
boilerplate and it was a whole start
with mobile small mobile and then work
yourself up words since bootstrap came
out it's now also pulled in some of
those elements so you get some like UI
elements like buttons and things like
that it was written in less and so I
ported it over to sass and now that's
part of the repo so if you want to use
it there's a SAS version and I have four
versions it's like SAS original syntax
SAS with compass and then there's s CSS
syntax and then the CSS with compass you
can choose your own adventure basically
and then I I really like a lot of the
work that's been done and Suzy it's
basically so if you it's like a layer on
top of compass and on top of fast that
does all the math for you and generating
grids and it's really smart because it
has like all the quick and easy mix ins
you can use but it also has a lot of
like if you really want to get advanced
and make your CSS like as clean as
possible it has a lot of powerful
functions and things to do that and so
like all that talk I was talking about
earlier about like passing and
breakpoints and then you know thinking
about different media queries it's
actually done a lot of that work for for
you so I highly recommend checking it
out and also want to mention like if if
you know everybody's talking about
bootstrap there is a SAS version that
you can use if you want to use bootstrap
but you want to actually use SAS I think
it's kind of
bad that I see a lot of people are just
using the out the output stuff and
editing that and I think that's bad like
I'd rather see people editing you know
the sass or less whichever one you pick
version of it instead and then this one
I should just recommend too so I had
this client that I was working with not
too long ago who had a bunch of old
legacy code and then they added
bootstrap the SAS version and then they
were trying to kind of create their own
library and when when you start bringing
in like I mean the the waste the way I'm
not talking bad about bootstrap okay but
the way bootstrap was initially right I
haven't checked out the new version but
there's a lot of repetitive code in it
especially like if you're using
responsive stuff a lot of the grids get
emitted again and that's because they're
using mix-ins instead of extend but this
actually ended up meaning a really
really long long long stylesheet and
what we found out was happening is that
Internet Explorer would just stop after
a certain point I gave it read most of
the CSS and then after a certain I
forget what the line number is or
character count is but it would just
stop and so like half this site wasn't
rendering properly personally I feel
like if you're at that point you're
doing something wrong you should never
be at that point but if you are there's
this tool called bless CSS and what it
does is dynamically splits your CSS
files up so like when I was working with
this client they manually split the
files up but then you have to I call in
the same mix-ins and things over and
over again like because otherwise you
know it's not in the same file anymore
but this lets you just keep everything
in the one file that you're working in
and it'll dynamically split it up for
you so it'll work with IE so if you
haven't tried it yet and you're just a
little afraid just give it a try
I
promise you you're gonna like it I was
almost kicking and screaming I didn't
want to do it and then I now I'm like
evangelizing it so I highly recommend
getting to try I also wanted to mention
that if you're scared because you're
looking at the website and you think
it's really ugly and it I mean it's it's
very text heavy there is a task force
that was recently created and I'm
helping lead that task force and we're
redesigning the SAS website to make it
more awesome and friendlier and more
design friendly but also still developer
friendly so this is the new logo we just
released last week so there's a lot more
that's about to come out soon so wait no
more weird lady on the phone now it's
this so yeah lots of stuff is going to
be coming out soon you can follow team
SAS design on Twitter if you're curious
and just want to see what we're doing
you can also this is sort of outside of
the whole task force theme but like I
like the hash tag team SAS because you
see a lot of people just like
evangelizing and showing off cool things
and SAS so check out the hash tag
there's also this final quote I want to
leave you with which I really like which
is be regular and orderly in your life
so that you may be violent and original
in your work and that's by gustave
flaubert and i really like this quote
because you know like especially you
know since i started out like an art
school and I just wanted to design my
crazy weird visual stuff but I find like
the more maintainable my stuff is the
more creative expression I get to have
because I don't have to focus on
building as much I can focus on being
creative and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
