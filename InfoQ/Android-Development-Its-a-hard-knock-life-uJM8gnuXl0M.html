life and it's a little bit about kind of
what it's like to be an Android
developer what are things like today and
kind of how we wish things could be in
the future so my name is Michael galpin
I work for blump technologies for a buff
I've worked at ebay both places I've
worked on our Android applications so
I've been fortunate enough to work on
two of the more popular Android apps out
there I'm also the co-author of Android
and practice which is a book that got
published about a month ago it's a book
mint for sort of the advanced Android
development book so if you're into
writing Android and that's what you do
for a living I highly recommended of
course and my name is Jonathan Simon
I've also worked for several large and
small companies right now that work for
a company called all trails which is a
even though I hate that this for that
analogy we're kind of like a yell for
the outdoors so we do listening of
hiking mountain biking trails and sort
of let you find things in the outdoors
I'm also the author of headfirst Android
development which should be coming out
relatively soon I'll keep you guys
posted on how that goes so um just a
little bit about why we're here we've
experienced all of these different
issues being Android developers authors
and working at startups so we wanted to
sort of take the world and you know lots
of people talk about what everything is
going on in the android community and
all the different issues but we kind of
wanted to bring it back down to
realistic personal experience and let
you know what we've experienced
personally and as far as why we're doing
this it's because the users and the
developers and all the people in the
ecosystem of the Android ecosystem are
being harmed by this and we actually
don't like that and we want to fix it so
what we want to do again is just sort of
bring these these stories that we've
experienced and that we know people
who've also experienced and sort of
share them with you and hopefully we'll
get to somewhere where this gets fixed
and so just a couple of these stories
okay first up we wanted to address
designers so I don't know how many if we
have any designers here the one guy okay
if you ask for something like this
basically if you ask for an iphone app
on Android right that's a that's not
going to happen right that is Android a
different platform you should not try to
recreate an iphone app on Android but
unfortunately there are apps out there
like this right so these are all
examples of what I call I phony apps so
that's a sound hound on the on the left
pulse which is a great app words with
friends Square allow these are great
apps that are really useful but they're
all I phony right they all look like
iphone apps they have the name of the
app in the middle maybe they have a back
button on the screen you know they have
these extremely rounded corner buttons
you know these don't look like Android
apps right there is no need to have a
back button in your app if it's an
android app every Android phone has a
has his own back button that users are
used to using you know so you're just
insulting them by putting something on
the screen that they're not going to use
anyways right so so don't don't make
apps like this don't ask for apps like
this there's no such thing as a pork
right it's a it's a different platform
has different UI paradigms you know
trying to pork things all you'll do is
make a poor imitation at best and it
works here that's going to insult but
user and give them something that's hard
them to use right so if you're going to
design for Android learn android you
know embrace the platform right so that
might mean you know giving up your
precious iphone for a while and actually
using an Android device I'm sure you can
survive and get over it but that's what
you really need to do alright so the
actually kind of wanted to talk about
device manufacturers anybody in here
build devices
okay cool so I can talk freely all right
so this is actually my phone i use the
HTC Thunderbolt the verizon phone I
actually really like it there's a lot i
do like about it it's got this kind of
kick stand which seems kind of goofy at
first but actually daily I actually kind
of like it here's the problem though the
USB cords at the bottom right so if
you're you know you can you can rest the
the phone on its side and it rests there
but you actually can't charge it while
its resting now I'm sure there's some
kind of reason you know maybe they built
a dock or something that the hardware
guys thought it made sense to do this
but from a daily practical usage
standpoint it really sucks and it's not
like it it doesn't fundamentally alter
your experience that you can't use the
phone but it's one of these things where
you just look at and you're like man
that was a goofy decision and so you
know we're trying to avoid all these
like iOS versus Android comparisons but
frankly like the the little fruit stand
company in cupertino would not do
something like this and so you know we
as members of the device community we
also can't do this so hardware is part
of it right but one of the cool things
about Android is that it's all open
source so if you're going to manufacture
device you can get all the source code
and then you can change it and you can
do lots of things maybe you can add
stuff to it and then whatever you do you
can put on your device so that sounds
really good in principle but there's a
lot of things within Android that are
the the OS offers up ap is that the
actual manufacturers have to implement
right so some examples this is the
camera another example of this is
contacts the address book on the phone
and then even more hardware things like
accelerometers and and whatnot so if you
do these things poorly it makes it makes
my life very difficult as a developer
right so I singled out HTC here because
they have a kind of a checkered past
here of you know not really holding to
the contracts of Android right so
if you use a HTC phone and it's a if an
app uses the camera app on the HTC phone
the way that it stores the the picture
essays is non-standard it's not like how
all the other you know devices out there
do it if CC wants do it a little bit
different you know and that may seem ok
ok well I can deal with everybody else
and HTC but obviously if every device
maker does this it doesn't bode well for
developers yeah so we don't want to just
rag on HTC right so this is the motorola
droid pro if i'm not mistaken my wife
had this phone it was our first android
phone it was kind of cool i had a you
know hardware keyboard it looked like he
was doing kind of good things the only
issue is that it's using motoblur which
is a forked entire version of the
android and it had some pretty serious
bugs especially on this particular
device to where you know turning off the
alarm in the morning would actually
crash the phone little things like this
which are actually a huge deal so you
know getting back to the overall points
no goofy hardware right so like the HTC
little kickstand thing if you're going
to put plugs in places whatever you're
doing with the hardware make sure it's
it's decent as michael saying make sure
the api behavior is consistent because
again what's going to happen if it's not
is that someone's going to have nexus
one or you know whatever droid they have
they're going to test it they're going
to think their app works are going to
put it out in the market it's going to
crash so it gives kind of everybody in
the hole in Android ecosystem of bad
experience the users are upset you're
upset because you're getting bad reviews
you know everybody loses and you know as
far as you know the the motoblur and the
HTC Sense and all this other kind of
stuff preferably I think most of the
people that i know would prefer android
not be forked google spends a lot of
time trying to make sure that the OS
user experiences is pretty good and if
it's going to be improved that should be
improved for everybody I think we're all
going to buy go to hardware if the
hardware is good it doesn't need to have
a custom version of Android and
especially if you do fork don't
introduce bugs and make sure that the
actual fort works so this is actually
kind of a big problem that I hope does
get fixed
yeah so kind of the the partners in
crime for the device manufacturers or
carriers right so carriers they don't
just sell the phones for the device
makers they actually are able to
customize them quite a bit themselves
and I remember when the HTC evo came out
it's about a year and a half ago now and
I open up the phone and this is what I
saw right this is the the app drawer and
there are all these apps on here like
this sprint navigation sprint TV sprint
zone there was an NFL app on here there
was a nascar app on here I thought well
these are silly but ok so a sprint they
wanted to give me some extra stuff for
free how nice of them but I don't really
not a NASCAR fan personally maybe I'll
just go and uninstall but no that didn't
work the apps could not be removed and
it's not just sprint this is from a
verizon phone right and they put
blockbuster apps all kinds of you know
verizon stuff on here and you can't
uninstall any of these things right so
they just take up all the space in your
device you know and they may not do
anything you even care about it all and
then you can't even uninstall them right
so just don't do this right you know
don't don't put crap on phones that
nobody wants or if you're going to do it
let people remove stuff fortunately
Google actually has addressed this
recently they announced last week as
part of ice cream sandwich that you can
disable any app on your phone so even if
the carrier's put an app on there that
you can't uninstall you can neuter it
essentially make it where I can't do
anything it can't then particularly you
can't watch in the background and you
know download things you know
anticipating you're going to want to
find out about the latest NASCAR race so
that kind of helps you know at least you
know it mitigates the problem slightly
but but this is really a bad experience
for users to even do this at all right
and some of the some of the
manufacturers have gotten better about
the
sprint in particular later on released
an update to the evo where you could
remove all the spring apps also don't
put lockdown on devices right so you
know in some cases you know 18 p howell
devices out for a while where they would
not allow third-party apps to be
installed right so that need for example
people cannot put the amazon appstore on
their phone so you know don't do that
people choose android for a reason right
it's an open platform doing things like
locking down the device you know it's
just completely against the whole idea
of the Android right and then obviously
these guys control the operating system
updates right so one of the good things
about Android is that OS updates come
over the air you know there's no need to
plug it into your computer talisman of
your computer run these software in the
computer you know you get it update over
the air you know you click a button and
you know a few minutes later it's
installed and your phone's restarted and
got a new version of the OS but because
it comes with the air we have to rely on
the carrier's to get these updates out
in a timely manner so yeah so I gotta
kind of tread lightly here because I do
enjoy my job and I want to continue to
work in the area so you know we'll talk
about this I'll tread lightly but you
know Google it's they're not the only
player here that's why we didn't talk
about them first you know everybody is
involved in this big ecosystem we keep
talking about but I do want to talk
about a few things that I think Google
could help out with so this is a this is
a support email I got about two weeks
ago somebody was having issues they
uninstall the app and couldn't reinstall
so this is addressing the issues with
the actual android market itself not all
the different Android Market's that's
kind of a whole another issue but this
is just saying specifically the market
itself has to work so it you know the
apks the Android packages get downloaded
they get versioned based on the order
that they were downloaded and then they
get installed so something obviously on
this person's phone didn't work so it's
unsure if it was you know part of a bug
in the actual market app or something is
wrong with the device but regardless the
the process of installing an app onto a
device has to be
so we flawless I mean if this breaks
it's the first experience that they're
having with a nap everybody looks bad
nothing I wanted to sort of bring up is
this whole issue with patents I mean
obviously this is in the news all the
time this is a little bit of a chart
just talking about who is in debt to who
with what patents I'm sure you guys have
seen this or versions of it before but I
just want to highlight it here in that
this just needs to be solved I mean the
fact that they're all these patent
issues anyway is kind of ridiculous and
actually to highlight the ridiculousness
take a look at this guy so we all know
about all the patent issues that are
going on people are worried engineers
that I talk to younger engineers are
worried about being involved in Android
development because they don't know
where the future the platform is going
related to these patents they're worried
that you know Google is going to lose a
number of patent lawsuits and all the
sudden Android as a platform isn't going
to exist so right now actually in this
goes beyond Android I actually think the
entire mobile market is suffering
because of this this fight that we have
over software patents that's just a
little bit getting kind of ridiculous so
I'd like to just see this resolved and
we can all kind of get past it now this
is another chart you guys may have seen
on the tubes going around today and
yesterday this is a chart talking about
the the version updates / devices in the
supported update versions of the OS on
the different devices it's a little bit
extreme but what you're seeing by all
the green on top is is the iOS devices
supporting the latest versions of the
iOS operating system and down below
you're seeing a lot of less green on the
Android side in that Android devices
aren't supporting the latest versions of
and roll the devices aren't supporting
the latest version of Android now it the
reason I'm saying it's a little bit
skewed is a number of the devices on the
bottom of this chart are actually
little-used devices there's like the the
motorola cliq and you know the backflip
and some other devices that just didn't
work like the garminfone who know it
actually uses so it's a little bit
skewed but I think it does highlight the
point that we do actually need to make
sure that the later devices or the later
version of the operator is supported on
it as many devices as possible yeah and
as a developer you know this is not that
chart I look at right I have a chart
work that shows what versions of Android
our users are using right so that's a
that's a similar kind of data but it's a
different way to look at it right as
Jonathan mentioned you know some of the
devices list on here didn't sell much at
all right and you know Android being a
free market you know if your motorola
you introduce with device it doesn't
sell at all do you bother investing into
updates that device probably not right
but he have the device that's all really
well like the droid you know or on here
is the the evo then yeah you're going to
invest in those so you know for a
developer's perspective what you see
then is ok you know this percentage of
my users are on this version of the OS
this percentage are on this other
version with a less right and it
actually breaks down pretty nicely like
if i compare this with my iphone
developing brothers at bump they have
about a pretty similar situation that
they're in of what what versions of us
they have to support but it's still very
critical for you know devices to get new
versions the US right that allows you
know developers to move forward with new
features in the platform and again this
is something that Google is you know is
trying to address they they made a
statement at Google i/o this year that
you know any you know any new devices
are going to get updates for 18 months
right so but make for a lot more green
on there but again it all depends on
what devices you you choose there so
just in summary the the markets got to
be really solid right but we had a we
had a case at bump where we didn't
update to bump and if you looked on the
android market through your web browser
it did not show the update if you look
on it through your phone it did show the
update but still that was pretty
frustrating and we went several days
where we didn't see the update there on
the on the android market you know so
the android market is you know basically
your marketing arm of your company right
it's where people first see about your
appt read about your app
you know so it's got to be really
reliable or otherwise it's gonna be
really hard for you to reach customers
so that's got to work really well and
you know the whole patent wars business
that's got to get resolved you know to
truly let really give that out of the
way for developers speaking of
developers so i think we probably have a
few developers in the room as well right
yeah okay you have to be showing real
friends here yeah right so I want to
talk about you know some of the some of
the patterns we've seen in amongst
developers this kind of just disturbs us
right you know we get a lot of
developers who apply for jobs and they
say oh I've got all these these apps
i've written and they're on the market
and they think they're really badass
because of that right but you know the
apps actually kind of suck you know and
it's really easy to just create an app
and get it out there but doesn't mean
it's any good you know I think for a
while a lot of the you know a lot of the
cool hip developers who you know were
copy paste practitioners you know we're
doing rails development right and then
for a while they all switch to the
iphone because hey that was the new
hotness but now a lot of them are
switching to android and so we're seeing
a lot more of this so um just because
it's it's mobile it's it's a small runs
on a small device does not mean you can
just throw code out there and expect it
to work perfectly right so here's this
guy he's you know through the zone train
thread framework parsers and toolkits
right what happens this guy the same
thing right is yeah a lot of developers
also who maybe they come from a
different kind of background you know
android is java base maybe they've been
doing like enterprise java development
you know they come to Android and they
want to rewrite everything themselves
right you know whatever's there they
don't even bother to learn what's there
they know how to do it better than the
guys at Google do anyways right so they
write all their own stuff
it just becomes a big heaping mess of
code they have to deal with that you
know can often break pretty often to
write so to testing right so you know
you think what's what's what's testing
on your testing your app involve right I
love that are their previous weaker
talked about unit testing because a lot
of folks don't test their apps at all
right they run on their phone they say
oh hey it's great okay submit to the
Android Market ready to go right so you
know again just because you know it's a
mobile it's a mobile app that's not mean
you don't have to test it right it's
like you know all these lessons we've
learned and software engineering over
the years should not be suddenly
forgotten because now we're doing things
for mobile devices right so another
thing I hear a lot about is a
fragmentation right that's a real
popular being in Android world is to
complain about fragmentation people
think oh my god there's you know 350
different Android devices for sale out
there currently I need to I have to test
on all these different devices but it's
really not a very fair statement right
if you actually you know spice things up
in some reasonable way like let's say
screen size right what types of screens
you have to deal with there's really
only two that gets you ninety-five
percent of the market right there right
so if you're not familiar with Android
you know they categorize rises by the
size inches in the pixel density right
there's really only two variations that
are very popular at all so if you've
tested on those two variations you're in
pretty good shape just to compare on the
the iphone side you have everything's
the same size but you again you have to
deal with two different pixel densities
right so you want up with basically two
variations as well right does it have a
Retina display or not so really any
different so I don't want to hear you
bitch about it yeah so
I mentioned earlier about people you
know moving the Android not really
thinking about you know the you know
what's involved with the Android
programming right so here's a guy
thinking he's going to make his App
really fast by you know putting all the
bitmaps all the images into a hashmap to
cash them right and what's going to
happen there right is uh his apps going
to freeze up right so again there's a
lot of developers who don't realize okay
I'm developing for a mobile device there
are certain constraints I need to deal
with right one of the big constraints
100 especially is memory you know every
Android app gets capped out at a certain
amount of memory usually between 12 and
20 megabytes total right that's all
you've got so you know make sure you
understand the constraints of the
environment you're in it's not like
writing Java for a server yeah so you
know as far as what Michael was saying
about engineering I do sometimes feel
like in the mobile world we're in
somewhat of a time-space continuum where
all the lessons that we've learned about
software engineering over the last 50 or
60 years just sort of vaporized and
people think that just because we're on
a small device with with a kind of a
limited set you know I we don't really
need to worry about this kind of stuff
you know all this unit testing is just
kind of out the door and all the lessons
that we've learned in the past building
these large-scale systems that we've
developed over the years just kind of
get thrown away so testing is really
important as far as testing goes another
thing is there's there's different
strategies for testing and all the need
to be employed so it's not really just
testing on your phone and other people's
phones which is extremely important but
you know automated testing is extremely
important then there's also dealing with
the specific devices so as much as the
screen size thing isn't important we did
talk a little bit earlier about the
differences between the contact lists on
the HTC Sense and the motoblur and all
these different forks of Android nose
are important to test on so you know
there's different strategies for that
there's you test which is a an
outsourced firm that actually it's it's
actually crowdsource so you can actually
you can get your apt tested on actual
specific devices by real users and get
reports sent back to you there's a
company around here device anywhere
where you can do remote testing on
physical devices so there's different
strategies you can use in
all of them should be used and you know
again like Michael was saying there's
just specific things about Android as
far as the tools that are available they
should all be used and we should just
build good software I can't say this
enough just build good apps yeah okay so
harshal developers a bit right you know
hope everybody understands why it
doesn't think it to you personally but
now here's a more popular target target
right the the business guys or product
managers let's let's make fun of them
right by the way any any any get you
guys here we need to know who we're
making fun all right it's your turn yeah
so a lot of folks these days things like
okay I've got a mobile phone I've got a
smartphone so that makes me qualified to
be a product manager for a smartphone
right I have a smartphone so I know what
smartphone users want you know and so
all they think about when coming up with
requirements for an application is what
they want out of it right so you know
don't be that guy yeah this is a little
bit of us just talking about feature set
so again we need to remember that mobile
devices are constrained devices both in
size and functionality and just form
factor so this is just a quick comic
about from a bike comic that I really
like just talking about the number of
things on these handlebar which is
actually I think a nice metaphor for
mobile devices because you've got a very
small place that you can put all this
different functionality and you really
need to make sure that the functionality
that's on the mobile device is specific
for the tasks that the users trying to
do anything else is really just taking
away instead of adding any benefit
actually just becomes a huge negative so
if you have all these bells and whistles
and your mobile apps you're just
actually confusing your users and making
it a little less useful as a nap this is
a real world example of you know what
happens when this goes awry it doesn't
help you ride this bike at all now the
next thing I kind of want to talk about
is you know there's a culture around all
of this type of development so when I
was developing large-scale enterprise
trading systems on Wall Street back in
the day there's a certain culture around
those types of systems you know very few
users lots of money serious risk
be testing at the same time getting a
release out was just impossible so now
that we're in the Android world and I'm
working around all these different
startups of which we both work for
startups right there's this really
intense need to push releases out all
the time so I used to work in a place
called rocket space was it which is a
shared it's a shared office space where
when you don't have enough money as a
start-up to get your own office you kind
of rent by the desk by the month and I
actually saw something that looked just
like this downstairs so this is like
exactly the problem with the culture of
mobile development and it's actually I'd
say worse on Android a number of
companies that I have worked with or
around I've heard things like well you
know since I don't really have to deal
with the app review process I'm more
willing to put out a buggy Android build
because I know I can fix it really
quickly that's a real problem and that's
something that we just need to get away
from yeah what was the quote about if uh
if you don't have bugs you're not really
using fasted office yeah yeah so just in
summary right you know apps are built
for your users they're not built for you
right I don't care who you are you know
if you can't just think about your own
needs so this applies to designers and
to developers you know executive CEOs
founders investors right think about the
people who are actually going to use
your app first don't this think about
how you would use it you know if one of
your one of your use cases is posting 23
tumblr blogs you built the app for you
not for real people all right keep the
appt concise and focus you know don't
try to throw every feature you can think
of in there just because you can do it
you know and then the the last thing is
not like a supposition here it's a fact
right that an ass quality will reflect
the time and money spent on the app so
when I was in college we had to read a
book called the mythical man month and
if you've you know if you're an engineer
maybe you've read it but if you're
someone who works with software but
you're not an engineer you really should
read it you know because it's it's all
about like you know what's involved in
building software you know it's not like
the building metaphor you might think
okay I can just put more people on
things and expect to get things done
like you would a construction project or
something but it doesn't work that way
right so people need to understand like
what's really involved in building
software and what the constraints are
yeah and just add what just add one
thing here I mean again getting it the
whole difference between this this sort
of time-space continuum I was talking
about I have literally worked with the
same people on these large enterprise
systems and now mobile systems and for
some reason as soon as we got to the
mobile space they forgot about this fact
that they knew this golden triangle
about development quality and time and
all of a sudden now since we're building
mobile apps I work with these guys are
just like what would you we could just
crank this out in two weeks and well the
answer is you can crank something out in
two weeks but the quality is obviously
going to go down that's fine somehow we
understood this when we were building
enterprise apps but we don't understand
this when we're building mobile apps so
there's definitely something a little
bit missing here now just to show you a
little bit about where this is going
we're kind of done talking about you
know our biz dev folks now this is um
this is opposed from Andrew Mayne that i
saw on google+ yesterday through a
couple of friends of mine and there are
some really radical suggestions here he
wrote this post talking about kind of
occupy android based on the Occupy Wall
Street movement I think that's a little
bit extreme but it did get a lot of
people's attention which i think is
actually good but here are some
suggestions that that he had made and i
think the the the extremeness of these
suggestions i think makes basically i
think it really points of the gravity of
the issues that we're bringing up here
so the types of issues that we're
talking about from a from a business
standpoint and also from an engineering
quality standpoint what Google needs to
do and what the device manufacturers
need to do these aren't like bug fixes
these aren't little things that just
need to get fixed in the next minor
release of Android or even the next
major release of Android this isn't even
something Google itself can control
completely right I mean this is
something that all of us are involved in
it's a big it's almost like a
collaborative you know movement that
we're working with on Android everybody
needs to be involved the device
manufacturers have to improve their work
the carrier's need to work with the
device manufacturers to make sure that
the you know latest Android OS is our
out it really is all of us and I think
that again the extremeness of you know
possibly forking out android into a new
company or you know a an open source
Firefox type situation i do think
reflect just how important it is yeah
exactly i mean you know we were
certainly here complaining about things
that bother us but kind of the point is
to show that it's not just us who's
bothered by all these things there's a
lot of other folks too who saying think
of there are some real big problems with
the android community and maybe
something really extreme like these kind
proposals is what would be required to
fix some of the issues so hopefully we
can get a lot of these things fixed
without something quite as extremists
with these proposals so that's kind of
end of our talk so we share with you
some of our you know complaints and
stories but we'd like to hear from you
guys if you want to talk right now or
come up to us later or email us you know
please share with us your pain and what
you what you want change
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
