mentioned physics for physics teachers
and this talk is going to be very much
like that because in order to understand
how will jerk us work you'll first need
to understand the innards of HD one
pipeline so the 1.1 spec was ratified in
june nineteen eighty nine as RFC 2616
now it was specifically designed to
address various issues with caching
persistent connections and so-called
incomplete HTTP 1.1 plement ations
what's intriguing is that despite having
been a standard since 1999 the most
popular web proxy in existence squid
doesn't actually support this
implementation HP fully they're still
working on adding HD 1.1 support and
preliminary support was only introduced
last year so it's amazing how far this
technology has progressed and yet we
still need to keep in mind that many of
the technologies we depend on like
proxies and caches have yet to catch up
so i'll go ahead and briefly go over the
HTTP request response model in the most
basic model the client initiates the
request and the server corresponding
provides a response now what's important
to note is that there is not necessarily
a direct connection between a client and
the server rather it's a chain that
includes a set of intermediaries these
intermediaries can include proxies which
are basically forwarding agents that
rewrite the request in some way and for
it's time recipient gateways which
translate an HTTP message to the
server's underlying protocol something
that can understand in case the server
doesn't understand hgp and finally
tunnels which we can use in order to
translate requests from one end point to
another without the entity having full
knowledge of what its contents are
basically an entity doesn't need to
understand HTTP in order to really
search requests so I'm sure most of you
are familiar with nodejs this is how we
go about with creating a basic HTTP
server in it as you can see every HTTP
connection involves an exchange of
messages between the request between the
client and server or the request in
response so here we've got a simple
handler that for every incoming request
writes a 200 ok response will be talking
about the various response codes later
influence a content type of text plane
and a content length of 13 and the loose
end the actual body along so each GP is
very much an application level protocol
which means that it has to have an
underlying transfer protocol and in the
case of HTTP this transfer protocol is
TCP so this is how it can create a
simple TCP client in node to emulate
something like telnet or neck and now
it's hard to note that node has its own
facilities for retrieving HD here busts
we're just creating a TCP clients so
that we can actually inspect the raw
HTML chase being sent back forth so
requests are initiated by the client and
as you can see there are two lines that
I write to the socket the first one is
Method the URL HD version any headers
which are not specifying and finally the
body which are not specifying here
either as you can see we need to delimit
these various fields with a CRF or a
character turn
a line p character so if we actually run
this code you'll see that it prints out
something like this the first line is
the Sabbath line that contains the
version of the HP a response code and a
human readable reason phrase which
buggers and punchy buggers can use in
order to ascertain what precisely
occurred any headers that are some along
with the message in this case you can
see the content I the content link that
we sent as well as some other headers
that node inserts automatic for us and
then the actual body itself so the body
is optional as I demonstrated in the
previous life and actually needs to be
omitted for certain types of requests
and responses so this is an under the
hood look at what an HTTP message looks
like so there are also various status
codes that HD implements the 100 level
is primarily informational 200 success
is the one that were most familiar with
and 206 in particular is one that will
be looking at in more detail later as it
involves a response for a partial get
request will cover what that means later
as well it don't worry a 300-level
response which means that some further
action is needed by the client and 400
and 500 for various errors either a
client error and there was something
wrong with the requested appliance app
or a server error meaning that the
server can fulfill and apparently ballot
request what's important to keep in mind
is that these are completely extensible
so clients don't need to necessarily
understand the full range of HTTP status
codes they only need to understand five
categories so now now that we look at
status codes let's have a look at HD
headers this is the fully exhaustive
list of HD headers as defined bites back
obviously we're not going to go for all
of them but we are going to look at some
in the general request response and
categories so general headers are
applicable to request and response
messages regardless of the mt being
transferred so for example transfer
encoding can be implemented on either
the request or response it doesn't
matter and the agent I said okay without
accordingly request headers are one
second be sent only on the request
response headers can only be sent on
response and entities apply to a
particular body that would transmit
again regardless of request the response
so this top is going to be about range
dancers and if you notice there's a
confusing bevy of various names if range
range except ranges content type content
length and transfer encoding versus
content encoding we'll go ahead and look
at these in a bit more detail and try to
send a great between them so first up is
encoding which is a prerequisite for
properly supporting partial range of
quests so in this case what let's with
what happens if you omit content-length
recall that when i when i showed you the
example of the HTTP response message we
had a defined content length on it with
a simple body now if you omit that
content length no it will automatically
send a response center called transfer
encoding chunk and as you can see we've
got two additional characters in a body
these characters if you look at them
closely are actually hex size indicators
that indicate the size of a particular
chunk this is a particularly powerful
feature of hg 1 point 1 and node that's
called chunk transfer encoding and we
can verify that those are
Deepak's by looking at the output so for
instance if you keep our scent d + 16
you'll see that it equals 13 which isn't
in the size of the first chunk the
second count is simply a zero white
chocolate notes Anzalone to signify the
end of the response so the heb spec
prohibits mixing transfer encoding
chunked and and defined content length
you cannot see chunks for a response
that already has effects length so once
again node handles this all transparent
for you so you never need to actually
think or a about it no however does not
implement range requests natively but
you can use a third-party library to do
that so we'll be looking at more detail
into how these work behind the scenes
and while you're important to implement
next let's look at content type and
content to coding content type refers to
the media type of the entity itself
whatever is sending the body whereas
content encoding general refers to
something like compression that requires
additional coding also note that
transform coding which I which are
covered before is different than content
encoding transfer encoding is specific
to the server it's me it's known as hot
by hot and it's only meaningful for one
particular any link in that request or
spot chain whereas content encoding is
applicable to the eddie itself and is
end to end in other words it's sent up
from a decline to the server or vice
versa it persists throughout the entire
chain so let's have a look at some of
the next element in the HIV status line
which are methods I'm sure we've all
seen these basic methods at some point
in our careers gabon head are the most
basic of them according to the spec
every single HD server has to support
these at a minimum against
others needs to but get it had are the
absolute minimum again node handles
these trans family for us now gal
requests are interesting they can either
be conditional which she covering this
you know earlier in a report for
caffeine or they can be partial which is
what we'll be talking about with range
requests so both help of capture there's
no need to download data that the client
already house or just doesn't care about
and these mechanisms allow us to
transparent system intact so but
actually sorry that so put indicates a
modification to an existent resource so
unlike posts which is right before it
put refers to your I that's already in
existence and as a result of that this
means that we've put we can actually do
partial uploads as well I'll cover that
montara but that's an interesting
distinction that we see between post and
put so the next time you're reading
about rest api and we're curious about
your post and put post-punk cumson post
refers to some sort of abstract resource
that's going to handle whatever data you
give it whereas put just handles the
exists whatever literally uri they give
it and then there's some more obscure
lunch likes like options which are used
for cross-origin resource sharing of
course there's a w3c spec about that and
trace and connect which are really
obscure and which we're not going to get
into it all because if you only be aware
of by the implementation so we've now
reached our destination of ranges first
of all there are different headers that
are set depending on whether you're
doing a request or response in a request
we need to set the range header or a
different feather
to do a conditional requests remember
just like doing traditional gifts we can
also do conditional partial get requests
so it's interesting that it works out
and then there's Congress ever which are
five deputies or entity and that a
request can actually send if we're
uploading partial contact so again
really useful whereas for response we
can send any number of hires down the
first one is except ranges this is
nearly an advisory header that tells the
client hey I support ranges so you can
feel free to make partial requests and
I'll fulfill them now because this is
advice or Heather servers aren't hard to
send it so you can have a server that
doesn't send an XL range request and a
client will attempt to make requests
anyway and fail or you can have a
misconfigured so that doesn't support
ranges and yet sends down this header
anyway so this header is clearly
advisory and doesn't guarantee support
of anything but it's considered to be
good practice to send along anyway
contact range and content length are
important when you're doing partial and
requests content range in this case
refers to bite so you're extracting a
particular file whereas content-length
refers to the actual size of the chunk
that you're starting these are obviously
required because you cannot be jumped
transfers or partial content except in
one very interesting case that will go
ahead and cover later and then date and
the caching headers are as you'd expect
for every other get request so let's
look at the syntax for the range header
that I requested set up to get the first
500 bites you specify the unit which in
this case is bites the only unit that
specs actually recognize and then a
range of 0 to 4 99 remember that bite
range positions are is your waist and
inclusive so the first time I bites is
by our bikes 04 99 if you want to get
the next 100 bytes just specify next
range so 503
now there's an interesting syntax for
specifying the last 500 bytes for the
first time syndics you can simply omit
the beginning by inc and this is
function as a negative sign basically
your best time that you want to get 500
bites from the end of the file so this
is useful when you don't actually know
the starting by offset or you don't
fully know how large file is and you
will trust this over to take care of
that or you can use the standard syntax
and just omit the ending so say in a
file full of thousand bytes of 10,000 I
silent you can do 9,500 through the end
file so that's applied you can also
specify non-contiguous ranges so you
separate them with commas and we have a
special syntax that provides them and
there is a way that you can configure
the server to handle those and respond
appropriately which we'll talk about
later there is an excellent no library
written by a teaching hawlucha called
range parser that does the handiwork
that does the dirty work of parsing
these ranges for you and giving you back
an array of the different values so you
can go ahead and NPM install that
required in your app and use a poor
person rate requests teachers library is
also used in express and connect which
transparent the Hamptons these Ranger
parts for us so we've looked at the
request side of things with the range of
west center let's look at the content of
each other the syntax is a content range
header can only specify one particular
range sorry you know non-contiguous
Rangers here and it has to contain
absolute my positions it's a lot more
strict which means that we can use a
simple regular expression are set and
I'll show an example of that later so a
Content range is only syntactically
valid if the last five value is less
than the first byte value
can have inverted values or if you give
it a range value that's greater than the
length so for syntactically invalid
content ranges the client if you're
sending down a responsible server the
client ignores the header and any
Content that you send along with it so
it's a really bad idea to send out
malformed headers general with or a run
the risk of your client totally ignoring
everything you've sat down so the syntax
remains the same for retrieving the next
500 bikes for retrieving all except
first 504 glass lens so as you can see
it's a very strict subset of the syntax
use wide range request so there is a
particular air conditioner surf cuts
them down for 16 if the range request is
valid so for invalid range requests the
way of the sermon criticism is only if
it's unsatisfiable so if you give it a
range outside of the actual file size if
you give it a syntactically invalid
range then it gets ignored so HTTP does
implement some nice conditions around
that to help you in case you end up
sending down our request headers there's
also a special type of response with the
asterisk the 416 response that you can
send down if the request
ranges an unsatisfied and again clients
like browsers and the built-in no Jam so
fast module know how to handle this
transparently so you're safe there work
of ever having to worry about this but
it's interesting unless to look at how
this occurs behind the scenes I
mentioned not contiguous ranges earlier
and it's an interesting topic because
what you end up sending down is actually
a meat is actually a mime message with a
content type of multi-part bite ranges
these look like email messages forum
uploads and any other type of multi-part
uploads basically boundaries separated a
boundary delimited string with the
content need to request the data in
between so you can use this for binary
values as an example this is the request
for eight or the RFC 2616 text file
which defines HD 1.1 and there is one
more thing that I'd like to cover I
noticed partial per request I mentioned
earlier that by its nature put rather
the post cannock separate requests so
because the URI reference is the actual
entity that you're modifying rather than
some abstract resource that takes care
of families for you so as a server doses
for these then it just responds to
simple 501 again standard HTTP semantics
but content it uses the contrary chatter
which if you recall is an entity header
that can be set up with either the
request response whenever you have some
kind of body so in node we can actually
use screens and regular Express and
combination of series regular
expressions in order to parse and upload
basically we checked with the request
method if its foot then you look for the
content or each other we done run with a
regular expression for the content
writer as I mentioned because it's so
strict it's it's trivial to write right
XO searches for it if you see it then we
simply pipe the input of the requests
into what
right some targeted great and specify a
start offset as well as flags so the
flags in this case a particular
important hour plus means that we're
opening the file for reading and writing
this is important because if you want to
insert data in the middle of the file
you want to do so without obliterating
the existing file contents which is what
create right student will do by default
or if you have right only mode enabled
so it's very easy to get this toward
node and especially with the power of
streams so finally let's look at some
use cases the very first one is resuming
interrupted downloads if for whatever
reason the download goes wrong your
connection ops whatever your client can
easily pick up on it and this is true as
true for downloading a regular static
HTML pages as it is renowned with media
types which brings me to my next point
and that is retrieving large media files
so if you're familiar with the html5
audio or video element you can actually
it actually uses this behind the scenes
in order to retrieve that body so and
this avoids is having to download
wasteful data that the client will never
eat for instance let's say you're
watching a YouTube video and you want to
skip right in the middle of it your
client doesn't have to retrieve the
first half of the video and waste
bandwidth and waste this cap space in
order to retrieve them it can just make
Ranger press for that particular part
and then buffer it as you continue
watching video the next East case are
download accelerators again you can open
multiple connections in parallel and
then once the file finishes downloading
stitch it together and finally you can
have much more granular
Cashin for which other file types of
downloading so on that note I know that
was a really quick primer we have just a
few minutes left so I'd like to thank
you for your time and turn over any
questions they have okay perfect oh
thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
