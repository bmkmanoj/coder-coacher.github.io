actually used to be like many of you or
right now like students at University of
Hawaii with flounders so my story starts
in court wreck and then I actually had
the opportunity to move for an
internship to Cambridge which actually
really enjoyed had a really good time
over there but it also allowed me to go
to conference in the US and there met
some people from Berkeley so this is
actually where I'm ended up like I've
been here almost for one-and-a-half
years and I have to say it's not that
bad
we were actually sailing like with some
of the people who were sitting in the
audience right now last weekend it was
just amazing on the base so and today I
actually wanted to talk a little bit
more about front-end tools like
everybody has these awesome technologies
I'm playing around a little bit and like
demoing it but like what is the actual
workflow behind it and how do you work
together in a team effectively like I'm
just gonna show five tools in general
and also give some live demos so bear
with me and to me it also feels that you
know a lot of developers are you know
just looking over the shoulder they're
just using a shovel well we actually
have I think we used this word before a
well-oiled machines and I'll try to demo
some of some of them the first one is
actually editor config I don't know is
there anybody here about it before ok no
hands I love this yes
um because it's very recently but it's
actually in jQuery moderniser like two
projects that probably almost everybody
knows so let me give you a very short
demo how it actually works so let me
open my sublime so this is how it looks
like it basically has like a bunch of
configuration settings like some people
likes to use spaces some people like to
use tabs but what this is actually going
to do is make everything automatically
so when you're saving a file it's just
gonna set the right charge set it's
gonna make sure that the end of lines
like if you're on Linux or Windows that
you're using the same thing also
inserting your final newline I don't
know if anybody used get her before and
just saw like please enter like a
newline in there so that's gonna fix it
for you and the thing I actually liked
most about it it's gonna trim your white
spaces because like if somebody gives
you a pull request and you see this ugly
white spaces and you know it just feels
bad that just for that one reason you
need to go back to them so basically
like I have a file in here the pink
things are all just white spaces at the
end and what I'm just gonna sue is like
save files so everything the white
spaces are gone and every single time
you're going to be doing this it's just
gonna work I would highly recommend just
anybody on a project where this more
than just one person just to include
this file next step is live reload so
many of designers and front-end
developers like the usual workflow what
they're doing is you know they have work
in their editor there save this CSS or
the HTML
go to the browser and refresh every
single time and if you're from the
developer and you do that the whole day
like 50 times hundred times that
actually adds up a lot especially if you
think around the whole year
so what live road actually will do is as
soon as you're saving a file it's
automatically gonna refresh in the
browser I'm just showing an Instagram
feed here from Belgium beer and you know
let's just try it out a little bit so
I'm just gonna come at out this line and
as you can see I didn't like tab over to
my browser I just hope my wife actually
works so it seems to be fine so the
background just changed and I'm actually
gonna do one more so this should be the
tag for as you guys USA so some of you
guys should be recognizing some of the
pictures in there I guess um it's just
like that one little extra step but it
definitely adds
after a while it's actually used by big
projects as well but people are taking
this to the next level
so live reload has been there for a
while so what you actually can like
there's a great demo from Polaroid
shareware he's actually when he's saving
it it's life editing the difference
there it's not going to completely
refresh your page just a part that you
changed so that's actually really cool
and the next one is this is actually
built into Chrome right now where you
can just save the file within your
browser you don't need to leave your
browser anymore but personally I still
like my IDE and maybe that will move
into browser soon but that's not
happening that hasn't happened yet it
also works with CoffeeScript sauce or
like any of the other frameworks out
there next up for me is grunt how many
people are familiar with that over heard
about it okay that's more hands okay so
what grunt actually is going to do is
gonna be the JavaScript task runner like
you can run a bunch of tasks in your
command line I think it was mentioned
before by Thomas sitting in the first
row here he mentioned that he was
actually minifying his files like you
can do that just every single time
manually but if you have some kind of
build script that does it for you it's
just way cooler so let me just demo that
a little bit in here as well so we're
gonna maximize this so let's clear this
so let's just run the grunt command what
it's gonna do right now is actually
gonna lint my code which is actually
going to check for errors like if I for
instance like crash the app a little bit
instead and then try to run grunt we're
going to see is Wow okay this is really
clear to me what's actually happening
it's completely broken
you can go back just change it it
actually has more than just the task
that I'm running in here like minifying
or linting it so I would just say test
it out and a nice thing about it is
lately written in JavaScript so if you
already know JavaScript definitely use
this one as well and the next thing that
I sometimes see like looking over the
shoulders for a lot of developers is
that they use an IDE like they use some
kind of text editor but they're not that
familiar with it I just think it's
worthwhile just investigating just like
spending a little bit of time there and
like seeing how you can optimize your
workflow my personal favorite right now
is sublime I switched over from text
made I used webstorm I used VII I just
used a bunch of them but I just want to
get like very familiar with it so a
couple of the things that I like about
it myself is just for instance like
switching over to a file for me that's
just command T and any file that's in
there I can just for instance if I want
to go to my CSS file just command T and
go into it the actual the other thing
that you're seeing in here as well is
like what what is it already is like you
know boxes around it and this is
actually linting my file on the fly this
is a really nice improvement of just
doing it after the build where you're
finding out okay these are the errors
this is gonna do it before like one of
the things that it's actually saying
here is like the universal selector is
known to be slow I'm like okay I know
like this is just CSS for making
representation so I'm not gonna bother
with it that much but the same in
JavaScript like if we screw this one up
the thing that you could see as well is
that little border around it the same
with semicolons in here and I don't know
if you can actually read the message to
them there but it's like yeah saying
missing semicolon so okay and yeah the
last one that I wanted to show off is
the get gutter so this is all versions
but I get a nice thing about here that
you can see on the left hand side is
like these plus symbols of like things
that you added or things that you
actually removed right up next anybody
knows about dot files raise of hands
okay okay okay
just a couple of people and when your
developer front-end developer you're
going to be spending a lot of time here
in the terminal and I can assure you let
you know that's how it actually is and
just is what your IDE I would recommend
a lot of people like spending some time
in there just exploring what it can
actually do so dot files are a list of
files just just as your bash or C file
that are going to do like a lot of
things out of the box just for you so
for instance if I want to go one
directory up instead of seeing I can
just do this and these are just aliases
where I can just go to my projects
folder I and the nice like the nice like
the one that I really like is that
command what does that command is
actually gonna do is you have all these
directories I don't know I hope there's
nothing like shaming in there but I have
all these directories in there and you
know I used to CD into all of them like
every single time which is very annoying
and I have to know the whole path and I
don't know where I'm at but like for
projects like the the presentation I'm
game giving right now actually spent
some time in there so the only thing I
need to do is that show and
automatically is going to go into the
show off directory so these are just a
bunch of things that are really cool
there's a bunch of people this is
actually not so clear on the screen I
guess so there's a bunch of people like
matches and Paul Irish I would
definitely recommend looking at their
files how they do it just copy and paste
them over and also maybe submit back to
them like Paul Irish actually worst one
of mine
it also shows some fancy colors as you
could see in here and actually like
let's look at my dick diff statement
right now this you know you can do
everything in the terminal here and just
see the things that I just changed so
let me switch over again the last one
I'm not actually going to show this one
off but it's coming up more and more and
rales jQuery moderniser big projects are
using this right now Travis CI is an
open-source continuous integration
server so this actually ties in really
well with github so as soon as you make
a pull request it's going to start to
build cinematically it actually has some
integration with grunt so you can like
link all these different tools together
and just like lint the file on the fly
so you don't need to like check out the
code locally check if everything works
check out the build still works you can
do that all for free like on an open
source server now I'm actually gonna
talk a little bit more like to the
students directly about things that I've
just learned on the fly like after my
college just three things that I wanted
to mention is the way I actually got
here in Berkeley is because I had one of
my open-source projects that actually
just took off I made a jQuery plugin and
they were like 15 different developers
all around the world like Japan they
were Chinese websites tweeting about it
and was like what is this Google
Translate okay it's actually good things
are saying so I would just recommend
everybody like open source and the same
with dribble like if you have any
designs if your designer like put them
online share them with people you know
and if you actually do people are going
to get back to you you're gonna make
pull requests for you and maybe even
like maintain like there's two other
maintainer x' on the project that I have
right now they're taking over I'm
totally fine with that and everybody's
doing it for a different reason one of
the guys who actually made a pull
request to me he was like wait just
because of the comments you're giving me
like I learned way more than just in
school in two weeks so for him was
learning for other people it's making
the resume so I would just say it's
right doing it I definitely will get you
further the next thing is like take
initiative actually as the students
we're doing up here like show your
materials show it up front again like
read about it and come outside of your
comfort zone even if you don't like
different presentations or are a little
bit afraid I guess
most developers are just do it try it
out and even just make like the youtube
videos about the cool stuff you're
working on and last but not least be
passionate like really love what you do
if you don't like try something else
there's we're working in the IT business
there's so many different branches that
we can choose from so and with that note
I would say thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
