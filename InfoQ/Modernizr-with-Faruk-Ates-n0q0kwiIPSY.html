moderniser about two years ago we are
currently a team of four volunteers Paul
iris and I were we're both here tonight
we're actually looking for more
volunteers so if people are interested
after this talk come talk to one of us
and we'll chat this talks basically
about moderniser obviously what it is
why you should use it what makes it
awesome and a little bit of history
behind it and we're not going to go into
too much detail both there will be some
code examples so you get a good feel of
like how to use this the best way
possible first gonna start with that you
know what is moderniser well the site
describes it as you know an open-source
JavaScript library that helps you build
the next generation of html5 and css3
powered websites it doesn't really tell
you how to does that but it's it's kind
of the essence with what you know what
this thing does it's open source it
helps you actually start to take
advantage of all these great new
features that browsers are adding to
html5 and or adding to their browsers
browser vendors and all these 18:05 css3
features that you know people want to
use but starting to use these
technologies isn't always the easiest
thing so moderniser makes it easier for
you to get started with them and to kind
of like figure out how to use them in
the best way possible without
sacrificing what the experience is going
to be like for you know people using
older browsers so the at the heart
moderniser is a feature detection
library so what we do is we detect or
what we the library detects everything
like everything from css3 and html5 and
all the related new technologies it
detects whether the browser that the
curtain
users currently using whether it has
native support for each of these
features and then once it has detected
that these features it'll report that
information back to you so that you as
the designer or developer you know that
oh this current user their browser can
do these things cannot do these things
so you know we want to do this thing
with html5 file API or we want to do
something cool with CSS transforms with
moderniser you actually know whether or
not the browser will be able to do that
and then that means you can either
choose to enhance experience for those
people that that have that capability in
the browser or you can degrade it for
those people who don't and do some kind
of fall back or for something
alternative the way moderniser makes
this information to you available to you
is there's two two methods well the
first way is it creates this global
javascript object called moderniser and
on that object are all all the feature
tests are listed as properties so you'll
have something like moderniser about CSS
transitions which when you evaluate it
it will return either true or false
based on whether or not the browser has
that feature built-in in native
implementation so if it's true you know
the browser can do transitions in CSS
you can do some cool stuff there if it's
false you know you need to fall back to
either like some jQuery animate fallback
or something else or offer something
without animation altogether the other
method with which you can use this
information is through classes added to
the HTML element now we recommend that
you start in your raw markup with just a
class no js' and then when you do that
moderniser will load and start doing its
feature detection it replaces that and
also adds all these classes and this is
just a small subset of the many classes
that will be added depending on what you
do but every time a feature is present
in a browser it'll add the class if it's
not present or the browser doesn't
understand it it'll prefix it with
in a - so in this small limited example
you can see that the browser is you know
doesn't support touch events it does
support CSS transitions that support
font face and it doesn't support 3d
transforms so this allows you to kind
like create different variations of your
design based on whether or not these
features are available and you can do
that just by creating what is
essentially a set of if-else conditions
in your CSS so I'll do a quick example
of that so you know we have our we have
our div you know drop shadows are
awesome and we can zoom in here and you
can kind of see is like oh you know what
yeah that's gorgeous you know beautiful
shadow but what about browsers that you
know don't support box shadow well in
that case we can do that the note box
shadow class and then again our CSS and
then we give it an alternate if we give
it a border you know it doesn't look
quite as nice it's all like solid you
but it's at least something and that can
help when you need to do something
subtle like that or something more
significant for instance you know in
this case we have some white text on a
white background well we can read it
because we have this gorgeous text
shadow around it of course in the
browser without text shadow that doesn't
work very well and that means you know
we can do no tax shadow we can change
the text color and then people will be
able to still read it and you know but
in the browsers that actually support
text shadow you get the nice fancy
version these are just kind of like
simple examples but at the heart we can
see here is you know this makes it like
makes doing these different experience
these different designs a lot easier so
as a designer and as a developer what
this means for you is that you know you
can control and sort of define different
different types of experiences or
different looks to the website and know
for sure whether or not it's going to
work in the browser and then you know
the browser doesn't support this you can
do that alternatives and it's actually
really easy does
the two previous examples I only had
like four lines of CSS reading not that
hard and yeah that's really kind of the
the the essence of what modernizer does
it you know making tailored experience
is easy we have so many different
browsers to support nowadays people are
using mobile devices of all sorts all
these different desktop browsers older
versions current versions future
versions and that makes it really
difficult so you know moderniser makes
it actually a lot easier because you can
just say hey is this feature present
that I want to use if not to do this
other thing so you know why I would
really use that beyond what I just kind
of like said you know easier to build
forward compatible experiences and
that's actually a pretty important thing
because what we're doing a lot and I'll
talk more about this in a bit but what
we're doing a lot is kind of like
focusing on the current browser
landscape but what we're building are
things that people will use beyond today
you know
besides an applications that we're
building right now people are using it
today and tomorrow not today and in the
past
so with modern eyes are whenever a new
browser shows up through the market the
site that you built Loxy working that
browser just fine and if it has certain
features that you know maybe the newer
version of Firefox or something if it
has certain features that it didn't have
at the time when you built it it'll
actually pick up on those features
automatically because she built it the
right way using moderniser and that's a
that's a pretty powerful thing because
even like completely new browsers show
up on the market still today yesterday
the new Amazon Kindle Fire tablet comes
with some other browser yeah sure it's
web-based but it's not exactly the same
WebKit as you know the WebKit is on the
iPad or the WebKit on on Android
smartphone or you know the WebKit on the
PlayBook which God knows what that is
but the thing is these are all different
browsers but you know whether or not
they support certain features is what
you actually care about
so with moderniser and doing it sort of
like progressive enhancement based on
feature detection
you can actually build forward
compatible experiences and that's a
really powerful thing because if you're
who here works at like an agency or
something like that building okay Wow
just a very small number who here works
at like a larger corporation for mostly
internal websites or apps well does
everyone else do okay so well people
have different needs and they have
different environmental constraints
based on like the company they work for
and the kind of websites or applications
they build and being able to sort of
like maintain different versions very
easily as actually really helpful
especially if you have certain
restrictions where you need to support
ie6 but you know you may not actually
want to or be able to support ie6 with
the full extent of the application logic
that you're building so with this you
can just say hey ie6 you know it's going
to be supported we're going to support
the basic functionality to bare minimum
and then we're going to progressively
enhance it for everyone who is able to
use a newer browser and then you know
those people will get a richer
experience a little nicer design you
know more functionality because their
browsers capable of it but you don't
have to actually worry and deal with
like all this sort of nasty hacking
around IE and its limitations and
missing features so you can just say hey
this it's going to work but it's going
to be a minimal and then you know better
browsers get better experiences on the
flip side you can be you know if you're
focusing on really cutting-edge
applications or websites you can be like
hey we have this amazing thing we want
to build and you kind of need like a
pretty recent version of Chrome or
Safari or Firefox and ie9 is like barely
cutting it it's like that's okay you can
do that and then just gracefully degrade
and make sure that everything that is
essential to you know all the essential
content is still there all the essential
functionality is still there make sure
that it's accessible to people with
older browsers but you know it'll just
not be as awesome it will be
less exciting but it's still accessible
and still works so all these kind of
like four compatible experiences are you
know really easy this whole thing is
also actually better for the web the
more you use the html5 css3 all these
new features that browser vendors are
putting into their browsers the more
kind of like bugs you discover the more
kind of like issues you want to get
fixed or changes to the feature
implementation you may want to request
and that helps the browser vendors make
their browser better more robust to make
it faster make it perform better for the
users that means the users are gonna get
a better experience because their
browser is you know getting better as a
result and that makes the overall web
just a better place for everyone so it's
actually really helpful for at the first
level the browser vendors we started
using all these new technologies second
level the users and third just the web
itself and the third reason you know
pink is the new hotness I think that's a
very compelling argument so those are
kind of like the whys behind behind why
you should use modernizr it's also the
whys behind why I kind of started it and
why we've been developing it for two
years now but there's another one which
was you know we want to put an end to
user agent sniffing and who here has
ever used like a reading modern browser
gone to a website and get this sort of
like error message screen saying hey you
need to upgrade to Firefox 4 or you know
you need to uh pray to IE 7 or that yeah
so I've seen this happen over and over
again so many times still like today and
this is just really bad because usage of
snipping is very error-prone there are
so many different user agents to work
with and it's really difficult to
actually be accurate with it because
these are agents lie a lot this is like
a browser user aid the string and if you
look closely you can see kind of like
four different things in there
you know two different browsers three
four different rendering engines it's
really not that easy to work with and it
has bitten people in the ass a lot over
the past ten years it's caused a lot of
issues on the web and for a lot of
corporations and a lot of agencies
because keeping up with keeping up with
this sort of model this approach it
doesn't scale it really doesn't scale
towards all these new browsers that are
coming out these new devices and these
new aspect ratios and everything and
this has caused a lot of trouble and and
like hardship on the web because it's
actually heard the web's progress over
the past ten years especially in the
earlier years so this was modernised was
also kind of device to offer a really
great alternative something that's
actually better than doing you know
forking of code through user you a
sniffing and all that and the whole
better aspect is that you know features
are much more reliable to detect for and
they're actually what you want to detect
for because as a developer or designer
you really shouldn't care whether or not
the users using Chrome or Safari or
Firefox or ie or whatever what you care
about is are they able to do this thing
that I want to do or see this thing that
I wanted to show them so yeah you know
the whole you a sniffing kind of want to
bring an end to that get people on the
feature detection bandwagon focus on
other things like speed and performance
so getting started with moderniser all
there are two versions of the JavaScript
library there said the development
version this is uncompressed as all the
tests in it and it's like over 40 tests
already it's also a really good research
for this general learning of html5 and
css3 things it's also a good thing we
put the development version on content
delivery network so now if you're
working on some kind of limited control
case where you cannot really control all
the markup or anything like that these
are useful resources for you to work
with but it's really for development
type purposes when you go
production and you want to use modernizr
in the production environment mmm we
actually make you do a custom build
where you only include the just a test
that you need so if you only need CSS
transitions you know only include that
test if you need only like a small
handful only include those and then you
make your own compressed production
build which is pretty unique to your own
scenario to your own needs and it's
something that we encourage you to host
yourself there are a couple well
there's one main thing that moderniser
doesn't do and that's make older
browsers support these new features from
html5 and css3 with two exceptions built
in is the html5 shift or IE print
protector and this is important for
anyone who wants to use two new elements
two new semantic elements from html5 so
if you want to use like article and
header and footer and you know H group
and all these like great new semantic
elements that's cool go ahead but
Internet Explorer has no idea what
you're talking about it doesn't
recognize these elements because they're
nomination well for and it just goes
like I don't know this is something I
see it but I don't understand it
the problem is ie will create a broken
document object model from it so your
Dom will actually be different than how
you actually structured your markup and
that's going to cause problems with
styling and JavaScript
so through this little thing that Remy
sharp wrote it basically it's just a
small JavaScript loop that goes through
all these new elements from html5 and
sort of like creates them in note space
for ie and then I Eve suddenly
understands these elements and it's like
oh hey a header I get that cool so with
this you can actually start using the
html5 semantic elements and still be
able to style and work with with them in
IE as well and I print protector also
allows you to still print them which is
still useful
the other thing is this is something
only available in custom builds and
that's response is and respond jeaious
is a fast and lightweight polyfill for
min/max with css3 media queries mainly
for IE 6 through 8 but also any other
browser that actually doesn't support
them yet so this is just a small little
JavaScript library that helps you take
advantage of media queries to provide
different sets of styles to different
environments primarily based on like
aspect ratio and the width of the screen
so what that's what's great about that
is that it allows allows you to start
doing responsive web design and every
browser including like ie6 and ever
since
who here has not heard of responsive web
design cool everyone's heard of it so
quick quick overview it's a you know
it's a Content first design oriented
technique it focuses you it asks you to
like really focus on starting sort of
with a mobile first approach which you
must have heard from heard of as well
with with content first you've really
focus on you know it's this content
necessary for the user on whether or not
they're on a mobile device or like a
tablet or whether they're on desktop and
if not then you know maybe you should
reconsider adding it so it really
simplifies every page kind of down to
what everyone needs at all times it's
it's a technique about fluid grits and
images so that you can create completely
adaptive layouts and adaptive layers
really kind of like they take the same
markup the same web page and make it
work no matter what the device or screen
size the user is using so whether or not
they're on a smartphone or tablet or a
desktop browser or like a really big
screen it'll still work and you can
still make sure that their layout is you
know makes sense to them is a really
great experience a recently launched
example this is the Boston Globe it's
brand-new website really fantastic full
of responsive like a completely
responsive design a really large website
to lots of content so I really encourage
you to check it out and learn a lot from
their code because it's a really great
resource just as a poor web developers
but this talk is not about responsive
web design so moving on using moderniser
the right way there are a couple of
general like principles to keep in mind
for that the first thing is sort of a
philosophical one where you want to
design and build for the browser of the
future and what I mean by that is we
typically look at like the browser
landscape of today you know you know how
much market share does ie9 have ie a day
7 Firefox 7 6 5 4 Chrome and that's
actually really unhelpful because what
you really want to do when you're
building and we're designing and
building these new websites or
applications is you want to design them
for this sort of hypothetical browser
that will come out about two years from
now because two years we've three years
two years there's a really long time in
our landscape and there's a lot of
things that change and if you're
focusing on just what's going on right
now you're going to sort of miss out on
the market share changes that will
happen over the next couple of years a
big thing about that is everyone that
has like an older browser right now you
know not the latest version not the
great latest and greatest of any browser
at some point they're going to upgrade
whether it's through a hardware upgrade
or just a software upgrade operating
system whatever they never almost never
virtually never downgrade their browsers
people don't go oh you know Firefox 6 is
really you know nice and all but I
prefer 3.5 it doesn't happen so people
always get better browsers
so no matter what your current audience
is for your your website or application
right now that audience is only going to
get better browsers over the next month
or in the next six months over the next
year and so forth so every time you
focus more on like the people using the
oldest browsers right now you're
actually preventing yourself from
focusing on what they will be using
sometime in the near future and
especially when it comes to feature
detection like whatever new version or
new browser that they will have a number
of months from now it'll have more
features more capabilities it'll be
better and if you focus too much on kind
of like what they have right now you're
you're not going to offer them the best
experience you could have given them
when they upgrade their browser next the
other ways the other principle or second
principles you're gonna like really
focus on feature detection based on
whether or not something is missing or
is present so it's kind of like the the
progressive enhancement graceful
degradation trade-off there where you
know you may you may have these features
you have this design for certain
features and the browser just not
doesn't have support for border-radius
or something like that then you know I
will do some kind of fall back for that
or just don't care but at least you
you're able to do both or whichever you
want to do the same was the early
example that I gave where you know maybe
you're building some internet app or
whatever you need to still support ie6
or ie7 and you really don't want to but
you have to it happens then you can just
say hey you know I you sevens gonna have
this level support it's going you know
the basic functionality is gonna be
there the content is going to be
accessible but they're not going to have
all the bells and whistles and then you
detect features and see if they're
present and then you just enhance it for
those people using a browser that can it
also is something that encourages you to
focus really on the speed and
performance of
site or your application because that's
a really big thing you people don't like
waiting especially on the web even more
so on mobile which doesn't actually make
sense a lot but yeah people really don't
like waiting with their phones and by
focusing on really lean code and the
best kind of experience possible for
them using native implementations native
implementations being much faster than
these JavaScript fall backs that you can
offer that allows you to create a much
better faster experience for people and
speed and performance are really much
more important than facial consistency
over the past like 15 years of the web
most of that time we've sort of dealt
with trying to make everything look
pixel perfect across every browser but
that that is really like we really need
to stop with that because we're never
going to actually do that there's always
going to be differences between certain
browsers certain type rendering engines
operating systems that will affect it
somehow and it's really not worth
spending a whole lot of time on that
because people do not go to your website
you know how that looks great I wonder
what it looks like in this other browser
they don't do that they go and use it so
but if it's really slow because you
spend a lot of time and resources on
making like everything pixel perfect and
making sure that these rounded corners
work in ie6 then if it's really slow and
takes a minute for them to go to the
next page then they're going to give up
and close the tab or a browser so these
are kind of like main principles behind
using modern eyes really the right way
and the first ones something that I kind
of want to visualize here where you know
we tend to focus on you know the past
three years like every this error
between the present and you know these
browsers that people have been using for
the past three years the three years is
a really long time who remembers which
browser came out three years ago there's
a little browser called chrome
no one had ever heard of it and then
Google came out as like hey here's a
brother and now brought that same
browser has 23 percent market share
worldwide and that's that's really
significant in just three years so where
is it going to be in the next three
years right we have no idea maybe chrome
will continue its upward slope and be
somewhere around like 50 55 maybe 60
percent maybe some other browsers gonna
hit the market
maybe the Kindle Fire is going to like
be super successful and millions of
people are going to use that to browse
the web with thing is you don't know but
what you do know is which features
already going to have in that browser or
not and we really should focus on you
know the browsers or the browser
landscape as it will be over the next
three years because that's also kind of
the time span in which websites get
refreshed or applications some really
big websites take more than six months
to develop in the first place so what
happens when you start developing any
focus on you know the present in the
past and you're already going to be six
months further down the road when you
actually ship it well then you're really
focusing on the browser landscape that
has long come behind us so designing for
the browser or design reading for the
browser of the future it's all about
like feature detection makes it possible
to do this because you know if you're
doing feature detection and you're
progressively enhancing it doesn't
matter like which browser is coming out
two years from now it'll still report
whether or not it supports that feature
and if it does your card will
automatically take the right path and
you know get this awesome experience
right so this is a whole like you know
progressive enhancement versus graceful
degradation actually already went over
that there's one more and that's called
regressive enhancement and it's kind of
a sort of in between the two with a like
little path to decide I like to think of
it as going mega responsive
and that's it makes use of this awesome
little library called yep nope
and we've actually incorporated yep nope
as part of modernized as well and the
Creator Alex Sexton is one of the four
volunteers on the team on the modernizer
team and what this does is it's
conditional dynamic resource loading and
it means something cool like this where
you use it you test for a feature in
this case geolocation if your browser
says yeah I support geolocation
it's awesome then you know you load GOG
yes a little little tiny bit of
JavaScript that takes advantage of the
native implementation of geolocation if
it doesn't you can say hey load this
polyfill and then with this polyfill is
actually going to be you know you're
going to simulate the whole geolocation
API so that you can still kind of offer
the same result it won't be as effective
but it's pretty close quick note on the
polyfill
a polyfill is a small JavaScript library
to retrofit new functionality into older
browsers so there's lots of them out
there and it's really about you know the
previous example is a great example
where you know if the browser doesn't
support geolocation there's just
fallback you can insert and then it'll
sort of support to your location a note
on them is that they do tend to create
an overhead in processing so sometimes
you may actually want to choose not to
use polyfills for putting all the
functionality into other browsers
because that will actually affect the
performance of those older browsers a
lot more so use with caution
another good example of this sort of
progressive enhancement thing is this
this example with the html5 forms
polyfill which is done by Ryan seden who
you know another awesome library that
works with moderniser
and we decided to put him on the team so
if you want to like be part of the
moderniser team just create something
that works really well with it it's
really awesome now we'll just ask you to
come join a team
that's a really great way to do it so
this example quickly go through it it's
you know it tests for moderniser the
input types email some other input prop
input type or input attributes and then
if the browser doesn't have all of these
it goes like oh nope
load this html5 forms polyfill and then
that polyfill will actually sort of like
use JavaScript to retrofit the new html5
forms functionality into the browser
which is a really great great way of
doing it because what this also means is
that you're not going to load these
resources for people that already like
whose browsers already understand these
things and you can take that to a way
more complicated example something that
won't fit on the slide but where you can
really like do all these various tests
and go like okay well the browser
supports these things load these
resources doesn't support that load
these resources the moderniser com
website itself is actually doing some of
that where you know we really try and
load only the resources for only the
current environment that we need and
ignore all the rest to close a little
bit of advanced debate sort of there's a
there's a lot of ongoing talk especially
in the past year about Native versus web
and you know our do we want to build
applications on the web and is it as
good as native and I kind of like to
think that moderniser plays a pretty
helpful role in this especially for
those people who here does native
development as well yeah so a handful so
the thing about that is like there's a
lot of stuff we can do in browsers it's
not as fast it's not as great perhaps as
what we can do in native platforms but
the thing that I like the web for maybe
the most is that it allows us to
actually deliver content to people using
devices going back all the way to like
92 from like free actual web era like
they can still sort of like understand
these technologies that we're using and
that's kind of like there's these
benefits to native you know it's great
baselines you can say hey upgrade to the
latest operating system but that's just
people out it makes it completely
inaccessible for these people that
either cannot or won't upgrade or switch
to your platform or whatever sometimes
you shuts them out for a long time on
the early days of the web we're kind of
behaving the same way we're oh yeah you
need to get the latest version of
Internet Explorer to get this understand
this website and then the whole website
movement kind of change that and
nowadays you know we can actually do
this thing especially with moderniser
where we offer the most amazing
experience that we can think of that we
can design and that we can build to all
the people that actually are using a
browser capable of rendering and
understanding it and then we can go on
to sort of like make sure that the
content is still available and
accessible to people using older
browsers and that all the bare
essentials will stay there no matter how
old their browser is and that's actually
a really powerful thing because that
gives us the largest possible audience
in the world to sell our content to or
our product and the downside is of
course you know more work upfront to do
it right but it's actually it's it turns
out it's going to be much less work to
maintain it over time so it's actually a
pretty valuable proposition and that's
kind of it we've left in a good amount
of time for questions because pretty
usually either case so thanks very much
we have some prizes as well so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
