bringing your food and being loud
chewing it hope you had a good lunch
hope nobody's getting killed on the side
door that sounds like weird out there
right now but we're going to see what is
about I'm Chris Heilmann i'm a senior
program manager at microsoft now I used
to be the principal evangelist for html5
and open web at Mozilla but that never
fit on a business card so i gave up on
that title and i used to work for yahoo
before i've been a web developer for 17
18 years i built massive websites out
there are few applications I worked
closely on Firefox OS the last few years
and trying to get the html5 application
story going and proper in the way that
we expect them to be rather than just a
copy of what native is and today I don't
want to give a very technical talk but I
want to give a talk about issues that
I'm seeing right now with our perception
of what we're doing because i live on
conferences at the moment i spoke at
when 42 conferences last year in 27
countries and i never give the same talk
twice i always write something special
and I see a lot of talks being repeated
a lot of patterns being repeated and a
lot of functionality being advertised as
the solution for everything whereas in
reality it's not quite there yet but we
always complain about how bad it is what
we do and how hard our jobs are and like
oh my god we got all this free food and
people give us money for doing the
things we like that's a terrible ordeal
that we're in and I think it's just
important that we understand in what
great times we actually live as
developers and his web developers
especially because I remember using like
netscape for and like internet explorer
five and my debugging tool wasn't alert
that's all that was there and nowadays
we got all these great things and still
we're talking about if they could be
better could be better something's wrong
the technologies we have are actually
incredible they're absolutely amazing we
have the the web components for example
that idea the component izing the web
and having a proper way of building
applications that way service workers
allowing us for offline
functionality and in essence a full HTTP
router in JavaScript egmore script 2015
2016 bringing JavaScript into a higher
language that is not the thing that was
done in 10 days and actually started
structured better than it before that we
are WebGL WebRTC like life video
streaming data channels of multiplayer
games WebRTC web PR is a very
interesting one as well Mozilla is doing
a lot of stuff that way right now and we
come a long way as professional
developers we always think they're okay
javascript developers other guys that
open text pad and write something and
hope it works in or in essence people go
to stack overflow copy and paste it in
until it works the full stack overflow
developer as I called them and but we
come we become much more professional
because we're doing version controlling
test-driven development task runners
we've got package management we've got
pre and post compilation trance piling
in all these things and our tooling has
never been better as well like we don't
have this alert box anymore or a tail or
something like that on a console we have
IDE integration like when I started
Microsoft I see what people do with
visual studio I myself use used sublime
text but because i'm using a mac as my
company machine as well and what people
do with IDEs is incredible we have
Watchers and life reloads we even don't
need to press f5 anymore to see the
thing that we've done with in browser
debuggers and development tools i work
closely with the development tool team
in my end Mozilla and now I'm actually
working with the f12 team in Microsoft
as well and what you can do and what you
can find out about your own code in
browsers nowadays is incredible with
remote debugging tools and protocols we
can even test things on devices they're
not even physically in the same space as
we are you can go into like an open
device lab and VNC in too far into a
mobile you enter mobile and then use a
remote debugging protocol or webdriver
to start using that with frameworks
libraries and packaging tools that make
our lives much easier react polymer
angular bootstrap phonegap manifold j/s
if you haven't seen manifold JS right
now that's using the w3c application
manifest and you can create a binary iOS
and a bi
android app from that not a not a thing
like a phonegap solution a hybrid app
but a real binary one and browsers are
openly innovating and are evergreen like
of course Firefox Chrome Opera Microsoft
edge Safari iOS and Safari these are
browsers that do get upgrades all the
time and this is great not for everybody
like enterprise customers hate that for
example and they have good reasons
because they have security audits every
two years and they've done that for the
last 50 years and there's no way of
changing that our communication tools
are splendid as well we all of github I
mean when github came out I love the
concept of like let's make a social
network for developers the not most
social people on this planet but it
really worked out and everybody is using
github and it made get much more in de
standable for people as well we all talk
on slack we call of access hundreds of
free resources on learning our trade
like nobody needs to pay for actually
becoming a web developer you if you find
the right resources and you'll follow
the right people you can actually learn
anything you want i watch conference
talks and training videos in the gym on
a cross trainer you've got 45 minutes
it's a great workout you've got nothing
else to do it before you watch daytime
television in England it's a good thing
to watch something that you learn
something from because otherwise your
brain wants to get out of your head we
all can take part in meetups and
conferences almost every day or on the
web I mean Silicon Valley San Francisco
is a great example for that you don't
even need to cook food just go to a meet
up every day and all of these things are
there and still will I can somehow
something is missing we always get the
feeling we're not there yet something is
missing I think this video shows it
quite nicely
so we always like why are we still
innovating and patching and putting more
things in rather than like we have a
platform that works the web is a
platform and I've seen it evolve from
like nothing to what it is now we all
are here because the internet we're not
here because of native apps we're not
here because of Nokia we're not here
about because of like wml apps these
kind of things we're all here because of
the internet and that's the thing that
we should protect and do something with
so everything we do is incredible and
you hear this a lot like that's an
incredible new solution and then you
look up the definition of incredible and
it means impossible to believe or a
difficult to believe and extraordinary I
think it's actually more interesting
that incredible to me means lacking
credibility and this is what we're doing
right now working for microsoft i have
to talk with government people i won't
have to work with people like state farm
like IBM's the people who run cashpoints
the people who run air airlines these
kind of things and when i go to them and
talk about all the cool stuff that we
talk about here that's just looking at
me like what are you doing because what
we do almost everything we do is release
these days is experimental everything is
like that's the future or next week it's
another future many things need
non-standard code of flags to be turned
on like oh yeah this works in the latest
prebuilt of my safari on my computer
right now so obviously all of your users
can rely on that thing things work only
in one browser sometimes even in a
special build and that's something that
I hate with a passion I had to use while
I still have to use because I work for
Microsoft all these web sites that were
built for internet explorer 6 7 and 8
and don't work in any other browser and
we think this is stupid but at the same
time we're totally fine to tell people
you need chrome to watch this website
instead really what we want to go back
to and after impressing one another with
a cool logo grandiose statements and the
three line hello world demo there's a
fine print stating don't use this in
production which of course doesn't stop
us from having a footer dare saying mate
with love in San Francisco
and to use any of these new standards
you need to use an abstraction library
like oh yeah well local storage is now
easy just use local forage no use that
one I found like 60 different libraries
to allow you for local storage on your
device and there's three standards for
that that actually work and you could
choose them simpler so who do we really
code for is something that I asked
myself after being in this avalanche of
information of great stuff and I got
really excited about it because it's not
far end users they're not likely to have
the same computers connections and
browsers we have these things are
expensive we don't think so because our
company pays for them but I see people
travel worldwide I see people would like
old IBM machines I see people with
desktop machines you go to like internet
cafes you've got these old Macs with
like with like always nine on it and
things like that and these people are
all allowed on the Internet you don't
shouldn't have that thing to be on the
Internet this is not the same thing not
companies you need to work with products
that work in large teams or can be used
environment following certification
processes I work with SI p with
Accenture and people like that nearly
well all of your developers now need to
go to the command line and install these
15 NPM packages that are experimental
but don't worry about it they're all
going to be fine economy be maintained
forever because that's how we do it
things now I think we code for ourselves
we code for conference participants and
we code for hacker news to actually win
a hacker news threat the tech press and
an imaginary perfect future audience and
why do we do this it's cool it's fun
it's like we're the cool kids we're the
ones who have to future of the Internet
in our hands we're not the ones that use
the thing is end users use in other
people to click on ads rather than us
who have ad blockers installed and I
don't know I don't feel I don't feel
happy doing that cause when I started I
wanted to do the first thing the end
user should be our main goal the people
out there should be able to use our
stuff what we put in there how much work
we put in there is not the problem we
get paid for doing work so we should
doing some more work to make work for
more end users is not a bad thing so
what happened what made us you're so
self-centered because when I started on
the web
we had the 2000 2002 2003 it was all
about like oh my god make these table
layouts go away and make CSS work
somehow across browsers so end users
have a fast experience this is what we
want to have what was the main thing
that we keep trying to fix on with all
the innovation efforts that we have and
to me this is mobile and mobile is still
a problem and mobile is to think that
the next generation of computer users
now in the Western world here in the
rich world gonna have their first
experiences on they don't have desktop
machines they don't have laptops until
they go to school they have to write
things before that everybody has a
mobile device a smartphone of some sort
and in most cases it's an iOS device
when you're here in America and we got
told all these these random things that
that mobile is completely different to
the web like mobile app app is a much
better model than its websites with URLs
because typing a URL on the phone is
terrible but downloading 50 meg of app
every two days because they have a new
background color is a much better
experience everything needs to work
offline that's that's something that why
what the app format is actually for but
then you then you actually go to an
internet with like a life i which is the
Wi-Fi that disconnects and connects all
the time and you realize that half your
native apps don't work properly anymore
speed is paramount and every bite costs
money except when it comes to showing
ads everything needs to be much simpler
interfaces people are busy and on the
road you know everybody's like oh people
use their mobile phones only running
after a train while they're actually
saving a child from a burning building
or something like that no people sit at
home with their phones on the under
computer while they're watching Netflix
so it's it's not the same year that the
story is different and every app should
take the full advantage over what the
operating system and the hardware offers
which is of course a wonderful story if
the operating system allows you to do
that which in many cases with javascript
is just not possible and we had this
great idea of smartphones making as much
more effective and much more much better
my day is completely planned with a
to-do list app and I don't worry about
it and when I living in London living in
a very touristy area all I see people is
taking selfies and sending pictures to
each other in facebook this is what
ninety percent of the use case of
mart phone is and we thought this is
like this perfect thing to make a better
life for ourselves no this is what
people do they stand there with their
thing buddhistic I was thinking about
making two sticks for tablets well I
think we Bullock's set up really proper
in the end because if you look at what
what the mobile experience is on the web
it's terrible and the verge had this
wonderful article about that where it
said like the mobile web sucks and it
showed all the problems that websites
have on on mobile devices on a website
that in itself has 87 requests and 7
megabyte of data to read a 1600 word
article which is bad enough as it is but
the other thing that I found more
interesting is that it has 34 tracking
tracking cookies on that website so we
really really want to know who you are
and again and again and again and again
so making the web full of stuff that
people don't need that it's just for you
to make money is making the web suck yes
the and that's to me is the biggest lie
about mobile innovation when people say
iOS is technically much better than any
other platform iOS has one thing that
nobody has it's damn easy to spend money
on it it's very easy to buy something
and all the other platforms you have to
jump through hoops or like find another
way to buy something it's a five-step
process and that's why people make much
more money on iOS and other platforms
and the audience is much more affluent
so releasing on iOS first is actually
already user research it already means
we get a group of people that spend
money so we have something to show to
our boss that it was a success on the
web you get many more people but all of
them want everything for free the web is
designed to work independent of hardware
software ability or location this is how
Tim berners-lee or timber as I call him
defined it back then and this is what he
did at the olympic games in london where
you showed like this is the web and it's
for everybody by typing it into twitter
anyways on mobile the back is stacked
against the web and that is not if not
necessarily one company's problem but
it's actually a program of fragmentation
because browsers are hard-wired and
update with the operating systems does
that sound familiar yes it's called ie6
and we hate that with a passion if the
operating system doesn't get upgraded a
lot of old Android devices don't get a
better browser they get the thing that
the company at that time thought was a
browser which a Sri is not one hardware
creators service providers and even
third-party vendors fork and release
their own unholy versions of the OS and
the browser and an Android that's a real
problem i mean PPK as these talks about
like chromia how many different chrome
versions are on different operating
providers on android and it's terrible
i've got a new huawei phone it came with
like six hundred apps that I don't need
that I can't delete it's amazing what
people do to you and the more you
control the experience on a mobile
device the more competitive you are
that's why iOS is great because they
control the hardware the software and
the distribution of course you can make
a better product and because you don't
have any interference from other
companies on the web on the other hand
control is a terrible thing because it
is for everybody independent of location
independent of ability and so on and so
forth now when we deal with loss in
psychology it's a five-step process that
could be the death of somebody that
could be like breaking up with somebody
and there's five steps to that as denial
there's anger there's bargaining des
depression and there's acceptance and
that has been four on four years as
research and we all see ourselves going
through that all the time and we do it
on the web with the mobile VoIP as well
the first thing was denial is this just
a fad it will go away you know nobody
will have smartphones people will use
desktops 20 end of the life like in the
end people would write HTML because
nobody wants to learn C sharp or then
whatever other language it's just a fad
don't worry about it if we put an
operating system based on html5 then
probably other people will do it as well
not naming any names here but it
happened a few times surely the
simplicity of web standards and the
amazing value of micro formats and
properly structured HTML will never
cease to amaze new developers because
that's much more
than building something in a modular way
or in a functional programming sway
anger was an interesting one because we
always find scapegoats it's the fault of
our users they do all the things wrong
when you like using outdated browsers
and turning off JavaScript whenever the
discussion is about progressive
enhancement everybody talks about the
people who turn off JavaScript which
don't exist the people who have no
JavaScript because some error happened
it's the fault of browser makers they
just don't innovate quickly enough and
match what mobile can do like how can
they not know what the operating system
will bring out that is one of the
best-kept secrets in this market like as
soon as iOS comes out with something new
why don't browsers have that well we
didn't know that this is coming like
nobody else did probably inside Apple
did people didn't know it's the fault of
cloud clients they only want crap and
nothing exciting that pushes the
envelope people always want the same and
like they just don't allow us to be
creative it's the fault of two creators
we need to match what native has in
terms of tooling and then we can ride
unicorns and have ice cream and then we
start bargaining when the anger is over
me like yeah okay did it listen to us
how about we do something like a stopgap
solution or phonegap solution that is
designed to become redundant and show
mobile OS makers that web is ready and
only if it had access to the hardware
capabilities phonegap was defined as a
gap solution that would go away not
happen anytime soon right now because we
still don't have to have our
capabilities we want to have let's
define lots of api's and form expert
groups that actually show you what the
things should be like and then the
mobile a native operating system
providers full of free get it as well we
give you lots of stuff please love us
please work with us let's inject
browsers with our apps into the platform
crosswalk project is very interesting
because it injects a new a newer chrome
into older android phones so if you have
to support old android phones but you
want to have a good html5 experience you
can use that one the only problem is
your mat your app is 17 Meg without any
of your app code because it has the
whole of chrome in it and that sound it
sounds like chrome frame in Internet
Explorer back then when chrome said like
yeah we going to fix the web with that
didn't quite work that way and then we
get depressed and we like okay let's
consider feed we can never match what
native offers and never in 0
as fast let's consider a new career goat
farming for example sounds like a great
investment let's try to find recognition
elsewhere maybe in a smaller group of
people who care about what I do sounds
familiar you know like people don't
listen to us let's make lots of events
what we talk to each other and tell each
other how amazing things we do and then
we start accepting things maybe this is
just another form factor maybe the web
cannot be on mobile the way it's
supposed to because of the app factor is
okay for mobile maybe the web doesn't
need to be everywhere the same way that
mobile doesn't need to replace the web
we could use our time to care for the
web that is instead like fix the web
that is right now maybe there is space
for more than one form factor you know
like you can go with a bicycle on the
road or with a car that's amazing you
know the same way you can have a website
that people look on a mobile phone or an
app or a website that tells you to
download the app which is right now
what's happened and maybe there's a time
to reflect and improve what we have
after all there is a lot that need
fixing the web is terribly broken and
i'm going to show that in a second or in
other words maybe not everything is
hopeless maybe we shouldn't get
depressed about this and think we're
trying to have to match and like oh my
god I remember when people wear on stage
they like native is eating our lunch and
you're like well every IT company has
free lunch so I'm you know like not that
much of an issue really so the web is
full of rubbish and it's time to clean
it up instead of adding more and that's
where these these tracking websites and
the law of ads and everything in there
gets out there we don't understand that
with every with every abstraction with
every helper library with every quick
stopgap solution we add more crap to the
web because people put these things in
their websites and never ever touch them
again because it works actually
Microsoft to help with one very
important fix to web the web very much
needed and that is the death of Internet
Explorer and I'm happily dancing on his
grave and
Microsoft edge is the new browser in
Windows 10 came out yesterday LH came on
earlier but Windows 10 came out
yesterday upstairs is my colleague I'm
going to sit on our boots as well so you
can play with the browser and I don't
care if you use chrome or firefox out of
5 for school and an edge is not going to
be on other platforms for now because it
does not need to be what I wanted to
have is a browser on Windows that
doesn't suck and a browser that does the
same thing in terms what the other
browsers do as well because ninety
percent of our end users used to think
that the operating system comes with
they don't even know what a browser is
for them the internet is that that world
thing or that bluey that's why the new
logo looks like the old logo because we
didn't want to confuse people they just
like they just use whatever comes with
the operating system the idea was to get
rid of all the bad ideas of the past
this is all the stuff that we threw out
from the operating system we forked
Internet Explorer's engine and then be
throughout vml attached event different
document types conditional comments
vbscript Silverlight you know all the
fun things that we gave to people that
they didn't want to use and have to use
in a lot of cases though but we found
interesting some for example XPath we
could implement by using the CSS parser
round and putting an XPath engine in
there so it's interesting bits and bobs
and then we said we replace all of the
things that we threw out with yummy
goodness and amazing standardized things
so we deleted two hundred thousand two
hundred twenty thousand lines of code
and that's not comment lines this is
code lines this is how much stuff that
was in there that was just backwards
compatibility and terribly old stuff six
documents mode got out 600 API is
removed 600 API is that nobody that
wasn't a right mind in 2010 used anymore
and then we put three hundred thousand
lines of rubber code in all the html5
specifications all the good ap is that
are defined in html5 and 55 new
standards and then we had to do 4200
interrupt fixes because we realize
putting a browser on the web that
renders the web as it was defined in
html5 is great but doesn't work because
we as developers
stop we will be put edge out there and
said like please love us here is a
browser that does html5 and this is what
it looks like on iOS the Hawaiian
Airlines this is what it looked like on
Firefox and this is what it looked like
on the mobile Internet Explorer same
website people build three different
websites and did user agent sniffing to
actually give different websites two
different things so the way we build
edge and we made it compatible the web
is we said we put a wrong user agent in
and said we're chrome and then we serve
lots of websites and fix the problems
contact the developers of the website
then be made a headless version of edge
and put it on top of the Bing crawler
and did 45 million pages and rendered it
all through and it like regression
rendering and see how they change
according to when you click through them
that's where the webdriver stuff comes
in as well and then we found interesting
bits because people use experimental
code all the bloody time so WebKit
appearance num is used everywhere and it
basically is done to make a thing not
look like anything so you can start
styling it and then you get fun things
like this dating site where without
WebKit appearance the support you can
set you can define your gender as empty
radio box or claw or full radio box I
mean it makes it more exciting to go to
a dating site because it says you
probably don't want to know I don't know
it was just very bizarre that people
rely on that stuff for something as
crucial as that and then you had WebKit
gradient which in that case is not a
problem but the amount of white buttons
with white text we found because WebKit
gradient was the only background so you
have to highlight the whole page to read
them that was not fun copy and paste
beats validation that one cracked me up
so you get like this bad rendering here
you know the stuff that like the utf-8
rendering problems that people always
like yeah why do you use these
characters just write English instead
and it is because this is how we defined
utf-8 encoding in XHTML and this is how
we define it in html5 cause much easier
much simpler much much easier to
understand and this is how people
implement it without the dash inside
over 600,000 times on github and
seriously people should never nobody
looked at that ever like because other
browsers allow for both the amount of
crud that is in browsers nowadays
because we don't want to break the web
and we expect developers to do bad
things it's just annoying me because I
thought we were professionals things you
learn when you write a JavaScript engine
there's a great talk by my colleague
Brian Carson Carson and gaurav says
about the chakra engine if you want to
learn about like just-in-time
compilation and what we've done to make
the the new chakra engine 2.5 times
faster than the internet explorer 11 1
this is a great talk and half of it i
was just glazing over because I'm like
yeah I don't know what you're talking
about but that sounds amazing but it's
really good interesting stuff what we
learned is that in lining you know when
you when you have a JavaScript function
that calls another JavaScript function
the browser interpreted just-in-time
compiler takes the other function puts
it inside the other one and then makes
one binary blob out of that rather than
having to binary blobs that all need
more memory more more computation so we
tried to make as much binary code from
different parts of JavaScript but only a
third of the of the top three thousand
websites benefit from it because we put
script scripts and lots and lots of
includes instead of just having any of
the cool tools that we have with God
grunt barford fart whatever they're
called now instead of having one script
include we got like 10,000 and this is
life on the web right now you need to
optimize a lot in JavaScript to the
engine for example for loops people
still do an iteration of the length of
an array on every iteration of the loop
instead of cashing that one time and now
we actually whenever it has a for loop
we analyze the for loop and we we then
realize that we don't have to iterate
anymore because it never happens in that
loop so we do it in Dutch and the
compiler as well outdated libraries are
very much in use and a lot of them were
the problem we wanted to have es6
compare your six compatibility we had
the issue that for example mootools
didn't like array contains and zapped Oh
didn't like array constructors so as
people use mootools and septal on
life websites with millions of users we
could not put that in the specification
of es6 because it would break the web
the same way we cannot support pointer
events and touch events in on mobile on
desktop in the edge because as soon as
you support touch events people will
give you in a mobile interface because
they tested they check for if touch is
supported then obviously this is an
iphone so minification is used a lot on
the web so a cliff ijs is used
everywhere and this is great so we
optimize the chakra engine to be much
faster with minified code thank you do
more of that stuff please the web is a
mess it is really as soon as you start
because I was going in like yeah let's
fix the browser because you were doing
everything wrong and then they pointed
out to me what developers do wrong what
I did wrong working for Yahoo and
companies like that because we're busy
we have to quickly release the thing so
yeah we clean it up later you know when
our boss tells us like release it now
and then we do a clean up later that
never happens nobody cleans up later
because we have a new thing to do
promises do not work does not es6
promises but promises of what the future
is going to be can we stop producing not
ready for production solutions as soon
as you type that into a website you
start slapping yourself what am i doing
here like why would I release this thing
if it's not ready for production that's
like recording a song that nobody should
listen to okay justin bieber but people
are getting tired of upcoming amazing
technologies and we need to use now and
jump through hoops to implement people
are getting tired of this the same way
people getting tired of using every
using a new app every week on their
mobile device I'm not really excited
anymore when everybody tells me like oh
gallop is not good enough anymore now is
broccoli now use that like by the time
you learn something it already the next
blog post is out saying like that's
dangerous to use don't use it something
like what am I doing here try to catch
up to something that's running away
abstraction libraries end up in
production become interoperability
issues and fill up the web and they do
like the amount of like jQuery included
15 times in different pages because
different people worked on different
parts of it is not uncommon
and when you when you have a search
engine that's really cool because you
can trace for that stuff and find it out
experimental technology and use gets
included across browsers to ensure
backwards compatibility making browsers
slow and fat Chrome Firefox Microsoft
edge Safari as well we all have to
implement bucks from other browsers
because we don't want to break the web
because if it shows up wrongly in your
browser people blame your browser
because obviously we as the developers
made no mistake that has to be the
browser we should never punish our end
users on the other hand the whole
concept like it's not their job to fix
their working environments to our needs
like ho people should update to the
newest browser that's not hard to do
well you do that on a on a data plan
that gives you like five mega a week and
download the browser just because your
website really doesn't work in it I was
in Albania the other day and the roaming
costs was 12 pound for 10 megabyte that
means the average web site of two
megabyte that have we have right now
according to HTTP archive cost me three
euro 23 to look at it better be a good
website there's no everybody should use
this you publish for the web you know
what you signed up for the web is
successful because anybody is invited
you can reach millions of people with
different environments different
abilities different setups you cannot
control them you cannot tell them what
browser to use what operating system to
use unless you buy them laptops and mail
it to them then you can but probably
nobody does that we're wasting our time
reevaluating sensible concepts like
progressive enhancement they work their
future proof let's not pretend we can
control things progressive enhancement
is not about JavaScript being available
it's not about like Oh promises are be
available progressive enhancement is
jumping into a river after checking
there's no sharks in there that's a good
idea you should do this you should also
have a background color for any image
that you use because if the image can't
be loaded and in text is white black on
black that's a bad experience that's
very sensible thing to do on a very
simple one to do the one thing that can
help us is love for the web and love for
our work as well and pride in our work
and not saying like we release quickly
hey then we can can go home no we stay
in the office and do beer pong or
whatever
love for the form factor is to web let's
not repeat the same mistakes with it
with I 6 checking for browsers user
agent sniffing blocking other browsers
telling you you need 806 on a resolution
and Internet Explorer 54 you cannot see
this website there around still let's
not write code that works let's write
code that is correct the amount of html5
is super forgiving we can write whatever
and something will come out of it but
the maintainability the beauty of code I
my twitter handle is code poet and
that's because i think code is writing
code to me is poetry and is writing it's
not math it's not algorithms it's
turning instructions into something
beautiful for an end user and I think we
should have much more pride into what we
do instead of saying like let's reinvent
something else and be better than the
other person that's not optimize our
work for a platform that doesn't
appreciate it and where it won't
flourish which is mobile think about
what desktops can do what tablets can do
what mobile phones could do but really
another right form factor for think
about what how much more effective you
can be on a bigger screen with a
keyboard and a mouse then on your mobile
device instead of saying like everybody
has a mobile device oh my god nobody
needs desktops anymore we all use
desktops everyday Google is a desktop
and this is where right now we need to
concentrate on getting one thing right
and that is es6 es6 comes with so much
goodness technically it has to be
fattening all this stuff that probably
i'll talk to you about the last few days
that's amazing and all of these parts
have different audiences there's
syntactic sugar for us to write less
code there's scalable app stuff in es6
and as for stuff for library builders in
es6 to make libraries better the support
is encouraging but also patchy
everything red is not good except for
her but in this case it's bad and the
problem is that non supporting browsers
es6 features are a syntax error that a
fat arrow in a and a javascript or a
promise in a javascript actually doesn't
do anything in an older browser and it's
so the first time that we do that in
javascript solution transpiring to es5
but that has other problems of course
with it because it adds an extra step
between writing code and running it in
the browser probably the thing that made
web grow as fast as it did like I put in
the browser I reload the thing it works
now I have to go through the translation
phase I have to do like all kind of
changing things of course we have
tooling for that tooling helps but it
still feels like I want to build a
website okay here you have to set up
Ruby and you have to set up 10,000
things on the command line back then it
was like just put in the browser put in
a developer tools try it out you didn't
run or debug the code you write you rite
different code than its what's going in
the browser and that's kind of dangerous
in terms of performance probably you
create much more code you get the mercy
of the transpiler to create efficient
code if the transpiler doesn't get
updated it probably throws out code that
is not efficient you create probably
much more code than you need because it
looks like five lines of code but gets
generated into six thousand lines of
code and browsers that support es6 will
never get any that's the irony of Trance
piling we make as6 work in browsers but
we never get any year six code because
people transpile for older browsers and
give the new browser zo6 es5 as well so
why do we have es5 in browsers to use
internally of course but for end-users
for us s end users as developers it
means it seems pointless and one of the
leads to design principles of html5 is
the priority of constituency
constituencies in case of conflict
consider users / authors / implementers
/ specifiers / theoretical purity users
are the most important thing everything
else has to be less important and I
totally agree with that cause users are
the people as I said who click on the
adds that pay our way pay our wages it
turns out that you can feature test year
6 feature test io by Kyle again allows
you to do to test the browser that you
have right now which parts of es6 are
supported and then you do a
progressively enhanced version of es6
and you load istics into the browser
that supports it and don't give you 6 to
the browser that doesn't not a bad idea
not giving code to a browser that that
chokes on good thing how does your 6
perform of course everything that is not
dark green is bad in this so basically
the only thing where es6 performs better
than es5 is the features that are only
in es6 that es5 doesn't have it all
so that's a problem but that's not
nothing new at the same with es 3 go
into es5 and and whenever the
functionality of a javascript becomes
more complex it's going to be slower
than the older version but we had
browsers that supported es5 so we were
able to make it perform and to make it
faster if we transpile everything into
es5 we never have a chance to make the
browser faster in es6 because we just
don't get that code at all we can't use
it safely in the wild right now because
older browsers don't support in and get
scared a syntax error we can use
typescript or trance pilot that totally
works we can feature test for it but it
gets very complex very quickly because
you want to test for everything that you
use and then it becomes lots of lots of
if statements or like lots of calling or
feature tehsil browsers that support it
will not get any years six that way but
can use it internally so for internally
your six is super good for browser same
for like libraries and no trace kind of
stuff environments where you control the
environment es6 is a good thing to use
environments where you don't control it
you have these problems the performance
is bad right now that's normal to
improve we need es6 to be used in the
wild and we cannot use it in the wild
because it's a chicken and xing I don't
have a solution for it yet where's a lot
of discussions going on and I think I
mixed a mixture of feature detection and
setting a baseline much like we do with
progressive enhancement and cutting the
mustard in es6 would be a good thing web
components being dependent on es6 and
being just module loading of es6 why not
then we don't have to worry about the
old browsers and make it even work and
those anymore you can help you 6 by
looking at the unit tests these are the
unit tests that go into every browser
that it says it's es6 compliance so look
at these unit tests and see how you can
help with debugging those and finding
new tests for new features there's
actually a great website called es6
catastor dark which is just a daily
exercise to go through these unit tests
and learn es6 by fixing the unit tests
so that's really really sweet and I
think in essence what I'm covering here
and I'm out of time is that we need to
move from patching to building I'm not
excited anymore hearing every week this
is the future of the internet and
because last week was another future I
want to build things that work for
people
and I want to build things for everybody
out there and I think we should focus
much more on our end users than
impressing one another this was my
showerhead in my flat in London for five
years because that's the kind of person
I am like it works I get wet I get
cleaned that's why I came in here for it
doesn't have to be look beautiful but I
think in the end I didn't feel at home
cuz that looks terrible and it's just
embarrassing when somebody visits you so
let's not write code like this let's
write the shower heads that make us
clean and are beautiful to use and yes
in other words love what you do and do
what you love I'm Chris Hyneman you can
get me a scope point on Twitter and I'll
be upstairs at the microsoft booth if
you have other questions as well thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
