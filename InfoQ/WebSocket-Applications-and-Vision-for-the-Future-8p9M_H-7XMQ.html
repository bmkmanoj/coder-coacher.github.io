hopefully everyone's caffeinated so
you're in the websocket applications and
vision for the future session and we
certainly all know about WebSocket up
into this point we we better know about
WebSocket we represent the top one
percent of all application programmers
of course so it's our job know about it
and we know that for the first time in
over 20 years there is now an official
second protocol for the web an RFC 6455
so where we all know we're staring at a
new phase of the web with all this good
html5 stuff and it's a lot of stuff
right and we're looking at web socket as
enabling a lot of this cool stuff to
happen over the web in a very efficient
way so I mean having a fat pipe
bi-directional fat pipe over the web is
potentially could be the butterfly that
flaps its wings type of type story so we
have four experts in web sockets and
real-time communications on our panel we
have Matt Ilya Phil and Peter to discuss
some of the the interesting spots for
WebSocket now in the future so I'll let
them introduce each other and Matt we'll
start with you and your name and what
you do and we're WebSocket plays a role
my name is matt's of our goal is some
one of the authors of framework called
meteor meteor is a platform for writing
applications where most of your software
runs inside the browser and communicates
with services in the data center and so
for us you know the whole story is about
the transport between those two and it's
a transport that needs to be somewhat
different from what we grew up with in
the web as you said bi-directional I
think you're going to see mostly data
rather than presentation over that
transport I think you're going to see a
lot more thinking about sessions and
session preservation and
state on that connection so we use today
either web sockets themselves or we use
one of the emulations layers with long
polling or whatnot that accomplishes the
same thing but I think in the long run
it's very exciting to have the ability
to open a real you know bi-directional
socket from your client-side application
and then talk to different endpoints
around the web so Iliad rework I work at
Google with the make go fast team and
Google Chrome teams and in both of those
for both of those teams the primary
focus is on web performance in general
so of course making Google web services
faster but we also know that making the
web faster as a whole is also plays
plays into like making Google faster as
well so we were very much aligned there
and specifically for web sockets one of
the things that we find is if you guys
attended HP to point o talk yesterday
latency is a big concern and we know
that we want to build better and more
vicious apps in the browser across these
platforms and web sockets is one way to
get there so having that bi-directional
way to communicate and also combining
websockets with other html5 technologies
is really where it gets really
interesting it's not just about the
pipes my name is phil liggett a-- i'm a
developer evangelist to push her push is
a hosted service I'm websockets heretic
or the focus is to make easy for for you
developers to add real-time interactive
functionality and user experiences to
web and mobile apps so as I said web
sockets are up at our core we we make it
possible for you to add WebSocket
bi-directional functionality to to your
web and mobile apps where potentially
you might either not be able to do it
yourself because you're on a platform
that doesn't support WebSockets yet or
or if you you're at the point where you
need to scale this real-time
infrastructure and we obviously has a
hosted service deal with that and I
think our focus that as I've said in the
intro is really about using these
technology
you to create this interactive user
experiences and changing changing the
way the web and because then call it the
living web and I just like to call it
you know the interactive web so that's
the way I think our web applications are
going to go and web sockets are at the
core of that hello my name is Peter
Peter moskovits I'm the developer
evangelist for kissing kissing is based
here in Mountain View we are web
communications platform company we have
a high-performance enterprise-grade
WebSocket server and our founders played
a key role in drafting and working on
the WebSocket standard my passion at
kissing is to visualize web sockets to
make to build applications and
demonstrations that help everybody
imagined and feel and experience what
WebSockets can do for us great thanks
Joe me so what are those I'll pose some
questions to specific people and if any
of the other people want to chime in 44
comments and hopefully we'll have some
time at the end there's a mic there so
hopefully we'll save some time for Q&amp;amp;A
so let me let me bring up we have two
vendors on the panel that are selling
WebSocket technology and when you look
at the technologies like instant obvious
no-brainer we're going to use it right
but are there any barriers to adoption
for web socket what do you see from
customers like I don't want to use that
because of a reason are there any of
those reasons right good so when it
comes to getting started with web stock
as I think the biggest and the most
interesting thing that I sees that we've
been living in this world of request
response where the browser has to
initiate the request and there has to be
a response to that from the from the
middle tier from the application server
tier and just having this mindset or
getting around this mindset and and
realizing that at this point you have
the same functionality in the browser
that we used to have in a thick client
application before the web was
introduced
in back in the client-server world we
had a full duplex connectivity all the
way to the back end and when we
introduced the web one of the major in
inventions was the web browser and what
the web browser introduced was a very
dumb kind of functionality the ability
to render HTML to render markup and this
is what we used it for a very very long
time and with the evolution of of
JavaScript the we suddenly became able
to run full-blown applications inside
the browser now we don't have to create
markup on the middle tier on the
application server tier and then send
that and have the browser render it in a
dumb way now we can actually have fully
blown applications run in the browser
and once these applications are running
in the browser then there's one more
thing that we would really need to
complete the picture and that's to have
a full duplex connectivity all the way
to the back end and that's what web
sockets bring to the to the table so one
thing is getting our heads around this
will duplex truly event-driven
experience and event-driven API that we
have in web sockets the other one is
moving away from the way of thinking
around request response and realizing
that now you can send messages from the
browser to the to the server and from
the server to the browser very very
seamlessly and lastly how we architect
applications we can move away from or
actually open up and build applications
that are not running on the applications
around the middle tier instead they are
running in the browser and that way you
can scale a lot better as well because
you don't have to run them on the
middleware and then the other
a show server nodes so essentially
inertia overcoming inertia for the
existing status quo absolutely okay
filthy ma well I think there's obvious
things such as a browser support I know
it's spoke about all the time but we are
always fighting against browser support
and we rely on polyfills and fullbacks
so that those things are still very
important and you need to prove to
clients that you have those things in
place we use full back to flash and then
we actually use Jess for HTTP fall back
so these sort of things are important
and if it's just a matter of
demonstrating to to potential clients
and developers of this stuff's reliable
and there's obviously the internet
infrastructure as well but we've got I
don't know that we're going to cover
that already but there are things that
interfere with with web socket
connections the secure connection tends
to tends to resolve things but you do
need these fullbacks where proxies are
going to are going to stop a WebSocket
connection I'm they happily deal with
HTTP so that was actually going to be my
question to you guys right so we have
web sockets as a standard which is nice
if it just worked but the problem is we
do have proxies would you have a lot of
things so the question I guess my
question to you guys is how feasible is
that today just use the naked web socket
API and just have that work reliably as
opposed to like if I'm really trying to
push something production do I need poly
fields what are what is the checklist or
should I really just come talk to you
because it's so complicated that nobody
can figure it out I guess I guess you
can look at it in a number of different
ways number one there is there's pretty
much all the IE versions that are out
there I 6i 7 I ate and I 9 do not have
native support for web sockets if you
look at the mobile space most of the
mobile browsers out there don't have
native support for web socket so you
definitely do need polyfoo you need
all the options for that well I think it
depends on who you're building the
application form so if you know the
users I mean it depends me generally
publishing something on the web it's
potentially for everybody but if you
know the users then you might know the
platform that they using so if you know
that they're all using Chrome you know
they're a certain type of user that will
always upgrade their the web browser
then then it will it will work we have
we've got a company users that target
financial clients so they tend to be in
a lockdown network they tend to be using
ie but we actually found that only three
percent of connections failed so that's
actually not bad step but still you want
to reach your hundred percent so you
need this fall back right so for a
meteor how do you guys tackle this
problem we don't use web sockets that's
one way to do it just admit it they
don't work like there we use sock just
as well and I think the technique of
amulet look you want to sock it from the
browser right I don't think anybody
disputes that that's the future you're
going to be able to open some kind of
connection outbound that's full duplex
and bi-directional that's fine but yeah
I mean proxies are a big problem another
one is compression so you know we find
that the downsides of not having native
compression when you use a web socket
are pretty bad especially when your
payload is Jason because it compresses
so well so you're giving up a lot and we
find in production that the different
emulation techniques even even just
basic xhr long pulling actually work
pretty well for most cases so what we've
done is in a meteor app clients don't
even try to use web sockets the server
will answer on a web socket so you're
welcome to if you have a particular
deployment situation that calls for that
that's fine but we just find in the
field that the fall backs work better so
it's actually had a question for you
from Matt so we've been talking about
sort of the user point of view how it
improves the user experience but for
hazard for
developer experience right I mean when I
found your site I said their lives this
is a really cool next generation web
development environment but we could
explain the audience and what would you
guys do Oh with respect to web sockets
or we expect to a real-time
communication real-time web development
yeah I mean there certainly is different
additionally it's actually what I think
everybody appear talked about its
applications are crawling down the wire
to run on a client and the reason is
that you can generally build a better
interface you can build a more
responsive interface and a better user
experience when the software is next to
the person and that's always been true
right Windows desktop software was
better in that respect than the web it's
just that it was so much more convenient
to go to a URL that we displaced a lot
of that old software but look at like
any modern web application even just a
website uses this technique you know the
photo browser on facebook open the web
inspector on these things the photo
browser on facebook sending Jason and
binary data for the photos but Twitter
for all the Hubble you about you know
the slow page load once that page is up
on the screen they're sending json back
and forth google+ gmail right all
structured data all going over the wire
so these are I think the the front line
of this general evolution away from
sending down a pre-rendered page of text
and toward an application that's
receiving updates from the server
asynchronously and that's what you need
a web socket or some kind of connection
that has that character to be able to
write apps that way thanks so I I went
to your session Ilya yesterday about the
speedy and HTTP 2.0 should I just wait
for that and not do anything with
WebSocket yeah right so HP two point oh
and speedy so first of all I should
preface this and say that as of today
web sockets do not run over speedy they
will we are working on it there's a
speck in progress and in fact right now
the team is working on
version for spec of speedy which will
have language about how WebSocket should
be transferred so that the challenges
areas just to figure out how exactly do
you map WebSocket frames or the
WebSocket protocol to speedy frames and
you know we've gone we've gone through a
couple of iterations and I think we have
a pretty good solution so then the next
question is what does that even mean
like what does hp2 point i'll give you
what does website has give you and you
know if you have this multiplexing and
bi-directional stuff aren't they the
same thing so the short answer is
they're not the same thing hpc point 0
will allow you to send multiple requests
and responses and multiplex them over
the same connection so it will actually
enable multiple web socket connections
to be delivered over the same connection
or multiple attack extremes i should say
so you can mocks multiple connections
which is nice but HP 2 point 0 does not
provide any sort of client-side api to
say on message call back do something
HP's point 0 will basically just go to
the browser and say here's your resource
and then the browser can you know put on
so cash or do whatever it needs to do
with it so it's a different layers in
the stack so those two things I think
we'll play well together and I think you
know one of the challenges that we have
is for example the WebSocket group is
currently working on web sockets mocks
right as a proposal and then hpc point 0
will kind of give you that hopefully for
free so then there's question of like I
were just doing the same work twice and
of course they did you know a good
answer to that as well we still need it
for ESP 1.1 but it still feels like
we're duplicating the work a little bit
good point and as you point out here and
you're talking Esther that whenever we
solve a problem we introduced yet
another problem and we're talking about
latency and your and your talk so part
of the the upgrade well part of the
experience of website is the upgrade
will the upgrade add latency sometime in
the future we're going to be talking
about the handshake any latency to the
web yep yep so just a quick comment when
we solve one problem we introduce
another hopefully we won't introduce
another but hopefully will unlock some
other problem that was just hidden right
and I think that's what we're finding
the HP two point O once we solve the
problem or the bottlenecks in HT 1.1 we
just stumbled into other bottlenecks and
TCP and other things that were
previously just hidden from us so on the
handshake side I don't have a good
answer for web sockets in fact is
something that'll be curious to hear
your guys take on but you know I
implemented a WebSocket server way back
in the day like one of the early drafts
draft 76 life was simple man you know
you send you send a request you got an
upgrade or like k i'm done i'm talking
web sockets nowadays it's like extremely
complicated there's extra rtts which
complicates things right so you make the
get request which is a radio latency
then you need to make another request
which is more latency so you introduce
all of these delays which is kind of
antithetical to this whole real-time
experience you're trying to build in HP
2.0 and specifically in speedy we are
running over SSL exactly for the reasons
that these guys mentioned there's a lot
of proxies that get in the way so we
need the end-to-end encrypted tunnel
just to push the frames without anybody
interfering with us which is kind of
unfortunate and ssl specifically you
know has a penalty when you create a new
connection there's the ssl handshake
which introduces more our titties so now
imagine you have that plus web sockets
handshakes and now you're like you're
waiting for two seconds to send any
WebSocket data that's a terrible
experience so I think that's something
that we need to figure out I don't think
there's been any conversations between
the WebSocket group and the kind of the
speedy guys for to see if we can
collapse those things and do it better
but right now speedy or they just beat
so far no working group is trying to
solve the same problem that WebSocket
group ran into with this whole handshake
business yeah just to confirm SSL is the
way how most of our customers deploy
there are web socket applications they
are running WSS WebSocket over over TLS
exactly for those two reasons that that
will you mentioned one is
to establish the a tunnel and the other
one many of our customers are financial
institutions and securities is essential
for them and generally speaking right I
eat on the desktop one on your regular
desktop browser you will likely get a
working WebSocket connection try and
access it on your mobile phone because
all the carriers have some sort of
proxies in between you're basically
mostly guaranteed that it will fail
unless it's SSL so that's one good
reason to look at us so yeah I remember
when I used to work for an investment
bank proxies world was a problem they
were connected to a server across the
street there was like 17 proxies I had
to traverse it's like yep that was
across the street for god sakes well
speaking of mobile so we have cloud and
mobile as two major arrows for us are
there any advantages of WebSocket in
those environments specifically for
mobile and cloud so um well I'm I can't
confirm it but if you think about a
WebSocket connection it's a single
persistent connection between client and
server other although comment solutions
used two connections 14 push from server
to client and the other one for kind of
commands from client to server so that
has the more resource intensive than a
single connection so in terms of mobile
or mobile sorry yeah I would think that
that web sockets are a more efficient
way of communicating so I'd really like
to do a test on that have a have an
application that connects over long
polling have another application that
connects over WebSocket and just have to
grow to mobile phones running and see
what the brat battery drain is I think
that's quite an easy test we can do so
one very kind of simple piece of data
that i have for performance is an
average request response just the
headers in HTTP is about 800 bites so if
you're sending your JSON payload which
is like you know message hello world
that's your 12 bytes or whatever it
works out to be your pending 800 bytes
of HTTP headers on top of that you know
you do the math web sockets allow you
much more efficient framing so you'll
add literally bites on top of that which
could be significant
and obviously for mobile the battery the
men was also these short things really
do matter yes so speaking of mobile two
things to add to that one is battery
life I think not only do we need to
better understand what battery how
battery life is implicated when you use
a WebSocket connection on mobile but
also what measures you can take to save
the battery life basically to see how
the user is interacting with the
application monitor that and maybe a
scale down the number of messages that
are sent to the mobile device or letter
sent from the mobile device the other
very mobile specific thing to think
about is is whether the connection is
there very often in a mobile device it
goes in standby mode or you turn it off
or you go in a tunnel and you get
disconnected so features like
automatically reconnecting to the source
or reinitiating restarting the
connection is another critical one that
we don't really see in a desktop or
laptop kind of environment you know I
just want to add one more thing that I
mean we kind of talked about web sockets
and we think about browsers but web
sockets are a protocol so it's not just
web browsers their libraries out there
to let you create native mobile
applications desktop applications server
to server communication it's it's a it's
really a protocol for real-time
communication on the web so we've got
iOS libraries Android libraries dotnet
libraries so it isn't just a browser no
Matthew do anything specific I mean I
know you use node on a server do you
have anything in a client side that
specifically enhances mobile
applications well I agree the biggest
problem mobile is the network start to
get really shoddy and so you have drops
you have disconnects you have packet
loss what we have found is that the and
and we just took a page from the
architectures the 80s and 90s and the
rise of TCP is a transport the the
semantics for replay and reconnection
are probably best done higher up in the
stack and WebSockets actually pretty
good for that because they don't get in
your way
it's fine if you lose the connection you
can reestablish one I mean the overhead
is unfortunate because of the the
legacies of how we actually talked on
the phone to start a connection but you
know you want to be able to so here's an
example the original web architecture
where you're delivering a document over
HTTP something that you don't worry a
whole lot about is a message replay
right it's no big deal if you issue a
couple of gets it's no big deal if your
initial request is lost and you just
reissue it i mean you hit reload in the
web browser and that does not carry over
very well to this new model where you're
sending these messages back and forth
and some of them may be commands that
have you know state changing effects
when they arrive so you need a story for
how do I over this transport whether
it's a web socket or an emulation of a
web socket or something how do I make
sure that my messages get delivered and
that they're executed once how do I
replay things when I lose them and I
suspect that a lot of that is going to
take place not in the the low-level the
transport but rather you know layer 6 or
7 or wherever it is these days right the
the actual application level so meteor
for example have some opinions about
what the right way to do replay is and
where in the protocol stack that lives
but that's probably not the same as what
you're going to want if you're doing
more of a you know a big fan out of
broadcasting events so I think
websockets rightfully sit below that
layer and I just think of them as TCP
sockets for web browsers so you think
history is going to repeat itself as it
did with TCP that other things would
built on top of DCPS oh yeah well yeah I
mean websockets have some hooks for this
right there's there's sub protocols and
there's the framing is correct I think
to be able to do some of these things so
yeah I think you'll see a lot of
innovation on top of that structure
speedy as well like being able to mux
connections and then you know use those
in different ways over the same actual
socket is really valuable so that's
interesting so what do you go other
gentlemen feel about that but having
these other things to live on top of web
Sokka as opposed to directly programming
against the web socket API so as I
mentioned there's there's ways to mocks
or build other protocols on top up on
top of web sockets which is great
because basically the web sockets gives
you this promise of a very low framing
overhead bi-directional communication
like that these are the building blocks
right and it's going to be reliable but
so I think there will be interesting
things built and something we already
see examples like accusing has great
demos of XMPP running on top amqp all
kinds of protocols right really cool
stuff but at the same time I also want
to highlight that web sockets is also
not the only technology for example we
have a lot we all have a lot of new
api's are coming to the browser for
example we have server sent events
that's not a new API ice actually
existed for a while it kind of doesn't
get mentioned very frequently but it's
very convenient it's basically it's a
one directional way it's a way for the
server to push data to the client
without any of the kind of additional
overhead of doing the WebSockets
handshake and all the rest it only
transfers text data and it specifies a
specific framing format it has auto
reconnect api's like everything all the
stuff is built in so if all you need is
your server push that could be a very
good answer and it works pretty darn
well today in your browser that's cool
we also have recently Microsoft
published a new spec or a new proposal
for the streams API which will allow ex
hrs to stream binary data this was a big
hole previously where you couldn't write
we always said oh it's a stream binary
data that's what you need a web talk is
for well if this this is this is
implemented this is just a proposal at
this point then with X a charge you'll
be able to stream out on a video or
other content directly we also have some
proposals for just like raw sockets you
know I think we're still discussing as
to whether that's a good idea but
there's certainly a lot of people that
believe that that that is something that
should be there so thumbs up from here
yeah so there's a lot of different
technologies here right that we can
leverage to build on these things
so are the complementary or they
orthogonal I think they're all
complimentary so if you just you need to
really kind of sit down and build a
matrix right of like what am I trying to
get for my app and what are these
technologies give me because of for
example service sent events just one way
push if that's all you need that's cool
if the client doesn't need to talk back
right if you need bi-directional and you
want to layer some more intelligent
protocol WebSockets is probably a good
call if all you need is to do streaming
of binary data assuming this streams API
comes in that's probably a good deal
like then you don't have to do the web
socket so all these things I think have
a very good spot for different
applications but currently like Phil
like how many of your customers are
looking at push applications versus or
like the next generation yeah I think a
lot of people talk about web sockets and
they say that I want to how to push
notification to my to my app and that's
fine and like the idea of live content
delivering live content to applications
it is great and it's a it's a
progression and it's something we can do
a lot easier now than we have done in
the past but I do think that it's the
excitement of WebSockets is is the
potential to add interactive
functionality to applications it's it's
not just about pusher I think you know
the events or service and events is fine
and can be used to fit delivering this
live content but I think generally when
we we do abstract upon these these royal
technologies because we want a little
bit more than they offer for instance
the event source does auto reconnect
websockets doesn't so you would nice Lee
they'll need a layer on top of website
gets to handle reconnection but I think
there's generally a little bit of chat
that goes on in terms of subscribing so
the number one use case for for this
sort of technology is pubs up you want
to subscribe to something and you want
the ability to root and publish
information on a certain topic or
subject or channel so I think that's
very important and so you know going
back to your first question I think it's
about WebSockets is about building this
interactive these interactive
applications we're seeing some really
good examples in terms of collaborative
apps like like Google Docs is a great
example of a collaborative application
but I think we need to see people using
web sockets to build more innovative
examples like that right so so we have
all those cool functionality with web
socket and other types of real-time
communication so one of the tenants of
html5 is removing plugins right and one
of their big reasons is that we have
four ways of getting for the black hats
to get in right so we want to reduce
that they only have one door in but now
we have this real-time pipe are there
any security issues now do we should
consider regards to a real-time pipe
like web soccer or any other real-time
communication channel actually before
that may I just jump back to the to the
previous one real quick and then we can
move on to surgery I'd like to approach
this higher level richer business
protocols question and the ability to
build these protocols on top of web
sockets from a slightly different angle
many of our customers are large
enterprises and they do have very
sophisticated enterprise apps deployed
within their firewalls they have
messaging deployed within within their
their firewalls and one of the things
that that brings a major major change to
their lives is that now they have a way
to extend the reach of these rich
business protocols all the way to the
browser all the way to the end user
using these higher level protocols on
top of web socket so one of the things
that we do that is the most popular with
our customers is a JMS JMS is this java
messaging service that many enterprises
use and simply by having JMS like api's
for all sorts of clients including
javascript as well as flash and flex and
and java now the customers can take
their JMS infrastructure and extended
all the way to the browser and their
browser application code speaks the
exact same terminology the exact same
language that they speak within the
firewall within their within
the enterprise and this is very very
popular especially when it comes to
trading applications when it comes to
betting and gaming kinds of kinds of
applications okay so so that's a good
point so regards to security there's a
fat pipe offer the black hat other ways
of getting in so anyone anytime you
provide any new API you provide a hole
for somebody to sneak into you still
have HTTPS right so you can run your
connection over SSL which is great so
you have the protection of that one
thing I guess in general you want to be
aware of is if you have built your own
custom protocol and now you're layering
it or pushing all the Zeta a custom
protocol through that pipe you're on
your own for ensuring that the data the
flowing to that pipe is what should be
there right so for example if you're
just doing request responses HTT
provides a lot of mechanisms to do
authentication verification all all of
those kinds of things right here you can
deploy you can use existing appliances
to kind of rate control and authenticate
etc now that you have this pipe your you
have to do that yourself so you know
that's that's just something you need to
be aware of yeah that's a great point I
was thinking before you asked about the
are all these different techniques
orthogonal or complementary and you know
you look back 30 years ago tcp was one
of many things that sat on top of IP and
it's funny how most of the other ones
just faded away right we really settled
on a particular higher level transport
that had the right characteristics that
turns out ninety-nine percent of what
you want to do on the Internet slots in
very nicely too and I mean that was also
back when I don't think I ETF really
required a Security section and you you
just had the Wild West people would make
these protocols and they didn't know
what they were doing or they didn't care
and and yeah you you had um grossly
inappropriate things at the protocol
layer I suspect we're gonna have to live
through that again right I think we're
in this period where everyone's sort of
casting around for the right level of
abstraction and the right kind of
transport a lot of that work isn't being
done
with respect to I think the the clearest
sense of how to do security and my guess
is that we will converge on something
that's well done and that becomes an
adopted standard and everybody can
essentially build their service on top
of that because you're right like most
most applications shouldn't be inventing
new security paradigms while they're
trying to get their data into the web
browser right and that is unfortunately
where we are today any other comments so
so we have this functionality hopefully
what we'll address and I guess we are
addressing someone to security what new
types of applications are we're going to
see I mean what new types of development
environments what types of telecom
collaborative applications beyond just
simple push you know that get the
canonical pushing prices to to a browser
right that's what chat application okay
we we've seen this for 10 years since
com so what are the next generation
collaborative things we can build a web
socket well so from the meteor
perspective the the model we like is if
you look at api's on the web they're
almost always about synchronizing or
coordinating two views of the same data
and when you really follow that path all
the way down and you have a way to have
a distributed app so you've got all
these different clients thousands or
millions of clients running at the same
time and they all have a related view of
the world right so some some set of data
that they share you can build a lot of
really interesting things so you know
that primitive lets you get away from
this sort of let's build a chat system
where we've got messages that just get
you know insert it into the DOM and
let's actually build an application
whose business logic and where all the
heavy lifting is actually happening on
the client with this this local set of
data that it has access to I mean my
guess is that to some degree it's not
that they're going to be new kinds of
apps it's that we're going to
throw away the implementations that
we're done using web technology like the
the you know HTTP HTML kind of stuff and
rebuild them in this new style where me
web browsers you've got OpenGL you've
got sound you've got right all of these
things are now possible inside the
browser and I I just suspect that it'll
look a lot like you know when we finally
could write real software on desktops
and PCs and it will just you'll see this
role explosion of newer interfaces and
more interactive techniques that they
are just too difficult to do with the
web so let me try maybe a roundabout way
of answering this question I don't think
there's a specific like one application
that is a killer application it's just
the way we distribute these things and
what we can enable so to backtrack maybe
some of you guys saw this there's a
there's a project that kind of
circulated few weeks back called gift
socket which is like blew my mind most
awesome thing ever so that it's a
glorious pack and the way it works is it
even works in IE 6 so the idea is you
have a gif image and the browser when it
reads the image it starts to display the
frames and the sources displayed even
before it receives all the data right so
you can stream data through a gif into
ie6 and that's your what that's your
socket so I mean that's that's awesome
right this is like this is WebSockets of
the 90s except nobody knew we just found
out so really cool stuff but the reason
I'm saying this like everything old is
new again right so we're talking about
all these technologies so the browser
for the longest time the browser has
been or it plays kind of a
straightjacket and what we could do
inside of it and that straitjacket was
HTTP request response I think in a
couple of years you'll look back and you
find that the browser has all of the
capabilities that you find in your
native environment today you can open a
socket you can have it can even talk UDP
we have WebRTC working on data channel a
proposal yet another API which will
actually give you ability to do
unreliable delivery or thus part of
WebRTC but it's applicable to anything
so you can build games etc so all these
things you
previously had to have a native app you
can you'll be able to do in the browser
and then the question as well now that
you can have all this flexibility to
build any app as you would on the native
platform what does the browser give you
on top of that and the advantages there
is well you don't need to build it ship
it in your shrink wrap it or put it an
app store it's right there it's
available you can push out notifications
instantly there's collaboration so it
kind of it enables a new class of
applications around that which i think
is really interesting and I think that's
where we're going to go yes I mean I
think the web now is our number one
communication platform and I see web
sockets and specifically in it wrapping
it in with html5 WebSockets as being
courted to this new communication
platform that we've got so I think it's
about using the new technologies we've
got with html5 as well as the ability to
and some interact to build you know
either these collaborative applications
or I think I think we've been
specifically those guys that have been
using this technology for a long time
and amount of times you've seen flashing
grids or trade tickets that it's
sometimes quite difficult to see beyond
that and I think we need to be bringing
in people who had a UX people that
understand ways that people can interact
with with these applications these web
applications in different ways I think
and beyond just just the mouse thinking
cross cross device communication the way
that we can use the accelerometer and
things in our inner mobile devices so I
don't think there's a specific answer
about these killer applications yet as
was said but I think we now have web
sockets is a great way for real-time
communication and the other technologies
within html5 and you know on mobile
native as well that that open up the
opportunity to really to really
experiment and find better ways of
communicating um pretty much everything
was said before me so I'd like to just
very quickly summarize that we see two
fundamentally different classes of
applications that our customers are
building one is the type of application
where the data a large amount of data is
available in the servers
site that needs to be pushed out to a
large number of clients to all sorts of
heterogeneous kinds of clients including
mobile so this is more of the trading
and betting kind of application and the
other type of application is more of the
peer-to-peer kind of app we are trying
is trading embedding are they different
training and so the peer-to-peer kinds
of applications where you have a device
or a browser or a desktop app that's
interacting with another device or
browser or desktop app out there so I
think that's going to be very exciting
and interesting one you're just a point
on that is it can be one too many as
well which is the exciting thing there's
only many people collaborating just
communicating and there's one thing that
I think we should we should very quickly
mention the relationship of HTTP and web
sockets and what is happening with HTTP
now that web socket is there and whether
HTTP is replaced by web socket so
basically and probably a needless to say
to many of you is that HTTP has its own
place HTTP is absolutely there to here
to stay for serving up assets things
like HTML and CSS and JavaScript and
images and then WebSocket is going to
play a very crucial role in the in the
bi-directional real-time data exchange
so as we said having a full-blown
application running inside the browser
basically the starter app gets to the
browser tends to get to the browser
through HTTP and once the app has been
downloaded we don't have the maintenance
nightmare like we had in the
client-server world it's all running
inside the browser and at that point the
browser can talk to the backend and the
application can get the dynamic data
from the back end through web sockets
very missable so maybe just a quick
comment on top of that I've actually
seen a couple of companies or open
source projects where specific projects
are actually replacing or trying to
replace HTTP with WebSockets it's like
to hell with it right we'll just open a
WebSocket connection and we'll mocks our
own protocol to deliver all the
resources not a good idea it they have
good intentions in a sense that there
there are limitations so for example if
you're transferring these small payloads
have this giant overhead on every
request yeah it hurts right so that's
one good reason why I think people are
doing this but in the long run that's
exactly what we're trying to solve with
HP two point oh and by doing your by
maxing your own protocol on top you
bypass the browser cache all of the kind
of pre fashion capabilities a browser
all these things that you get for free
right so I'm hoping that we can we're
not hoping we will address that in HTTP
two point oh and you know WebSockets is
not a replacement for HTTP good point
good point okay I think we are out of
time so I guess we'll be up front for a
few minutes until I kick us out so thank
you everybody see you next year
