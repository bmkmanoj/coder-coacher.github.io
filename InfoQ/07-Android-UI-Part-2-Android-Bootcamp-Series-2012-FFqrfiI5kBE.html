that we did is we talked about the two
different approaches to UI so this is
one place where Android is sort of
different than what you guys might have
experienced through Java right so what
we do is we create some kind of XML file
usually first then we switch to Java so
it's usually this way right and it's
usually that this is the first thing we
do and then this is the second thing we
do
that's sort of the best practice you
don't have to do it this way but that's
the typical way it works right so in the
context of that we said all right so
let's let's begin let's start working on
the XML file right so what we did
yesterday is we created essentially
equivalent of yellow world like Yamba so
far doesn't really do much doesn't do
anything right so what you did the only
file that we tackled is the layout we
change its name from main to status but
that's hardly a work right so we started
working on this and as soon as this is
loaded I'll show you it's interesting
for 404 303 OS intercept slow not sure
if for us any faster so um this is our
UI as of yesterday right so what we did
is we said all right so we want to
create we want to create an app that is
gonna have its gonna be a stylish app so
I'm gonna see some kind of text right
I'm gonna see a button and then I'm
going to see a big white box right
basically the same design you saw
yesterday running the only things I've
flipped the button from bottom to top
because I realized it's a much better
user experience yeah yes yeah you don't
have to use XML talk about what really
happens behind the scenes the magic yeah
well look into that mm-hmm good question
so like I said UI is that's to be one of
the things you spend the most energy in
Android
and it tends to be one thing that is
usually confusing this is by the way
chapter six in the book and it's it just
basically exploded as a chapter so it
became you know it could be like a book
on its own just an Android UI right so
we're just scratching the surface here
now best practice e UI being done the
easiest is to do it in iterations so
first thing I do is I'll just drop
widgets onto the screen right that's
what we did yesterday we just drops
three things and you can also see it
here right because you have there's your
linear layout there's our piece of text
button and editable text right so a
couple of things that we introduced
yesterday is we introduced this property
here like this is what you guys did
yesterday you use these these two
buttons right remember what they do yeah
so they specify the width and height and
they're very depressed or they're really
straight so unique it's binary we got
two options right now the and the
options were fill parent also known as
matched pair --nt in wrap content so
you're actually if you look at the XML
you're gonna get three options but fill
parent and that parent are one of the
same they just renamed it from fill
parent to match parent for whatever
reason in two X version and then wrap
content just wraps the content so that's
that's what we did yesterday another
thing that we did so we said for this
guy to be to be a fill parent with wise
right but we said it should be a wrap
content high twice right and for this
guy we said fill parent feel parent take
all the available space right nothing
you guys need to do for now but just
kind of want to show you a couple of
things so this guy if I wanted to have
it take all the available space bam bam
easy right now what if I wanted this guy
to actually be bigger so I could go here
and press this button right what just
happened
what is happened to my edit tax it's
actually not overlapped um but it's it's
right here it's off of the screen so
what happens is the system goes like
this it says it goes to the top dog
which is our linear layout it says
linear layout how much space do you need
well typically you're top dog wants to
take all the available real estate right
that that's the only way it makes sense
usually so it's a usually these guys
feel parents feel parent right mmm
so then it goes linear layout goes to
its children one by one and says hey
child number one how much space do you
need let's just talk horizontally
vertically right since it's how much
space we need piece of text and piece of
Texas I just want to wrap my own font
right content which is this large font
and Daddy says fine I'll give you that
much real estate so we chop off that
from the entire real estate right so
comes to the button we come to the
button and we say button button how much
space do you need and now the button
says I want to get all the space from
your daddy right so it gets all the
space right now by the time the youngest
child comes along youngest child is
crude there's no more space left right
it wasn't planned it's kind of like you
know it's just another proved in sucks
being the youngest child right so
especially if your siblings are all
their siblings are grading so and so
that's how this this works that's how
that's how the system is laying things
up for those of you could use layouts in
Java it works exactly the same way right
just in Java we it was a has your panel
would has because the relationship
talked to a layout as opposed to is
that's the only difference but
everything else is the same so um so
what I could do is I could you know I
could return this back but then how they
what what if I want it this button what
if I wanted these two buttons to
actually be these two elements to
actually be the same height you don't in
this case but there just to kind of
illustrate another point what people do
we could actually say and I'm sure
there's a button for that but I usually
do it these kinds of things right from
the properties right by the way we
talked about this you guys have
properties available to you here right
if you don't you can whenever you're
missing a window right Eclipse hears
gazillion of them just go under window
show view and then if it's not here then
go under other and then just find it
it's gonna be under general but in
general yes there gazillion properties
available so it used to be in the past
the reason why I'm so used to this isn't
in the past we didn't have a button for
that right these buttons didn't exist so
I actually have to do everything from
here right and so these are gazillion
properties like if you take a look at
the button right and check out how many
properties you can check change in a
button right by the way no normally the
next question is like well how do we
know which property does what right
where is the documentation for this I
think the best documentation is actually
eclipse itself so you can like put you
can put like you know your mouse over it
and tells your tax apply that for this
view containing blah blah right scroll
acts and so on I mean you can go to the
official documentation but it's not as
intuitive as using Eclipse in this case
so I think it is the best documentation
so what I could do so there's our
there's there's our layout layout width
and layout height right fighting with
yeah so now if I wanted to say feel a
match parent or fill parent that's where
my 3d button comes in what you can
change now is you can say there's a
property called weight okay and you can
basically say change the weight of this
you know how serious we are about this
intention so the weight is basically a
number it's a number between 0 and 1 so
it's all confusing on the way I usually
explain it is you know 0 means don't
care about anyone else
right I want it then I want it now like
my daughter right and one would be yield
to all the other siblings right so
you're saying daddy daddy I want all the
space but if anybody else wants some all
the yield to them as well right so
basically if I put one here then I have
a button that now yield it's too much so
it's gone because this guy the church so
yielded to the third child won't
purchase that I want it all right so the
fair game would be if both children
yield it to each other so now we have a
perfect 50/50 split right they're both
saying daddy we want all the space but
we're gonna be you know we're mindful of
others right so that's one approach that
works well and of course you can play
with these numbers it doesn't have to be
zero and one could be like sixty forty
percent and so on right so if you want
forty percent you put point six right
it's gonna reverse because one means
fully dealing it's all it's a little
weird now you may say to yourself you
know forget about all this weight stuff
right like I can just go and for height
I mean I don't have to use this match
parent fill parent like these two
options right you can actually use any
number you want you could go in here and
you can say I want to use I want this to
be and don't do this plus 200 pixels or
like let's pick a bigger number that's
the three kind of pixels right you can
actually see it 400 pixels right now
what is what is the problem with this
approach yeah so so there are two
problems first of all we're not
acknowledging the density of a screen
right how many how many pixels do you
have per inch what does it mean
px pixel actually makes no sense
whatsoever anymore
I think today's day in in you know day
and age that we live in density of a
screen is something that just keeps on
changing like rapidly right so for
example most of your modern phones are
240 dpi I think I think iPhone has
3:20 like extra dents your old-school
sort of you know dad one we actually see
that one or g1 phone
they're like hundred sixty dpi anything
else you cannot see pixels at some point
right so on to it should fix the first
problem one better than px is to use
something called DP DP or depth you if
they're synonyms so you can use either
one like you can use depth if that rolls
of the tongue is here dipping DP
basically specify the our density
independent pixels so what that means
that at 160 dpi one px equals one VP so
as we have a dancer screen the button is
itself gonna just how many pixel that
works out to be to be consistent so
that's you can basically safely forget
pixels and switch to DPS from going
forward so if it's not so what's the
full screen height in depth if it's not
an issue of pixels anymore that really
depends on the device so but the last
count we can I think 453 different
devices in the market so at 160 dpi you
have one pixel cross one DP
so if I have 240 dpi a big device which
is your standard nowadays that means
that I need one-and-a-half pixels for
the equivalent depth just because I got
much more pixels available to me
it's a dancer screen so the system is
going to adjust that automatically
it will be the same yeah it yeah it will
be the same actual in interest it will
be a prolonged yeah
yeah it would be equivalent in inches so
we're basically making up for the fact
that some screens are such kept such a
big pixels in some are much more fine
fine grained yeah yeah yeah well yeah
the owner 160 dpi screen it's exactly
160th of an inch right on this is 240 an
iPhone it's 320 inside yeah I just you
know guys in Korea or Asia are just
packing way more pixels in the same
screen making it much sharper so that's
what's going on um so so so like I said
this actually you know a takes into
account the fact that we are not going
to have the you know different densities
of screen but it's still not a very good
practice to do it this way because of
the it's not a very it's not a UI that's
going to adjust itself well for
different devices and configurations and
so forth so you should really try to use
one of those two right feel pain or
match parent and if you know wrap
content and that's a better approach so
layout to wait so yeah so let me uh let
me give you guys something so I actually
so like I said you have gazillion
properties here and you could be
overwhelmed there's so many properties
right like which ones do I care about so
I kind of created this list and this is
just for my experience these are the
properties you care about all right so
and by the way this like may be missing
in the slide deck so I'm gonna add its
like to copy it over so I just forgot
about the slide side today so on these
two properties you universally care
about every single budget every single
view
always gonna have with him height right
it just must otherwise it can be drawn
because we don't know how big it is
right so that you must have it's a long
right
you break it your app won't work these
are sort of my commonly used things so
wait
like I said how great your generous
widget is it's a number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 1
means your own l0 which is the default
means don't care about anyone else the
other one that's kind of common is
gravity the problem gravity is basically
the Android lingo for alignment right
the problem is that we got two so
yesterday yesterday we cheated we just
kind of said oh I want this text to be
in the middle so we went here and we
said all right let's just Center it and
that worked through the magic didn't
really care what happened behind the
scenes what happened behind the scenes
is we have updated to one of those
gravities so one gravity is the plane of
gravity and the other one is layout
gravity what they do a different thing
so so basically layout gravity is going
to position the blue box well then you
know it's gonna Center it within its
parent here's a different color so this
is its parent right make sense
so that could work in this case in the
center the the other gravity would
actually position the text itself within
the blue box itself so centering text
within the blue box wouldn't do much let
me show you so basically if I let me do
it like this I can't like this tool is
too smart together you know we had this
situation right so if I just did gravity
and I said gravity center in click from
da da da and say Center all right not to
happen yeah actually dead it's centered
at X within the box the problem is that
the box is so small it's like okay I'm
in central but you know not a lot of
space to move right but in this case if
the box was
bigger so if this box was actually fill
pant then that gravity of the world you
don't care about any of this it's like
try one and if it doesn't work for ideal
but they do different things one
position is the content within the box
dealing in the position of the box
within the pan right so far so good
um say their way so yes in this case we
said center which would gonna apply both
width and height the problem or not the
problem but the reason why it didn't do
anything substantial what height wise is
because we had the rap content at so for
example if this guy actually did feel
parent then it would have been in the
middle right if the pant was actually
begged and sent training it within the
big parent you would have seen the
difference maybe but we had this kind of
situation but this is tiny high twice
just wrap content and that's why he
doesn't do much yeah so what happens
with the fields that are set blank right
what what values do they have on I'll
show you a tool with electron that's
going to well I guess I can show you a
tool right now it doesn't really matter
there's a couple of tools that I'm going
to be showing is we keep on going one of
the course is a tool called hierarchy
viewer yeah you guys got it it's part of
your SDK everyone's got it you just type
hierarchy viewer you'll type the whole
thing right hierarchy viewer interesting
and it fires up that tool well why would
you care about this tool and this tool
was designed to to help you optimize
your UI right so for example if I launch
my app
some points my absence artfully
there's this so if I if I now I go and I
say yeah I say let's load the higher key
for this particular UI all right so what
this tool does is basically now loads
the hierarchy of the current screen my
current screen is this screen right so
what you can see is its hierarchy so
basically I can I can move around I can
kind of see all the structure of my UI
is right you can double click on various
pieces if you want to see the height of
that view all right so this is my entire
screen the phone screen right this would
be that but - the the table all right
this will be my piece of text there's
not much this would be the title bar and
then this is where our stuff starts
right yeah and then you can kind of see
that this is our linear layout right
there's our large trucks there's our
button and there's our area right um you
you type hierarchy viewer command line
I'm assuming it's in your path it's in
your SDK it's in the in the tools as the
case large goals which you should put in
a path so then you can just type it
anywhere but otherwise you can just
double click you know go open it up up
there
but it's part of the as they came so so
this is just a piece of text this is the
you know the actual button and so on so
for example if you wanted to see you
know the properties of the button that
we don't normally you can set the
probabilities are right here so let's
see layout you know it's kind of small
so let me zoom in but you can see that
you know get baseline is 41 get five to
72 Direction is in carat weight is 14
480 and you know
bottom margin is this left margin is
that blah blah blah measurements the
size are 72 by 480 in padding is you
know 1716 10 and so on and so on okay so
in other words run time is gonna set
properties if you guys are doing
something that needs to be pixel perfect
this is a good tool for that right if
you don't set some property the run time
wall said at the end of the day mostly
things are set possibly other things you
can see the UI here make us so this tool
actually can work on any you are so this
is home screen right palm spin so more
complex than our status activity let's
say clock
yeah so in Cairo a view it shows you it
shows you it says launcher and then you
say I want to open up with launcher so
the point of this tool is to help you
optimize your UI right so first of all
you can look into it and you can can
explain try to figure out what's going
on as you can see this UI is fairly
complex I mean look at how much stuff
there is right right
so what different dots mean I looked at
it at one point and it's like one is
memory the other one is CPU the third
one is something else it's not very
intuitive but they basically you know
green green green would be a good object
but rather red red would be the worst
object and I forget exactly which dot
means what
yeah but keep in mind that this is
basically designed for optimizing the UI
in a nutshell you want you you are to be
flat not deep right so notice how this
structure notice call these structures
fairly flat right I mean we don't have
for number of objects we have it's all
sort of more or less it's very wide
right it's not very deep are the colors
mean different things and I forget it's
like memory CPU like time to draw memory
consumption is something else yeah yeah
green green is good orange yellow is so
so in red is poor so it gives you an
idea what how long what takes to drop to
render so the system you can help
basically with that but we got to this
because we were talking about the
properties that were set by the system
right so first again
if you invalidate a layout that causes
it to redraw so it's gonna cause it to
basically eventually have the system but
it right I'm not sure not sure yeah you
can use it we you can use it with the
actual phone as well yeah so see if I
plug it in
so if I go to arcavir it's finding
devices hopefully my device responds
you can actually one of the things that
you can do eventually when this comes up
let's see um for some reason it's not
responding let me try this again so if I
view this now it's just connecting to
the emulator should work with the
physical device but one of the things
you can do is you get the view word for
pixel-perfect graphics so you can
actually look into various pixels and
get the RGB codes those pixels
yeah something's not responding the
device itself is not respond let me see
what happens when I do adb devices that
says it's there oh yeah there's a view I
believe it's this button or something or
inspect screenshot and you can actually
do a pixel perfect like intersection of
the graphics on the screen okay so let's
move on so we were talking about so far
about the cone properties I mentioned
layout width and height we talked about
gravity in weight right and the next one
I would do is text right so we have our
graphics currently looks like this it's
not very user friendly it says large
text and so on so we positioned
everything the way you want it now we
will go do a second iteration we
actually adjust the text do you think we
will change the text okay we could I
mean we can do everything from XML yeah
so the XML looks like this right so well
you know there's the text large text you
know don't do this but they could change
it to something like status update yeah
so that worked yeah and that actually
changed the text property here so that
will work let's get it straight to that
approach 20 words it's not a proper
approach why can't change the way you
can change the language it's static yeah
so so basically the best approach to do
with strings is to basically put strings
outer strings into strings the xml file
and then to refer to them usually in
this way yeah so you typically want to
outsource your text to a text file
because
this file status XML is in a layout
director it's a layout so as such it's
concerned about laughs it's not concern
about the the other stuff like English
for instance right so what we would do
is we the proper way would be to go to
strings you know to create a new string
totally click on a plus give it a key
something like status update and give it
a value
right so what they did is I created a
new standard sublet key value pairs
right so I open up strings.xml and I
click on this little button here a plus
so far so good soon so now let's go back
to this the proper approach here would
be to say to find a property called text
right and supposed to so I select this
find proper call text and say add string
slash status update so the result is the
same
but now I outsource the actual value of
the text to another string
so if we have International Version it
would automatically translate it and so
on and so if you're done with this one
just you can do the button next right
click on the button now show you the
shortcut for this because doing this in
too fast it's kind of it could be a lot
to work right here's a shortcut you can
right click on the button say edit text
right and this actually gives you a
chooser to choose the text these are
these are the things that should be kept
currently defined in your strings.xml
right well the one we want is not there
for the button alright so what you can
do is you can say new string and bring
some not a dialog to quickly create a
new string now it's a little confusing
because it's in its first of all it's
very large the dialogue and secondly its
reverse right so the key is the second
parameter the value is the first so you
could say something like button update
and you may say update thank so the
first time as you English the second one
is its name
no I mean yeah if you want to provide a
different one for Spanish sure but yeah
I would not worry about this at this
point so I would usually worry about all
those alternative resources tore at the
end of the project because otherwise you
just have to kind of like maintain like
you want to add the button you know I
have to think about all the 15 languages
you're supporting right ah you know let
me just get it right in English and then
at some point we're gonna just go in and
you know translate the entire accent ah

or even better just give it to somebody
else to do it for us because we can so I
kept on oh okay that now actually
injected that string into streams XML
file right so now I can select it from
here and then there's my Apple
so that actually added a value here
towards things that smell
so you in theory you don't even need the
streams XML to be open because you can
use that traffic
I didn't you don't wanna modify the
other string oh you're talking about
what would you put in that field so
that's the key so the key is whatever
you want to put I called mine button in
the score object now this brings a good
point actually
um this key value pair list right it can
explode really quickly right yeah we
don't even care any you I really have
like four properties at some point
imagine you have a medium-sized app you
may have like a hundred different pieces
of text so how you're gonna name them so
that you can find it because there's no
namespace right everything is flat so
that's why you know you can you can
create your own sort of coding standards
some people like to prefix it with what
would domain that it's in so if this is
a status domain I'm working on status
activity I mean your status underscore
button down this corruptive right so
just really depends on your project in
your team but you keep in mind that this
is a flat list
can you reference multiple XML files you
can certainly you can have multiple XML
files yes and they're gonna you're gonna
see the union of what you see is
available strings is gonna be the union
of those things yes but when you say r
dot string dot or when you say ad string
slash then there's no namespace still
itself you may have it in my string your
string bobby string right XML but
ultimately it's gonna be string slash
it's behind-the-scenes this is just a
file like this see it's a resource and
then a bunch of strings so this could
live in a different file it doesn't have
to be strings.xml a string actually
refers to the type of research so your
text is going yeah this text here it
goes so let's do the final one which is
the text area text area doesn't you
wanna put some kind of text there to
tell the user to type in a message right
but if you type in text like we've done
so far then the user is going to have to
delete the text first right before they
can start typing and that's extremely
annoying right so there is a property
called hint right which is that gray out
text the moment you start typing into it
it just disappears mix-ins um so here's
another shortcut because I don't think
hint you can get from here okay there is
a little hint okay so you could do it
here or you can actually new properties
there's usually a da da da ting by the
way this never worked in Linux I don't
know if they fixed it eventually but
this wall dawdle dot doesn't normally
work on Macs but you can actually do
that as well so you know select what
you're working on so for example I want
to change the hint dollar god I don't
have my key and to create a new string
so I say hint I may say please enter
your status update okay
that's making in BAM that's why
oh it's you click on it you touch it you
start typing so the hint disappears once
you start typing once you select the box
once it gets in focus then you save the
file and then you can test
what's up yes yes
yeah this is kind of weird he keeps
losing the information
what do you change the king size it's
gonna be the size of the text that's in
the box so you go into the text size
property some of the same size as the
text all right so why is my device so
fine
somebody's launch so you make him notice
that I had for text appearance here
that's how I made it large from the
first piece of text I made it text
appearance large that's an attribute
that somebody defined somewhere
by the way one of the cultural things in
Eclipse is that if you know if your code
is not organized very well you can
format it so you can basically go source
format and see how that fixes everything
to fit things anyway
very useful you could change a bag you
can change the background of things so
for example if I wanted to make my
button be blue I can select it I can go
into properties I can go into background
and I could actually type in the RGB
code for blue which is a 0 0 F for
example right now I have one blue button
right not a very pretty button yeah
myself it's smaller because the previous
button actually used an image for the
background right so that's that's
partially why um ok so we're not gonna
do it for the button
let's do for example for the big area oh
how do I now select my I want to change
the background of my background of the
entire thing
ok I selected huh what do i click i mean
it's it's all like i don't really have
the place to like mean it's kind of hard
yes
that's what that's why i outline is very
useful because you can go here and
select it so you can select that's why
you know I have the outline and I can
then go property cynical change the
background to for example pound right so
now I have a blue background not too
pretty
I mean don't judge me for my design
skills but it is a blue background right
now what if I wanted to have this white
box actually be somewhat translucent
so we can see our beautiful blue
background yes you can specify the alpha
channel as well so I can select this
area and if I say just found FFF then
it's just white but if I say alpha
Channel like for example C FFF right so
then it's white but it's somewhat
translucent so that's why the blue is
gonna come through what do you mean yeah
so those those values so your standard
RGB values standard sort of yeah yeah
you would look it up I mean it's just a
record yeah so well if you pay more if
you leave more money than yes there is
yeah it's it's not available in the free
version it's available in the premium
version of Eclipse so so if there is
something called a we could actually
define the background color look we can
do some like this look on we can define
our own colors so you could specify
colors there's a resource for that so I
could do something like this like I
could go up to my resources I could
click on plus right to create a new type
of resource yes
just like we created did you create a
new resource so far maybe not yeah so
again you could listen like this go file
new Android XML file so you get it XML
file editor so in here you could say I
want to create a file called owner
colors
XML right it's not a layout it's gonna
be a list
it's a color know they're always gonna
be frame adjust maybe let's try that
let me try I normally don't use trouble
so I usually use values and then color
let's see so drawable colors XML and
then color see this is when you get this
it doesn't know what you're talking
about or I can add Missy if it's
actually smart enough so if you right
click on it you can say open with AHA
color editor let's see so let me do it
like this I'm gonna create the new
values but resource colors XML and see
here I can add in our color and I can
give it the name right so I can say my
blue so what they did is in I create new
values or resource so I selected
resource or values there's no matter
right values click on the little a plus
I'll go file new Android XML file so
here I chose values and specify a file
named colors XML
so it doesn't thanks ballasts entire sex
now
right so click on Ally that creates a
new file it's usually a blank file you
then say add and then it gives you a
list of things you could be adding so
far we only saw strings right that you
can add a new color and then a color in
Tulsa here values specified as an RGB
blah blah blah you can do a RGB if you
have a alpha Channel so it's your
standard red green and blue right plus
the Alpha Channel so my blue maybe
something like c00 you put a little in
strings.xml but then that would be a
string this case it's an element both
color so if you notice and the resources
it knows this is an element for color
yeah thanks yeah thanks for uh I can't
yeah yeah so now if I go back to my
status as opposed to hard coding that
color blue if I specify this is opposed
to hard coding the value here just like
with string so you want to outsource
this to another file so I could actually
outsource it to color my blue right so
this guy is concerned with layout not
with color so I altered the actual value
of the color to another place a place
for color which happens to be in a
various colors build.xml
yeah so it's not the time it's the file
name itself is not important what's
important is this the the type of
resources same with strings to say a
string object happens to land in father
for strings.xml
so far so good
okay so you guys can play with some of
these cosmetic stuff we're gonna talk
about the image just a little bit but
then you're gonna quickly switch to Java
so that's the point basically right so
this is sort of like you know you can
keep on going and exploiting xml but you
saw the main sort of properties there's
obviously gazillion other ones which are
you know whichever ones are interesting
you can you can troll extrapolate for
this point a lot of these things it
sounds good cool so let's do it stem
today let's do a short break and then
we're gonna continue with images and
then we're gonna do the job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
