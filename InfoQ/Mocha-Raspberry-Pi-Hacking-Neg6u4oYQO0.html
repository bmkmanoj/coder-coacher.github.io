chin and I'm going to be talking about
what you can do with raspberry pi
specifically Java on Raspberry Pi I am a
Java technology ambassador for Oracle so
I speak about Java technologies I'm
probably best known for the book I wrote
on javafx but have also been doing a lot
with embedded technologies over the past
year and this will be a pretty
interactive session so you guys can stop
me at any time you want to ask questions
interact and likewise I get to ask you
questions when I feel like it and
hopefully somebody in the audience is
nice enough to respond alright so Java
runs on a bunch of different devices
which you might not even know everything
from small devices like parking meters
RFID intelligent power meters medium
sized devices like routers and switches
home automation network systems and then
big devices like cars and and printers
and stuff I was actually just in Japan
chatting with a bunch of printer
companies like Kenan and Rico and it's
surprising how much java technology
these guys use in their in their
products traditionally you've seen Java
ME used in embedded devices Java ME is a
subset of the Java platform and has some
small changes and deviations to make it
run better and extremely low memory
footprint devices as a results you need
to modify your applications to get them
to run in Java me what I'm going to be
showing you guys today is java SE
embedded the nice thing about java SE
embedded is you can use all the same
tools and technologies you use on
desktop applied to embedded devices and
run it on really really small chips so i
have i brought toys
so on this is an example of the
Centurion module it has inside of it a
little arm processor a 3g chip and on
the back is an LGA mount where you can
mount this on an existing embedded board
to integrate with other devices and you
program the chip using Java currently
Java ME although they're working on a
java SE embedded build the ARM processor
they're running is powerful enough to to
do either and it lets you hook up
wireless connectivity to a lot of
systems where you might otherwise have
trouble getting in a small form factor
so one example of where they've used
these I'm actually I'm going to pass
these around the room so you guys can
can take a look so if you wouldn't mind
and I'll give one to this side of the
room if someone wouldn't mind is just
bringing it back up to the front don't
don't mind interrupting the session you
can just pop up so that's an example of
a really really tiny device and one
place where they've used those is in the
rainforest so they used a chip like this
to track rainforest deforestation people
cutting down trees and taking them away
from the rainforest and what they would
do is they would make small cut outs in
the trunk insert a module which had
power a chip like this and a GPS and
accelerometer on it so when the tree
fell over they could track by the
accelerometer that it or the gyroscope
that had fallen and then GPS for current
location and then transmitted over 3g so
they could track it so a cool use of
small embedded technology and you guys
are all java hackers i'm sure you could
come up with much more interesting use
cases for java running on really small
embedded devices so what we run going to
be primarily focusing on today is java
running on the Raspberry Pi okay that
cable doesn't want come out take it at
this end so this is a Raspberry Pi in a
in a clear case it's a $35 computer how
many of you guys already have raspberry
PI's okay a few the rest of you should
buy one tell your boss this is for very
important prototyping work I'm sure
they'll be happy to happy the t1 up for
you and it's it's almost a little
computer I have some of the specs on the
next page here so the the processor the
system on a chip is in the center there
it's a broadcom BCM 2835 the model b has
512 megabytes of memory so you can run
real programs on it it runs it 700
megahertz by default but you can crank
it up to a gigahertz overclocking it and
it runs cool enough you don't even need
to put any sort of fan or heat sink on
it you can just air cool it even inside
of a plastic case like this and that's
the reason they use chips like this and
small embedded form factors like the see
Tyrion ship I showed you this is an arm
11 it so it's an arm v6 processor and
you can run full linux on it so you can
run DB in which is what i'll be running
today our clinics and there's a couple
other distributions which work as well i
think the only distribution which
doesn't work is a bun too because they
stuck with the arm v7 for their releases
so i'm not sure if they plan on ever
back boarding back to arm v6 to support
the Raspberry Pi and it has a lot of
interconnectivity so you can hook it up
to different displays and devices so
there's hdmi that's what i'll be using
for the display today to show you guys
what's happening on here also vga you
can hook it up to a TV what do you out
put a couple USB ports an ethernet port
one thing to note about the USB ports is
it's both powered via USB so there's a
USB jack on the back
which you can supply power to the the
newer devices ones that came out with in
the past I think pretty much 2013 you
can actually power them off the the
output USB ports as well the the host
was it hosts or client I forget oh thank
you very much you guys are very
efficient if you didn't get a chance to
see it for some reason you can just hop
up and grab one so you can actually
power it off the host USB but there's
another USB port on the back
specifically for powering it don't power
it off both that's usually not a good
thing to do and it also has GPIO pins on
top and this is where you get a lot of
hardware connectivity so you can use the
GPIO pins to hook it up to accelerometer
hook it up two buttons which is anything
which supports an I squared C bus and
I'll talk a little bit about the
software you would need to control that
for the job as the embedded release
alright so I've been talking about the
hardware and we have a few folks who
have this so do our do our Raspberry Pi
experts know what these two funky
connectors on top or 4 i'm sure if you
have one you've always wondered what the
the weird ports on top it kind of its
funky it pops up and you don't you don't
have a capacitor oh it still works ok
I've heard I heard about pokes putting
really big caps on here I think it's I
think it's meant for power surges so it
can supply uneven power input if you put
large enough caps on then you can
actually keep it powered if it runs at a
power for a few seconds and they use
that for netbooks sometimes when you
hook it up to a netbook for a display
screen when you open or close to display
the USB cuts out so if you really big
caps on it you can keep it running okay
so anyway back to these two
anyone wanted to venture a guess there
there there for ribbon cables you look
like you know maybe ya know alright so
one of these is for the raspberry pi
camera so they just released a camera
module on the Raspberry Pi site and it
is pretty cool it hooks up be a ribbon
cable and you can use it for you can use
it for displaying video limit let me get
you a picture what that looks like and
we even have network you can also use
usb cameras via the USB port but this is
a much more compact and elegant solution
and it goes directly through the GPU so
it uses less of your precious CPU which
is pretty constrained the only problem
right now is you can't actually order
these they came out like I think about a
month ago and they've been they were
backordered the day they released it so
if you got one of the early production
runs you were really really lucky but
for the rest of us we have to wait till
they make more of them okay so that's
one port and the second one is for an
LCD panel so I did bring a toy which
I'll show you guys on a in a sec so
currently they have a nice port for an
LCD panel but they don't actually they
never actually made an LCD panel that
works with the port yet and since it's a
proprietary interface through the GPU
nobody else can do it it's not open
source unfortunately that portion but
there's a nice work around hack and I'll
show you guys this touchscreen working
with the Raspberry Pi in a sec we'll get
to that later ok so anyway that's the
two camera and LCD with touch for those
two ports and then like I mentioned you
can do lots of cool stuff with the GPIO
pins this is an example of an
accelerometer module the mpu 9150
so you can hook this up and then get
motion detection on your Raspberry Pi
just like you would from a cell phone or
other device now remember this is like
low level inputs you're not going to get
a clean API like you would with a mobile
phone but you'll get some some nice
Louisville numbers you can try to
interpolate in and figure out what's
going on and any device which supports I
squared C or a couple other interfaces
you can use via the PI forge a library
Peiffer J is an open source library it
works with the java SE embedded release
and it'll let you take advantage of the
GPIO pins eventually the they're going
to roll some of the support into the
official Java release so you can use AP
is that comes directly out of the JDK
but until that happens in a future job
release using some of these open source
libraries is your best option ok and the
other thing I'm going to show you guys
is the touchscreen so there's a little
bit of information about the touchscreen
which I'm going to be showing you guys
so it's made by chalkboard electronics
they're a little company in Israel which
does some nice custom hardware let's see
okay we've got our cable set from these
guys the workaround they did is this LCD
typically is powered over one of those
LCD cables like what the Raspberry Pi
has but since there's no interface for
that yet they rigged a little daughter
board there we go which takes the LCD
input and then converts it to hdmi or
rather takes the hdmi and converts it to
the LCD signal and the cable also
separately breaks out touch to USB so
you can do touch over USB plus take
advantage of hdmi and then effectively
use the use the touchscreen and if
you're interested take a photo of this
slide or check the slide decks later
because
I got the guys that chalkboard
electronics to give us a discount for
ten percent off i think all their
screens i checked over the weekend
because i wanted to see the status of
the new 7-inch LCD screens they've been
working on so they're almost ready with
those they had some production issues
but pretty much everything they make is
backordered but there is it's pretty
good quality and relatively inexpensive
the 10 inch version is 135 dollars for
the LCD panel plus all the connectors
and it's they've been gradually
improving the revisions this is a late
revision screen I just got from them and
they properly did the eated support so
the it tells the Raspberry Pi what
resolution to support you don't need to
do anything funky on the early versions
of the board you had to do some custom
things with your Raspberry Pi video
graphics set up to get it working and if
you did this yourself you would
definitely need to do some hacking to
get an LCD panel to hook up to the pie
so it's nice that they've packaged a
solution which is pretty much plug and
play okay so before we get started
hacking anybody have any questions about
hardware all right so what we're going
to try to do here is set up a raspberry
pi I have all the instructions on my
blog javafx on raspberry pi three easy
steps but if you go to Steve on Java com
it's fairly easy to find and it details
the instructions for this so install
Linux you guys can pretty much handle
that right okay it is basically that
easy with the Raspberry Pi distribution
on the site just think one or two days
ago they introduced a new installer
called noob there's a fancy acronym but
I think they just wanted to be called
new because it sounded cool i would i
would hold off on trying to use that
until they work out the kinks in it it's
going to be the new go forward mechanism
for flashing the Raspberry Pi but I
tried it out over the over the weekend
and I was
able to get it to work properly an image
a correct card so I have a feeling they
have to work out some bugs in it before
they actually get fine-tuned the
instructions on my blog explain how you
would image it using a standard image
eat with either win32 disk imager or DD
for command line with Linux or for
Macintosh they have a program which will
prompt you for the image file let you
install it so I'd recommend going that
route for now if you have a Raspberry Pi
rather than using the new noob tool
probably in the next few weeks they'll
work out the kinks and then it will be
much much better all right step to
download and copy job at 84 army a I
have a link on my blog for this but
literally it's as easy as downloading it
and then unzipping it on your Raspberry
Pi so most of you can probably handle
unzipping uh yeah and step three is
we're going to deploy and run some
javafx apps alright so let's see if we
can actually get this working on the
hardware we have here said so you guys
can actually see what's going on here
I've taken my Raspberry Pi which is a
nice um you know $35 inexpensive
embedded device and I'm going to be
hooking it up to a capture device this
is this is actually I was chatting with
um with Max the guys doing recording
here this is the same image capture
device they're using but it runs about
two or three hundred dollars and I'm
going to be hooking it up to a two or
three thousand dollar laptop so you guys
can see it on screen so this is not the
most efficient setup for using your
Raspberry Pi at home a better
alternative would be just to plug this
into your TV but this works well for
presentations because this way I don't
have to rely upon the venue actually
having a projector which supports the
Raspberry Pi properly yep
okay so you're wondering if there's an
IR port or RF port on the Raspberry Pi
so this is really a cup this is a common
question and the reason people want I
rrf for the Raspberry Pi is does anyone
know what the most common use of
raspberry PI's is right now yeah yeah so
most people you know by this great
embedded device and they hook it up to a
TV and use it as a they put XBMC on it
and use it as a media player and
actually the GPU on this is the one of
the best features it has a really nice
GPU it'll it'll kick the pants off your
average set-top box but anyway so if
you're using it in that way you might
want I are remote or something to
control it and the best way to do that
it doesn't come with one built in but
you can buy a USB dongle hook it up via
USB and then if as long as you get one
which has supported linux drivers you
can do I are to the Raspberry Pi same
thing with Wi-Fi it comes with built-in
ethernet but there's a bunch of known
Wi-Fi modules which work quite well with
the Raspberry Pi so you can do wireless
instead of going over cable bluetooth
etc etc pretty much anything you can
find supported linux drivers for you can
hook up via USB to add to the pie
okay so a question is for sound
recording on the pie so it has an audio
output but none audio input although you
can do sound recording you just you hook
up a USB mic so pretty much the answer
to most questions about how do i add
hardware it's either add something via
USB which if you can find drivers for
linux that's the easiest second easiest
is if it supports serial you can do USB
to serial so that's a common way to hook
up NFC readers or other devices like
that and then finally if you want to
hack a little hardware the GPIO pins are
the best way to do low level input
output from the device okay good
questions alright so I'm going to
attempt to get the pie working on my
computer I'm hooking up via ethernet as
well and the reason for that is that
hopefully we will get some a local area
connection to the pie so we can do ssh
and i'm using VNC VLC as the display for
the screen so the text here is too small
to read i mean if i started typing on
the pie you wouldn't really be able to
see what's going on but we can open up
via the ethernet an ssh term and only
get a nice big display so you can see
what's happening on the pie which I'll
do in a sec the reason I want the
display primarily is to see what IP
address the Raspberry Pi picks up for my
computer since I'm doing internet
connection sharing it should pick in 90
alright
so it tempted to start up its own
networking and realized they couldn't
and it picked up an IP of oh that's even
tiny for me 192 168 243
okay so you'll you'll typically get a
nice big fat warning saying fingerprint
authentication blah blah blah and you
can ignore that the default image ute
login password is pie and raspberry
which will get you into the device okay
and we get a nice little Linux prompt
here and then we can navigate the file
system so it's a normal I have a debian
distribution already installed in the op
directory wow that blue really doesn't
show up let's see there's an option to
turn off color on LS what would anyone
know offhand yeah yeah that might help
all right well let's do this i'll just
run java and then you can actually see
the output
a color equals empty color done okay
okay so if I did this yeah much better
thank you all right so I have jdk 18
version which I downloaded and unzipped
already onto the SD card here and it has
everything you would expect in a normal
release including javafx support so I'm
going to be showing some visual stuff on
the graph on the Raspberry Pi using the
LCD screen okay and then I just ran the
the Java so you can see the version
which is 1180 EA this is the December
release of the SE embedded which is what
you'll get currently on the website I
believe in the next few weeks we will be
doing nightly builds or weekly builds of
the same distribution so you'll get more
recent versions of the Java as the
embedded which will match up with the
desktop Java 18 releases and part of the
reason you'll want that is you notice i
have an internal build on their the
reason I pulled that one is because the
there was a bug in the touchscreen
driver support which they fixed since
December and you need the most current
build to actually get working so it
works for display but the touch input
itself doesn't work in the December
build but we got it reported actually I
was in due to to Rome Italy speaking at
code motion and one of the conference
organizers there is the guy who reported
the touch screen bug so I met him face
to face even though we'd been chatting
on jira about the the issue since I did
display locally here I was testing it
and then he was he found the issue and
in Romans we bumped into each other at
the conference
okay so let's see if we can get some
stuff working here i am gonna use
netbeans as my ide if you want to do the
same thing you can install NetBeans 73
with Java 7 which includes javafx and
you'll be able to do exactly the same
thing I'm going to be showing you we
will use incredibly large presenter
fonts let's do that's huge I think that
should be big enough it's that good in
the back okay and let's start a new
project I'm going to choose a FX ml
application because that will give us a
xml file we can configure using seen
builder which is a visual GUI building
tool for building javafx applications so
the what just got created you can ignore
my groovy hacking so it created a main
class Jax comp test an F XML file which
is our UI definition and then a
controller file the main class is pretty
much boilerplate you extend the
application class implements override
the start method all this start method
does is load the f xml file for the UI
definition it doesn't actually do
anything interesting and then you know a
public static void method is the entry
point so that is pretty much boilerplate
all the interesting stuff happens in the
xml file so this sets up an anchor pain
a button and a label this is what it
looks like an xml format but we will use
the visual builder instead seen builder
if you install seen builder 10 it will
just magically open and seen builder
when you double-click it from NetBeans
IntelliJ as of the last patch release
has really good job FX integration as
well and eclipse with EFX clips also has
built-in javafx support so
there's quite good IDE support as well
and on the left here are a bunch of
components you can add in so we can pop
an image in our scene graph on the right
our properties so let's see let's let's
grab a camera picture
alright so now we got a little camera
picture that didn't work
finder okay and then I'm going to going
to go to the jacks con folder and pop in
checks pop in the image we just
downloaded Jack source contest duh meds
alright 10 sec thought we just saved it
now we've saved it ok so now y'all a
JPEG picture of a camera and we'll go
back to seen builder and okay so pretty
easy to add images there's a bunch of UI
controls for tables and charts all sorts
of stuff you can resize the scene just
by dragging and dropping I'm going to
make it monstrous because the Raspberry
Pi default resolution is 1920 x 1080
which is huge you get low lines to align
things ok that's a massive pi camera and
you can also preview in the window here
alright so here's a question for you
guys what what should we make happen
when you click the button what should
happen to our pi camera how you're right
it is upside down alright rotate 90
degrees and what's what's your what's
your favorite color
blue green yellow pink all right pink
all right let's rotate it upside down
and make it pink for him alright so for
pink the easiest way to do that is to in
seen builder you can add effects we can
get color adjustments and then do a
little Hugh oh that's is that pink
enough for you a little more purple and
pink that will go with it okay I want a
little better centered there we go
perfectly centered and then for rotation
we're going to actually have to code
something so let's let's save this go
back into NetBeans now if we run this we
should see exactly what we saw in seen
builder just actually running with code
rather than executing an XML file okay
but the buttons not active yet so we'll
go to the third file which I didn't open
yet which is the controller file the way
controllers work is you can annotate
variables with a deaf XML and it will
inject those with the corresponding ID
you can also put methods in here again
annotate it with an F X amount and that
lets you call it from your from your
code so if we look at the XML we're
already calling handle button action
when you click the buttons that's
already in there but our image views
missing an ID let's just call him image
and see here is our color adjustment
that's a nice little effect as well but
it's pre-applied so we want to I guess
unapplied it and then reapply it okay so
that should get us our our image and
then the initialize gets called
immediately on on startup so we can do
our
grab off the effects and clear it and
then we'll save this off and then we
click will you will reapply the effects
and rotate it I'm going to use a
rotation rotate translation now you do
rotate transition builder the way
builders work is you have a create
method on them and a build a method the
create method is a static method which
gives you a builder so you can chain
methods and then when you call build at
the end it returns the object back which
is going to be an instance of a rotate
transition so in the middle here we can
we can put all sorts of properties like
what node does it apply to image what
angle are we going to rotate it so 180
degrees but I say we we spin it a couple
times before we stop so it has to be an
odd number what was your favorite odd
number seven okay and then a duration
let's just give it seven seconds
five seconds okay thank you for
participating good job okay so I think
we're almost done and anyone noticed
something I forgot to do
yes I think you guys are close like I
created the rotation but I didn't
actually do anything with it so you need
to actually start the rotation and tell
it to go so I'm just going to do the
lazy way and chain it right here plate I
think that should do it let's let's see
how we're doing
what I do
oh thank you all right good good thing I
have folks to pair program with me
because my presentation coding skills
are somewhat lacking all right so let's
let's see how we're doing so you're what
you think the color good rotation yeah
okay so that's that's cute we can do in
the desktop but that's not really why
we're here so let's see if we can get it
running on the pie now the nice thing as
I mentioned earlier fewer if you're
doing Emmy or the other stack you'd have
to recompile and do all this stuff for
the device with SC we can take exactly
the same jar file we just built and run
it on device you could also move the
code over and compiled on the pie but
we're just going to copy the jar file
right now and the way I'm going to hook
up is I'm going to do SFTP using
cyberduck you can use your favorite SFTP
program of choice to get files around
would I say 243
yeah thank you 43 all right and then
login with pie and raspberry okay so now
we got the pie file system up go to the
dist folder grab our jar file and pop it
in okay and we should see our jack sky
there
there we go ok so it's somewhere in this
directory even though I can't read that
huge list and what we're going to do is
we're going to start our java process
you can add this to your path as well
and there's a couple extra arguments you
need to add on just for the early access
these will go away in the final release
the first one is in the early access
they didn't add the JavaFX libraries to
the bootstrap class path in the final
JDK 18 release these will all be right
on the boots tab strap jet class paths
you can ignore that the other one is
they also didn't default the javafx
platform in the final release it will
default to egl FB which is the 3d
accelerated graphics pipeline but in the
preview release you need to specify this
explicitly there's like five or six
different pipelines at different
experimental spaces but this is the
fastest and the one which will be the
default and the final release and then
run our guy okay so that should run it
and we'll see the output in the VLC
window okay so we got OpenGL ES 20
embedded device detected I forgot
something important i'm going to kill it
we need a mouse otherwise we can't click
the button let's see mouse mouse mouse
aha so one of the things which you'll
notice with the pie is when you plug in
USB devices it randomly reboots I got
lucky and it didn't reboot that time so
if you plug in or take something out of
the USB port and you notice your PI
reboots that's quite normal the the USB
ports are both low power and a little
bit finicky echo so that looks good we
got our guy and then let's see if I can
mouse go
okay so that the tearing you see is from
my capture card that's not from the pie
this slight pause you saw at the
beginning was a GC pause but if we do it
again we should see it without the pause
okay so you guys can create your own
apps running on the pie pretty easily
alright so I'm going to the last thing
I'm going to show you is the touch
screen I'm going to pop up one of the
demos which I'll show you the Great Khan
version of it which I did for a
conference in in Denmark a couple weeks
ago as a signage app for the conference
while i'm setting that up you guys can
ask questions and i'll be happy to
answer questions while i'm fiddling with
resetting hard work so ask away ok so
the question is do you need to use the
soft float distribution and fortunately
the latest version of the early access
is hard float for those of you who don't
know the difference between solid and
hard float soft float relies on the cpu
to do floating point instructions which
offer desktop processors is basically
unheard of but in the mobile world is
quite common because you have a lot of
low power chips the arm six supports
hard float instruction set and by taking
advantage of it you get much better
performance especially for graphic stuff
which is why they prioritize getting
that done for the early access so the
short answer is yes you you get hard
float you actually shouldn't have to use
the hard flip build and that's the
default distribution for um Raspberry Pi
as well as using hard float
okay so i'm hooking up the LCD connector
let's see if I got this right I need
power as well the screen requires a
little bit more juice than you can get
off the Raspberry Pi
okay either net LCD screen all right
that looks pretty good now i'm going to
switch over BLC so you guys don't have
to get up and what we'll do instead is
we're going to open up a new capture
showing my FaceTime camera alright
alright and this way i move the hardware
in the right spot you can kind of see
what's going on wow that's really bad
glare okay so let's see if we can get
the pie powered first power okay and
this also gives you a chance to see the
CA where am I going this way rotate the
lights on the pie as well so that I've
the lights in the top corner the one
light is for activity 3 are for Ethernet
and another is just for power on ok so
that stuff is working good here's the
the pie screen itself it's not that
bright because it has a sensor here this
is a ambient light sensor although if we
put it near something bright it should
brighten the screen a little bit wow
these these lights are just not working
with me
alright let's see if we can ssh into the
device again
ah ok so this is this is what happens to
your demo machines sometimes it wouldn't
be a real demo unless you had a full
hard crash your computer ok set always
have a back-up plan so this is a little
physical keyboard and while we're
waiting for my computer to do its thing
we can physically hook this up and log
into the pie on the command prompt and
then kick off the demo that way this is
also a nice um lean back device to use
if you're um on your sofa and you want
to browse your media collection you can
use this keyboard from a distance to UM
to do stuff
okay start great come
okay so that's now booting up the demo
oh thank you for restarting everything
all right first presentation so this is
the this is the backup slide if the demo
didn't work this is the dev ox themed
version of it which we used outside of
the big conference rooms so you could
see what the current session was going
on in the next few sessions were
floating by on a big HDMI monitor I did
a great comp deemed version of it for
the groovy conference in Denmark which
is which is what I'm bringing up on the
display what I'm going to recommend is
after I finish this and it boots up here
is probably better just for you guys to
come up and actually look at the
physical display up here I was getting
too much reflection off the lights up
here to actually show the screen through
the camera on my computer but it is it's
in the middle of booting right now and
in conclusion you can build some
graphically rich fast performing apps on
the Raspberry Pi I showed you how to set
up everything from scratch please check
out my blog Steve on Java calm for the
detailed instructions and you can start
doing this today so the early access
release is out you can run full Java you
can even run people have been doing
small EE clusters on raspberry PI's you
can run desktop applications using
javafx technology and you can interface
with lots of hardware using the PI for J
libraries I mentioned earlier so there's
quite a lot you can do with the
Raspberry Pi for a a small $35 computer
okay so I'm going to leave this slide up
this is my contact info twitter and blog
and then if you want to see the running
application come up to the front and you
can take a look at it but thank you for
attending
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
