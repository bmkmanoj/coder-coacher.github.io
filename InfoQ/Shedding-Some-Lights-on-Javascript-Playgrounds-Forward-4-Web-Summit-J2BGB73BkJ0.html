though it's already four p.m. I really
appreciate that today I'll be talking
about JavaScript playgrounds let me ask
you this in the beginning right away who
of you knows what a JavaScript
playground is not beautiful cool they
already know what I was talking about
just very quickly let me explain to you
who I am and what I'm doing and then
basically kind of segue over why I'm
dealing with JavaScript playgrounds all
the time I'm a developer evangelist
doing open-source initiatives and kind
of evangelize for open-source
initiatives at SI p some of the cool
features that I did throughout the last
few weeks is probably github posted
tutorials so we right now pull tutorials
for for the Sapa com from github I
usually give webcasts about our
JavaScript playground a JavaScript
library open UI 5 and I also organize
the berry open-source meet up so I'm
kind of very very much involved to do
hope and source story and front-end
development obviously JavaScript and I
was the developer evangelist or advocate
i usually go to people speak about our
technology and kind of try to get them
started very quickly so that's why i'm
using javascript playgrounds all the
time because they allow me to have an
isolated code piece and get started
without thinking about ide configuration
or anything else so that's what I'm
dealing why I'm dealing with JavaScript
playgrounds now going over to this whole
topic during my research when i did that
in the beginning when i tried to figure
out what kind of play God I should go
with for my job I realized that there
are more than 10 JavaScript playgrounds
out there having very very similar
features however like small differences
when it comes to very specific things so
probably you know some of them like code
pan jsfiddle and J's bin are probably
the most known frameworks of JavaScript
playgrounds however there is much much
more and that's not even the full list I
actually identified many many different
others now I'm why well what makes a
JavaScript playground first a JavaScript
program
essentially gives you the opportunity to
edit your code preview it and share with
other people and I think the very last
bit is the most crucial aspect to it
because otherwise you could just use
your web ide or you know some kind of
other environment with some plugins
installed to actually accomplish exactly
that that thing however JavaScript play
guns allow you to share that code and
even going beyond that they allow you to
collaborate together so essentially
there's kind of a mode for people in
some of the JavaScript playgrounds
already where you can collaborate share
your code and see how other people
actually editing different pieces of the
codes and update immediately your result
and see what's happening there so that's
a really cool feature and I think that
will be probably very very much asked
for in the future but you know more
about later on so I just give you an
example what javascript play gun play
playgrounds do this one is actually a
bit that I created it's a code that's
shared on plunker plonkers one of the
JavaScript playgrounds and as you can
see I have different files over here
that you could actually browse and check
out you know in more detail however the
most important aspect here is you can
actually see that this is a life running
code of my piece that I created I can do
you know all kinds of stuff move it
around and so on so forth so that's why
I use JavaScript playgrounds because I
can actually demonstrate my applications
right away and you can do the same thing
either with customers or some other
people that you just go to maybe your
team members and so on so forth so
that's why I think JavaScript
playgrounds are actually very very
important now just very roughly maybe
that's an extensive list but why should
you actually care about JavaScript
Paragons and already mentioned in the
beginning that you that you might just
want to use it to actually quickly show
off what you want to create or what you
want to do so it's all about creating
prototypes and being very very quick
that's why those playgrounds are very
very important during inception modes so
whenever you create a new project and
you want to actually create a you know
proof-of-concept you want to get started
with something and figure out if it
actually works like you expect it to
work just go ahead jump into the code
piece and just coat it right away
and that allows you to have a very very
fast iteration cycle so you don't need
to reload you need to switch from editor
to your browser and you know hit reload
or whatever not just keep all of that
you just code and you see the result
immediately so that's why it's very
important on the other side you might
want to test certain things just in
isolation and I think one of the key
aspects why javascript playgrounds
become became more famous it's probably
because people saw them on Stack
Overflow whenever people have certain
issues I wanted to figure out something
or show a solution to a problem they
actually created small code snippets and
they shared them now in the beginning
they use JavaScript playgrounds for it
however they change now stack overflow
has has their own development for that
and that's where you can see that you
can actually test isolated use cases you
can have very specific methods test them
and sent them over very quickly to
explain what you did there and you know
how this problem could be solved there
are other cool features that you might
want to use for instance one of the one
of the JavaScript playgrounds allows you
to share your code and it looks just
beautiful there's the community they can
like it they can comment on it so
essentially if you want to brag about it
they want to show it you can just you
know do that on the JavaScript
playground and share your code so people
will see a result immediately they will
see probably how cool you solved a
certain problem and you can just share
it right away you can put it in your
blog post people can see right away the
result they can also see that the
sources of it so that's a pretty cool
feature now why you should care about
this specific talk right now is because
there are actually so many different
JavaScript playgrounds it's hard to
navigate and figure out which one you
should go with and which one might be
interesting for you now I'm very basic
the the ideas you need to figure out
what kind of different needs you might
have and that different needs actually
are shaped by many many different
aspects that you might have for instance
your audience if it's very technical you
might want to figure out you know a very
technical just cos beta code based
solution if it's a very specific
JavaScript library you might need to
figure out how to use the JavaScript
library in the playground and I have a
very specific example for this piece
because one of the libraries that I
evangelize for open UI 5 with an essay p
implements the model-view-controller
pattern
a very specific way it kind of requires
you to have files separated files one
per model 1 / few and one per controller
right so it's kind of hard to get
everything in one file and you end up
with spaghetti code if you just you know
do let's say J's bin files and that's
why came across plunker clunker actually
allows you to have separate files and
see them right away as a preview well
that's a pretty cool thing overall they
have much in common however certain use
cases that you might expect are not
covered yet and very brief you before we
go ahead play guns are not supposed to
replace your IDE they should not feature
they should not cover all the complex
scenario is that you might have for
instance if it comes to data retrieval
it's actually very very hard to achieve
in certain playgrounds you might come
you will probably come across the course
problems and you need to figure out how
to do with Jason P and so on so forth
and they're also not really supposed to
help you with testing building or
minifying so it's really focusing on
this kind of inception phase of your
project in the very beginning trying to
get something done quickly trying to
achieve this Wally effect with your
customer for instance and then go from
there and kind of you know put it into
your own whole environment and develop
in your code editor so how would you
approach if you would like to choose a
JavaScript framework a frayed JavaScript
playground now usually you would start
off with your needs you try to figure
out what you need for this specific use
case and I did that for myself as well I
created a shield list of 11 categories
and 83 criteria and I have that all on
github you can see them as well you can
check them out and you can figure out if
there's something that you might be for
yourself here's the list of all the
different categories that I created for
instance community how much adoption is
there how many people actually helping
you out if stuff is happening how can
you achieve collaboration connectivity
can you actually access your files
through an API or not and all those
different bits and pieces I was actually
looking into it when i created this this
kind of well research more or less for
my own project and i wanted to share
with you now the next thing is to figure
out what kind of playgrounds you
actually want to analyze
and I told you there are many many
different ones and I kind of boiled it
down to a list of eight relevant for
JavaScript and based off those eight I
even bother down a bit more and I
created to tears I created the first
here which is more adoption probably
more known those are the four over here
its coat pant plonker jay has been a
jsfiddle and then I have a tier 2 which
is probably of less known JavaScript
playgrounds and also some kind of a beta
or alpha Stadium out of those four
jsfiddle focuses on the KISS principle
so very very easy not too many features
rather just you know allowing you to
dump some code and share it with people
and probably collaborate on it but it
does not give you know all the features
that you might need the other ones
though are very very much feature driven
so if you want to check out the raw
analysis just in case and if you want to
contribute and help me and if you want
to add some other playgrounds you can
definitely do it I have that on get up
you can create some issues or you know
if you see something that's wrong just
let me know as you can see that's quite
a lengthy lengthy list so let me switch
over
now let me summarize what i did there
and what could find during my research
certain steps certain things that you
might want to consider if you actually
create a new project and you want to
figure out what kind of playground to go
with that's a very I would say initial
list if there's need and if you tell me
that you actually would like to see more
I can create some kind of an app that
allows you to choose and select and
filter from it however I just wanted to
figure out if there's actually need in
the beginning so if you want to actually
just let me just go through the test
very quickly if you want to figure out
what you want to choose what kind of
play don't you want to choose you can
use this initial list to figure out if
you can actually exclude certain things
or include them for instance if you need
file support and that's what I need it
for my framework you might want to use
plonker or code pen kolpin is a bit
tougher to use so clunker is kind of the
goat and go to a playground in that case
if you care about beautify codes
jsfiddle code pen or punk again if you
need some kind of a pre-processing and
that happens quite often you might want
to go with this for frameworks that I
listed over here because not all of them
support you know it extensively those
two are very important J has been in
plunker you can run them locally because
they're open source you can actually
download them put them in your own
environment they have them somewhere
maybe in your internet or something
within the company running just
specifically for your own use case
that's a really cool one codeman is the
only one that is actually optimized for
mobile I don't know if you would do it
if you would code actually a mobile but
you could do it with code panic that
actually allows you to switch between
the fuse very easily and the one cool
feature about it is you can actually
display your responsive applications and
figure out how they look on mobile as
well with this with this JS playground
what else would be important I think 11
J's library over here code test it's
kind of a unicorn because it allows you
to test responsiveness it actually
changes the width of the result screen
and it also shows you the layers so if
you have some some kind of diff layers
overlapping each other you can actually
analyze them and see them right away and
co
test so that's pretty cool thing now if
you want to have kind of a very
interesting a very very cool cycle
between importing and exporting you
might want to go with J's bin because G
has been allows you to import gist's
from github and then I will see also to
export them right away and that's the
only JavaScript playground that allows
you to do so other one other ones would
need you know kind of zip archives that
you need to download or just you know
put everything into one HTML thing and I
think one thing that is very important
that's coming up very soon I think it's
trending right now is the live
collaboration so if you want to do live
coding with people or kind of coding
podcasts or webcasts those frameworks
are very very good in that in that case
other ones do not have a collaboration
feature included and out of those four
they actually only two that are really
really useful and out of those two
there's only one and I would need to
look at the name of it that actually
records your your activities on the
screen so you can kind of share
recording right away as soon as you're
done with development you can share that
recording and kind of you know have it
for all the people on your blog or
somewhere available versioning if you
care about different versions and you
probably will if you use it extensively
you should not use code planet that's
not allow it to you know have different
versions or see insights about different
versions and changes conclusions
disclaimer this list is just based on
the research that I did and it might
change very quickly I see changes you
know all the time and throughout the
usage of those JavaScript wagons for the
last few weeks I saw how they actually
change and how to implement new features
I see where some JavaScript playgrounds
already working out working on for
instance this one javascript prague on
reworking the whole backends and they
will have many many different other
features and just probably a few weeks
or so so that's just my disclaimer
otherwise i can tell you that I think
plunker should be the field on the dog
in tier 1 out of those four probably
prominent JavaScript Paragons plunker is
the one that has lasted option and it
doesn't really have a nice documentation
that's true however I think it has all
the features and you know the most
important cool things included probably
will gain traction very soon now if you
don't care about sharing your codes just
use your ID
do not even go the way and bother about
you know using a JavaScript playgrounds
if you just want to code something and
you don't do not care about sharing just
use some web IDs like cloud nine or
sublime or something I think there's one
thing that we need to work on overall in
JavaScript playground field we need to
figure out how to import more files and
we need to kind of extend those features
the only importing features that I've
seen so far is literally just github
gist and that's it so you cannot even
import files or archives you cannot do
it right now and I think as soon as we
get there we might even come to a point
where you can actually take a piece that
you developed upload it there test test
that was very quickly to ensure that you
know there's no local kind of thing
changing your ear code or your results
and just go from there exported again
and you know continued development
locally another thing if you need to
playground for nodejs there's JS app
that's a pretty cool thing i just
realized that a few weeks ago and if you
want to test your performance just jjs
perv I think we have a few more minutes
so let me just quickly finish that in
the beginning as already mentioned
probably most people realized about j
realize that they are actually a
JavaScript playgrounds because they saw
them on stackoverflow they saw their
somebody created a code they clicked on
it and then that's how they kind of got
into this whole playground fields but
now stack overflow they created their
own solution coats and that stack
snippets and there are certain reasons
for that I give them that I'm however
the kind of you know removes the
traction from JavaScript wagons probably
a bit more on the other side I see that
there's a trend coming up for coding
webcasts and that will probably increase
the adoption especially if we have more
advanced features in terms of recording
and you know sharing all your records
probably even with voice and comments
and so on so forth the one framework
that I mentioned that's kind of
reworking or entirely reworking the
whole back end implementation is code
magic and code magic appears to be
another underdog that just appeared a
few months ago and they have many many
different features that looks super
clean very useful however
they do not allow you to share your coat
pieces yet because they don't have a
back end to kind of store all of that
and generate the URLs yet so I'm they're
kind of working on it and that's coming
up very soon now if any of the advice
any of the makers actually looking into
this I would probably advise them to
stop creating new playgrounds and rather
focus on you know extension points for
core functionalities what I see
happening is writing right now we have
more than 12 prager plugins that I'm
aware of and they have very very similar
functionalities now I don't know why you
would need 12 of them because I don't
think we have so many different use
cases for JavaScript playgrounds that's
why I would probably advise to go more
modular weight of development kind of
create create extension points for
people and besides that most of the
frameworks actually are built on top of
other open source projects for instance
AC editor or code mirror and for
collaboration it's together GS that's
basically it so if you guys have any
questions yes you do yeah you can
actually if you look into my list I
realize that as well and I was looking
into that there's a console few for some
of the JavaScript playgrounds the way
you can actually avoid using the console
view and you need even the console use
developer tools you can actually open up
the developer tools and kind of figure
out you know where you console.log
appears so that works out this fall yes
there is um they're actually they're
actually certain playgrounds a go
certain playgrounds that allow you to
have a console few so you can actually
just open it up as you know next to HTML
Javascript and results you can actually
open up a console view and this one the
ones are definitely including that is
cold pan and GS bin SF right now however
what you can do if you look into your
developer tools you can actually I'm
kind of filter out what kind of things
you see in the developer tools so if you
go in chrome you will be able to select
for instance if your own plonker you'll
be able to select run plonker that's the
domain and then tell that you actually
are only interested in the console logs
coming
from that don't specific domain so you
can kind of tear your targeted and
narrow it down that works too i can show
it to you after the presentation one of
the solution is definitely to filter out
the developer tool you know the feedback
that you get from the console you can
actually filter it out another solution
is to actually open up the embed few or
kind of the full screen view of your
application so most of the playgrounds
allow you to kind of have you know the
real few of your application and they
open up in a new tab and that's where
you can actually just look into the
specific console dog that is related to
your app very none convenient though I
give I give you that but that's another
solution yes yeah I can the example that
I showed you is actually an example with
folders this one as you can see over
here I have different folders the trick
is as you would do it with github if you
create something on the UI you just type
in the slash and plunker will realize
it's a folder so the entire full name of
this thing if I could create a new name
is j / I ATM that's a trick any other
questions okay awesome thank you very
much guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
