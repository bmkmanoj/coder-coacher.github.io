name is Kevin kempter I am the chief
data architect at consistent State we
are a postgres professional services
shop here in Denver let me just take a
quick poll how many came from out of
town wow how cool is that we were
thrilled with you with just the success
of this being our first postgres day in
Denver we intend on moving forward on an
annual basis I'm not exactly sure how
that's going to look it looks like the
typical PG East and PG West the JD runs
are going away and he's thinking about
Denver for a single annual conference so
I don't know if that means we merge or
he takes it over or maybe we do a PG day
plus a postgres conference in Denver I
think Denver is a great location because
its central and you know it's Denver so
anyway thanks for coming we're thrilled
that you guys are here and I am doing
the keynote so I didn't talk about when
technology works meaning I was going to
talk about sort of postgres in the real
world that was the official title and I
got to thinking about doing a keynote
and I think what I'm going to try to do
is is show a parallel between what
happened with Lennox and what's
happening with postgres and I think
there's a lot of relevant parallels
there not to say that the postgres and
Lennox are the only technologies that
have experienced this sort of trajectory
ful in terms of success but they're
they're pretty prime examples of open
source technologies in particular that
have become extremely successful in the
marketplace just a little brief bit
about Lennox history we won't go through
it all but you know it started with
the you know Bell Labs of course and
then mynocks came over anybody here
remember my necks you're showing your
age in any case then of course Linus
gets involved and it turns into GPL
license and so on and so forth and
brings us up to today where I think if
we were to go back say maybe to where
deckhand and the spark versions were
just coming out in the Lenox world most
big corporations had the attitude that
you're not putting Lennox in my data
center because you know it's this piece
of shareware kind of thing and there was
a really prevalent attitude of Lennox
was a toy and it's just a bunch of
hackers and you know why would you even
consider and today I think if you were
to pull data centers you'd be
hard-pressed to find a data center that
did not have Lennox in it in a big way
and Lennox has really sort of hit that
tipping point and overtake in the server
market even to the point where Lennox is
the number one platform sold for servers
today just in terms of acceptance in in
2003 Lennox server sales hit excess of
900 million and today just for q1 of
this year the Lennox server market is
his surpassed two billion which means
we're on track for four billion dollars
this year Justin Lennox serve ourselves
not to include any database license fees
or software or anything that goes with
that that's just the Lennox servers
themselves so you know getting a getting
a rack server from Dale kind of thing my
thoughts are and doing a little bit of
research I think this is pretty accurate
in terms of what drove the industry in
general to be willing to accept what was
a
originally viewed as a package version
of shareware and now these companies are
allow it to be the predominant OS piece
of open source software in their data
center I think one was affordability and
that's a big one but it's only a big one
in the context of the other factors
shareware is cheap too but you know you
wouldn't take a most pieces of shareware
that are truly fit the category of
shareware as opposed to open source
software you wouldn't really want to put
that in your data center a strong active
community was a big one the lenox
community grew up really fast and got to
the point real quick where support
official support was almost unnecessary
it was necessary from a we want to be
able to point the finger at someone if
something goes wrong but not necessarily
in in terms of being able to get support
in general availability of external
tools was a big one so it took a little
bit of time but it was fairly rapid in
terms of all the tools that go with
Lennox that the the software that we run
today and the database is being ported
to lenox and so on and so forth proven
reliability and proven performance are a
given I think without that none of the
other factors would have applied but
Lennox continued to shine in those
categories and then the availability of
commercial support so when Red Hat
showed up on the scene and started to
offer commercial support even though in
the early days it was kind of strapped
up by duct tape and baling wire it
actually gives the gave these companies
the ability to point the finger at
someone and say this is your problem i
want you to fix it and i think the the
combination of all of these factors
really led to this this explosion of
Lennox that we've seen in the
marketplace I would make the case that
we are midstream seeing that same event
take place in the postgres arena
here's a little bit of just a brief
review of postgres is history again I
won't go into a lot of it but postgres
have been around for a good 15 years in
fact postgres is the same code base
where Botha Lustra and informants came
from which is kind of interesting
because informix based their their
product on the the original postgres
code base and then years later informix
paid I think it was two billion dollars
to buy elestra which was also based on
the same code base which is a little
funny but not totally because of course
the code bases its pled and yada yada
yada however from an acceptance
perspective we don't as we don't have
you know we can't point to to sales
because sales in the way that Lennox
server sales apply don't really apply
nor are those numbers really available
from a postgres scenario however I
pulled this from indeed jobs which is
one of the job boards that pulls from
all the other job boards and this is a
chart that shows the percentage of
growth of job postings specifically
asking for postgres experience so in the
past five years we've seen a four
hundred percent plus increase in
Postgres job postings and I think that's
a that's pretty good news for you know
those of us that like to work in the
postgres arena the adoption factors I
think are largely the same the
affordability the active community the
availability of the external tools are
their reliability and performance the
commercial support and I think proven
success is a big one with postgres in
particular I think there was up until
recently like four or five years ago
there was a lot of reluctance of
companies to engage their big database
systems with an open source database
mysql was okay because it was largely
five years ago used only for websites
and
the website goes down well you know we
can deal with it but for the big core
database engines running the companies
you know primary data servers there was
a lot of reluctance there and I think
what's happened is a lot of companies
have decided to step into the waters if
you will and that's led to other
companies having a higher level of
confidence which is sort of led to this
propagation of companies and brought us
to where we're at today just quickly
I'll run through each one of these
factors and how I think they're really
in a lot of ways paralleling the the
lenox trajectory we saw on the postgres
side so affordability wise of course
it's free to download and it has a very
liberal license meaning pre bsd license
basically says don't blame us as if it
breaks and number two do whatever you
want with it so you can close source it
you can wrap it in another product you
can change it and not tell anybody yadda
yadda yadda excellent documentation an c
compliant and and I think the ANSI
compliant thing is really big especially
with postgres being the most an c
compliant database there is inclusive of
even the commercial guys and I think
that leads in a lot of cases to a
scenario where the end staff or in-house
dba's obviously there's a learning curve
if you're coming from Oracle or you're
coming from db2 or informix however the
fact that post graphs is fully ants and
compliant top to bottom it does reduce
that learning curve by a fair amount
obviously you're you know the special
Oracle extensions and the db2 extensions
and so forth that aren't entity
compliant anyway are going to be
prevalent in use in any given shop that
decides to use that technology as their
database platform however it does still
at the end of the day reduce your
learning curve and I think that learning
curve is key when it comes to
affordability I think a lot of people
talk about oh it's open so
course it's free but that's not
necessarily the end of the story and I
think with some open source components
or open source tools they haven't been
successful because that learning curve
is significant and they're like well why
don't you want it it's free and it's you
know well we have to retrain everybody
kind of thing the strong active
community that the postgres community is
huge not only you guys but the
conference's that we see around the
world every year postgres has 13 active
highly active mailing lists I did just a
quick search on the post the psql
general list and so far this year we've
seen 9800 posts and that isn't uncommon
across the other mailing lists likewise
I counted at least 16 postgres related
conferences that have happened so far
this year there's a PG day happened in
France and there was a PG day in Germany
there was an event in the UK I think
there was an Australian event and of
course PG West and PG East and PG open
and on and on and on postgres is is
gaining significant amount of popularity
availability of external tools this is a
pretty short list I could fill up
several slides with replication tools
we've got slow knee and baccardo and
there's the postgres XC project and the
postgres our project which isn't really
ready for prime time but it's promising
the parallel query tools like the stato
project that Jim's going to be talking
to us about today there are some other
parallel query tools the postgres XE in
particular gives us sort of an open
source version of green plum if you will
without the approach that we're really
just focused on dss kind of thing
there's Oracle to post grass migration
tools and there's actually sequel server
to postgres migration tools and db2
migration tools that are out there
there's GUI management tools like the
the PG admin tool there's a number of
GIS tools and reporting tools and
monitoring tools and it just goes on and
on and most of these tools are fairly
simple to operate and fairly
straightforward to implement if you've
got some level of database experience
and minimal level of postgres in
particular experience there are some
exceptions saloni is not necessarily the
easiest to implement your first time but
your second time it's it actually starts
to make sense and it's pretty
straightforward but there are a number
of tools like the pgadmin 3 is almost a
single command and you're done kind of
thing reliability postgres has proven
its reliability time and time and time
again where that really comes from is
that the core engine from day one at the
point where they took postgres 95 out of
Berkeley and started it sort of
retrofitted and and re integrated as a
single database as opposed to a
collection of various student projects
that all kind of sort of loosely talk to
each other from that point forward the
engine has been designed with the
thought that the system could lose power
at any given time and that philosophy
has driven postgres to actually have
almost a legendary reputation for
reliability I've seen scenarios where I
was even shocked that the database
actually survived if you l went into
recovery mode and just came back online
automatically part of that is due to
things like MVCC and save points and
point in time recovery and so forth but
a lot of it is simply due to the fact
that it's been designed that way from
the ground up proven performance again
postgres has really proved itself well
here postgres still doesn't have built
in parallel query but even without
parallel query I've seen postgres go
head-to-head with Oracle in multiple
scenarios and do quite well in fact
I don't have the numbers but I did some
work for a GIS shop and we were out to
lunch one day and they mentioned that
they did a significant amount of
benchmarking before they decided to
bring postgres in as as not a
replacement but just to augment what
they were doing and in every single task
postgres send their oracle RAC were neck
and neck obviously there's you know
there's a number of factors that I'm not
necessarily saying that Oracle will go
head-to-head with rack and in every case
I think in their case they were largely
a rack shot because it was cool to be a
rack shop and not necessarily because
they really needed the performance of
rack I could be wrong but I I think a
lot of scenarios we run into on the
Oracle side they're doing neither rack
or you know whatever they're running
they're running because it seemed to be
the right choice in part because it's
cool but in part because you know that's
what everybody else is doing and it you
know that's what companies are pushing
and based on the research it looks like
it'll do the job and in a lot of those
cases I would say eighty to ninety
percent of those cases postgres out of
the box will come in and go head-to-head
obviously there's cases there's the edge
cases that other twenty percent where if
you're a rack shop and you actually need
rack and rack is barely giving you the
performance you need you're probably not
going to do it with vanilla post crest
you might do it with green plum or maybe
the postgres XC project or maybe with
this dan I of getting parallel query but
again that's the edge cases I think the
data partitioning and the tuning options
and the large object support we have are
just sort of icing on the cake in terms
of proven performance the availability
of commercial support has been keen I
think for adoption in the industry and
obviously there's a number of shops
around the world as well as here in the
states that that are offering official
commercial support for for postgres
I know we do it Jim is going to be
speaking on stat I oh he he does it
there's probably a number of companies
here in the audience that support
postgres efficiently and likewise a
number of shops out there are not only
offering support but official the
traditional 24 by 7 monitoring and
support that you would expect like like
with red hat for example that sort of
style of if my server goes down in the
middle of the night I want someone on
the other end of the phone likewise
there's a growing number of I'm seeing
postgres companies that are cropping up
not necessarily in terms of postgres we
will help you support postgres companies
but companies that are offering packaged
services that include postgres behind
the scenes and I think we're seeing that
in a number of cloud offerings and we're
seeing it just in the in a number of
initiatives that need a runtime database
behind the scenes and it used to be that
the default choice was MySQL I think
what we're seeing is MySQL gets to
certain points where you have to start
to do some less than desirable options
in terms of your architecture to get
where you want to be from a performance
perspective and to boot now everybody's
terrified because Oracle owns mysql and
it ain't free anymore kind of thing and
so in terms of proven success I pulled
this straight off the postgres site with
the exception of the last couple of
bullets there but these are the general
categories of industries that have
actually submitted their names to the
postgres org site and said hey put our
name up there because we're running post
grass and if you jump up there and look
around you'll see there's a number of
companies and every one of these
categories that are officially running
post grass and would probably be willing
to share thoughts about
their experience as well NASA is a
project that we've been working on for a
while with Stanford and I know of a
couple of web filtering companies that
don't run postgres I think in terms of
what's in store for us moving forward is
we're going to see a lot more web-based
services I think everybody is all about
it's got to be on the web the interface
has to be a web page and I think that
makes a lot of sense with them those
smartphones and the iPads and who knows
what's coming next I think hand in hand
with that is the cloud offerings we're
seeing and I think in those two key
areas in particular postgres is really
gaining a foothold we've personally
worked with a number of startup
companies that that really did their
research up front and even if the Oracle
ownership of MySQL wasn't on the table
they still would have selected post
grass because it met their needs and Po
and mysql out-of-the-box wasn't going to
meet their needs because what we're
seeing I think especially with the cloud
offerings is these these web-based
companies that have web-based solutions
are now starting to see extremely large
data sets and extremely large sets of
users and it's really requiring a lot of
horsepower on the backend and I think
there's a reluctance to go down the you
know let's shard everything to the nth
degree and have 257 different instances
of MySQL kind of thing I think we're
also starting to see a increase in
primarily remote services and packaged
services where companies are almost
becoming virtual where they can pick and
choose different partnerships and
packaged up a notch or target an
audience with a set of services and say
hey basically we're a portal but that's
our company I think we're seeing some
non-traditional training methods that
are going to take off which are going to
allow companies for example
us-based companies to have reach across
Europe and and Australia and Japan and
so forth without having to fly somebody
halfway across the world and I think
we're starting to see a slight trend
where there's truly less boots on the
ground I know we see it within our shop
with pretty few exceptions every one of
our customers is out of state and I
rarely meet our customers face-to-face
more than once or twice for anywhere
from a three-month to a two-year gig in
fact there's a couple companies we've
worked with for six months to a year
before I even met him face-to-face and I
think that's going to become a pretty
standard in our industry I think in
terms of you guys here in particular
given that you guys are working with
postgres you're working for companies
that are leveraging postgres I think
that we're at that point in the sort of
Red Hat trajectory of success if you
will where our job needs to be number
one to really start to innovate and
start to push post grass into scenarios
where postgres does well and I think
that's one of the areas that we need as
companies to be very intentional about
we need to start leveraging the cloud
technologies utilizing web technologies
virtualization is is off the charts and
I think postgres is a platform that does
extremely well in virtualization
scenarios and packaged services in fact
our company is heavily weighted on the
package services side meaning we look
for where areas where we can take sort
of the usual suspects if you will
meaning certain things that we end up
doing for customers over and over and
over again and we'll just package it up
and automate it anywhere from fifty to
eighty percent and then drop the price
and it's great for both of us we get to
we get recurring revenue based on a
largely automated approach and the
customers get you know a low monthly fee
because they don't
have to get a consultant out on site to
make some of this stuff happen I think
likewise as we move forward in the
postgres arena in particular I think
partnerships are going to be key we're
starting to see that even with us here
in Denver we're having a number of key
partnership companies reach out to us
because there's a lot of shops out there
I think they're looking for solid
postgres relational database skills that
they can leverage but not necessarily
have to bring in and hire employees and
make it a permanent part of what they do
so I think again as you guys within your
companies looking for partnerships and
in particular look at the startup market
I think the startup market is a really
good area to look for places to try to
partner with companies and make sure
that the post grass environment and that
the tuning that's been done and so forth
that it's really a good fit I think one
of the biggest detriments to postgres in
particular but any database platform is
when the platform gets rolled out and
it's the wrong fit or somebody that
doesn't know how to tune it has tried to
tune it and it just falls on its face
and then that reputation in a negative
way starts to propagate across the
industry obviously expanding our own
offerings through creative partnerships
that's exactly what we're doing and I
think we need to move I think a lot of
times with with these these projectiles
style you know this has just taken off
kind of thing there comes a point in
time where as companies we need to say
hey let's ride the wave because if we
don't our competitor as well and I think
you know all of the above looking at
these partnerships and looking at ways
to innovate patch packaging some
services and I think just one of the
things that we adhere to moving forward
is if it doesn't work we drop it and we
drop it quick we we try not to get too
emotionally attached to any particular
set of
package services because if it doesn't
work frankly I don't want it around so
that's pretty much all I have I just
think there's a great parallel between
red Hatton but you're not read have a
lennox in particular and how red hat was
able to step in and offer some of the
sort of remaining missing gaps to turn
it into a real technology that's been
embraced and I think post grass is
literally on that same track and you
know I think that's great I mean you
guys are here in the conference is a
success and I think largely because
that's exactly what's happening so
thanks for coming i hope you guys have a
great time today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
