network first of all very quick note
about flurry I think many of you may
have heard of the company we're the
largest mobile analytics tracker today
we track about 120,000 mobile
applications worldwide there are
ninety-seven ninety-eight percent so
9790 percent of smartphone devices use
our analytics today worldwide the goal
the company is to use this data to
provide mobile app developers with
better measurement better acquisition
and by the magnetization of their mobile
audience just some you know stats by the
company will track about 330 million
devices 20 billion sessions a month so
that's about 15,000 sessions per second
about three times the times of the three
times the data that Twitter processes on
any given day and we're one of the
largest users of Hadoop on top of that
we have an advertising and monetization
network called app circle and what we do
is we use all the analytics which is
free to target the advertisements to
users based on what the users have done
in our network so it's really high
quality targeted traffic acquisition so
not sure what we do but what we want to
talk about today is the mobile explosion
and and what is driving it everyone
knows about it but there's there's three
big factors that the drive it I think
what we're experiencing right now is the
most significant shift in adoption of a
consumer technology that we've lived in
our lifetime and it's possible that we
may live in our lifetime until the end
so it's a it's a very fascinating what's
happening the adoption of mobile devices
and mobile applications we have the pc
revolutionary 80s the infinite boom of
the 90s and on mobile computing has
really taken off at a speed that's
unparalleled and there's three things i
want to cover about what is driving this
there's more but there's three that want
to cover one is the install base of
devices of smart devices has been
growing really rapidly the second thing
is there is a content distribution layer
that's really easy and frictionless
that's built on
that which makes content extremely easy
to create and distribute and the third
thing is that there's a monetization
capability on top of that content that's
really promising and that's enabling
anyone to really make significant
revenue on mobile applications so first
of all smart phone devices first of all
about mobile phones themselves including
smartphones and feature phones the
install base of phones is actually four
billion right now it's actually growing
a little bit further than this that's
larger than the PC and TV install base
combined so that's not really a surprise
what's interesting is looking I have in
this presentation updateable from flurry
and from other providers what's
interesting is the breakdown of the
mobile shipments globally by feature
phones or non smartphones versus
smartphones green being the smart phones
and blue being the feature phones and
it's interesting that obviously the
growth in the adoption of smartphones is
very very rapid still it's at the
beginning as you can see here we're here
2011 this dramatic room for growth in
mobile apps Mart phone shipments which
means that if you're an app developer
and you're thinking about getting into
mobile it's not too late for sure the
other interesting thing about this is
that they become a more mainstream with
lowering price points especially on
Android devices and the penetration is
really high on the US and European
markets which have higher income as well
which makes it even more compelling a
lot of people are talking about iOS
versus Android who's going to win it
it's a two horse race it's really
interesting that in may or june of this
year the the daily activations of phones
with android surpassed for the first
time the deal activations of iOS devices
so that is actually not a surprise to be
honest with you when you have so many
providers like HTC motorola samsung LG
adopting android more than Apple it
doesn't mean that necessarily people are
making an order decision it's a
sequencing decision people are
increasingly saying we're going to make
an iPhone obligation and then put it
over to Android and the question is
which one did they do first so it's a
sequence edition rather than a exclusive
one or the other we do know that iphone
at least for now monetize is better than
android devices based on analysis from
flurry will attract 120,000 apps when we
look at the same application in in an
iphone format in an android format the
android format typically monetize it
between 25 and fifty percent of the
level of the iphone application so and I
think anecdotal you may have heard this
so I think there's a little room for
growth on the Android side to be more to
provide a platform that more effectively
drivers usage and monetization as you as
you may know it may become a three-horse
race would love for that to happen I
think it's good for consumers when that
happens when they have choice big
contenders windows with Nokia amazon rim
windows with no cure the one that's most
visible and that in making most of the
of the noise windows does know how to
make a good operating system obviously
and their latest mango operating system
for mobile has a lot of promise they
also know how to build a developer
community and they have a lot of assets
with msn xbla productivity apps also the
hardware partnership with nokia remains
to be seen how effective that's going to
be but the biggest challenge that
they're facing is a placate a developer
adoption of the platform the number of
available applications is very very
limited and it's a very difficult
chicken and egg problem so they're gonna
have to really do something special if
they're going to really become a big
contender in analytics the in our
analytics that we track less than 2% of
the new application starts out with
windows right now the one that in my
opinion is the most promising of the
plan once is Amazon they have a lot of
the right assets in place already they
just need to bring it all together they
can leverage a very effective device in
kindle fire which they've upgraded with
you know full color screen deals with
game makers movies lots of great content
so they have lots of content that
they're building on they have the
commerce engine and they happen to have
the second largest credit card
aggregator that to be the second largest
category aggregator and they have the
consumer trust so I think this is a
contender that we watch it very closely
and I think in the next year may emerge
is a very very strong potential third
candidate rim is a little bit behind
there has been obviously concerns about
ram as you may have read in the
I think fundamentally you know one thing
to note is that they built their whole
system with communication in mind not
necessarily with applications in mind
and it's making it really hard for
developers to adopt it as a platform so
moving over to applications and I'm
going to be quickly just because I want
to make sure we we get to everything
it's really interesting to note that
content that my talk about 15 years to
migrate from traditional forms to the
other web online is now moving to
applications at a much higher much
faster pace within three years or less
so it took you know newspapers movies TV
and games about 10 to 15 years to move
to the web in earnest it's taken about
three years in mobile with apps like you
know the New York Times Netflix Rovio's
angry birds and think of each of the
applications really as a as well as a
platform itself so it's a like new york
times itself is a way to delivering news
inside mobile applications so i think
you know the main reason that this is
happening is that people are have
learned they know what they're doing
they're moving the content creation
really fast and there's very low
friction to entering the new mobile app
economy so who is actually creating
applications so everyone is jumping in
the fray who are the mobile application
developers today so there's over 600,000
apps in the in the iOS market as you as
you know the sources of them are very
broad so you have mobile 5% these are
the people who were creating
applications and feature phones early so
it's a very small percentage of the
early vanguard that are moving to the
smartphone mobile applications you've
got online companies the companies have
developed a lot of applications on
facebook about a quarter of the makeup
is them you have native iphone
applications of people who develop for
the first time applications and games
for the iphone you have traditional
gaming companies like EA and ubisoft you
have traditional media you have retail
and cpg so pretty much everyone is an
amazing growth in mobile app developers
the fastest adoption among app
developers as well for mom from a
platform point of view ever and the
customers are responding it's really
interesting this is part of the
in the FLIR a blog we we issued this
report later this earlier this year for
the first time in June of this year
mobile applications consumed more of a
person's time than the web on any given
day so on june it was 74 minutes per day
people were using the web 81 minutes
they were using mobile applications and
this was you know almost doubled versus
a year just prior so the question that
comes up here is is this cannibalizing
people's time or it is additive and I
think the answer is both I think that
online usage would have grown even
faster there wasn't a mobile alternative
but i think that mobile is actually
entering people's lives at moments when
they were not using any technology
before it's kind of it fits everybody
it's pretty much think of it as a snack
versus a meal and it replaces the spare
time well there is five minutes waiting
for the train to arrive or whether it's
just five minutes procrastinating it's a
perfect alternative and this is this
chart which is a little bit hard to read
illustrates that even more what we've
done here with our FLIR analytics is
look at it's called daypart comparison
each line represents one medium blue is
television green is internet and red is
mobile applications iOS and Android and
the lines represent at any given hour of
the day what percentage of the active
users of this medium are actually using
the medium so what's interesting for
example if you look at 9am this would
tell you that there's about fifteen to
twenty percent of television and
Internet users using those mediums and
about 28 5 28 to 30 percent of iOS and
Android users using those applications
what's interesting is that TV shows you
the the very big curve that we've always
used to there's the primetime that all
the shows go after it's between 7 p.m.
and 11pm really seven to ten p.m. what's
interesting about the iOS and Android
apps is that there is no such clear
primetime that throughout the day from
7am all the way till 11pm people are
very actively using their phones most of
the day over thirty percent and given
the fact that there are about 110
million people who are active iOS and
Android users per day in the United
States
today this means that for those 17 days
you have over 20 million people each
hour accessing their mobile devices
which is the equivalent of 17 American
Idols every single day being reached
through mobile devices it's an amazing
change in consumer behavior because
people just really are attached to their
phones at all times in terms of what
applications people are using the
initial downloads they will track again
through Fleur analytics by category you
see that is a very significant tail you
have the games which we'll talk more
about in this panel entertainment
utilities the list is very very long but
if you really try to aggregate them into
the applications that people spend the
most time on it really gets quite
concentrated so games account for about
forty seven percent of the time spent of
mobile users today of social networking
which includes IM is about a third and
then you get about just under ten
percent for news and entertainment i
should note that flurry is not tracking
facebook so if we were tracking facebook
i think the social networking would have
been an even larger part of this pie the
interesting thing about the audience is
that it's a highly desirable for mobile
applications it used to they used to be
almost a stigma that advertisers did not
want to reach gamers because for some
reason they weren't as likely to engage
with the brands or not as desirable that
is simply not the case with mobile
applications and mobile games we've done
a study about mobile gamers among our
base one of the things that's
interesting that the flurry does is we
actually get a lot of people to report
their age and gender inside our
analytics and we also have an
extrapolation algorithm on top of that
that estimates with a high degree of
certainty the agent gender of different
users so we are able to tell what is the
demographic makeup of game players in
mobile phones so what's interesting is
first of all on the income side mobile
gamers are about fifty percent higher
than the average household income in
terms of the education it's more than
double the likelihood of being a
university degree or higher so well
educated and also what's not shown here
is that there's a very good mix between
male and female actually is a slight
edge to women fifty-three percent women
forty-seven percent
and most of them in the 20 to 30 age
range so think of the mid 20 year old
male or female high-income well-educated
who does not want to reach this audience
as a advertiser or a brand so really
really valuable audience in terms of
monetization going to the third piece so
we talked about now you know the smart
the device of device penetration and the
content platform in terms of
magnetization basically we have in iOS
and Android a very good monetization
platform that when you look at ARPU
revenue per user per day it rivals many
of the other platforms so this study is
actually done from a do strategies and
what they calculated is the total annual
revenue related to all the offerings
that each of those providers offers in
the market today and combine the annual
revenue for any given user from all
those offerings so for example Google
includes all the Google properties gmail
gtalk Maps search AdWords Adsense and
that gives you about eighteen dollars
per user per year you got yahoo
microsoft is side we actually tracked
using clear analytics then we took a
snapshot of all the freemium so free to
play with in-app purchases games and and
we looked at what the revenue per game
per user was per per year and you show
you see that it's actually the
second-highest about fifteen dollars per
user per year compared to about 18 for
Google and the interesting thing is that
this revenue is being made by the middle
class if you will or any of a large
number of app developers that do not
need to be large companies there can be
two or three people working out of their
studio or their garage and this is the
power that it's really really impressive
how quickly and easily someone with low
barriers can create an application that
monetizes that well in terms of the
types of apps that are generating this
revenue back in January of 2011 if you
looked at the iOS top 100 grossing apps
about sixty percent of them 61 % would
be-- apps that were premium basically
you need to pay a dollar or more let's
say to actually download the application
and thirty-nine percent where freemium
so free to play
with in-app purchases well just six
months later this was completely turned
on its head right now about two-thirds
of the top 100 grossing games are
premium so free applications with in-app
purchases and just about a third is
premium applications you have to pay
upfront and that makes a lot of sense
the free applications get dramatically
faster adoption people are really
looking for the free apps but what's
really interesting is that people are
willing to pay inside the application if
the currency is right and if the if what
the currency enables you to do is a
value so there's a very big shift to the
freemium model and a big shift to the
gamification if you will not just in
games but in other other types of
applications where there's an
introduction of virtual currency that
may let you for example in Pandora turn
off the ads for a day or you know in New
York Times may give you some free
content for a certain period of time so
that's really a pervasive business model
so who pays who are the people who pay
most which are the demographics that you
guys should be developing applications
for its really interesting that as a
general rule of thumb the younger
audience you know under 24 tend to be
heavy users and the older audience you
know above 25 old is above 25 god help
us but the older audience above 25 are
the ones that are the the higher
monetize errs between men and women it's
interesting that between the big groups
of 25 to 34 which is the highest
monetizing group men are actually are
more likely to be have a higher portion
of the other spending pie than women and
if you actually look into this a little
bit more detail you'll see that men and
women are actually fairly equally likely
to be making in-app purchases it just
have men when the making of purchases
their their benchers they actually spend
significantly more kareena purchase so
men are more compulsive inside in terms
of making the the purchases whereas
women are a little bit more thoughtful
about it and in terms of mobile
campaigns so we talk a lot about in-app
purchases the other big revenue stream
is about advertising so mobile app
developers
are using advertising to make revenues
this could be in the form of application
recommendation so they get paid for
driving installs of other applications
it could be also through other forms of
advertising such as video advertising
recently there's a big growth in video
advertising flurry actually launched an
advertising offering which included
people seeing video clips about six
months ago but what's interesting about
this is that the effectiveness of
advertising campaigns that run on mobile
is significantly higher than the
effectiveness of campaigns around an
online across the entire spectrum of how
people measure the effectiveness of
marketing campaigns whether it's the
unaided awareness of a service or the
aided awareness or the actual awareness
about what the service does specific
association with messages favorability
of the brand and eventually purchase
intent so advertisers are seeing this
and an increasing number of dollars and
moving into mobile advertising the other
thing that's really interesting is just
looking at specifically the video clip
advertising offering that flurry
provides we have seen that the quality
of the customers that application
developers acquire through mobile
advertising is significantly higher than
their average users so people who come
for example with who watch a 15-second
video clip and then they install an
application there about thirty three
percent more likely to make an in-app
purchase in that application versus the
average application user which is a very
significantly better than any other paid
acquisition campaign that we've seen to
date so there's going to be a lot of
room for growth and improvement in
targeting mobile application campaigns
and the medium is very effective that's
it thank you
